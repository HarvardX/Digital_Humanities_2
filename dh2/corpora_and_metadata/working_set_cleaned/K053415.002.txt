dies  every day now brought me nearer my freedom and i was impatient till we proceeded again to sea that i might have an opportunity of getting a sum large enough to purchase it i was not long ungratified for in the beginning of the year      my master bought another sloop named the nancy the largest i had ever seen she was partly laden and was to proceed to philadelphia our captain had his choice of three and i was well pleased he chose this which was the largest for from his having a large vessel i had more room and could carry a larger quantity of goods with me accordingly when we had delivered our old vessel the prudence and completed the lading of the nancy having made near three hundred per cent by sour barrels of pork i brought from charlestown i laid in as large a cargo as i could trusting to gods providence to prosper my undertaking with these views i sailed for philadelphia on our passage when we drew near the land i was for the first time surprised at the sight of some whales having never seen any such large sea monsters before and as we sailed by the land one morning i saw a puppy whale close by the vessel it was about the length of a wherry boat and it sollowed us all the day till we got within the capes we arrived safe and in good time at philadelphia and i sold my goods there chiefly to the quakers they always appeared to be a very honest discreet sort of people and never attempted to impose on me i therefore liked them and ever after chose to deal with them in preference to any others  one sunday morning while i was here as i was going to church i chanced to pass a meeting house the doors being open and the house full of people it excited my curiosity to go in when i entered the house to my great surprise i saw a very tall woman standing in the midst of them speaking in an audible voice something which i could not understand having never seen any thing of this kind before i stood and stared about me for some time wondering at this odd scene as soon as it was over i took an opportunity to make inquiry about the place and people when i was informed they were called quakers i particularly asked what that woman i saw in the midst of them had said but none of them were pleased to satisfy me so i quitted them and soon after as i was returning i came to a church crowded with people the churchyard was full likewise and a number of people were even mounted on ladders looking in at the windows i thought this a strange sight as i had never seen churches either in england or the west indies crowded in this manner before i therefore made bold to ask some people the meaning of all this and they told me the rev mr george whitfield was preaching i had often heard of this gentleman and had wished to see and hear him but i had never before had an opportunity i now therefore resolved to gratify myself with the sight and pressed in amidst the multitude when i got into the church i saw this pious man exhorting the people with the greatest fervor and earnestness and sweating as much as i ever did while in slavery on montserrat beach i was very much struck and impressed with this i thought it strange i had never seen divines exert themselves in this manner before and was no longer at a loss to account for the thin congregations they preached to  when we had discharged our cargo here and were loaded again we left this fruitful land once more and set sail for montserrat my traffic had hitherto succeeded so well with me that i thought by selling my goods when we arrived at montserrat i should have enough to purchase my freedom but as soon as our vessel arrived there my master came on board and gave orders for us to go to st eustatia and discharge our cargo there and from thence proceed for georgia i was much disappointed at this but thinking as usual it was of no use to encounter with the decrees of sat i submitted without repining and we went to st eustatia after we had discharged our cargo there we took in a live cargo as we call a cargo of slaves here i sold my goods tolerably well but not being able to lay out all my money in this small island to as much advantage as in many other places i laid out only part and the remainder i brought away with me neat we sailed from hence for georgia and i was glad when we got there though i had not much reason to like the place from my last adventure in savannah but i longed to get back to montserrat and procure my freedom which i expected to be able to purchase when i returned as soon as we arrived here i waited on my careful doctor mr brady to whom i made the most grateful acknowledgments in my power for his former kindness and attention during my illness  while we were here an odd circumstance happened to the captain and me which disappointed us both a good deal a silversmith whom we had brought to this place some voyages before agreed with the captain to return with us to the west indies and promised at the same time to give the captain a great deal of money having pretended to take a liking to him and being as we thought very rich but while we stayed to load our vessel this man was taken ill in a house where he worked and in a weeks time became very bad the worse he grew the more he used to speak of giving the captain what he had promised him so that he expected something considerable from the death of this man who had no wife or child and he attended him day and night i used also to go with the captain at his own desire to attend him especially when we saw there was no appearance of his recovery and in order to recompense me for my trouble the captain promised me ten pounds when he should get the mans property i thought this would be of great service to me although i had nearly money enough to purchase my freedom if i should get safe this voyage to montserrat in this expectation i laid out above eight pounds of my money for a suit of superfine clothes to dance in at my freedom which i hoped was then at hand we still continued to attend this man and were with him even on the last day he lived till very late at night when we went on board after we were got to bed about one or two oclock in the morning the captain was sent for and informed the man was dead on this he came to my bed and waking me informed me of it and desired me to get up and procure a light and immediately go with him i told him i was very sleepy and wished he would take somebody else with him or else as the man was dead and could want no farther attendance to let all things remain as they were till the next morning no no said he we will have the money tonight i cannot wait till tomorrow so let us go accordingly i got up and struck a light and away we both went and saw the man as dead as we could wish the captain said he would give him a grand burial in gratitude for the promised treasure and desired that all the things belonging to the deceased might be brought forth among others there was a nest of trunks of which he had kept the keys whilst the man was ill and when they were produced we opened them with no small eagerness and expectation and as there were a great number within one another with much impatience we took them one out of the other at last when we came to the smallest and had opened it we saw it was full of papers which we supposed to be notes at the sight of which our hearts leapt for joy and that instant the captain clapping his hands cried out thank god here it is but when we took up the trunk and began to examine the supposed treasure and longlookedfor bounty alas alas how uncertain and deceitful are all human affairs what had we found while we thought we were embracing a substance we grasped an empty nothing the whole amount that was in the nest of trunks was only one dollar and a half and all that the man possessed would not pay for his cossin our sudden and exquisite joy was now succeeded by as sudden and exquisite pain and my captain and i exhibited for some time most ridiculous figures  pictures of chagrin and disappointment we went away greatly mortified and left the deceased to do as well as he could for himself as we had taken so good care of him when alive for nothing we set sail once more for montserrat and arrived there safe but much out of humor with our friend the silversmith when we had unladen the vessel and i had sold my venture finding myself master of about fortyseven pounds  i consulted my true friend the captain how i should proceed in offering my master the money for my freedom he told me to come on a certain morning when he and my master would be at breakfast together accordingly on that morning i went and met the captain there as he had appointed when i went in i made my obeisance to my master and with my money in my hand and many fears in my heart i prayed him to be as good as his offer to me when he was pleased to promise me my freedom as soon as i could purchase it this speech seemed to confound him he began to recoil and my heart that instant sunk within me what said he give you your freedom why where did you get the money have you got fortypounds sterling yes sir i answered how did you get it replied he i told him very honestly the captain then said he knew i got the money very honestly and with much industry and that i was particularly careful on which my master replied i got money much faster than he did and said he would not have made me the promise he did if he had thought i should have got money so soon come come said my worthy captain clapping my master on the back come robert which was his name i think you must let him have his freedom  you have laid your money out very well you have received good interest for it all this time and here is now the principal at last i know gustavas has earned you more than an hundred a year and he will still save you money as he will not leave you  come robert take the money my master then said he would not be worse than his promise and taking the money told me to go to the secretary at the register office and get my manumission drawn up these words of my master were like a voice from heaven to me in an instant all my trepidation was turned into unutterable bliss and i most reverently bowed myself with gratitude unable to express my feelings but by the overflowing of my eyes and a heart replete with thanks to god while my true and worthy friend the captain congratulated us both with a peculiar degree of heartfelt pleasure as soon as the first transports of my joy were over and that i had expressed my thanks to these my worthy friends in the best manner i was able i rose with a heart full of affection and reverence and left the room in order to obey my masters joyful mandate of going to the register office as i was leaving the house i called to mind the words of the psalmist in the    th psalm and like him i glorified god in my heart in whom i trusted these words had been impressed on my mind from the very day i was forced from deptsord to the present hour and i now saw them as i thought fulfilled and verified my imagination was all rapture as i flew to the register office and in this respect like the apostle peter acts xii   whose deliverance from prison was so sudden and extraordinary that he thought he was in a vision i could scarcely believe i was awake heavens who could do justice to my feelings at this moment not conquering heroes themselves in the midst of a triumph  not the tender mother who has just regained her longlost infant and presses it to her heart  not the weary hungry mariner at the sight of the desired friendly port  not the lover when he once more embraces his beloved mistress after she has been ravished from his arms  all within my breast was tumult wildness and delirium my feet scarcely touched the ground for they were winged with joy and like elijah as he rose to heaven they were with lightning sped as i went on every one i met i told of my happiness and blazed about the virtue of my amiable master and captain  when i got to the office and acquainted the register with my errand he congratulated me on the occasion and told me he would draw up my manumission for half price which was a guinea i thanked him for his kindness and having received it and paid him i hastened to my master to get him to sign it that i might be fully released accordingly he signed the manumission that day so that before night i who had been a slave in the morning trembling at the will of another was become my own master and completely free i thought this was the happiest day i had ever experienced and my joy was still heightened by the blessings and prayers of many of the sable race particularly the aged to whom my heart had ever been attached with reverence  as the form of my manumission has something peculiar in it and expresses the absolute power and dominion one man claims over his fellow i shall beg leave to present it before my readers at full length  montserrat  to all men unto whom these presents shall come i robert king of the parish of st anthony in the said island merchant send greeting know ye that i the aforesaid robert king for and in consideration of the sum of seventy

sixty six  robert king signed sealed and delivered in the presence of terry legay montserrat registered the within manumission at full length this eleventh day of july      in liber d terry legay register  in short the fair as well as black people immediately styled me by a new appellation  the most desirable in the world which was freeman and at the dances i gave my georgia superfine blue clothes made no indifferent appearance as i thought some of the sable females who formerly stood aloof now began to relax and appear less coy but my heart was still fixed on london where i hoped to be ere long so that my worthy captain and his owner my late master finding that the bent of my mind was toward london said to me we hope you will not leave us but that you will still be with the vessels here gratitude bowed me down and none but the generous mind can judge of my feelings struggling between inclination and duty however notwithstanding my wish to be in london i obediently answered my benefactors that i would go in the vessel and not leave them and from that day i was entered on board as an ablebodied sailor at thirtysix shillings per month besides what perquisites i could make my intention was to make a voyage or two entirely to please these my honored patrons but i determined that the year following if it pleased god i would see old england once more and surprise my old master capt pascal who was hourly in my mind for i still loved him notwithstanding his usage of me and i pleased myself with thinking of what he would say when he saw what the lord had done for me in so short a time instead of being as he might perhaps suppose under the cruel yoke of some planter with these kind of reveries i used often to entertain myself and shorten the time till my return and now being as in my original free african state i embarked on board the nancy after having got all things ready for our voyage in this state of serenity we sailed for st eustatia and having smooth seas and calm weather we soon arrived there after taking our cargo on board we proceeded to savannah in georgia in august      while we were there as usual i used to go for the cargo up the rivers in boats and on this business have been frequently beset by alligators which were very numerous on that coast and shot many of them when they have been near getting into our boats which we have with great difficulty sometimes prevented and have been very much frightened at them i have seen a young one sold in georgia alive for six pence  during our stay at this place one evening a slave belonging to mr read a merchant of savannah came near our vessel and began to use me very ill i entreated him with all the patience i was master of to desist as i knew there was little or no law for a free negro here but the fellow instead of taking my advice persevered in his insults and even struck me at this i lost all temper and fell on him and beat him soundly the next morning his master came to our vessel as we lay alongside the wharf and desired me to come ashore that he might have me flogged all round the town for beating his negro slave i told him he had insulted me and had given the provocation by first striking me i had told my captain also the whole affair that morning and wished him to have gone along with me to mr read to prevent bad consequences but he said that it did not signify and if mr read said any thing he would make matters up and desired me to go to work which i accordingly did the captain being on board when mr read came and applied to him to deliver me up he said he knew nothing of the matter i was a free man i was astonished and frightened at this and thought i had better keep where i was than go ashore and be flogged round the town without judge or jury i therefore refused to stir and mr read went away swearing he would bring all the constables in the town for he would have me out of the vessel when he was gone i thought his threat might prove too true to my sorrow and i was consirmed in this belief as well by the many instances i had seen of the treatment of free negroes as from a fact that had happened within my own knowledge here a short time before  there was a free black man a carpenter that i knew who for asking a gentleman that he worked for for the money he had earned was put into gaol and afterward this oppressed man was sent from georgia with false accusations of an intention to set the gentlemans house on fire and run away with his slaves i was therefore much embarrassed and very apprehensive of a flogging at least i dreaded of all things the thoughts of being striped as i never in my life had the marks of any violence of that kind at that instant a rage seized my soul and for a little i determined to resist the first man that should offer to lay violent hands on me or basely use me without a trial for i would sooner die like a free man than suffer myself to be scourged by the hands of ruffians and my blood drawn like a slave the captain and others more cautious advised me to make haste and conceal myself for they said mr read was a very spiteful man and he would soon come on board with constables and take me at first i refused this counsel being determined to stand my ground but at length by the prevailing entreaties of the captain and mr dixon with whom he lodged i went to mr dixons house which was a little out of town at a place called yeamachra i was but just gone when mr read with the constables came for me and searched the vessel but not finding me there he swore he would have me dead or alive i was secreted about five days however the good character which my captain always gave me as well as some other gentlemen who also knew me procured me some friends at last some of them told my captain that he did not use me well in suffering me thus to be imposed upon and said they would see me redressed and get me on board some other vessel my captain on this immediately went to mr read and told him that ever since i eloped from the vessel his work had been neglected and he could not go on with her loading himself and mate not being well and as i had managed things on board for them my absence must retard his voyage and consequently hurt the owner he therefore begged of him to forgive me as he said he never heard any complaint of me before during the several years i had been with him after repeated entreaties mr read said i might go to hell and that he would not meddle with me on which my captain came immediately to me at his lodging and telling me how pleasantly matters had gone on desired me to go on board  some of my other friends then asked him if he had got the constables warrant from them the captain said no on this i was desired by them to stay in the house and they said they would get me on board of some other vessel before the evening when the captain heard this he became almost distracted he went immediately for the warrant and after using every exertion in his power he at last got it from my hunters but i had all the expenses to pay  after i had thanked all my friends for their kindness i went on board again to my work of which i had always plenty we were in haste to complete our lading and were to carry twenty head of cattle with us to the west indies where they are a very profitable article in order to encourage me in working and to make up for the time i had lost my captain promised me the privilege of carrying two bullocks of my own with me and this made me work with redoubled ardour as soon as i had got the vessel loaded in doing which i was obliged to perform the duty of the mate as well as my own work and that the bullocks were near coming on board i asked the captain leave to bring my two according to his promise but to my great surprise he told me there was no room for them i then asked him to permit me to take one but he said he could not i was a good deal mortified at this usage and told him i had no notion that he intended thus to impose on me nor could i think well of any man that was so much worse than his word on this we had some disagreement and i gave him to understand that i intended to leave the vessel at this he appeared to be very much dejected and our mate who had been very sickly and whose duty had long devolved upon me advised him to persuade me to stay in consequence of which he spoke very kindly to me making many fair promises telling me that as the mate was so sickly he could not do without me and that as the safety of the vessel and cargo depended greatly upon me he therefore hoped that i would not be offended at what had passed between us and swore he would make up all matters when we arrived in the west indies so i consented to slave on as before soon after this as the bullocks were coming on board one of them ran at the captain and butted him so furiously in the breast that he never recovered of the blow in order to make me some amends for his treatment about the bullocks the captain now pressed me very much to take some turkeys and other fowls with me and gave me liberty to take as many as i could  room for but i told him he knewvery well i had never carried any turkeys before as i always thought they were such tender birds that they were not fit to cross the seas however he continued to press me to buy them for once and what seemed very surprising to me the more i was against it the more he urged my taking them insomuch that he ensured me from all losses that might happen by them and i was prevailed on to take them but i thought this very strange as he had never acted so with me before this and not being able to dispose of my papermoney in any other way induced me at length to take four dozen the turkeys however i was so dissatisfied about that i determined to make no more voyages to this quarter nor with this captain and was very apprehensive that my free voyage would be the worst i had ever made  we set sail for montserrat the captain and mate had been both complaining of sickness when we sailed and as we proceeded on our voyage they grew worse this was about november and we had not been long at sea before we began to meet with strong northerly gales and rough seas and in about seven or eight days all the bullocks were near being drowned and four or five of them died our vessel which had not been tight at first was much less so now and though we were but nine in the whole including five sailors and myself yet we were obliged to attend to the pumps every half or three quarters of an hour the captain and mate came on deck as often as they were able which was now but seldom for they declined so fast that they were not well enough to make observations above four or five times the whole voyage the whole care of the vessel rested therefore upon me and i was obliged to direct her by mere dint of reason not being able to work a traverse the captain was now very sorry he had not taught me navigation and protested if ever he should get well again he would not fail to do so but in about seventeen days his illness increased so much that he was obliged to keep his bed continuing sensible however till the last constantly having the owners interest at heart for this just and benevolent man ever appeared much concerned about the welfare of what he was entrusted with when this dear friend found the symptoms of death approaching he called me by my name and when i came to him he asked with almost his last breath if he had ever done me any harm god forbid i should think so i replied i should then be the most ungrateful of wretches to the best of benefactors while i was thus expressing my affection and sorrow by his bedside he expired without saying another word and the day following we committed his body to the deep every man on board loved him and regretted his death but i was exceedingly affected at it and found that i did not know till he was gone the strength of my regard for him indeed i had every reason in the world to be attached to him for besides that he was in general mild affable generous faithful benevolent and just he was to me a friend and father and had it pleased providence that he had died but five months before i verily believe i should not have obtained my freedom when i did and it is no improbable that i might not have been able to get it at any rate afterward  the captain being dead the mate came on the deck and made such observations as he was able but to no purpose in the course of a few days more the few bullocks that remained were found dead but the turkies i had though on the deck and exposed to so much wet and bad weather did well and i afterward gained near three hundred per cent on the sale of them so that in the event it proved a happy circumstance for me that i had not bought the bullocks i intended for they must have perished with the rest and i could not help looking on this otherwise trifling circumstance as a particular providence of god and was thankful accordingly the care of the vessel took up all my time and engaged my attention entirely as we were now out of the variable winds i thought i should not be much puzzled to hit upon the islands i was persuaded i steered right for antigua which i wished to reach as the nearest to us and in the course of nine or ten days we made this island to our great joy and the day after we came safe to montserrat  many were surprised when they heard of my conducting the sloop into the port and i now obtained a new appelation and was called captain this elated me not a little and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus styled by as high a title as any freeman in this place possessed when the death of the captain became known he was much regretted by all who knew him for he was a man universally respected at the same time the sable captain lost no fame for the success i had met with increased the affection of my friends in no small measure  chap viii the author to oblige

the death of my captain lost my great benefactor and friend i had little inducement to remain longer in the west indies except my gratitude to mr king which i thought i had pretty well discharged in bringing back his vessel safe and delivering his cargo to his satisfaction i began to think of leaving this part of the world of which i had been long tired and returning to england where my heart had always been but mr king still pressed me very much to stay with his vessel and he had done so much for me that i found myself unable to refuse his requests and consented to go another voyage to georgia as the mate from his ill state of health was quite useless in the vessel accordingly a new captain was appointed whose name was william phillips an old acquaintance of mine and having refitted our vessel and taken several slaves on board we set sail for st eustatia where we stayed but a few days and on the  0th of january      we steered for georgia our new captain boasted strangely of his skill in navigating and conducting a vessel and in consequence of this he steered a new course several points more to the westward than we ever did before this appeared to me very extraordinary  on the fourth of february which was soon after we had got into our new course i dreamt the ship was wrecked amidst the surfs and rocks and that i was the means of saving every one on board and on the night following i dreamed the very same dream these dreams however made no impression on my mind and the next evening it being my watch below i was pumping the vessel a little after eight oclock just before i went off the deck as is the custom and being weary with the duty of the day and tired at the pump for we made a good deal of water i began to express my impatience and uttered with an oath damn the vessels bottom out but my conscience instantly smote me for the expression when i left the deck i went to bed and had scarcely fallen asleep when i dreamed the same dream again about the ship as i had dreamt the two preceding nights at twelve oclock the watch was changed and as i had always the charge of the captains watch i then went upon deck at half after one in the morning the man at the helm saw something under the leebeam that the sea washed against and he immediately called to me that there was a grampus and desired me to look at it accordingly i stood up and observed it for some time but when i saw the sea wash up against it again and again i said it was not a fish but a rock being soon certain of this i went down to the captain and with some confusion told him the danger we were in and desired him to come upon deck immediately he said it was very well and i went up again as soon as i was upon deck the wind which had been pretty high having abated a little the vessel began to be carried sideways toward the rock by means of the current still the captain did not appear i therefore went to him again and told him the vessel was then near a large rock and desired he would come up with all speed he said he would and i returned to the deck when i was upon  again i saw we were  above a  shot from the rock  noise of the breakers all around us i was exceedingly alarmed at this and the captain having not yet come on the deck i lost all patience and growing quite enraged i ran down to him again and asked him why he did not come up and what he could mean by all this the breakers said i are round us and the vessel is almost on the rock with that he came on the deck with me and we tried to put the vessel about and get her out of the current but all to no purpose the wind being very small we then called all hands up immediately and after a little we got up one end of a cable and fastened it to the anchor by this time the surf was foamed round us and made a dreadful noise on the breakers and the very moment we let the anchor go the vessel struck against the rocks one swell now succeeded another as it were one wave calling on its fellow the roaring of the billows increased and with one single heave of the swells the sloop was pierced and transfixed among the rocks in a moment a scene of horror presented itself to my mind such as i never had conceived or experienced before all my sins stared me in the face and especially i thought that god had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head for cursing the vessel on which my life depended my spirits at this forsook me and i expected every moment to go to the bottom i determined if i should still be saved that i would never swear again and in the midst of my distress while the dreadful surfs were dashing with unremitting fury among the rocks i remembered the lord though fearful that i was undeserving of forgiveness and i thought that as he had often delivered he might yet deliver and calling to mind the many mercies he had shown me in times past they gave me some small hope that he might still help me i then began to think how we might be faved and i believe no mind was ever like mine so replete with inventions and confused with schemes though how to escape death i knew not the captain immediately ordered the hatches to be nailed down on the slaves in the hold where there were above twenty all of whom must unavoidably have perished if he had been obeyed when he desired the man to nail down the hatches i thought that my sin was the cause of this and that god would charge me with these peoples blood this thought rushed upon my mind that instant with such violence that it quite overpowered me and i fainted i recovered just as the people were about to nail down the hatches perceiving which i desired them to stop the captain then said it must be done i asked him why he said that every one would endeavor to get into the boat which was but small and thereby we should be drowned for it would not have carried above ten at the most i could no longer restrain my emotion and i told him he deserved drowning for not knowing how to navigate the vessel and i believe the people would have tossed him overboard if i had given them the least hint of it however the hatches were not nailed down and as none of us could leave the vessel then on account of the darkness and as we knew not where to go and were convinced besides that the boat could not survive the surfs we all said we would remain on the dry part of the vessel and trust to god till daylight appeared when we should know better what to do  i then advised to get the boat prepared against morning and some of us began to set about it but others abandoned all care of the ship and themselves and fell to drinking our boat had a piece out of her bottom near two feet long and we had no materials to mend her however necessity being the mother of invention i took some pump leather and nailed it  the broken part and plastered it ov with tallowgrease and thus prepared with the utmost anxiety of min we watched for daylight and thoug every minute an hour till it appeare at last it saluted our longing eyes and kind providence accompanied its approach with what was no small comfort to us for the dreadful swells began to subside and the next thing that we discovered to raise our drooping spirits was a small key or desolate island about five or six miles off but a barrier soon presented itself for there was not water enough for our boat to go over the reefs and this threw us again into a sad consternation but there was no alternative we were therefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once and what was still worse all of us were frequently under the necessity of getting out to drag and lift it over the reefs this cost us much labor and fatigue and what was yet more distressing we could not avoid having our legs cut and torn very much with the rocks there were only four people that would work with me at the oars and they consisted of three black men and a dutch creole sailor and though we went with the boat five times that day we had no others to assist us but had we not worked in this manner i really believe the people could not have been saved for not one of the white men did any thing to preserve their lives indeed they soon got so drunk that they were not able but lay about the deck like swine so that we were at last obliged to lift them into the boat and carry them on shore by force this want of assistance made our labor intolerably severe insomuch that by going on shore so often that day the skin was partly stripped off my hands  however we continued all the day to toil and strain our exertions till we had brought all on board safe to the shore so that out of thirtytwo people we lost not one  my dream now returned upon my mind with all its force it was fulfilled in every part for our danger was the same i had dreamt of and i could not help looking on myself as the principal instrument in effecting our deliverance for owing to some of our people getting drunk the rest of us were obliged to double our exertions and it was fortunate we did for in a very little time longer the patch of leather on the boat would have been worn out and she would have been no longer fit for service situated as we were who could think that men should be so careless of the danger they were in for if the wind had but raised the swell as it was when the vessel struck we must have bid a final farewell to all hopes of deliverance and though i warned the people who were drinking and entreated them to embrace the moment of deliverance nevertheless they persisted as if not possessed of the least spark of reason i could not help thinking that if any of these people had been lost god would charge me with their lives which perhaps was one cause of my laboring so hard for their preservation and indeed every one of them afterward seemed so sensible of the service i had rendered them that while we were on the key i was a kind of chieftian amongst them i brought some limes oranges and lemons ashore and finding it to be a good soil where we were i planted several of them as a token to any one that might be cast away hereafter this key as we afterward found was one of the bahama islands which consist of a cluster of large islands with smaller ones or keys as they are called interspersed among them it was about a mile in circumference with a white sandy beach running in a regular order along it on that part of it where we first attempted to land there stood some very large birds called slamingoes these from the reflection of the sun appeared to us at a little distance as large as men and when they walked backwards and forwards we could not conceive what they were our captain swore they were cannibals this created a great panic among us and we held a consultation how to act the captain wanted to go to a key that was within sight but a great way off but i was against it as in so doing we should not be able to save all the people and therefore said i let us go on shore here and perhaps these cannibals may take to the water accordingly we steered toward them and when we approached them to our very great joy and no less wonder they walked off one after the other very deliberately and at last they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears about the key there were turtles and several sorts of fish in such abundance that we caught them without bait which was a great relief to us after the salt provisions on board there was also a large rock on the beach about ten feet high which was in the form of a punchbowl at the top this we could not help thinking providence had ordained to supply us with rainwater and it was something singula that if we did not take the water when it rained in some little time after i would turn as salt as seawater  our first care after refreshmen was to make ourselves tents to lodge in which we did as well as we could with some sails we had brought from the ship we then began to think how we might get from this place which was quite uninhabited and we determined to repair our boat which was very much shattered and to put to sea in quest of a ship or some inhabited island it took us up however eleven days before we could get the boat ready for sea in the manner we wanted it with a sail and other necessaries when we had got all things prepared the captain wanted me to stay on shore while he went to sea in quest of a vessel to take all the people off the key but this i refused and the captain and myself with five more set off in the boat toward new providence we had no more than two musket load of gunpowder with us if any thing should happen and our stock of provisions consisted of three gallons of rum four of water some salt beef some biscuit and in this manner we proceeded to sea  on the second day of our voyage we came to an island called abbico the largest of the bahama islands we were much in want of water for by this time our water was expended and we were exceedingly fatigued in pulling two days in the heat of the sun and it being late in the evening we hauled the boat ashore to try for water and remain during the night when we came ashore we searched for water but could find none when it was dark we made a fire around us for fear of the wild beasts as the place was an entire thick wood and we took it by turns to watch in this situation we found very little rest and waited with impatience for the morning as soon as the light appeared we set off again with our boat in hopes of finding assistance during the day we were now much dejected and weakened by pulling the boat for our sail was of no use and we were almost famished for want of fresh water to drink we had nothing left to eat but salt beef and that we could not use without water in this situation we toiled all day in sight of the island which was very long in the evening seeing no relief we made shore again and fastened our boat we then went to look for fresh water being quite faint for the want of it and we dug and searched about for some all the remainder of the evening but could not find one drop so that our dejection at this period became excessive and our terror so great that we expected nothing but death to deliver us we could not touch our beef which was salt as brine without fresh water and we were in the greatest terror from the apprehension of wild beasts when unwelcome night came we acted as on the night before and the next morning we set off again from the island in hopes of seeing some vessel in this manner we toiled as well as we were able till four oclock during which we passed several keys but could not meet with a ship and still famishing with thirst went ashore on one of those keys again in hopes of finding some water here we found some leaves with a few drops of water in them which we lapped with much eagerness we then dug in several places but without success as we were digging holes in search of water there came forth some very thick and black stuff but none of us could touch it except the poor dutch crecreole who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if had been wine we tried to catch fish but could not and we now began to repine at our fate and abandon ourselves to despair when in the midst of our murmuring the captain all at once cried out a sail a sail a sail this gladdening sound was like a reprieve to a convict and we all instantly turned to look at it but in a little time some of us began to be afraid it was not a sail however at a venture we embarked and steered after it and in half an hour to our unspeakable joy we plainly saw that it was a vessel at this our drooping spirits revived and we made toward her with all the speed imaginable when we came near to her we found she was a little sloop about the size of a gravesend  and quite full or people a circumstance which we could not make out the meaning of our captain who was a welchman swore that they were pirates and would kill us i said be that as it might we must board her if we were to die by it and if they should not receive us kindly we must oppose them as well as we could for there was no alternative between their perishing and ours this counsel was immediately taken and i really believe that the captain myself and the dutchman would then have faced twenty men we had two cutlasses and a musket that i brought in the boat and in this situation we rowed alongside and immediately boarded her i believe there were about forty hands on board but how great was our surprise as soon as we got on board to find that the major part of them were in the same predicament as ourselves  they belonged to a whaling schooner that was wrecked two days before us about nine miles to the north of our vessel when she was wrecked some of them had taken to their boats and had left some of their people and property on a key in the same manner as we had done and were going like us to new providence in quest of a ship when they met with this little sloop called a wrecker their employment in those seas being to look after wrecks they were then going to take the remainder of the people belonging to the schooner for which the wrecker was to have all things belonging to the vessel and likewise their peoples help to get what they could out of her and were then to carry the crew to new providence  we told the people of the wrecker the condition of our vessel and we made the same agreement with them as the schooners people and on their complying we begged of them to go to our key directly because our people were in want of water they agreed therefore to go along with us first and in two days we arrived at the key to the inexpressible joy of the people that we had left behind as they had been reduced to great extremities for want of water in our absence luckily for us the wrecker had now more people on board than she could carry or victual for any moderate length of time they therefore hired the schooners people to work on the wreck and we left them our boat and embarked for new providence  nothing could have been more fortunate than our meeting with this wrecker for new providence was at such a distance that we never could have reached it in our boat the island of abbico was much longer than we expected and it was not till after sailing for three or four days that we got safe to the farther end of it toward new providence when we arrived there we watered and got a good many lobsters and other shellfish which proved a great relief to us as our provisions and water were almost exhausted we then proceeded on our voyage but the day after we left the island late in the evening and whilst we were yet amongst the bahama keys we were overtaken by a violent gale of wind so that we were obliged to cut away the mast the vessel was very near foundering for she parted from her anchors and struck several times on the shoals here we expected every minute that she would have gone to pieces and each moment to be our last so much so that my old captain and sickly useless mate and several others fainted and death stared us in the face on every side all the swearers on board now began to call on the god of heaven to assist them and sure enough beyond our comprehension he did assist us and in a miraculous manner delivered us in the very height of our extremity the wind lulled for a few minutes and although the swell was high beyond expression two men who were expert swimmers attempted to go to the buoy of the anchor which we still saw on the water at some distance in a little punt that belonged to the wrecker which was not large enough to carry more than two she filled at different times in their endeavors to get into her alongside of our vessel and they saw nothing but death before them as well as we but they said they might as well die that way as any other a coil of very small rope with a little buoy was put in along with them and at last with great hazard they got the punt clear from the vessel and these two intrepid water heroes paddled away for life toward the buoy of the anchor our eyes were fixed on them all the time expecting every minute to be their last and the prayers of all those that remained in their senses were offered up to god on their behalf for a speedy deliverance and for our own which depended on them and he heard and answered us these two men at last reached the buoy and having fastened the punt to it they tied one end of their rope to the small buoy that they had in the punt and sent it adrift toward the vessel we on board observing this threw out boathooks and leads fastened to lines in order to catch the buoy at last we caught it and fastened a hawser to the end of the small rope we then gave them a sign to pull and they pulled the hawser to them and fastened it to the buoy which being done we hauled for our lives and through the mercy of god we got again from the shoals into deep water and the punt got safe to the vessel it is impossible for any to conceive our heartfelt joy at this second deliverance from ruin but those who have suffered the same hardships those whose strength and senses were gone came to themselves and were now as elated as they were before depressed two days after this the wind ceased and the water became smooth the punt then went on shore and we cut down some trees and having found our mast and mended it we brought it on board and fixed it up as soon as we had done this we got up the anchor and away we went once more for new providence which in three days more we reached safe after having been above three weeks in a situation in which we did not expect to escape with life the inhabitants here were very kind to us and when they learned our situation showed us a great deal of hospitality and friendship soon after this every one of my old fellow sufferers that were free parted from us and shaped their course where their inclination led them one merchant who had a large sloop seeing our condition and knowing we wanted to go to georgia told four of us that his vessel was going there and if we would work on board and load her he would give us our passage free as we could not get any wages whatever and sound it very hard to get off the place we were obliged to consent to his proposal and we went on board and helped to load the sloop though we had only our victuals allowed us when she was entirely loaded he told us she was going to jamaica first where we must go if we went in her this however i refused but my fellow sufferers not having any money to help themselves with necessity obliged them to accept of the offer and to steer that course though they did not like it  we stayed in new providence about seventeen or eighteen days during which time i met with many friends who gave me encouragement to stay there with them but i declined it though had not my heart been fixed on england i should have stayed as i liked the place extremely and there were some free black people here who were very happy and we passed our time pleasantly together with the melodious sound of the catguts under the lime and lemon trees at length captain phillips hired a sloop to carry him and some of the slaves that he could not sell to georgia and i agreed to go with him in this vessel meaning now to take my farewell of that place when the vessel was ready we all embarked and i took my leave of new providence not without regret we sailed about four oclock the morning with a fair wind for georgia and about eleven oclock the same morning a sudden and short gale sprung up and blew away most of our fails and as we were still among the keys in a very few minutes it dashed the sloop against the rocks luckily for us the water was deep and the sea was not so angry but that after having for some time labored hard and being many in number we were saved through gods mercy and by using our greatest exertions we got the vessel off the next day we returned to providence where we soon got her again refitted some of the people swore that we had spells set upon us by somebody in montserrat and others that we had witches and wizzards amongst the poor helpless slaves and that we never should arrive safe at georgia but these things did not deter me i said let us again face the winds and seas and swear not but trust to god and he will deliver us we therefore once more set sail and with hard labor in seven days time arrived safe at georgia  after our arrival we went up to the town of savannah and the same evening i went to a friends house to lodge whose name was mosa a black man we were very happy at meeting each other and after supper we had a light till it was between nine and ten oclock at night about that time the watch or patrol came by and discerning a light in the house they knocked at the door we opened it and they came in and sat down and drank some punch with us they also begged some limes of me as they understood i had some which i readily gave them a little after this they told me i must go to the watchhouse with them this surprised me a good deal after our kindness to them and i asked them why so they said that all negroes who had a light in their houses after nine oclock were to be taken into custody and either pay some dollars or be flogged some of those people knew that i was a free man but as the man of the house was not free and had his master to protect him they did not take the same liberty with him they did with me i told them that i was a free man and just arrived from providence that we were not making any noise and that i was not a stranger in that place but was very well known there besides said i what will you do with me  that you shall see replied they but you must go to the watchhouse with us now whether they meant to get money from me or not i was at a loss to know but i thought immediately of the oranges and limes at santa cruz and seeing that nothing would pacify them i went with them to the watchhouse where i remained during the night early the next morning these imposing ruffians flogged a negroman and woman that they had in the watchhouse and then they told me that i must be flogged too i asked why and if there was no law for free men and told them if there was i would have it put in force against them but this only exasperated them the more and instantly swore they would serve me as doctor perkins had done and were going to lay violent hands on me when one of them more humane than the rest said that as i was a free man they could not justify stripping me by law i then immediately sent for doctor brady who was known to be an honest and worthy man and on his coming to my assistance they let me go  this was not the only disagreeable incident i met with while i was in this place for one day while i was a little way out of the town of savannah i was beset by two white men who meant to play their usual tricks with me in the way of kidnapping as soon as these men accosted me one of them said to the other this is the very fellow we are looking for that you lost and the other swore immediately that i was the identical person on this they made up to me and were about to handle me but i told them to be still and keep off for i had seen those kind of tricks played upon other free blacks and they must not think to serve me so at this they paused a little and one said to the other  it will not do and the other answered that i talked two good english i replied i believed i did and i had also with me a revengeful stick equal to the occasion and my mind was likewise good happily however it was not used and after we had talked together a little in this manner the rogues left me  i stayed in savannah some time anxiously trying to get to montserrat once more to see mr king my old master and then to take a final farewell of the american quarter of the globe at last i met with a sloop called the speedwell captain john bunton which belonged to grenada and was bound to martinico a french island with a cargo of rice and i shipped myself on board of her  before i left georgia a black woman who had a child lying dead being very tenacious of the church burial service and not able to get any white person to perform it applied to me for that purpose i told her i was no parson and besides that the service over the dead did not affect the soul this however did not satisfy her she still urged me very hard i therefore complied with her earnest entreaties and at last consented to act the parson for the sirst time in my life as she was much respected there was a great company both of white and black people at the grave i then accordingly assumed my new vocation and performed the funeral ceremony to the satisfaction of all present after which i bade adieu to georgia and sailed sor martinico  chap ix the author arrives at martinico  meets with new difficulties  gets to montserrat where he takes leave of his old master and sails for england  meets capt pascal  learns the french horn  hires himself with doctor irving where be learns to freshen sea water  leaves the doctor and goes a voyage to turkey and portugal and afterward goes a voyage to grenada and another to jamaica  returns to the doctor and they embark together on a voyage to the north pole with the hon capt phipps  some account of that voyage and the dangers the author was in  he returns to england  i thus took a final leave of georgia for the treatment i had received in it disgusted me very much against the place and when i left it and sailed for martinico i determined never more to revisit it my new captain conducted his vessel safer than my former one and after an agreeable voyage we got safe to our intended port while i was on this island i went about a good deal and found it very pleasant in particular i admired the town of st pierre which is the principal one in the island and built more like an european town than any i had seen in the west indies in general also slaves were better treated had more holidays and looked better than those in the english islands after we had done our business here i wanted my discharge which was necessary for it was then the month of may and i wished much to be at montserrat to bid farewell to mr king and all my other friends there in time to sail for old england in the july fleet but alas i had put a great stumbling block in my own way by which i was near losing my passage that season to england i had lent my captain some money which i now wanted to enable me to prosecute my intentions this i told him but when i applied for it though i urged the necessity of my occasion i met with so much shuffling from him that i began at last to be afraid of losing my money as i could not recover it by law for i have already mentioned that throughout the west indies no black mans testimony is admitted on any occasion against any white person whatever and therefore my own oath would have been of no use i was obliged therefore to remain with him till he might be disposed to return it to me thus we sailed from martinico for the grenades i frequently pressing the captain for my money to no purpose and to render my condition worse when we got there the captain and his owners quarrelled so that my situation became daily more irksome for besides that we on board had little or no victuals allowed us and i could not get my money nor wages as i could then have gotten my passage free to montserrat had i been able to accept it the worst of all was that it was growing late in july and the ships in the islands must sail by the   th of that month at last however with a great many entreaties i got my money from the captain and took the first vessel i could meet with for st eustatia from thence i went in another to basseterre in st kitts where i arrived on the   th of july on the   d having met with a vessel bound to montserrat i wanted to go in her but the captain and others would not take me on board until i should advertise myself and give notice of my going off the island i told them of my haste to be in montserrat and that the time then would not admit of advertising it being late in the evening and the vessel about to sail but he insisted it was necessary and otherwise he said he would not take me this reduced me to great perplexity for if i should be compelled to submit to this degrading necessity which every black freeman is under of advertising himself like a slave when he leaves an island and which i thought a gross imposition upon any freeman i feared i should miss that opportunity of going to montserrat and then i could not get to england that year the vessel was just going off and no time could be lost i immediately therefore set about with a heavy heart to try who i could get to befriend me in complying with the demands of the captain luckily i found in a few minutes some gentlemen of montserrat whom i knew and having told them my situation i requested their friendly assistance in helping me off the island some of them on this went with me to the captain and satisfied him of my freedom and to my very great joy he desired me to go on board we then set sail and the next day   d i arrived at the wishedfor place after an absence of six months in which i had more than once experienced the delivering hand of providence when all human means of escaping destruction seemed hopeless i saw my friends with a gladness of heart which was increased by my absence and the dangers i had escaped and i was received with great friendship by them all but particularly by mr king to whom i related the fate of his floop the nancy and the causes of her being wrecked i now learned with extreme sorrow that his house was washed away during my absence by the bursting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was opposite the town of plymouth it swept great part of the town away and mr king lost a great deal of property from the inundation and nearly his life when i told him i intended to go to london that season and that i had come to visit him before my departure the good man expressed a great deal of affection for me and sorrow that i should leave him and warmly advised me to stay there insisting as i was much respected by all the gentlemen in the place that i might do very well and in a short time have land and slaves of my own i thanked him for this instance of his friendship but as i wished very much to be in london i declined remaining any longer there and begged he would excuse me i then requested he would be kind enough to give me a certificate of my behavior while in his service which he very readily comp ied with and gave me the following  montserrat january         the bearer hereof gustavus vasa was my slave for upwards of three years during which he has always behaved himsels well and discharged his duty with honesty and assiduity  robert king to all to whom this may concern  having obtained this i parted from my kind master after many sincere professions of gratitude and regard and prepared for my departure for london i immediately agreed to go with one capt john hamer for seven guineas the passage to london on board a ship called the andromache and on the   th and   th i had free dances as they are called with some of my countrymen previous to my seeting off after which i took leave of all my friends and on the   th i embarked for london exceedingly glad to see myself once more on board of a ship and still more so in steering the course i had long wished for with a light heart i bade montserrat farewell and never had my feet on it since and with it i bade adieu to the sound of the cruel whip and all other dreadful instruments of torture adieu to the offensive sight of the violated chastity of the sable females which has too often accosted my eyes adieu to oppressions although to me less severe than most of my countrymen and adieu to the angry howling dashing surfs i wished for a grateful and thankful heart to praise the lord god on high for all his mercies in this ecstasy i steered the ship all night  we had a most prosperous voyage and at the end of seven weeks arrived at cherrygarden stairs thus were my longing eyes once more gratified with a sight of london after having been absent from it above four years i immediately received my wages and i never had earned seven guineas so quick in my life before i had thirtyseven guineas in all when i got cleared of the ship i now entered upon a scene quite new to me but full of hope in this situation my first thoughts were to look out for some of my former friends and amongst the first of those were the miss guerins as soon therefore as i had regaled myself i went in quest of those kind ladies whom i was very impatient to see and with some difficulty and perseverance i found them at mayshill greenwich they were most agreeably surprised to see me and i quite overjoyed at meeting with them i told them my history at which they expressed great wonder and freely acknowledged it did their cousin capt pascal no honor he then visited there frequently and i met him four or five days after in greenwich park when he saw me he appeared a good deal surprised and asked me how i came back i answered in a ship to which he replied dryly i suppose you did not walk back to london on the water as i saw by his manner that he did not seem to be sorry for his behavior to me and that i had not much reason to expect any favor from him i told him that he had used me very ill after i had been such a faithful servant to him for so many years on which without saying any more he turned about and went away a few days after this i met capt pascal at miss guerins house and asked him for my prizemoney he said there was none due to me for if my prizemoney had been  0000l he had a right to it all i told him i was informed otherwise on which he bade me defiance and in a bantering tone desired me to commence a lawsuit against him for it there are lawyers enough said he that will take the cause in hand and you had better try it i told him then that i would try it which enraged him very much however out of regard to the ladies i remained still and never made any farther demand of my right some time afterward these sriendly ladies asked me what i meant to do with myself and now they could assist me i thanked them and said if they pleased i would be their servant but if not i had thirtyseven gnineas which would support me for some time i would be much obliged to them to recommend me to some person who would teach me a business whereby i might earn my living they answered me very politely that they were sorry it did not suit them to take me as their servant and asked me what business i should like to learn i said hairdressing they then promised to assist me in this and soon after they recommended me to a gentleman whom i had known before one capt ohara who treated me with much kindness and procured me a master a hairdresser in coventrycourt haymarket with whom he placed me i was with this man from september till the february following in that time we had a neighbor in the same court who taught the frenchhorn he used to blow it so well that i was charmed with it and agreed with him to teach me to blow it accordingly he took me in hand and began to instruct me and i soon learned all the three parts i took great delight in blowing on this instrument the evenings being long and besides that i was fond of it i did not like to be idle and it filled up my vacant hours innocently at this time also i agreed with the rev mr gregory who lived in the same court where he kept an academy and an eveningschool to improve me in arithmetic this he did as far as barter and alligation so that all the time i was there i was entirely employed in february      i hired myself to dr charles irving in pallmall so celebrated for his successful experiments in making sea water fresh and here i had plenty of hair dressing to improve my hand this gentleman was an excellent master he was exceedingly kind and good tempered and allowed me in the evenings to attend my schools which i esteemed a great blessing therefore i thanked god and him for it and used all my diligence to improve the opportunity this diligence and attention recommended me to the notice and care of my three preceptors who on their parts bestowed a great deal of pains in my instruction and besides were all very kind to me my wages however which were by two thirds less than ever i had in my life for i had only   l per annum i soon found would not be sufficient to defray this extraordinary expense of masters and my own necessary expenses my old thirtyseven guineas had by this time worn all away to one i thought it best therefore to try the sea again in quest of more money as i had been bred to it and had hitherto found the profession of it successful i had also a very great desire to see turkey and i now determined to gratify it accordingly in the month of may      i told the doctor my wish to go to sea again to which he made no opposition and we parted on friendly terms the same day i went into the city in quest of a master i was extremely fortunate in my inquiry for i soon heard of a gentleman who had a ship going to italy and turkey and he wanted a man who could dress hair well i was overjoyed at this and went immediately on board of his ship as i had been directed which i found to be fitted up with great taste and i already foreboded no small pleasure in sailing in her not finding the gentleman on board i was directed to his lodgings where i met with him the next day and gave him a specimen of my dressing he liked it so well that he hired me immediately so that i was perfectly happy for the ship master and voyage were entirely to my mind the ship was called the delawar and my masters name was john jolly a neat smart good humoured man just such an one as i wished to serve we sailed from england in july following and our voyage was extremely pleasant we went to villa franca nice and leghorn and in all these places i was charmed with the richness and beauty of the countries and struck with the elegant buildings with which they abound we had always in them plenty of extraordinary good wines and rich fruits which i was very fond of and i had frequent occasions of gratifying both my taste and curiosity for my captain always lodged on shore in those places which afforded me opportunities to see the country around i also learned navigation of the mate which i was very sond of when we left italy we had delightful sailing among the archipelago islands and from thence to smyrna in turkey this is a very ancient city the houses are built of stone and most of them have graves adjoining to them so that they sometimes present the appearence of churchyards provisions are very plentiful in this city and good wine less than a penny a pint the grapes pomegranates and many other fruits were also the richest and largest i ever tasted the natives are well looking and strong made and treated me always with great civility in general i believe they are fond of black people and several of them gave me pressing invitations to stay amongst them although they keep the franks or christians separate and do not suffer them to dwell immediately amongst them i was astonished in not seeing women in any of their shops and very rarely any in the streets and whenever i did they were covered with a veil from head to foot so that i could not see their faces except when any of them out of curiosity uncovered them to look at me which they sometimes did i was surprised to see how the greeks are in some measure kept under by the turks as the negroes are in the west indies by the white people the less refined greeks as i have already hinted dance here in the same manner as we do in our nation  on the whole during our stay here which was about five months i liked the place and the turks extremely well i could not help observing one very remarkable circumstance there the tails of the sheep are flat and so very large that i have known the tail even of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds the fat of them is very white and rich and is excellent in puddings for which it is much used our ship being at length richly loaded with silk and other articles we sailed for england  in may      soon after our return from turkey our ship made a delightful voyage to oporto in portugal where we arrived at the time of the carnival on our arrival there were sent on board of us thirtysix articles to observe with very heavy penalties if we should break any of them and none o us even dared to go on board any other vessel or on shore till the inquisition had sent on board and searched for every thing illegal especially bibles such as were produced and certain other things were sent on shore till the ships were going away and any person in whose custody a bible was found concealed was to be imprisoned and flogged and sent into slavery for ten years i saw here many very magnificent sights particularly the garden of eden where many of the clergy and laity went in procession in their several orders with the host and sung te deum i had a great curiosity to go into some of their churches but could not gain admittance without using the necessary sprinkling of holy water at my entrance from curiosity and a wish to be holy i therefore complied with this ceremony but its virtues were lost upon me for i found myself nothing the better for it this place abounds with plenty of all kinds of provisions the town is well built and pretty and commands a fine prospect our ship having taken in a load of wine and other commodities we sailed for london and arrived in july following  our next voyage was to the mediterranean the ship was again got ready and we sailed in september for genoa this is one of the finest cities i ever saw some of the edifices were of beautiful marble and made a most noble appearance and many had very curious fountains before them the churches were rich and magnificent and curiously adorned both in the inside and out but all this grandeur was in my eyes disgraced by the galley slaves whose condition both there and in other parts of italy is truly piteous and wretched after we had stayed there some weeks during which we bought many different things we wanted and got them very cheap we sailed to naples a charming city and remarkably clean the bay is the most beautiful i ever saw the moles for shipping are excellent i thought it extraordinary to see grand operas acted here on sunday nights and even attended by their majestys i too like these great ones went to those sights and vainly served god in the day while i thus served mammon effectually at night while we remained here there happened an eruption of mount vesuvius of which i had a perfect view it was extremely awful and we were so near that the ashes from it used to be thick on our deck after we had transacted our business at naples we sailed with a fair wind once more for smyrna where we arrived in december a seraskier or officer took a liking to me here and wanted me to stay and offered me two wives however i resused the temptation thinking one was as much as some could manage and more than others would venture on the merchants here travel in caravans or large companies i have seen many caravans from india with some hundreds of camels laden with different goods the people of these caravans are quite brown among other articles they brought with them a great quantity of locusts which are a kind of pulse sweet and pleasant to the palate and in shape resembling french beans but longer each kind of goods is sold in a street by itself and i always found the turks very honest in their dealings they let no christians into their mosques or churches for which i was very sorry as i was always fond of going to see the different modes of worship of the people wherever i went the plague broke out while we were in smyrna and we stopped taking goods into the ship till it was over she was then richly laden and we sailed in about march    0 for england one day in our passage we met with an accident which was near burning the ship a black cook in melting some fat overset the pan into the fire under the deck which immediately began to blaze and the flame went up very high under the foretop with the fright the poor cook became almost white and altogether speechless happily however we got the fire out without doing much mischief after various delays in this passage which was tedious we arrived in standgate creek in july and at the latter end of the year some new event occurred so that my noble captain the ship and i all separated  in april      i shipped myself as a steward with capt wm robertson of the ship grenada planter once more to try my fortune in the west indies and we sailed from london for madeira barbados and the grenades when we were at this last place having some goods to sell i met once more with my former kind of west india customers  a white man an islander bought some goods of me to the amount of some pounds and made me many fair promises as usual but without any intention of paying me he had likewise bought goods from some more of our people whom he intended to serve in the same manner but he still amused us with promises however when our ship was loaded and near sailing this honest buyer discovered no intention or sign of paying for any thing he had bought of us but on the contrary when i asked him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought goods of so that we found we were like to get more blows than payment on this we went to complain to one mr mintosh a justice of the peace we told his worship of the mans villainous tricks and begged that he would be kind enough to see us redressed but being negroes although free we could not get any remedy and our ship being then just upon the point of sailing we knew not how to help ourselves though we thought it hard to lose our property in this manner luckily for us however this man was also indebted to three white sailors who could not get a farthing from him they therefore readily joined us and we all went together in search of him when we found where he was i took him out of a house and threatened him with vengeance on which finding he was likely to be handled roughly the rogue offered each of us some small allowance but nothing near our demands this exasperated us much more and some were for cutting his ears off but he begged hard for mercy which was at last granted him after we had entirely stripped him we then let him go for which he thanked us glad to get off so easily and ran into the bushes after having wished us a good voyage we then repaired on board and shortly after set sail for england i cannot help remarking here a very narrow escape we had from being blown up owing to a piece of negligence of mine just as our ship was under sail i went down under the cabin to do some business and had a lighted candle in my hand which in my hurry without thinking i held in a barrel of gunpowder it remained in the powder until it was near catching sire when fortunately i observed it and snatched it out in time and providentially no harm happened but i was so overcome with terror that i immediately fainted at this deliverance  in twentyeight days time we arrived in england and i got clear of this ship but being still of a roving disposition and desirous of seeing as many different parts of the world as i could i shipped myself soon after in the same year as steward on board of a fine large ship called the jamaica captain david watt and we sailed from england in december      for nevis and jamaica i found jamaica to be a very fine large island well peopled and the most considerable of the west india islands there was a vast number of negroes here whom i found as usual exceedingly imposed upon by the white people and the slaves punished as in the other islands there are negroes whose business it is to flog slaves they go about to different people for employment and the usual pay is from one to four bits i saw many cruel punishments inflicted on the slaves in the short time i stayed here in particular i was present when a poor fellow was tied up and kept hanging by the wrists at some distance from the ground and then some half hundred weights were fixed to his ancles in which posture he was flogged most unmercifully there were also as i heard two different masters noted for cruelty on the island who had staked up two negroes naked and in two hours the vermin stung them to death i heard a gentleman i well knew tell my captain that he passed sentence on a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poison an overseer i pass over numerous other instances in order to relieve the reader by a milder scene of roguery before i had been long on the island one mr smith at port morant bought goods of me to the amount of twentyfive pounds sterling but when i demanded payment from him he was going each time to beat me and threatened that he would put me in goal one time he would say i was going to set his house on fire at another he would swear i was going to run away with his slaves i was astonished at this usage from a person who was in the situation of a gentleman but i had no alternative and was therefore obliged to submit when i came to kingston i was surprised to see the number of africans who were assembled together on sundays particularly at a large commodious place called spring path here each different nation of africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country they still retain most of their native customs they bury their dead and put victuals pipes and tobacco and other things in the grave with the corpse in the same manner as in africa our ship having got her loading we sailed for london where we arrived in the august following on my return to london i waited on my old and good master dr irving who made me an offer of his service again being now tired of the sea i gladly accepted it i was very happy in living with this gentleman once more during which time we were daily employed in reducing old neptunes dominions by purifying the briny element and making it fresh thus i went on till may      when i was roused by the sound of fame to seek new adventures and find toward the north pole what our creator never intended we should a passage to india an expedition was now fitting out to explore a northeast passage conducted by the honorable constantine john phipps since lord mulgrave in his majestys sloop of war the race horse my master being anxious for the reputation of this adventure we therefore prepared every thing for our voyage and i attended him on board the race horse the   th day of may      we proceeded to sheerness where we were joined by his majestys sloop the carcass commanded by captain lutwidge on the  th of june we sailed toward our destined place the pole and on the   th of the same month we were off shetland on this day i had a great and unexpected deliverance from an accident which was near blowing up the ship and destroying the crew which made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cautious the ship was so filled that there was very little room on board for any one which placed me in a very awkward situation i had resolved to keep a journal of this singular and interesting voyage and i had no other place for this purpose but a little cabin or the doctors storeroom where i slept this little place was stuffed with all manner of combustibles particularly with tow and aquafortis and many other dangerous things unfortunately it happened in the evening as i was writing my journal that i had occasion to take the candle out of the lanthorn and a spark having touched a single thread of the tow all the rest caught the flame and immediately the whole was in a blaze i saw nothing but present death before me and expected to be the first to perish in the flames in a moment the alarm was spread and many people who were near ran to assist in putting out the fire all this time i was in the very midst of the flames my shirt and the handkerchief on my neck were burnt and i was almost smothered with the smoke however through gods mercy as i was nearly giving up all hopes some people brought blankets and mattresses and threw them on the flames by which means in a short time the fire was put out i was severely reprimanded and menaced by such of the officers who knew it and strictly charged never more to go there with a light and indeed even my own fears made me give heed to this command for a little time  but at last not being able to write my journal in any other part of the ship i was tempted again to venture by stealth with a light in the same cabin though not without considerable fear and dread on my mind on the  0th of june we began to use dr irvings apparatus for making salt water fresh i used to attend the distillery i frequently purified from twentysix to forty gallons a day the water thus distilled was perfectly pure well tasted and free from salt and was used on various occasions on board the ship on the   th of june being in lat    we made greenland where i was surprised to see the sun did not set the weather now became extremely cold and as we sailed between north and east which was our course we saw many very high and curious mountains of ice and also a great number of very large whales which used to come close to our ship and blow the water up to a very great height in the air one morning we had vast quantities of seahorses about the ship which neighed exactly like any other horses we fired some harpoon guns amongst them in order to take some but we could not get any the  0th the captain of a greenland ship came on board and told us of three ships that were lost in the ice however we still held on our course till july the   th when we were stopped by one compact impenetrable body of ice we ran along it from east to west above ten degrees and on the   th we got as far north as  0    and in    or  0 degrees east longitude from london on the   th and  0th of july we saw one continued plain of smooth unbroken ice bounded only by the horizon and we fastened to a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick we had generally sunshine and constant daylight which gave cheerfulness and novelty to the whole of this striking grand and uncommon scene and to heighten it still more the reflection of the sun from the ice gave the clouds a most beautiful appearance we killed many different animals at this time and among the rest nine bears though they had nothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat we used to decoy them to the ship sometimes by burning feathers of skins i thought them course eating but some of the ships company relished them very much some of our people once in the boat fired at and wounded a seahorse which dived immediately and in a little time after brought up with it a number of others they all joined in an attack upon the boat and were with difficulty prevented from staving or oversetting her but a boat from the carcass having come to assist ours and joined it they dispersed after having wrested an oar from one of the men one of the ships boats had before been attacked in the same manner but happily no harm was done though we wounded several of these animals we never got but one we remained hereabouts until the  st of august when the two ships got completely fastened in the ice occasioned by the loose ice that set in from the sea this made our situation very dreadful and alarming so that on the  th day we were in very great apprehension of having the ships squeezed to pieces the officers now held a council to know what was best for us to do in order to save our lives and it was determined that we should endeavor to escape by dragging our boats along the  toward the sea which however was farther off than any of us thought this determination filled us with  dejection and confounded us with despair for we had very little prospect of escaping with life however we sawed some of the ice about the ships to keep it from hurting them and thus kept them in a kind of pond we then began to drag the boats as well as we could toward the sea but after two or three days labor we made very little progress so that some of our hearts totally failed us and i really began to give up myself for lost when i saw our surrounding calamities while we were at this hard labor i once fell into a pond we had made amongst some loose ice and was very near being drowned but providentially some people were near who gave me immediate assistance and thereby i escaped drowning our deplorable condition which kept up the constant apprehension of our perishing in the ice brought me gradually to think of eternity in such a manner as i never had done before i had the fears of death hourly upon me and shuddered at the thoughts of meeting the grim king of terrors in the natural state i then was in and was exceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if i should die in it i had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time for we saw that our existence could not be long on the ice after leaving the ships which were now out of sight and some miles from the boats our appearance now became truly lamentable pale dejection seized every countenance many who had been before blasphemers in this our distress began to call on the good god of heaven for his help and in the time of our utter need he heard us and against hope or human probability delivered us it was the eleventh day of the ships being thus fastened and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner that the wind changed to the e n e the weather immediately became mild and the ice broke toward the sea which was to the s w of us many of us on this got on board again and with all our might we hove the ships into every open water we could find and made all the sail on them in our power and now having a prospect of success we made signals for the boats and the remainder of the people this seemed to us like a reprieve from death and happy was the man who could first get on board of any ship or the first boat he could meet we then proceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again which we accomplished in about thirty hours to our infinite joy and gladness of heart as soon as we were out of danger we came to anchor and refitted and on the   th of august we sailed from this uninhabited extremity of the world where the inhospitable climate affords neither food nor shelter and not a tree or shrub of any kind grows amongst its barren rocks but all is one desolate and expanded waste of ice which even the constant beams of the sun for six months in the year cannot penetrate or dissolve the sun now being on the decline the days shortened as we sailed to the southward and on the   th in latitude    it was dark by ten oclock at night september the  0th in latitude      we met a very severe gale of wind and high seas and shipped a great deal of water in the space of ten hours this made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole day and one sea which struck the ship with more force than any thing i ever met with of the kind before laid her under water for some time so that we thought she would have gone down two boats were washed srom the booms and the longboat from the chucks all other moveable things on the decks were also washed away among which were many curious things of different kinds which we had brought from greenland and we were obliged in order to lighten the ship to toss some of our guns overboard we saw a ship at the same time in very great distress and her masts were gone but we were unable to assist her we now lost sight of the carcass till the   th when we saw land about orfordness off which place she joined us from thence we sailed for london and on the  0th came up to deptford and thus ended our arctic voyage to the no small joy of all on board after having been absent four months in which time at the imminent hazard of our lives we explored nearly as far toward the pole as    degrees north and  0 degrees east longitude being much farther by all accounts than any navigator had ever ventured before in which we fully proved the impracticability of finding a passage that way to india  chap x the author leaves doctor irving and engages on board a turkey ship  account of a black mans being kidnapped on board and sent to the west indies and the authors fruitless endeavors to procure his freedom  some account of the manner of the authors conversion to the faith of jesus christ  our voyage to the north pole being ended i returned to london with doctor irving with whom i continued for some time during which i began seriously to reflect on the dangers i had escaped particularly those of my last voyage which made a lasting impression on my mind and by the grace of god proved afterward a mercy to me it caused me to reflect deeply on my eternal state and to seek the lord with full purpose of heart ere it was too late i rejoiced greatly and heartily thanked the lord for directing me to london where i was determined to work out my own salvation and in so doing procure a title to heaven being the result of a mind blended by ignorance and sin  in process of time i left my master doctor irving the purisier of waters i lodged in coventrycourt haymarket where i was continually oppressed and much concerned about the salvation of my soul and was determined in my own strength to be a firstrate christian i used every means for this purpose and not being able to find any person amongst those with whom i was then acquainted that acquiesced with me in point of religion or in scripture language that would show me any good i was much dejected and knew not where to seek relief however i first frequented the neighboring churches st jamess and others two or three times a day for many weeks still i came away dissatisfied something was wanting that i could not obtain and i really found more heartfelt relief in reading my bible at home than in attending the church and being resolved to be saved i pursued other methods first i went among the quakers where the word of god was neither read or preached so that i remained as much in the dark as ever i then searched into the roman catholic principles but was not in the least edified i at length had recourse to the jews which availed me nothing as the fear of eternity daily harassed my mind and i knew not where to seek shelter from the wrath to come however this was my conclusion at all events to read the four evangelists and whatever sect or party i found adhering thereto such i would join thus i went on heavily without any guide to direct me the way that leads to eternal life i asked different people questions about the manner of going to heaven and was told different ways here i was much staggered and could not find any at that time more righteous than myself or indeed so much inclined to devotion i thought we should not all be saved this is agreeable to the holy scriptures nor would all be damned i found none among the circle of my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten commandments so righteous was i in my own eyes that i was convinced i excelled many of them in that point by keeping eight out of ten and finding those who in general termed themselves christians not so honest or so good in their morals as the turks i really thought the turks were in a safer way of salvation than my neighbors so that between hopes and fears i went on and the chief comforts i enjoyed were in the musical french horn which i then practiced and also dressing of hair such was my situation some months experiencing the dishonesty of many people here i determined at last to set out for turkey and there to end my days it was now early in the spring      i sought for a master and found a captain john hughes commander of a ship called anglicania fitting out in the river thames and bound to smyrna in turkey i shipped myself with him as a steward at the same time i recommended to him a very clever black man john annis as a cook this man was on board the ship near two months doing his duty he had formerly lived many years with mr william kirkpatrick a gentleman of the island of st kitts from whom he parted by consent though he afterward tried many schemes to inveigle the poor man he had applied to many captains who traded to st kitts to trepan him and when all their attempts and schemes of kidnapping proved abortive mr kirkpatrick came to our ship at union stairs on easter monday april the fourth with two wherry boats and six men having learned that the man was on board and tied and forcibly took him away from the ship in the presence of the crew and the chief mate who had detained him after he had information to come away i believe this was a combined piece of business but be that as it may it certainly reflected great disgrace on the mate and captain also who although they had desired the oppressed man to stay on board yet this vile act on the man who had served him he did not in the least assist to recover or pay me a farthing of his wages which was about five pounds i proved the only friend he had who attempted to regain him his liberty if possible having known the want of liberty myself i sent as soon as i could to gravesend and got knowledge of the ship in which he was but unluckily she had sailed the first tide after he was put on board my intention was then immediately to apprehend mr kirkpatrick who was about setting off for scotland and having obtained a habcas corpus for him and got a tipstaff to go with me to st pauls churchyard where he lived he suspecting something of this kind set a watch to look out my being known to them obliged me to use the following deception i whitened my face that they might not know me and this had the desired effect he did not go out of his house that night and next morning i contrived a well plotted stratagem notwithstanding he had a gentleman in his house to personate him my direction to the tipstaff who got admittance into the house was to conduct him to a judge according to the writ when he came there his plea was that he had not the body in custody on which he was admitted to bail i proceeded immediately to that well known philanthropist granville sharp esquire who received me with the utmost kindness and gave me every instruction that was needful on the occasion i lest him in full hope that i should gain the unhappy man his liberty with the warmest sense of gratitude toward mr sharp for his kindness but alas my attorney proved unfaithful he took my money lost me many months employ and did not do the least good in the cause and when the poor man arrived at st kitts he was according to custom staked to the ground with four pins through a cord two on his wrists and two on his ancles was cut and flogged most unmercifully and afterward loaded cruelly with irons about his neck i had two very moving letters from him while he was in this situation and made attempts to go after him at a great hazard but was sadly disappointed i also was told of it by some very respectable families now in london who saw him in st kitts in the same state in which he remained till kind death released him out of the hands of his tyrants during this disagreeable business i was under strong convictions of sin and thought that my state was worse than any mans my mind was unaccountably disturbed i often wished for death though at the same time convinced i was altogether unprepared for that awful summons suffering much by villains in the late cause and being much concerned about the state of my soul these things but particularly the latter brought me very low so that i became a burden to myself and viewed all things around me as emptiness and vanity which could give no satisfaction to a troubled conscience i was again determined to go to turkey and resolved at that time never more to return to england i engaged as steward on board a turkeyman the wester hall capt lina but was prevented by means of my late captain mr hughes and others all this appeared to be against me and the only comfort i then experienced was in reading the holy scriptures where i saw that there is no new thing under the sun eccles i   and what was appointed for me i must submit to thus i continued to travel in much heaviness and frequently murmured against the almighty particularly in his providential dealings and awful to think i began to blaspheme and wished often to be any thing but a human being in these severe conflicts the lord answered me by awful visions of the night when deep sleep falls upon men in slumberings upon the bed job xxxiii    he was pleased in much mercy to give me to see and in some measure understand the great and awful scene of the judgmentday that no unclean person no unholy thing can enter into the kingdom of god ephesians v   i would then if it had been possible have changed my nature with the meanest worm on the earth and was ready to say to the mountains and rocks fall on me rev vi    but all in vain i then in the greatest agony requested the divine creator that he would grant me a small space of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities which i felt were grievous the lord in his manifold mercies was pleased to grant my request and being yet in a state of time the sense of gods mercies were so great on my mind when i awoke that my strength entirely failed me for many minutes and i was exceedingly weak this was the first spiritual mercy i ever was sensible or and being on praying ground as soon as i recovered a little strength and got out of bed and dressed myself i invoked heaven from my inmost soul and servently begged that god would never again permit me to blaspheme his most holy name the lord who is longsuffering and full of compassion to such poor rebels as we are condescended to hear and answer i felt that i was altogether unholy and saw clearly what a bad use i had made of the faculties i was endowed with they were given me to glorify god with i thought therefore i had better want them here and enter into life eternal than abuse them and be cast into hell sire i prayed to be directed if there were any holier than those with whom i was acquainted that the lord would point them out to me i appealed to the searcher of hearts whether i did not wish to love him more and serve him better notwithstanding all this the reader may easily discern if a believer that i was still in natures darkness at length i hated the house in which i lodged because gods most holy name was blasphemed in it then i saw the word of god verified viz before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear  i had a great desire to read the bible the whole day at home but not having a convenient place for retirement i left the house in the day rather than stay amongst the wicked ones and that day as i was walking it pleased god to direct me to a house where there was an old seafaring man who experienced much of the love of god shed abroad in his heart he began to discourse with me and as i desired to love the lord his conversation rejoiced me greatly and indeed i had never heard before the love of christ to believers set forth in such a manner and in so clear a point of view here i had more questions to put to the man than his time would permit him to answer and in that memorable hour there came in a dissenting minister he joined our discourse and asked me some few questions among others where i heard the gospel preached i knew not what he meant by hearing the gospel i told him i had read the gospel and he asked where i went to church or whether i went at all or not to which i replied i attended st jamess st martins and st anns soho  so said he you are a churchmani answered i was he then invited me to a lovefeast at his chapel that evening i accepted the offer and thanked him and soon after he went away i had some further discourse with the old christian added to some profitable reading which made me exceedingly happy when i left him he reminded me of coming to the feast i assured him i would be there thus we parted and i weighed over the heavenly conversation that had passed between these two men which cheered my then heavy and drooping spirit more than any thing i had met with for many months however i thought the time long in going to my supposed banquet i also wished much for the company of these friendly men their company pleased me much and i thought the gentleman very kind in asking me a stranger to a feast but how singular did it appear to me to have it in a chapel when the wished for hour came i went and happily the old man was there who kindly seated me as he belonged to the place i was much astonished to see the place filled with people and no signs of eating and drinking there were many ministers in the company at last they began by giving out hymns and between the singing the ministers engaged in prayer in short i knew not what to make of this sight having never seen any thing of the kind in my life before now some of the guests began to speak their experience agreeable to what i read in the scriptures much was said by every speaker of the providence of god and his unspeakable mercies to each of them this i knew in a great measure and could most heartily join them but when they spoke of a future state they seemed to be altogether certain of their calling and election of god and that no one could ever separate them from the love of christ or pluck them out of his hands this filled me with utter consternation intermingled with admiration i was so amazed as not to know what to think of the company my heart was attracted and my affections were enlarged i wished to be as happy as them and was persuaded in my mind that they were different from the world that lies in wickedness   john v    their language and singing etc did well harmonize i was entirely overcome and wished to live and die thus lastly some persons in the place produced some neat baskets full of buns which they distributed about and each person communicated with his neighbor and sipped water out of different mugs which they handed about to all who were present this kind of christian fellowship i had never seen nor ever thought of seeing on earth it fully reminded me of what i had read in the holy scriptures of the primitive christians who loved each other and broke bread in partaking of it even from house to house this entertainment which lasted about four hours ended in singing and prayer it was the first soul feast i ever was present at this last twentyfour hours produced me things spiritual and temporal sleeping and waking judgment and mercy that i could not but admire the goodness of god in directing the blind blasphemous sinner in the path that he knew not of even among the just and instead of judgment he has showed mercy and will hear and answer the prayers and supplications of every returning prodigal o to grace how great a debtor daily i am constrained to be   after this i was resolved to win heaven if possible and if i perished i thought it should be at the feet of jesus in praying to him for salvation after having been an eyewitness to some of the happiness which attended those who feared god i knew not how with any propriety to return to my lodgings where the name of god was continually profaned at which i felt the greatest horror i paused in my mind for some time not knowing what to do whether to hire a bed elsewhere or go home again at last fearing an evil report might arise i went home with a farewell to cardplaying and vain jesting etc i saw that time was very short eternity long and very near and i viewed those persons alone blessed who were found ready at midnight call or when the judge of all both quick and dead comes  the next day i took courage and went to holborn to see my new and worthy acquaintance the old man mr c  he with his wife a gracious woman were at work at silk weaving they seemed mutually happy and both quite glad to see me and i more so to see them i sat down and we conversed much about soul matters etc their discourse was amazingly delightful edifying and pleasant i knew not at last how to leave this agreeable pair till time summoned me away as i was going they lent me a little book entitled the conversion of an indian it was in questions and answers the poor man came over the sea to london to inquire after the christians god who through rich mercy he found and had not his journey in vain the above book was of great use to me and at that time was a means of strengthening my faith however in parting they both invited me to call on them when i pleased this delighted me and i took care to make all the improvement from it i could and so far i thanked god for such company and desires i prayed that the many evils i felt within might be done away and that i might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances this was quickly heard and answered and i was soon connected with those whom the scripture calls the excellent of the earth i heard the gospel preached and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid open by the preachers and the way of salvation by christ alone was evidently set forth thus i went on happily for near two months and i once heard during this period a reverend gentleman mr g speak of a man who had departed this life in full assurance of his going to glory i was much astonished at the assertion and did very deliberately inquire how he could get at this knowledge i was answered fully agreeable to what i read in the oracles of truth and was told also that if i did not experience the new birth and the pardon of my sins through the blood of christ before i died i could not enter the kingdom of heaven i knew not what to think of this report as i thought i kept eight commandments out of ten then my worthy interpreter told me i did not do it nor could i and he added that no man ever did or could keep the commandments without offending in one point i thought this sounded very strange and puzzled me much for many weeks for i thought it a hard saying i then asked my friend mr l  d who was a clerk in a chapel why the commandments of god were given if we could not be saved by them to which he replied the law is a schoolmaster to bring us to christ who alone could and did keep the commandments and fulfilled all their requirements for his elect people even those to whom he had given a living faith and the sins of those chosen vessels were already atoned for and forgiven them whilst living and if i did not experience the same before my exit the lord would say at that great day to me go ye cursed etc etc for god would appear faithful in his judgments to the wicked as he would be faithful in showing mercy to those were ordained to it before the world was therefore christ jesus seemed to be all in all to that mans soul i was much wounded at this discourse and brought into such a dilemma as i never expected i asked him if he was to die that moment whether he was sure to enter the kingdom of god and added do you know that your sins are forgiven you he answered in the affirmative then confusion anger and discontent seized me and i staggered much at this sort of doctrine it brought me to a stand not knowing which to believe whether salvation by works or by faith only in christ i requested him to tell me how i might know when my sins were forgiven me he assured me he could not and that none but god alone could do this i told him it was very mysterious but he said it was really matter of fact and quoted many portions of scripture immediately to the point to which i could make no reply he then desired me to pray to god to show me these things i answered that i prayed to god every day he said i perceive you are a churchman i answered i was he then entreated me to beg of god to show me what i was and the true state of my soul i thought the prayer very short and odd so we parted for that time i weighed all these things well over and could not help thinking how it was possible for a man to know that his sins were forgiven him in this life i wished that god would reveal this self same thing unto me in a short time after this i went to westminster chapel the rev mr p  preached from lam iii    it was a wonderful sermon he clearly showed that a living man had no cause to complain for the punishments of his sins he evidently justified the lord in all his dealings with the sons of men he also showed the justice of god in the eternal punishment of the wicked and impenitent the discourse seemed to me like a twoedged sword cutting all ways it afforded me much joy intermingled with many fears about my soul and when it was ended he gave it out that he intended the ensuing week to examine all those who meant to attend the lords table now i thought much of my good works and at the same time was doubtful of my being a proper object to receive the sacrament i was full of meditation till the day of examining however i went to the chapel and though much distressed i addressed the reverend gentleman thinking if i was not right he would endeavor to convince me of it when i conversed with him the first thing he asked me was what i knew of christ i told him i believed in him and had been baptized in his name then said he when were you brought to the knowledge of god and how were you convinced of sin i knew not what he meant by these questions i told him i kept eight commandments out of ten but that i sometimes swore on board ship and sometimes when on shore and broke the sabbath he then asked me if i could read i answered yes  then said he do you not read in the bible he that offends in one point is guilty of all i said yes then he assured me that one sin unatoned for was as sufficient to damn a soul as one leak was to sink a ship here i was struck with awe for the minister exhorted me much and reminded me of the shortness of time and the length of eternity and that no unregenerate soul or any thing unclean could enter the kingdom of heaven  he did not admit me as a communicant but recommended me to read the scriptures and hear the word preached not to neglect fervent prayer to god who has promised to hear the supplications of those who seek him in godly sincerity so i took my leave of him with many thanks and resolved to follow his advice so far as the lord would condescend to enable me during this time i was out of employ nor was i likely to get a situation suitable for me which obliged me to go once more to sea i engaged as steward of a ship called the hope capt richard strange bound from london to cadiz in spain in a short time after i was on board i heard the name of god much blasphemed and i feared greatly lest i should catch the horrible infection i thought if i sinned again after having life and death set evidently before me i should certainly go to hell my mind was uncommonly chagrined and i murmured much at gods providential dealings with me and was discontented with the commandments that i could not be saved by what i had done i hated all things and wished i had never been born confusion seized me and i wished to be annihilated one day i was standing on the very edge of the stern of the ship thinking to drown myself but this scripture was instantly impressed on my mind  that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him   john iii    then i paused and thought myself the unhappiest man living again i was convinced that the lord was better to me than i deserved and i was better off in the world than many after this i began to fear death i fretted mourned and prayed till i became a burden to others but more so to myself at length i concluded to beg my bread on shore rather than go again to sea amongst a people who feared not god and i entreated the captain three different times to discharge me he would not but each time gave me greater and greater encouragement to continue with him and all on board showed me very great civility notwithstanding all this i was unwilling to embark again at last some of my religious friends advised me by saying it was my lawful calling consequently it was my duty to obey and that god was not conined to place etc etc particularly mr g s the governor of tothilfields bridewell who pitied my case and read the eleventh chapter of the hebrews to me with exhortations he prayed for me and i believed that he prevailed on my behalf as my burden was then greatly removed and i found a heartfelt resignation to the will of god the good man gave me a pocket bible and alleines alarm to the unconverted we parted and the next day i went on board again we sailed for spain and i found favor with the captain it was the fourth of the month of september when we sailed from london we had a delightful voyage to cadiz where we arrived the twentythird of the same month the place is strong commands a fine prospect and is very rich the spanish galloons frequent that port and some arrived whilst we were there i had many opportunities of reading the scriptures i wrestled hard with god in fervent prayer who had declared in his word that he would hear the groanings and deep sighs of the poor in spirit i found this verified to my utter astonishment and comfort in the following manner  on the morning of the  th of october i pray you to attend all that day i thought that i should either see or hear something supernatural i had a secret impulse on my mind of something that was to take place which drove me continually for that time to a throne of grace it pleased god to enable me to wrestle with him as jacob did i prayed that if sudden death were to happen and i perished it might be at christs feet  in the evening of the same day as i was reading and meditating on the fourth chapter of the acts twelfth verse under the solemn apprehensions of eternity and reflecting on my past actions i began to think i had lived a moral life and that i had a proper ground to believe i had an interest in the divine favor but still meditating on the subject not knowing whether salvation was to be had partly for our own good deeds or solely as the sovereign gift of god  in this deep consternation the lord was pleased to break in upon my soul with his bright beams of heavenly light and in an instant as it were removing the veil and letting light into a dark place i saw clearly with the eye of faith the crucified savior bleeding on the cross on mount calvary the scriptures became an unsealed book i saw myself a condemned criminal under the law which came with its full force to my conscience and when the commandment came sin revived and i died i saw the lord jesus christ in his humiliation loaded and bearing my reproach sin and shame i then clearly perceived that by the deeds of the law no flesh living could be justified i was then convinced that by the first adam sin came and by the second adam the lord jesus christ all that are saved must be made alive it was given me at that time to know what it was to be born again john iii   i saw the eighth chapter to the romans and the doctrines of gods decrees verified agreeable to his eternal everlasting and unchangeable purposes the word of god was sweet to my taste yea sweeter than honey and the honeycomb christ was revealed to my soul as the chiefest among ten thousand these heavenly moments were really as life to the dead and what john calls an earnest of the spirit john xvi       etc  this was indeed unspeakable and i firmly believe undeniable by many now every leading providential circumstance that happened to me from the day i was taken from my parents to that hour was then in my view as if it had but just then occurred i was sensible of the invisible hand of god which guided and protected me when in truth i knew it not still the lord pursued me although i slighted and disregarded it this mercy melted me down when i considered my poor wretched state i wept seeing what a great debtor i was to sovereign free grace now the ethiopian was willing to be saved by jesus christ the sinners only surety and also to rely on none other person or thing for salvation self was obnoxious and good works he had none for it is god that works in us both to will and to do oh the amazing things of that hour can never be told  it was joy in the holy ghost i felt an astonishing change the burden of sin the gaping jaws of hell and the fears of death that weighed me down before now lost their horror indeed i thought death would now be the best earthly friend i ever had such were my grief and joy as i believe are seldom experienced i was bathed in tears and said what am i that god should thus look on me the vilest of sinners i felt a deep concern for my mother and friends which occasioned me to pray with fresh ardour and in the abyss of thought i viewed the unconverted people of the world in a very awful state being without god and without hope  it pleased god to pour out on me the spirit of prayer and the grace of supplication so that in loud acclamations i was enabled to praise and glorify his most holy name when i got out of the cabin and told some of the people what the lord had done for me alas who could understand me or believe my report  none but to whom the arm of the lord was revealed i became a barbarian to them in talking of the love of christ his name was to me as ointment poured forth indeed it was sweet to my soul but to them a rock of offense i thought my case singular and every hour a day until i came to london for i much longed to be with some to whom i could tell of the wonders of gods love toward me and join in prayer to him whom my soul loved and thirsted after i had uncommon commotions within such as few can tell aught about now the bible was my only companion and comfort i prized it much with many thanks to god that i could read it for myself and was not left to be tossed about or led by mans devices and notions the worth of a soul cannot be told  may the lord give the reader an understanding in this whenever i looked in the bible i saw things new and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort for i knew that to me was the word of salvation sent sure i was that the spirit which indicted the word opened my heart to receive the truth of it as it is in jesus  that the same spirit enabled me to act faith upon the promises that were precious to me and enabled me to believe to the salvation of my soul by free grace i was persuaded that i had a part in the first resurrection and was enlightened with the light of the living job xxxiii  0 i wished for a man of god with whom i might converse my soul was like the chariots of aminadab canticles vi    these among others were the precious promises that were so powerfully applied to me all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive matt xxi    peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you john xiv    i saw the blessed redeemer to be the fountain of life and the well of salvation i experienced him to be all in all he had brought me by a way that i knew not and he had made crooked paths straight then in his name i set up my ebenezer saying hitherto he has helped me and could say to the sinners about me behold what a savior i have thus i was by the teaching of that allglorious deity the great one in three and three in one confirmed in the truths of the bible those oracles of everlasting truth on which every soul living must stand or fall eternally agreeable to acts iv    neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved but only christ jesus may god give the reader a right understanding in these facts to him that believes all things are possible but to them that are unbelieving nothing is pure titus i     during this period we remained at cadiz until our ship got laden we sailed about the fourth of november and having a good passage we arrived in london the month following to my comfort with heartfelt gratitude to god for his rich and unspeakable mercies  on my return i had but one text which puzzled me or that the devil endeavored to buffet me with viz romans xi   and as i had heard of the reverend mr roman and his great knowledge in the scriptures i wished much to hear him preach one day i went to blackfriars church and to my great satisfaction and surprise he preached from that very text he very clearly showed the difference between human works and free election which is according to gods sovereign will and pleasure these glad tidings set me entirely at liberty and i went out of the church rejoicing seeing my spots were those of gods children i went to westminster chapel and saw some of my old friends who were glad when they perceived the wonderful change that the lord had wrought in me particularly mr g  s  my worthy acquaintance who was a man of a choice spirit and had great zeal sor the lords service i enjoyed his correspondence till he died in the year      i was again examined at that same chapel and was received into church fellowship amongst them i rejoiced in spirit making melody in my heart to the god of all my mercies now my whole wish was to be dissolved and to be with christ  but alas i must wait mine appointed time  miscellaneous verses or reflections on the state of my mind during my first convictions of the necessity of believing the truth and experiencing the inestimable benefits of christianity well may i say my life has been one scene of sorrow and of pain from early days i griefs have known and as i grew my griefs have grown dangers were always in my path and fear of wrath and sometimes death while pale dejection in me reigned i often wept by grief constrained when taken from my native land by an unjust and cruel band how did uncommon dread prevail my sighs no more i could conceal to ease my mind i often strove and tried my trouble to remove i sung and uttered sighs between  assayed to stifle guilt with sin but of not all that i could do would stop the current of my woe conviction still my vileness showed how great my guilt  how lost to good  prevented that i could not die  nor could to one sure refuge fly  an orphan state i had to mourn   forsook by all and left forlorn those who beheld my downcast mein could not guess at my woes unseen they by appearance could not know the troubles that i waded through lust anger blasphemy and pride with legions of such ills beside  troubled my thoughts while doubts and fears clouded and darkened most my years sighs now no more would be confined   they breathed the trouble of my mind i wished for death but checked the word and often prayed unto the lord unhappy more than some on earth i thought the place that gave me birth  strange thoughts oppressed  while i replied  why not in ethiopia died and why thus spared when nigh to hell  god only knew  i could not tell  a tott ring fence a bowing wall  i thought myself ere since the fall often times i mused and nigh despair while birds melodious filled the air  thrice happy songsters ever free how blessed were they compared to me thus all things added to my pain while grief compelled me to complain when sable clouds began to rise my mind grew darker than the skies the english nation called to leave how did my breast with sorrows heave i longed for rest  cried help me lord  some mitigation lord afford yet on dejected still i went  heartthrobbing woes within me pent nor land nor sea could comfort give nor aught my anxious mind relieve weary with troubles yet unknown to all but god and self alone numerous months for peace i strove numerous foes i had to prove inured to dangers griefs and woes trained up midst perils death and foes said must it thus ever be   no quiet is permitted me hard hap and more than heavy lot i prayed to god forget me not   what thou ordainst help me to bear  but o deliver from despair strivings and wrestling seemed in vain nothing i did could ease my pain then gave i up my work and will consessd and owned my doom was hell like some poor prisoner at the bar conscious of guilt of sin and fear arraigned and selfcondemned i stood   lost in the world and in my blood yet here midst blackest clouds confined a beam from christ the day star shined surely thought i if jesus please he can at once sign my release i ignorant of his righteousness set up my labors in its place  forgot for why his blood was shed  and prayed and fasted in its stead he died for sinners  i am one might not his blood for me atone though i am nothing else but sin yet surely he can make me clean thus light came in and i believed myself forgot and help received my savior then i know i found for eased from guilt no more i groaned o happy hour in which i ceased to mourn for then i found a rest my soul and christ were now as one  thy light o jesus in me shone blessed be thy name for now i know i and my works can nothing do  the lord alone can ransom man   for this the spotless lamb was slain when sacrifices works and prayer proved vain and ineffectual were  lo then i come the savior cried and bleeding bowed his head and died he died for all who ever saw no help in them nor by the law  i this have seen and gladly own  salvation is by christ alone act iv     chap xi the author embarks on board a ship bound for cadiz  is near being shipwrecked  goes to malaga  remarkable fine cathedral

the musquito admiral who treats him kindly  he gets another vessel and goes on board  instances of bad treatment  ms doctor irving  gets to jamaica  is cheated by his captain  leaves the doctor and goes for england  when our ship was got ready for sea again i was entreated by the captain to go in her once more but as i felt myself now as happy as i could with to be in this life i for some time refused however the advice of my friends at last prevailed and in full resignation to the will of god i again embarked for cadiz in march      we had a very good passage without any material accident until we arrived off the bay of cadiz when one sunday just as we were going into the harbor the ship struck against a rock and knocked off a garboard plank which is the next to the keel in an instant all hands were in the greatest confusion and began with loud cries to call on god to have mercy on them although i could not swim and saw no way of escaping death i felt no dread in my then situation having no desire to live i even rejoiced in spirit thinking this death would be sudden glory but the fullness of time was not yet come the people near to me were much astonished in seeing me thus calm and resigned but i told them of the peace of god which through sovereign grace i enjoyed and these words were that instant in my mind  christ is my pilot wise my compass is his word  my soul each storm desies while i have such a lord  i trust his faithfulness and power  to save me in the trying hour  though rocks and quicksands deep through all my passage lie  yet christ shall safely keep and guide me with his eye  how can i sink with such a prop  that bears the world and all things up   at this time there were many large spanish ukers or passagevessels full of people crossing the channel who seeing our condition a number of them came alongside of us as many hands as could be employed began to work some at our three pumps and the rest unloading the ship as fast as possible there being only a single rock called the porpus on which we struck we soon got off it and providentially it was then high water we therefore run the ship ashore at the nearest place to keep her from sinking after many tides with a great deal of care and industry we got her repaired again when we had dispatched our business at cadiz we went to gibraltar and from thence to malaga a very pleasant and rich city where there is one of the finest cathedrals i had ever seen it had been above fifty years in building as i heard though it was not then quite finished great parts of the inside however was completed and highly decorated with the richest marble columns and many superb paintings it was lighted occasionally by an amazing number of wax tapers of different sizes some of which were as thick as a mans thigh these however were only used on some of their grand festivals  i was very much shocked at the custom of bullbaiting and other diversions which prevailed here on sunday evenings to the great scandal of christianity and morals i used to express my abhorrence of it to a priest whom i met with i had frequent contests about religion with the reverend father in which he took great pains to make a proselyte of me to his church and i no less to convert him to mine on these occasions i used to produce my bible and show him in what points his church erred he then said he had been in england and that every person there read the bible which was very wrong but i answered him that christ desired us to search the scriptures in his zeal for my conversion he solicited me to go to one of the universities in spain and declared that i should have my education free and told me if i got myself made a priest i might in time become even pope and that pope benedict was a black man as i was ever desirous of learning i paused for some time upon this temptation and thought by being crafty i might catch some with guile but i began to think that it would be only hypocrisy in me to embrace his offer as i could not in conscience conform to the opinions of his church i was therefore enabled to regard the word of god which says come out from amongst them and refused father vincents offer so we parted without conviction on either side  having taken at this place some fine wines fruits and money we proceeded to cadiz where we took about two tons more of money etc and then sailed for england in the month of june when we were about the north latitude    we had contrary wind for several days and the ship did not make in that time above six or seven miles strait course this made the captain exceeding fretful and peevish and i was very sorry to hear gods most holy name often blasphemed by him one day as he was in that impious mood a young gentleman on board who was a passenger reproached him and said he acted wrong for we ought to be thankful to god for all things as we were not in want of any thing on board and though the wind was contrary for us yet it was fair for some others who perhaps stood in more need of it than we i immediately seconded this young gentleman with some boldness and said we had not the least cause to murmur for that the lord was better to us than we deserved and that he had done all things well i expected that the captain would be veay angry with me for speaking but he replied not a word however before that time on the following day being the   st of june much to our great joy and astonishment we saw the providential hand of our benign creator whose ways with his blind creatures are past finding out the preceding night i dreamed that i saw a boat immediately off the starboard main shrouds and exactly at half past one oclock the following day at noon while i was below just as we had dined in the cabin the man at the helm cried out a boat which brought my dream that instant into my mind i was the first man that jumped on the deck and looking from the shrouds onward according to my dream i descried a little boat at some distance but as the waves were high it was as much as we could do sometimes to discern her we however stopped the ships way and the boat which was extremely small came alongside with eleven miserable men whom we took on board immediately to all human appearance these people must have perished in the course of one hour or less the boat being small it barely contained them when we took them up they were half drowned and had no victuals compass water or any other necessary whatsoever and had only one bit of an oar to steer with and that right before the wind so that they were obliged to trust entirely to the mercy of the waves as soon as we got them all on board they bowed themselves on their knees and with hands and voices lifted up to heaven thanked god for their deliverance and i trust that my prayers were not wanting amongst them at the same time this mercy of the lord quite melted me and i recollected his words which i faw thus verified in the  0 th psalm o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endures for ever hungry and thirsty their souls fainted in them they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distressess and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation o that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfies the longing soul and silleth the hungry soul with goodness  such as sit in dardness and in the shadow of death  then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep whosoever is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the lord  the poor distressed captain said that the lord is good for seeing that i am not fit to die he therefore gave me a space of time to repent i was very glad to hear this expression and took an opportunity when convenient of talking to him on the providence of god they told us they were portuguese and were in a brig loaded with corn which shifted that morning at five oclock owing to which the vessel sunk that instant with two of the crew and how these eleven got into the boat which was lashed to the deck not one of them could tell we provided them with every necessary and brought them all safe to london and i hope the lord gave them repentance unto life eternal  i was happy once more amongst my friends and brethren till november when my old friend the celebrated doctor irving bought a remarkable sine sloop about   0 tons he had a mind for a new adventure in cultivating a plantation at jamaica and the musquito shore asked me to go with him and said that he would trust me with his estate in preference to any one by the advice therefore of my friends i accepted of the offer knowing that the harvest was fully ripe in those parts and hoped to be an instrument under god of bringing some poor sinner to my well beloved master jesus christ before i embarked i found with the doctor four masquito indians who were chiefs in their own country and were brought here by some english traders for some selfish ends one of them was the musquito kings son a youth of about eighteen years of age and whilst he was here he was baptized by the name of george they were going back at the governments expense after having been in england about twelve months during which they learned to speak pretty good english when i came to talk to them about eight days before we sailed i was very much mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches since they were here to be baptized nor was any attention paid to their morals i was very sorry for this mock christianity and had just an opportunity to take some of them once to church before we sailed we embarked in the month of november      on board of the sloop morning star captain david miller and sailed for jamaica in our passage i took all the pains that i could to instruct the indian prince in the doctrines of christianity of which he was entirely ignorant and to my great joy he was quite attentive and received with gladness the truths that the lord enabled me to set forth to him i taught him in the compass of eleven days all the letters and he could put even two or three of them together and spell them i had foxs martyrology with cuts and he used to be very fond of looking into it and would ask many questions about the papal cruelties he saw depicted there which i explained to him i made such progress with this youth especially in religion that when i used to go to bed at different hours of the night if he was in his bed he would get up on purpose to go to prayer with me without any other clothes than his shirt and before he would eat any of his meals amongst the gentlemen in the cabin he would sirst come to me to pray as he called it i was well pleased at this and took great delight in him and used much supplication to god for his conversion i was in full hope of seeing daily every appearance of that change which i could wish not knowing the devices of satan who had many of his emissaries to sow his tares as fast as i sowed the good seed and pull down as fast as i built up thus we went on nearly four fifths of our passage when satan at last got the upper hand some of his messengers seeing this poor heathen much advanced in piety began to ask him whether i had converted him to christianity laughed and made their jest at him for which i rebuked them as much as i could but this treatment caused the prince to halt between two opinions some of the true sons of belial who did not believe that there was any hereafter told him never to fear the devil for there was none existing and if ever he came to the prince they desired he might be sent to them thus they teazed the poor innocent youth so that he would not learn his book any more he would not drink nor carouse with these ungodly actors nor would he be with me even at prayers this grieved me very much i endeavored to persuade him as well as i could but he would not come and entreated him very much to tell me his reasons for acting thus at last he asked me how comes it that all the white men on board who can read and write and observe the sun and know all things yet swear lie and get drunk only excepting yourself i answered him the reason was that they did not fear god and that if any one of them died so they could not go to or be happy with god he replied that if these persons went to hell he would go to hell too i was sorry to hear this and as he sometimes had the toothache and also some other persons in the ship at the same time i asked him if their toothache made his easy he said no then i told him if he and these people went to hell together their pains would not make his any lighter this answer had great weight with him it depressed his spirits much and he became ever after during the passage fond of being alone when we were in the latitude of martinico and near making the land one morning we had a brisk gale of wind and carrying too much sail the mainmast went over the side many people were then all about the deck and the yards masts and rigging came tumbling all about us yet there was not one of us in the least hurt although some were within a hairs breadth of being killed and particularly i saw two men who by the providential hand of god were most miraculously preserved from being smashed to pieces on the fifth of january we made antigua and montserrat and ran along the rest of the islands and on the fourteenth we arrived at jamaica one sunday while we were there i took the musquito prince george to church where he saw the sacrament administered when we came out we saw all kinds of people almost from the church door for the space of half a mile down to the waterside buying and selling all kinds of commodities and these acts afforded me great matter of exhortation to this youth who was much astonished our vessel being ready to sail for the musquito shore i went with the doctor on board a guineaman to purchase some slaves to carry with us and cultivate a plantation and i chose them all my own countrymen on the twelfth of february we sailed from jamaica and on the eighteenth arrived at the musquito shore at a place called dupeupy all our indian guests now after i had admonished them and a few cases of liquor given them by the doctor took an affectionate leave of us and went ashore where they were met by the musquito king and we never saw one of them afterward we then sailed to the southward of the shore to a place called cape gracias a dios where there was a large lagoon or lake which received the emptying of two or three very fine large rivers and abounded much in fish and land tortoise some of the native indians came on board of us here and we used them well and told them we were come to dwell amongst them which they seemed pleased at so the doctor and i with some others went with them ashore and they took us to different places to view the land in order to choose a place to make a plantation of we fixed on a spot near a rivers bank in a rich soil and having got our necessaries out of the sloop we began to clear away the woods and plant different kinds of vegetables which had a quick growth while we were employed in this manner our vessel went northward to black river to trade while she was there a spanish guarda costa met with and took her this proved very hurtful and a great embarrassment to us however we went on with the culture of the land we used to make fires every night all around us to keep off wild beasts which as soon as it was dark set up a most hideous roaring our habitation being far up in the woods we frequently saw different kinds of animals but none of them ever hurt us except poisonous snakes the bite of which the doctor used to cure by giving to the patient as soon as possible about half a tumbler of strong rum with a good deal of cayenne pepper in it in this manner he cured two natives and one of his own slaves the indians were exceedingly fond of the doctor and they had good reason for it for i believe they never had such an useful man amongst them they came from all quarters to our dwelling and some woolwow or flatheaded indians who lived fifty or sixty miles above our river and this side of the south sea brought us a good deal of silver in exchange for our goods the principal articles we could get from our neighboring indians were turtle oil and shells little silk grass and some provisions but they would not work at any thing for us except fishing and a few times they assisted to cut some trees down in order to build us houses which they did exactly like the africans by the joint labor of men women and children i do not recollect any of them to have had more than two wives these always accompanied their husbands when they came to our dwelling and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us and always squatted down behind their husbands whenever we gave them any thing to eat the men and their wives eat separate i never saw the least sign of incontinence amongst them the women are ornamented with beads and fond of painting themselves the men also paint even to excess both their faces and shirts their favorite color is red the women generally cultivate the ground and the men are all fishermen and canoe makers upon the whole i never met any nation that were so simple in their manners as these people or had so little ornament in their houses neither had they as i ever could learn one word expressive of an oath the worst word i ever heard amongst them when they were quarrelling was one that they had got from the english which was you rascal i never saw any mode of worship among them but in this they were not worse than their european brethren or neighbors for i am sorry to say that there was not one white person in our dwelling nor any where else that i saw in different places i was at on the shore that was better or more pious than those unenlightened indians but they either worked or slept on sundays and to my sorrow working was too much sundays employment with ourselves so much so that in some length of time we really did not know one day from another this mode of living laid the foundation of my decamping at last the natives are well made and warlike and they particularly boast of having never been conquered by the spaniards they are great drinkers of strong liquors when they can get them we used to distill rum from pine apples which were very plentiful here and then we could not get them away from our place yet they seemed to be singular in point of honesty above any other nation i was ever amongst the country being hot we lived under an open shed where we had all kinds of goods without a door or a lock to any one article yet we slept in safety and never lost any thing or were disturbed this surprised us a good deal and the doctor myself and others used to say if we were to lie in that manner in europe we should have our throats cut the first night the indian governor goes once in a certain time all about the province or district and has a number of men with him as attendants and assistants he settles all the differences among the people like the judge here and is treated with very great respect he took care to give us timely notice before he came to our habitation by sending his stick as a token for rum sugar and gunpowder which we did not refuse sending and at the same time we made the utmost preparation to receive his honor and his train when he came with his tribe and all our neighboring chieftians we expected to sind him a grave reverend judge solid and sagacious but instead of that before he and his gang came in sight we heard them very clamorous and they even had plundered some of our good neighboring indians having intoxicated themselves with our liquor when they arrived we did not know what to make of our new guests and would gladly have dispensed with the honor of their company however having no alternative we feasted them plentifully all the day till the evening when the governor getting quite drunk grew very unruly and struck one of our most friendly chiefs who was our nearest neighbor and also took his goldlaced hat from him at this a great commotion taken place and the doctor interfered to make peace as we could all understand one another but to no purpose and at last they became so outrageous that the doctor fearing he might get into trouble left the house and made the best of his way to the nearest wood leaving me to do as well as i could among them i was so enraged with the governor that i could have wished to have seen him tied fast to a tree and flogged for his behavior but i had not people enough to cope with his party i therefore thought of a stratagem to appease the riot recollecting a passage i had read in the life of columbus when he was amongst the indians in mexico or peru where on some occasion he frightened them by telling them of certain events in the heavens i had recourse to the same expedient and it succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations when i had formed my determination i went in the midst of them and taking hold of the governor i pointed up to the heavens i menaced him and the rest i told them god lived there and that he was angry with them and they must not quarrel so that they were all brothers and if they did not leave off and go away quietly i would take the book pointing to the bible read and tell god to make them dead this operated on them like magic  the clamor immediately ceased and i gave them some rum and a few other things after which they went away peaceably and the governor afterward gave our neighbor who was called captain plasmyah his hat again when the doctor returned he was exceedingly glad at my success in thus getting rid of our troublesome guests the musquito people within our vicinity out of respect to the doctor myself and his people made entertainments of the grand kind called in their tongue tourri or dryckbot the english of this expression is a feast of drinking about of which it seems a corruption of language the drink consisted of pine apples roasted and casades chewed or beaten in mortars which after lying some time ferments and becomes so strong as to intoxicate when drank in any quantity we had timely notice given to us of the entertainment a white family whithin five miles of us told us how the drink was made and i and two others went before the time to the village where the mirth was appointed to be held and there we saw the whole art of making the drink and also the kind of animals that were to be eaten there i cannot say the sight of either the drink or the meat were enticing to me they had some thousands of pine apples roasting which they squeezed dirt and all into a canoe they had there for the purpose the casade drink was in beef barrels and other vessels and looked exactly like hogwash men women and children were thus employed in roasting the pine apples and squeezing them with their hands for sood they had many land torpins or tortoises some dried turtle and three large alligators alive and tied fast to the trees i asked the people what they were going to do with these alligators and i was told they were to be eaten i was much surprised at this and went home not a little disgusted at the preparations when the day of the feast was come we took some rum with us and went to the appointed place where we found a great assemblage of these people who received us very kindly the mirth had begun before we came and they were dancing with music and the musical instruments were nearly the same as those of any other sable people but as i thought much less melodious than any other nation i ever knew they had many curious gestures in dancing and a variety of motions and postures of their bodies which to me were in no wise attracting the males danced by themselves and the females also by themselves as with us the doctor showed his people the example by immediately joining the womens party though not by their choice on perceiving the women disgusted he joined the males at night there were great illuminations by setting fire to many pine trees while the dryckbot went round merrily by calabashes or gourds but the liquor might more justly be called eating than drinking one owden the oldest father in the vicinity was dressed in a strange and terrifying form around his body were skins adorned with different kinds of feathers and he had on his head a very large and high headpiece in the form of a grenadiers cap with prickles like a porcupine and he made a certain noise which resembled the cry of an alligator our people skipped amongst them out of complaisance though some could not drink of their tourrie but our rum met with customers enough and was soon gone the alligators were killed and some of them roasted their manner of roasting is by digging a hole in the earth and filling it with wood which they burn to coal and then they lay sticks across on which they set the meat i had a raw piece of the alligator in my hand it was very rich i thought it looked like fresh salmon and it had a most fragrant smell but i could not eat any of it this merrymaking at last ended without the least discord in any person in the company although it was made up of different nations and complexions  the rainy season came on here about the latter end of may which continued till august very heavily so that the rivers were overflowed and our provisions then in the ground were washed away i thought this was in some measure a judgment upon us for working on sundays and it hurt my mind very much i often wished to leave this place and sail for europe for our mode of procedure and living in this heathenish form was very irksome to me the word of god says what does it avail a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul this was much and heavily impressed on my mind and though i did not know how to speak to the doctor for my discharge it was disagreeable for me to stay any longer but about the middle of june i took courage enough to ask him for it he was very unwilling at sirst to grant my request but i gave him so many reasons for it that at last he consented to my going and gave me the following certificate of my behavior  the bearer gustavus vassa has served me several years with strict honesty sobriety and fidelity i can therefore with justice recommend him for these qualifications and indeed in every respect i consider him as an excellent servant i do hereby certify that he always behaved well and that he is perfectly trustworthy  charles irving musquito shore june          though i was much attached to the doctor i was happy when he consented i got every thing ready for my departure and hired some indians with a large canoe to carry me off all my poor countrymen the slaves when they heard of my leaving them were very sorry as i had always treated them with care and affection and did every thing i could to comfort the poor creatures and render their condition easy having taken leave of my old friends and companions on the   th of june accompanied by the doctor i left that spot of the world and went southward above twenty miles along the river there i found a sloop the captain of which told me he was going to jamaica having agreed for my passage with him and one of the owners who was also on board named hughes the doctor and i parted not without shedding tears on both sides the vessel then sailed along the river till night when she stopped in a lagoon within the same river during the night a schooner belonging to the same owners came in and as she was in want of hands hughes the owner of the sloop asked me to go in the schooner as a sailor and said he would give me wages i thanked him but i said i wanted to go to jamaica he then immediately changed his tone and swore and abused me very much and asked how i came to be freed i told him and said that i came into that vicinity with dr irving whom he had seen that day this account was of no use he still swore exceedingly at me and cursed the master for a fool that sold me my freedom and the doctor for another in letting me go from him then he desired me to go in the schooner or else i should not go out of the sloop as a freeman i said this was very hard and begged to be put on shore again but he swore that i should not i said i had been twice amongst the turks yet had never seen any such usage with them and much less could i have expected any thing of this kind among the christians this incensed him exceedingly and with a volley of oaths and imprecations he replied christians damn you you are one of st pauls men but by g  except you have st pauls or st peters faith and walk upon the water to the shore you shall not go out of the vessel which i now learnt was going amongst the spaniards toward carthagena where he swore he would sell me i simply asked him what right he had to sell me but without another word he made some of his people tie ropes round each of my ancles and also to each wrist and another rope round my body and hoisted me up without letting my feet touch or rest upon any thing thus i hung without any crime committed and without judge or jury merely because i was a free man and could not by the law get any redress from a white person in those parts of the world i was in great pain from my situation and cried and begged very hard for some mercy but all in vain my tyrant in a great rage brought a musket out of the cabin and loaded it before me and the crew and swore that he would shoot me if i cried any more i had now no alternative i therefore remained silent seeing not one white man on board who said a word on my behalf i hung in that manner from between ten and eleven oclock at night till about one in the morning when finding my cruel abuser fast asleep i begged some of his slaves to slack the rope that was round my body that my feet might rest on something this they did at the risk of being cruelly used by their master who beat some of them severely at first for not tying me when he commanded them whilst i remained in this condition till between five and six oclock next morning i trust i prayed to god to forgive this blasphemer who cared not what he did but when he got up out of his sleep in the morning was of the very fame temper and disposition as when he left me at night when they got up the anchor and the vessel was getting under way i once more cried and begged to be released and now being fortunately in the way of their hoisting the sails they released me when i was let down i spoke to one mr cox a carpenter whom i knew on board on the impropriety of this conduct he also knew the doctor and the good opinion he ever had of me this man then went to the captain and told him not to carry me away in that manner that i was the doctors steward who regarded me very highly and would resent this usage when he should come to know it on which he desired a young man to put me ashore in a small canoe i brought with me this sound gladdened my heart and i got hastily into the canoe and set off whilst my tyrant was down in the cabin but he soon spied me out when i was not above thirty or forty yards from the vessel and running upon the deck with a loaded musket in his hand he presented it at me and swore heavily and dreadfully that he would shoot me that instant if i did not come back on board as i knew the wretch would have done as he said without hesitation i put back to the vessel again but as the good lord would have it just as i was alongside he was abusing the captain for letting me go from the vessel which the captain returned and both of them soon got into a very great heat the young man that was with me now got out of the canoe the vessel was sailing on fast with a smooth sea and i then thought it was neck or nothing so at that instant i set off again for my life in the canoe toward the shore and fortunately the confusion was so great amongst them on board that i got out of the reach of the musket shot unnoticed while the vessel sailed on with a fair wind a different way so that they could not overtake me without tacking but even before that could be done i should have been on shore which i soon reached with many thanks to god for this unexpected deliverance i then went and told the other owner who lived near that shore with whom i had agreed for my passage of the usage i had met with he was very much astonished and appeared very sorry for it after treating me with kindness he gave me some refreshment and three heads of roasted indian corn for a voyage of about eighteen miles south to look for another vessel he then directed me to an indian chief of a district who was also the musquito admiral and had once been at our dwelling after which i set off with the canoe across a large lagoon alone for i could not get any one to assist me though i was much jaded and had pains in my bowels by means of the rope i had hung by the night before i was therefore at different times unable to manage the canoe for the paddling was very laborious however a little before dark i got to my destined place where some of the indians knew me and received me kindly i asked for the admiral and they conducted me to his dwelling he was glad to see me and refreshed me with such things as the place afforded and i had a hammock to fleep in they acted toward me more like christians than those whites i was amongst the last night though they had been baptized i told the admiral i wanted to go to the next port to get a vessel to carry me to jamaica and requested him to send the canoe back which i then had for which i was to pay him he agreed with me and sent five able indians with a large canoe to carry my things to my intended place about fifty miles and we set off the next morning when we got out of the lagoon and went along shore the sea was so high that the canoe was oftentimes very near being filled with water we were obliged to go ashore and drag across different necks of land we were also two nights in the swamps which swarmed with musquito flies and they proved troublesome to us this tiresome journey of land and water ended however on the third day to my great joy and i got on board of a sloop commanded by one captain jenning she was then partly loaded and he told me he was expecting daily to sail for jamaica and having agreed with me to work my passage i went to work accordingly i was not many days on board before we sailed but to my sorrow and disappointment though used to such tricks we went to the southward along the musquito shore instead of steering for jamaica i was compelled to assist in cutting a great deal of mahogany wood on the shore as we coasted along it and load the vessel with it before she sailed this fretted me much but as i did not know how to help myself among these deceivers i thought patience was the only remedy i had left and even that was forced there was much hard work and little victuals on board except by good luck we happened to catch turtles on this coast there was also a particular kind of fish called manatee which is most excellent eating and the flesh is more like beef than fish the scales are as large as a shilling and the skin thicker than i ever saw that of any other fish within the brackish waters along shore there were likewise vast numbers of alligators which made the fish scarce i was on board this sloop sixteen days during which in our coasting we came to another place where there was a smaller sloop called the indian queen commanded by one john baker he also was an englishman and had been a long time along the shore trading for turtle shells and silver and had got a good quantity of each on board he wanted some hands very much and understanding i was a freeman and wanted to go to jamaica he told me if he could get one or two that he would sail immediately for that island he also pretended to show me some marks of attention and respect and promised to give me fortyfive shillings sterling a a month if i would go with him i thought this much better than cutting wood for nothing i therefore told the other captain that i wanted to go to jamaica in the other vessel but he would not listen to me and seeing me resolved to go in a day or two he got the vessel to sail intending to carry me away against my will this treatment mortified me extremely i immediately according to an agreement i had made with the captain of the indian queen called for her boat which was lying near us and it came alongside and by the means of a north pole shipmate which i met with in the sloop i was in i got my things into the boat and went on board of the indian queen july the  0th a few days after i was there we got all things ready and sailed but again to my great mortification this vessel still went to the south nearly as far as carthagena trading along the coast instead of going to jamaica as the captain had promised me and what was worst of all he was a very cruel and bloodyminded man and was a horrid blasphemer among others he had a white pilot one stoker whom he beat often as severely as he did some negroes he had on board one night in particular after he had beaten this man most cruelly he put him into the boat and made two negroes row him to a desolate key or small island and he loaded two pistols and swore bitterly that he would shoot the negroes if they brought stoker on board again there was not the least doubt but that he would do as he said and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate but when the captain was asleep the two negroes took a blanket and carried it to the unfortunate stoker which i believe was the means of saving his life from the annoyance of insects a great deal of entreaty was used with the captain the next day before he would consent to let stoker come on board and when the poor man was brought on board he was very ill from his situation during the night and he remained so till he was drowned a little time after as we sailed southward we came to many uninhabited islands which were overgrown with fine large cocoa nuts as i was very much in want of provisions i brought a boat load of them on board which lasted me and others for several weeks and afforded us many a delicious repast in our scarcity one day before this i could not help observing the providential hand of god that ever supplied all our wants though in the ways and manner we know not i had been a whole day without food and made signals for boats to come off but in vain i therefore earnestly prayed to god for relief in my need and at the close of the evening i went off the deck just as i laid down i heard a noise on the deck and not knowing what it meant i went directly on the deck again when what should i see but a fine large fish about seven or eight pounds which had jumped aboard i took it and admired with thanks the good hand of god and what i considered as not less extraordinary the captain who was very avaricious did not attempt to take it from me there being only him and i on board for the rest were all gone ashore trading sometimes the people did not come off for some days this used to fret the captain and then he would vent his fury on me by beating me or making me feel in other cruel ways one day especially in his wild wicked and mad career after striking me several times with different things and once across my mouth even with a red burning stick out of the fire he got a barrel of gunpowder on the deck and swore that he would blow up the vessel i was then at my wits end and earnestly prayed to god to direct me the head was out of the barrel and the captain took a lighted stick out of the fire to blow himself and me up because there was a vessel then in sight coming in which he supposed was a spaniard and he was afraid of falling into their hands seeing this i got an axe unnoticed by him and placed myself between him and the powder having resolved in myself as soon as he attempted to put the fire in the barrel to chop him down that instant i was more than an hour in this situation during which he struck me often still keeping the fire in his hand for this wicked purpose i really should have thought myself justifiable in any other part of the world if i had killed him and prayed to god who gave me a mind which rested solely on himself i prayed for resignation that his will might be done and the following two portions of his holy word which occured to my mind buoyed up my hope and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man he has determined the times before appointed and set bounds to our habitations acts xvii    and who is there among you that fears the lord that obeys the voice of his servant that walks in darkness and has no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god isaiah l  0 and thus by the grace of god i was enabled to do i found him a present help in the time of need and the captains fury began to subside as the night approached but i found  that he who cannot stem his angers tide  does a wild horse without a bridle ride   the next morning we discovered that the vessel which had caused such a fury in the captain was an english sloop they soon came to an anchor where we were and to my no small surprise learned that doctor irving was on board of her on his way from the musquito shore to jamaica i was for going immediately to see this old master and friend but the captain would not suffe me to leave the vessel i then inform the doctor by letter how i was treated and begged that he would take me out  the sloop but he informed me that  was not in his power as he was a pasenger himself but he sent me so rum and sugar for my own use i no learned that after i had left the esta which i managed for this gentleman on the musquito shore during which the slaves were well fed and comfortable a white overseer had supplied my place this man through inhumanity and illjudged avarice beat and cut the poor slaves most unmercifully and the consequence was that every one got into a large puriogua canoe and endeavored to escape but not knowing where to go or how to manage the canoe they were all drowned in consequence of which the doctors plantation was left uncultivated and he was now returning to jamaica to purchase more slaves and stock it again  on the   th of october the indian queen arrived at kingston in jamaica when we were unloaded i demanded my wages which amounted to eight pounds five shillings sterling but captain baker refused to give me one farthing although it was the hardestearned money i ever worked for in my life i found out doctor irving upon this and acquainted him of the captains knavery he did all he could to help me to get my money and we went to every magistrate in kingston and there were nine but they all refused to do any thing for me and said my oath could not be admitted against a white man nor was this all for baker threatened that he would beat me severely if he could catch me for attempting to demand my money and this he would have done but that i got by means of doctor irving under the protection of captain douglas of the squirrel man of war i thought this exceeding hard usage though indeed i found it to be too much the practice there to pay free negro men for their labor in this manner  one day i went with a free negroe tailor named joe diamond to one mr cochran who was indebted to him some trifling sum and the man not being able to get his money began to murmur the other immediately took a horsewhip to pay him with it but by the help of a good pair of heels the tailor got off such oppressions as these made me seek for a vessel to get off the island as fast as i could and by the mercy of god i found a ship in november bound for england when i embarked with a convoy after having taken a last farewell of doctor irving when i left jamaica he was employed in refining sugars and some months after my arrival in england i learned with much sorrow that this my amiable friend was dead owing to his having eaten some poisoned fish  we had many very heavy gales of wind in our passage in the course of which no material incident occurred except that an american privateer falling in with the fleet was captured and set sire to by his majestys ship the squirrel  on january the seventh      we arrived at plymouth i was happy once more to tread upon english ground and after passing some little time at plymouth and exeter among some pious friends whom i was happy to see i went to london with a heart replete with thanks to god for past mercies  chap xii different transactions of the authors life till the present time  his application to the late bishop of london to be appointed a missionary to africa  some account of his share in the conduct of the late expedition to sierra leona  petition to the queen  conclusion  such were the various  which i was a witness to and the fertune i experienced until the year      since that period my life has been more uniform and the incidents of it fewer than in any other equal number of years preceding i therefore hasten to the conclusion of a narrative which i fear the reader may think already sufficiently tedious  i had suffered so many impositions in my commercial transactions in different parts of the world that i became heartily disgusted with the seafaring life and was determined not to return to it at least for some time i therefore once more engaged in service shortly after my return and continued for the most part in this situation until       soon after my arrival in london i saw a remarkable circumstance relative to african complexion which i thought so extraordinary that i beg leave just to mention it a white negro woman that i had formerly seen in london and other parts had married a white man by whom she had three boys and they were every one mullattoes and yet they had fine light hair in      i served governor macnamara who had been a considerable time on the coast of africa in the time of my service i used to ask frequently other servants to join me in family prayer but this only excited their mockery however the governor understanding that i was of a religious turn wished to know what religion i was of i told him i was a protestant of the church of england agreeable to the thirtynine articles of that church and that whomsoever i found to preach according to that doctrine those i would hear a few days after this we had some more discourse on the same subject when he said he would if i chose as he thought i might be of service in converting my countrymen to the gospel faith get me sent out as missionary to africa i at first refused going and told him how i had been served on a like occasion by some white people the last voyage i went to jamaica when i attempted if it were the will of god to be the means of converting the indian prince and said i supposed they would serve me worse than alexander the coppersmith did st paul if i should attempt to go amongst them in africa he told me not to fear for he would apply to the bishop of london to get me ordained on these terms i consented to the governors proposal to go to africa in hope of doing good if possible amongst my countrymen so in order to have me sent out properly we immediately wrote the following letters to the late bishop of london  to the right reverend father in god robert lord bishop of london the memorial of gustavus vassa shows that your memorialist is a native of africa and has a knowledge of the manners and customs of the inhabitants of that country  that your memorialist has resided in different parts of europe for twentytwo years last past and embraced the christian faith in the year       that your memorialist is desirous of returning to africa as a missionary if encouraged by your lordship in hopes of being able to prevail upon his countrymen to become christians and your memorialist is the more induced to undertake the same from the success that has attended the like undertakings when encouraged by the portugeuse through their different settlements on the coast of africa and also by the dutch both governments encouraging the blacks who by their education are qualified to undertake the same and are found more proper than european clergymen unacquainted with the language and customs of the country  your memorialists only motive for soliciting the office of a missionary is that he may be a means under god of reforming his countrymen and persuading them to embrace the christian religion therefore your memorialist humbly prays your lordships encouragement and support in the undertaking  gustavas vassa at mr guthries tailor no    hedgelane  my lord i have resided near seven years on the coast of africa for most part of the time as commanding officer from the knowledge i have of the country and its inhabitants i am inclined to think that the within plan will be attended with great success if countenanced by your lordship i beg leave further to represent to your lordship that the like attempts when encouraged by other governments have met with uncommon success and at this very time i know a very respectable character a black priest at cape coast castle i know the within named gustavus vassa and believe him a moral good man  i have the honor to be my lord your lordships humble and obedient servant matt macnamara grove   th march       this letter was also accompanied by the following from doctor wallace who had resided in africa for many years and whose sentiments on the subject of an african mission were the same with governor macnamaras  march         my lord i have resided near five years on senegambia on the coast of africa and have had the honor of silling very considerable employments in that province i do approve of the within plan and think the undertaking very laudable and proper and that it deserves your lordships protection and encouragement in which case it must be attended with the intended success  i am my lord your lordships humble and obedient servant thomas wallace   with these letters i waited on the bishop by the governors desire and presented them to his lordship he received me with much condescension and politeness but from some certain scruples of delicacy and saying the bishops were not of opinion of sending a new missionary to africa he declined to ordain me  my sole motive for thus dwelling on this transaction or inserting these papers is the opinion which gentlemen of sense and education who are acquainted with africa entertain of the probability of converting the inhabitants of it to the faith of jesus christ if the attempt were countenanced by the legislature  shortly after this i left the governor and served a nobleman in the dorsetshire militia whith whom i was encamped at coxheath for some time but the operations there were too minute and uninteresting to make a detail of  in the year      i visited eight counties in wales from motives of curiosity while i was in that part of the country i was led to go down into a coalpit in shropshire but my curiosity nearly cost me my life for while i was in the pit the coals fell in and buried one poor man who was not far from me upon this i got out as fast as i could thinking the furface of the earth the safest part of it  in the spring of      i thought of visiting old ocean again in consequence of this i embarked as steward on board a fine new ship called the london commanded by martin hopkin and sailed for new york i admired this city very much it is large and well built and abounds with provisions of all kinds while we lay here a circumstance happened which i thought extremely singular  one day a malefactor was to be executed on a gallows but with a condition that if any woman having nothing on but her shift married the man under the gallows his life was to be saved this extraordinary privilege was claimed a woman presented herself and the marriage ceremony was performed  our ship having got laden were turned to london in january      when she was ready again for another voyage the captain being an agreeable man i sailed with him from hence in the spring march      for philadelphia on the  th of april we took our departure from the landsend with a pleasant gale and about nine oclock that night the moon shone bright and the sea was smooth while our ship was going free by the wind at the rate of about four or five miles an hour  at this time another ship was going nearly as fast as we on the opposite point meeting us right in the teeth yet none on board observed either ship until we struck each other forcibly head and head to the astonishment and consternation of both crews she did us much damage but i believe we did her more for when we passed by each other which we did very quickly they called to us to bring to and hoist out our boat but we had enough to do to mind ourselves and in about eight minutes we saw no more of her we refitted as well as we could the next day and proceeded on our voyage and in may arrived at philadelphia  i was very glad to see this favorite old town once more and my pleasure was much increased in seeing the worthy quakers freeing and easing the burdens of many of my oppressed african brethren it rejoiced my heart when one of these friendly people took me to see a free school they had erected for every denomination of black people whose minds are cultivated here and forwarded to virtue and thus they are made useful members of the community does not the success of this practice say loudly to the planters in the language of scripture  go ye and do likewise  in october      i was accompanied by some of the africans and presented this address of thanks to the gentlemen called friends or quakers in gracechurchcourt lombard street  gentlemen  by reading your book entitled a caution to great britain and her colonies concerning the calamitous state of the enslaved negroes we part of the poor oppressed needy and much degraded negroes desire to approach you with this address of thanks with our inmost love and warmest acknowledgment and with the deepest sense of your benevolence unwearied labor and kind interposition toward breaking the yoke of slavery and to administer a little comfort and ease to thousands and tens of thousands of very grievously afflicted and too heavy burdened negroes  gentlemen could you by perseverance at last be enabled under god to lighten in any degree the heavy burden of the afflicted no doubt it would in some measure be the possible means under god of saving the souls of many of the oppressors and if so sure we are that the god whose eyes are ever upon all his creatures and always rewards every true act of virtue and regards the prayers of the oppressed will give to you and yours those blessings which it is not in our power to express or conceive but which we as a part of those captivated oppressed and afflicted people most earnestly wish and pray for  these gentlemen received us very kindly with a promise to exert themselves on behalf of the oppressed africans and we parted  while in town i chanced once to be invited to a quakers wedding the simple and yet expressive mode used at their solemnizations is worthy of note the following is the true form of it  after the company have met they have seasonable exhortations by several of the members the bride and bridegroom stand up and taking each other by the hand in a solemn manner the  declares to this purpose  friends in the fear of the lord and in the presence of this assembly whom i desire to be my witnesses i take this my friend m n to be my wife promising through divine assistance to be unto her a loving and faithful husband till death separate us and the woman makes the like declaration then the two first sign their names to the record and as many more witnesses as have a mind i had the honor to subscribe mine to a register in gracechurchcourt lombard street  my hand is ever free  if any female debonair wishes to obtain it this mode i recommend  we returned to london in august and our ship not going immediately to sea i shipped as a steward in an american ship called the harmony captain john willet and left london in march      bound to philadelphia eleven days after sailing we carried our foremast away we had a nine weeks passage which caused our trip not to succeed well the market for our goods proving bad and to make it worse my commander began to play me the like tricks as others too often practice on free negroes in the west indies but i thank god i found many friends here who in some measure prevented him on my return to london in august i was very agreeably surprised to find that the benevolence of government had adopted the plan of some philanthropic individuals to send the africans from hence to their native quarter and that some vessels were then engaged to carry them to sierra leona an act which redounded to the honor of all concerned in its promotion and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing there was then in the city a select committee of gentlemen for the black poor to some of whom i had the honor of being known and as soon as they heard of my arrival they sent for me to the committee when i came there they informed me of the intention of government and as they seemed to think me qualified to superintend part of the undertaking they asked me to go with the black poor to africa i pointed out to them many objections to my going and particularly i expressed some difficulties on the account of the slave dealers as i would certainly oppose their traffic in the human species by every means in my power however these objections were overruled by the gentlemenof the committee who prevailed on me to consent to go and recommended me to the honorable commissioners ofhis majestys navy as a proper person to act as commissary for government in the intended expedition and they accordingly appointed me in november      to that office and gave me sufficient power to act for the government in the capacity of commissary having received my warrant and the following order  by the principal officers and commissioners of his majestys navy whereas you were directed by our warrant of the  th of last month to receive into your charge from mr joseph irwin the surplus provisions remaining of what was provided for the voyage as well as the provisions for the support of the black poor after the landing at sierra leona with the clothing tools and all other articles provided at governments expense and as the provisions were laid in at the rate of two months for the voyage and for four months afrer the landing but the number embarked being so much less than we expected whereby there may be a considerable surplus of provisions clothing etc these are in addition to former orders to direct and require you to appropriate or dispose of such surplus to the best advantage you can for the benefit of government keeping and rendering to us a faithful account of what you do herein and for your guidance in preventing any white persons going who are not intended to have the indulgence of being carried thither we send you herewith a list of those recommended by the committee for the balck poor as proper persons to be permitted to embark and acquaint you that you are not to suffer any others to go who do not produce a certificate from the committee for the black poor of their having their permission for it for which this shall be your warrant dated at the navyoffice january          j hinslow geo marsh w palmer  to mr gustavus vassa commissary of provisions and stores for the black poor going to sierra leona i proceeded immediately to the executing of my duty on board the vessels destined for the voyage where i continued till the march following  during my continuanee in the employment of government i was struck with the flagrant abuses committed by the agent and endeavored to remedy them but without effect one instance among many which i could produce may serve as a specimen government had ordered to be provided all necessaries slops as they are called included for   0 persons however not being able to muster more than     i was ordered to send the superfluous slops etc to the kings stores at portsmouth but when i demanded them for that purpose from the agent it appeared they had never been bought though paid for by government but that was not all government were not the only objects of peculation these poor people suffered infinitely more their accommodations were most wretched many of them wanted beds and many more clothing and other necessaries for the truth of this and much more i do not seek credit from my own assertion i appeal to the testimony of capt thompson of the nautilus who convoyed us to whom i applied in february      for a remedy when i had remonstrated to the agent in vain and even brought him to be a witness of the injustice and oppression i complained of i appeal also to a letter written by these wretched people so early as the beginning of the preceding january and published in the morning herald on the  th of that month signed by twenty of their chiefs  i could not silently suffer government to be thus cheated and my countrymen plundered and oppressed and even lest destitude of the necessaries for almost their existence i therefore informed the commissioners of the navy of the agents proceeding but my dismission was soon after procured by means of a gentleman in the city whom the agent conscious of his peculation had deceived by letter and who moreover empowered the same agent to receive on board at the government expense a number of persons as passengers contrary to the orders i received by this i suffered a considerable loss in my property however the commissioners were satisfied with my conduct and wrote to capt thompson expressing their opprobation of it  thus provided they proceeded on their voyage and at last worn out by treatment perhaps not the most mild and wasted by sickness brought on by want of medicine clothes bedding etc they reached sirrea leona just at at the commencement of the rains at that season of the year it is impossible to cultivate the lands their provisions therefore were exhausted before they could derive any benefit from agriculture and it is not surprising that many especially the lascars whose constitutions are very tender and who had been cooped up in ships from october to june and accommodated in the manner i have mentioned should be so wasted by their confinement as not long to survive it  thus ended my part of the longtalked of expedition to sierra leona an expedition which however unfortunate in the event was humane and politic in its design nor was its failure owing to government every thing was done on their part but there was evidently sufficient mismanagement attending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its success  i should not have been so ample in my account of this transaction had not the share i bore in it been made the subject of partial animadversion and even my dismission from my employment thought worthy of being made by some a matter of public triumph see the public advertiser july          the motives which might influence any person to descend to a petty contest with an obscure african and to seek gratification by his depression perhaps it is not proper here to inquire into or relate even if its detection were necessary to my vindication but i thank heaven it is not i wish to stand by my own integrity and not to shelter myself under the impropriety of another and i trust the behavior of the commissioners of the navy to me entitle me to make this assertion for after i had been dismissed march    i drew up a memorial thus  to the right honorable the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury the memorial and petition of gustavus vassa a black man late commissary to the black poor going to africa humbly shows that your lordships memorialist was by the honorable the commissioners of his majestys navy on the  th of december last appointed to the above employment by warrant from that board  that he accordingly proceeded to the execution of his duty on board of the vernon being one of the ships appointed to proceed to africa with the above poor  that your memorialist to his great grief and astonishment received a letter of dismission from the honorable commissioners of the navy by your lordships orders  that conscious of having acted with the most perfect fidelity and the greatest assiduity in discharging the trust reposed in him he is altogether at a loss to conceive the reasons of your lordships having altered the favorable opinion you were pleased to conceive of him sensible that your lordships would not proceed to so severe a measure without some apparent good cause he therefore has every reason to believe that his conduct has been grossly misrepresented to your lordships and he is the more confirmed in his opinion because by opposing measures of others concerned in the same expedition which tended to defeat your lordships humane intentions and to put the government to a very considerable additional expense he created a number of enemies whose misrepresentations he has too much reason to believe laid the foundation of his dismission unsupported by friends and unaided by the advantages of a liberal education he can only hope for redress from the justice of his cause in addition to the mortification of having been removed from his employment and the advantage which he reasonably might have expected to have derived therefrom he has had the misfortune to have sunk a considerable part of his little property in fitting himself out and in other expenses arising out of his situation an account of which he here annexes your memorialist will not trouble your lordships with a vindication of any part of his conduct because he knows not of what crimes he is accused he however earnestly entreats that you will be pleased to direct an inquiry into his behavior during the time he acted in the public service and if it be found that his dismission arose from salse representations he is confident that in your lordships justice he shall find redress  your petitioner therefore humbly prays that your lordships will take his case into consideration and that you will be pleased to order payment of the above referredto account amounting to   l  s and also the wages intended which is most humbly submitted  london may         the above petition was delivered into the hands of their lordships who were kind enough in the space of some few months afterward without hearing to order me  0l sterling  that is   l wages for the time upwards of four months i acted a faithful part in their service certainly the sum is more than a free negro would have had in the western colonies  from that period to the present time my life has passed in an even tenor and great part of my study and attention has been to assist in the cause of my much injured countrymen  march the   st      i had the honor of presenting the queen with a petition on behalf of my african brethren which was received most graciously by her majesty at the request of some of my most particular friends i take the liberty of inserting it here   to the queens most excellent majesty madam your majestys well known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which i plead  yet i do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress my sufferings although numerous are in a measure forgotten i supplicate your majestys compassion for millions of my african countrymen who groan under the lash of tyranny in the west indies  the oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there have at length reached the british legislature and they are now deliberating on its redress even several persons of property in slaves in the west indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust  and what is inhuman must ever be unwise  your majestys reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty surely the more extended the misery is the greater claim it has to your majestys compassion and the greater must be your majestys pleasure in administering to its relief  i presume therefore gracious queen to implore your interposition with your royal consort in favor of the wretched africans that by your majestys benevolent influence a period may now be put to their misery and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen and admitted to partake of the blessings of your majestys happy government so shall your majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity  and may the allbountiful creator shower on your majesty and the royal family every bleffing that this world can afford and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next  i am your majestys most dutiful and devoted servant to command gustavus vassa the oppressed ethiopian no    baldwins gardens the negro consolidated act made by the assembly of jamaica last year and the new act of amendment now in agitation there contain a proof of the existence of those charges that have been made against the planters relative to the tratment of their slaves  i hope to have the satisfaction of seeing the renovation of liberty and justice resting on the british government to vindicate the honor of our common nature these are concerns which do not perhaps belong to any particular office but to speak more seriously to every man of sentiment actions like these are the just and sure foundation of future fame a reversion though remote is coveted by some noble minds as a substantial good it is upon these grounds that i hope and expect the attention of gentlemen in power these are designs consonant to the elevation of their rank and the dignity of their stations they are ends suitable to the nature of a free and generous government and connected with views of empire and dominion suited to the benevolence and solid merit of the legislature it is a pursuit of substantial greatness  may the time come  at least the speculation to me is pleasing  when the sable people shall gratefully commemorate the auspicious era of extensive freedom then shall those persons granville sharp esquire the reverend thomas clarkson the reverend james ramsay our approved friends men of virtue are an honor to their country ornamental to human nature happy in themselves and benefactors to mankind particularly be named with praise and honor who generously proposed and stood forth in the cause of humanity liberty and good policy and brought to the car of the legislature designs worthy of royal patronage and adoption may heaven make the british senators the dispersers of light liberty and science to the uttermost parts of the earth then will be glory to god on the highest on earth peace and good will to men  glory honor peace etc to every soul of man that works good to the britons first because to them the gospel is preached and also to the nations those that honor their maker have mercy on the poor it is righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity and the wicked shall fall by their own wickedness may the blessings of the lord be upon the heads of all those who commiserated the cases of the oppressed negroes and the fear of god prolong their days and may their expectations be filled with gladness the liberal devise liberal things and by liberal things shall stand isaiah xxxii   they can say with pious job did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor job xxx     as the inhuman traffic of slavery is to be taken into the consideration of the british legislature i doubt not if a system of commerce was established in africa the demand for manufactures will most rapidly augment as the native inhabitants will insensibly adopt the british fashions manners customs etc in proportion to the civilization so will be the consumption of british manufactures  the wear and tear of a continent nearly twice as large as europe and rich in vegetable and mineral productions is much easier conceived than calculated  a case in point  it cost the aborigines of britain little or nothing in clothing etc the difference between their forefathers and the present generation in point of consumption is literally i  inite the supposition is most obvious it will be equally immense in africa  the same cause viz civilization will ever have the same effect  it is trading upon safe grounds a commercial intercourse with africa opens an inexhaustible source of wealth to the manufacturing interests of great britain and to all which the slave trade is an objection  if i am not misinformed the manufacturing interest is equal if not superior to the landed interest as to the value for reasons which will soon appear the abolition of slavery so diabolical will give a most rapid extension of manufactures which is totally and diametrically opposite to what some interested people assert  the manufactures of this country must and will in the nature and reason of things have a full and constant employ by supplying the african markets  population the bowels and surface of africa abound in valuable and useful returns the hidden treasures of centuries will be brought to light and into circulation industry enterprise and mining will have their full scope proportionably as they civilize in a word it lays open an endless field of commerce to the british manufactures and merchant adventurer the manufacturing interest and the general interests are synonymous the abolition of slavery would be in reality an universal good  tortures murder and every other imaginable barbarity and iniquity are practiced upon the poor slaves with impunity i hope the slave trade will be abolished i pray it may be an event at hand the great body of manusacturers uniting in the cause will considerably facilitate and expedite it and as i have already stated it is most substantially their interest and advantage and as such the nations at large except those persons concerned in the manufacturing neckyokes collars chains handcuffs legbolts drags thumbscrews iron muzzles and coffins cats scourges and other instruments of torture used in the slave trade in a short time one sentiment alone will prevail from motives of interest as well as justice and humanity europe contains one hundred and twenty millions of inhabitants query  how many millions does africa contain supposing the africans collectively and individually to expend  l a head in raiment and furniture yearly when civilized etc an immensity beyond the reach of imagination  this i conceive to be a theory founded upon facts and therefore an infallible one if the blacks were permitted to remain in their own country they would double themselves every fifteen years in proportion to such increase will be the demand for manufactures cotton and indigo grow spontaneously in most parts of africa a consideration this of no small consequence to the manufacturing towns of great britain it opens a most immense glorious and happy prospect  the clothing etc of a continent ten thousand miles in circumference and immensely rich in productions of every denomination in return for manufactures  i have only therefore to request the readers indulgence and conclude i am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this narrative i hope censure will be suspended when it is considered that it was written by one who was as unwilling as unable to adorn the plainness of truth by the coloring of imagination my life and fortune have been extremely chequered and my adventures various even those i have related are considerably abridged if any incident in this little work should appear uninteresting and trifling to most readers i can only say as my excuse for mentioning it that almost every event of my life made an impression on my mind and influenced my conduct i early accustomed myself to look for the hand of god in the minutest occurrence and to learn from it a lesson of morality and religion and in this light every circumstance i have related was to me of importance after all what makes any event important unless by its observation we become better and wiser and learn to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly before god to those who are possessed of this spirit there is scarcely any book or incident so trifling that does not afford some profit while to others the experience of ages seems of no use and even to pour out to them the treasures of wisdom is throwing the jewels of instruction away  the end
