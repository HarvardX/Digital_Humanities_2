my trust is in god an angel standing atop the upper half of a globe beneath a banner  a dissertation upon the nervous system to show its influence upon the soul  man can know little and yet he wants to know all things he is confined to a point of time in this life yet extends his views backwards and forwards through millions of ages till he is lost in eternity he is confined to some minute part of this globe yet while his feet stand on it his soul is traveling through the whole planetary system traversing the immensity of space till he is at last lost in infinity  published september    0  dissertation on the nervous system etc section i before we proceed it will be necessary to explain in a simple manner the nature of those bodily powers which constitute the very principles of life  the human body is sustained and kept alive by three principal powers which like the movements of a clock or watch cooperate and assist each other the first is the brain and nervous system proceeding from it the grand source of all sensation the second is the heart and arteries or blood vessels which give motion and circulation to the blood and the third is the stomach and bowels which prepare the aliment and supply nourishment for those as well as all parts of the body  in speaking of digestion it will be remarked that the stomach loses its power when deprived of nervous influence and we should here take notice that the regularity and vigor of the hearts motion chiefly depend on the same cause  as therefore the brain and nerves the heart and arteries and the stomach and bowels are the principal instruments of all sensation circulation nutrition life and motion and the very agents which govern and direct the whole animal machine it will be necessarily consequent that when any of them becomes disconcerted and put out of order the vital functions of the body depending upon them must then be unduly performed where one links broken the whole chains destroyed  such is the extraordinary sympathy and intercourse between those several organs that like so many little provinces allied by mutual interest not one of them can exercise its full power without the assistance and concurrence of the rest for as the heart and stomach cannot act without the assistance of the brain or the stomach digest without receiving a due quantity of blood from the heart so neither can the heart have sufficient force to keep up the circulation without a continual supply of nourishment from the stomach or even the brain itself exert its influence over those organs without being duly nourished by both although it will evidently appear that the nerves are the immediate organs of all vital motion and sensation and the medium by which impressions made on the body are instantly conveyed to the mind yet the precise manner by which this misterious intercourse is carried on remains a secret in nature with which perhaps we shall never be acquainted  so intimately connected are the body and soul and such their correspondence that impressions made on the one naturally influence the other with the like feelings thus by immoderate grief the digestive faculty of the stomach is impaired and taken away and by a blow on the head which injures the brain the soul is as it were dethroned and losing its empire over the body all sense and motion are instantly destroyed the soul or intellect whilst confined to the body that muddy vesture of decay is obliged to stoop to the state and condition of the nerves whose feelings are liable to alteration from a thousand accidental or unavoidable causes so as to occasion diseases or being totally abolished to produce instant death those as well as many other circumstances concur to prove that the faculties and disposition of the mind in a great measure depend on the bodily organs with which they cooperate and where those are changed from their natural state so are its appetites and operations  how different is the state of the body and soul when the vessels are empty or full viz after long fasting or a plentiful meal in the first the pulse is weak and unequal the complexion pale the body languid and the spirits desponding but after eating and the moderate use of wine the springs of life are wound up and the body and soul are restored to their native vigor  the consent between the brain and heart is remarkable for intense study or thinking quickens the pulse and a sudden fright will occasion palpetations or a convulsive struggle of the heart even sometimes to a mortal suffocation in both these cases the first impression is made on the brain and the heart like a faithful companion suffers by sympathy but whether the nerves act as tubes or vibrating cords like the strings of a musical instrument or whether they serve as conductors to some subtle fluid similar to that of electric fire we are wholly ignorant the brain seems therefore to the nerves what the heart is to the blood vessels or arteries for too violent a degree of action in the last will produce heat and increase circulation as may be observed after violent exercise or in the time of a fever in like manner when the power of the brain and nerves is too violently impressed on the body or soul their sensations will be rendered too quick and exquisite like the motion of a watch which becomes rapid and irregular when the main spring acts too strongly on the several wheels and subordinate movements  impressions made on the soul will often totally subdue those of the body and on the contrary such as are made on the body will remove those of the soul all which may supply an intelligent observer with useful hints in the cure of such diseases as have been unsuccessfully treated by medicines  religious doubts which perplex the soul with alternate hopes and fears a sedentary life or warm damp air all dispose the constitution to melancholy by weakening the nervous power those are the general causes of low spirits and acquired melancholy which always operate most powerfully on people of nice sensations whose pleasures and pains from overdelicacy of the nervous system are too exquisite for sense but the precise manner in which they produce their effects or why such causes do not always occasion similar consequences in such a particular state of the nerves is utterly unknown  where joy most revels grief does most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident those on the contrary of more clumsy organs who are possessed of little more than vegetablefeeling never experience the misery of nervous disorders but if they have less pleasure the account is balanced by their enduring less pain  we have already observed that the body and soul receive all their information by means of the brain and nerves and that by those they mutually converse and sympathize with each other hence it will follow that whenever those organs are injured and like unfaithful messengers do not truly execute their office and represent things as they are the patient will then be imposed upon by delusive perception and figure to herself things which have no existence but in her own distempered brain  they suppose that every one looks upon them with a malignant eye and puts the worst construction on what they say and do in short though they are industrious to torment themselves by means which appear ludicrous they experience substantial misery and are sometimes driven to desperation and suicide so that in the whole catalogue of earthly evils human nature cannot present an object more truly pitiable  what then shall be said of those who either from ambition or the view of gain stifle the feelings of honor and humanity and sordidly submit to form alliances which entail hereditary miseries on their posterity more grievous than death itself and who therefore instead of remembering the authors of their being with filial affection must behold them with indignation and sorrow  retirement and bodily ease are not destructive to the melancholy for whilst they sit still unemployed they become a prey to their own thoughts on the contrary exercise and severity of diet are beneficial for no one can think or study with the same attention when impressed with the disagreeable sensation of hunger or tormented with a raging tooth as when he is perfectly at ease  since we find that painful sensations applied to the body or mind often destroy health and occasion melancholy by parity of reasoning it may be concluded that pleasurable feelings of a contrary nature will bid fairest to restore it the chiefest of those are cheerful company poetry music and dramatic entertainments of the comic kind frequent exercise in the open fields or flower gardens the waters of tunbridge or spa assisted by that sovereign remedy the peruvian bark and the use of the cold bath will also be found powerfully salutary  the study of natural history and employment of delineating some of its most beautiful and minute objects arranged under their proper classes as those of birds insects and flowers will afford very pleasing and rational entertainment and assist in diverting the mind from things of a more serious nature particular thoughts and reflections of the mind are joined with certain conditions of the body and therefore our manner of living in a considerable degree changes our manner of thinking hence by pravelling the universal benefits of air exercise and diet will at once be most agreeably obtained all which tend to strengthen the constitution and to wear out disagreeable impressions made on the body or mind by introducing others of a different nature  the next sovereign remedy in diseases of the mind is music cicero asserts it is amazing power and plato supposes the effect of harmony on the mind is equal to that of air on the body its divine influence is exemplified by david in the cure of saul and the eastern monarch who had conquered the world was himself subdued by the seraphic strains of timotheuss harp which so captivated his ear that he was roused into madness or soothed into melancholy as the sounds became sprightly and animated or solemn and slow  so wonderful is the empire of music over the mind as recorded by the ancients that it leads the soldier undaunted to the imminent deadly breach and alternately stops the rage of conquest by its varied power it mitigates bodily pain suspends the malignant force of madness and despair and lulls the soul into traquility and peace  the effect of music however will be different according to the style and manner of its composition and therefore should be adapted to the particular state and disposition of the mind the plaintive tone of soft flutes will induce a pleasing languor and compose it when tortured with rage or irritated by the more violent passions and on the contrary the merry pipe and tabor will exhilerate and raise the moping head of melancholy depressed by religious despair disapointed ambition or hopeless love  let us appeal to the refined feelings of those most susceptible of the divine power of harmony to prove its sovereign influence over the mind that it is the true oblivious antidote the nepenthe of the gods to heal a wounded spirit to exalt the soul above lowthoughted care and lap it in elysium  this great sensibility occasions people of rank to be victims of their most favorite feelings all that afflicts or threatens others all the evil incident to mankind in general are to them real grievances affecting them very frequently more than their own private complaints and essentially destroy their health in a word infinitely more sensible of tender impressions and exposed to a much greater number than the peasant of necessity they must suffer much more  nerves continually agitated by humors which are always irritative by disordering the harmony of the organs and enfeebling the body murder the mental faculties which are so much dependant on the situation of its surrounding body that whatever disorders the economy of the one absolutely prejudices the mode of thinking in the other  that brightning ray by god himself bestowed blends with our senses and like them grows weak nervous disorders that disposition to be too easily affected and susceptible of irregular and painful emotions is one of the most cruel scourges to people of rank that has been advanced it most commonly occurs and till now has been particularly unhappy in a mistaken treatment because its origin had not been sufficiently investigated it is different species which required very different remedies was left unexamined this branch of physic is at present too much confined to hypothesis the subject of party disputes or at least influenced by fashion  many eminent physicians regarding all disorders of the nerves as the consequences of relaxed fibers and weak digestions would effect a cure by means of remedies which are hot and strengthening by gums steel bitters camphire castor musk spirituous tinctures opium etc which is an error similar to the following in speaking of indigestion and stomachic remedies in attributing all nervous complaints to one cause they have proposed but one kind of remedy which unhappily has no better success than in complaints of the stomach nerves inflamed by the immoderate use of aromatics are not relieved by using assafoetida a sharper medicine than the most piquant aromatic those who are dried up by the abuse of barbados water and marasquin will not find assistance by drinking great quantities of the tincture of gentian of valerian or of castor but those remedies so hurtful in these cases are very beneficial in cases where a weak fiber or poor and watery blood are the true causes of the complaint and such cases often do occur  that tea affects the nerves of the stomach is evident by its communicating disagreeable sensations upon the soul that the soul becomes affected when the digestion of the stomach is impaired is also evident so that the soul cannot be answerable in that case for actions of the body for without the nerves are braced up to the standard of the soul it is ideas are imperfectly connected so that it is clear the nerves operate upon the soul as the works of a clock regulate the movement in keeping time  that extreme sensibility to all impressions which render many so unhappy should be treated like disorders of the nerves on which it depends and often requires cold baths milk diet much exercise and the courage to brave the open air and those things which we most dread  sometimes the disorder only exists in the imagination the vapourish persuade themselves they are not able to do any thing when they are very strong they fancy every thing incommodious which they are very well able to bear they deprive themselves of and renounce all enjoyments frighten themselves with an unexisting bugbear and court a real one such cases require the physicians utmost penetration if he is deluded the patient is lost but if he deceives the patient and gains his confidence a cure is the work of a minute i have seen five such persons who fancied they could neither bear light noise air or food keep their beds in a dark and matted chamber where none were suffered to walk move or speak out but with the utmost precaution lived only on broth and jellies thought themselves dangerously ill settled their affairs and all this while they were perfectly well i compelled them to see hear speak quit their beds and even their house to eat and act like other people to feel themselves well and pass in one quarter of an hour from the greatest misery to the greatest happiness  we must be persuaded the nerves are immediately affected by the labors of the soul inactivity is also sufficient to destroy them and often produces this effect even in persons whose mind is as indolent as their body the nerves are the principal parts of the machine whenever any of the animal functions are disturbed they must undoubtedly be injured  when the nerves are affected without any sensible cause one would be led to suppose that some disease would soon appear the source of which might possibly be discovered by attentive observation and be the more easily destroyed before the disease had come to any height some disorders of the stomach especially show themselves more readily by the effects they have on the nerves for they being a kind of medium between the soul and the body are exposed to suffer from the irregularities of each and communicate to the one the injuries they receive from the other thus it is that the soul becomes prejudicial to the body and the body hurtful to the soul and that they are both combined in destroying the nervous system  section ii let us now consider what is to be done to obtain a cure in nervous diseases  first then we are exactly to regulate the use of nonnaturals for in vain is a prescription of medicines if the patient is not directed and willing to observe certain regulations in relation to air diet and exercise choose a free open air not encumbered with hills or woods a dry cool air braces and invigorates the whole body while a hot confined and damp air weakens and relaxes the habit when the stomach and bowels are weak they should be well guarded against cold and damps especially in winter and there is no dress better and more necessary to keep up a due perspiration than flannels worn next the skin  constant exercise every day that allows of it either in walking on horseback or in an open chaise is of vast service it should be as much as the strength will admit without weakness fatigue or hurry never weary yourself nor raise a sweat go no further than you can return with as much spirit as you went out exercise strengthens the whole nervous system assists digestion but retards it after a full meal therefore after dinner sit a while sangnification and the distribution and secretion of all the animal fluids by muscular motion the blood and juices are kept in a due state of fluidity their viscididity is broken and dissolved and all obstructions either prevented or removed the flesh brush is an excellent thing for strengthening the solids as friction either with the flesh brush flannel or coarse linen cloth strengthens the body promotes the circulation and is particularly useful in weak bowels  people of weak nerves are generally quick thinkers from the delicacy of their sensitive organs which we therefore more liable to be fatigued and relaxed with exercise than those of a coarser make whence we see the necessity of keeping the mind easy quiet and cheerful since nothing hurts nervous people more than fear grief and anxiety use therefore agreeable amusements and a little slight entertaining and diverting reading that requires no thought for all study is pernicious and hurtful conversation should be agreeable trifling and easy without dispute or contradiction amusements be innocent various and not expensive otherways upon reflection the money laid out would do more hurt than the amusements could recompense in a word all thought and care must be laid aside and rationality must give place for a while to a way of life which bath gives a pattern of i cannot but highly approve of a practice there of having music while the patients drink the water which has a very great and good effect upon the motion of the finer animal fibers music has been allowed in all ages of the world to have a noble power in raising the dejected ideas of the soul those that have the most delicate constitutions are most sensible of its good effects it opens the obstructions of the finest vessels assuages the passions and at the same time communicates a pleasure to the soul and makes its ideas cheerful gay and lively by the oscillatory motion of the air vibrating against the tempanum of the ear there is such an impulsive motion given to the finest fibers of the brain upon which the soul more immediately displays its faculties as to enable them to bring regular impulses to the sensorium  but music though it restores the tone of the finest fibers of the brain yet the inferior organs demand coarser treatment to restore them to the standard of health  we must abridge the quantity and quality of our food which ought to be nourishing easy of digestion and suited to the stomach of the patient fat meats and heavy sauces are hurtful and all excess is to be avoided the patient ought never to eat more than the stomach can easily digest eat therefore little at a time but often of innocent plain and simple meat for every time the stomach is overloaded the strength is impaired and its nerves are disordered  above all things heavy suppers ought to be avoided since the stomach is much more apt to be oppressed with the same quantity of food in an horizontal position than in any erect posture and since the digeston goes on slower in time of sleep than when awake as the vessels are then much relaxed  it is a great blessing that loathing and want of appetite in some degree attend all disorders which prevent many people from in fallibly and quickly ruining themselves without resource those who have only a few transient symptoms and are but in the first stage of nervous diseases should live with a due degree of temperance suited to their constitution and abate a little of the quantity of their food while they are more immediately under the symptoms indeed if the disorder is deep and has continued so long as to produce more violent symptoms there is a necessity to be still more careful drink small beer soft fine ale or wine and water but never use water alone wine in excess enfeebles the body and impairs the faculties of the soul but a few glasses of wine in time of eating assist digestion a glass of wine before dinner on an empty stomach and when one is languid feeble or faint is of great service wine in general is preferable to malt liquor the best wine is rhenish mountain or small french wine when the stomach and bowels are troubled with acidity water mixed with rum or brandy is preferable to wine or malt liquor that too common drink tea is very hurtful to both the stomach and nerves especially if drank hot with little bread i would therefore recommend not the disuse but the more moderate use of tea it were well if something else was joined with it in the morning or instead of tea which is almost constantly hurtful to the neves a tea made of balm and mint in every dish of which should be put a ea spoonful of the balsamic mixture of cream and yolks of eggs with two or three drops of oil of cinnamon which makes an agreeable beverage and is highly grateful to the stomach as i have myself had occasion to observe  but of all things the cold bath is the greatest strengthener of the nerves it removes glandular obstructions raises the spirits and vivifies and strengthens the whole man for children delicate constitutions and women liable to miscarriages or troublesome floodings nothing can be better cold bathing i am persuaded is analagous to the bark which is also a very proper medicine for it strengthens the stomach muscles nerves and even the soul itself and enables them to support fresh fatigues i have known several young persons throw themselves into the cold bath after being wearied and depressed with study who always found upon coming out a peculiar strength of mind and a fresh disposition to study but i shall here observe that where the stomach liver or other viscera are unsound the cold bath is improper  that eminent physician mr lewis says that of all remedies whether external or internal there is none can equal the virtue of the cold bath  it cools the body more strengthens the nerves better and promotes perspiration more effectually than any medicine taken down the throat can do  the use of bark and the cold bath together is pointed out by the nature of their virtues they produce the same effects and being combined will cure disorders which every other remedy would only have increased being strengthening sedative and febrifugal they reinvigorate diminish the feverous and nervous heat and calm the irregular motions produced by the spasmodic disposition of the nervous system they fortify a weak stomach and quickly dissipate its attendant pains they restore appetite they facilitate digestion and nutrition they promote all the functions and particularly perspiration which render them so efficacious in all catarhous and cutaneous disorders in a word they remove all disorders occasioned by weakness provided the patient is not afflicted with indissoluble obstructions inflammations or internal ulcerous obscesses which conditions almost necessarily exclude the cold bath but which frequently allow of the quinquina from my own experience i can assure the reader that i have my self plunged into the cold bath when i have found my spirits so depressed that without the utmost exertion of a powerful resolution and being as it were supernaturaly assisted i could never have attempted it yet on coming out i have found my nerves so braced and my spirits so strengthened that in a manner i viewed an other and a spiritual state with such extacy as made me ready and desirous to enter into it i shall here too further recite what i once met with at margate in kent where the late king of britain arrived from germany and used the cold bath and drank the waters with great advantage which is expressed by an inscription on a statue erected on purpose in this manner  thy baths give vigor and thy waters health for although the water only acts immediately on the cutaneous nerves and vessels yet it is strengthening power is by sympathy communicated to the inmost parts of the body and mixes radically with the fluids  daily experience convinces us of the power of the soul upon the stomach those most addicted to reflection perform their digestion with greater difficulty on the contrary those who think little generally digest well we frequently see persons of weak understandings eat and drink very freely without suffering any inconvenience although they lead sedentary lives and have not remarkably strong constitutions on the contrary how many sensible men do we see whose digestion is performed with much pain and difficulty although they are of a good habit of body and use some exercise  the connection of the soul with the body is in fact so strong that it is even difficult to conceive how one of them should act and the other not be sensible in a greater or a less degree of that action the organs of sense being put in motion convey the subject of thought to the mind by acting on the fibers of the brain and while the soul is employed in thinking the parts of the brain are in a greater or less forcible motion and in a less or greater degree of tension these motions fatigue the medullary or nervous portion of the brain and this delicate substance after a long course of meditation becomes as much exhausted as a strong man is after exercise whoever has thought intensely even once in his life must have experienced this in himself and there is certainly no very studious man who has not often felt on coming out of his closet violent pains in his head attended with a great degree of heat in this part this heat will depend on the proportion of weariness and inflammatory tension which the medullary substance has undergone the eyes soon become sensible of this fatigue and if we consider a man who is deeply engaged in thought we shall see that the muscles of his face are all upon the stretch and sometimes appear even convulsed  a great author has taken notice of the danger of fixing the attention too strongly when the action of the soul is too powerful says he it attacks the body so violently that it throws it into a consuming state if the soul exerts itself in a peculiar manner on certain occasions the body is made sensible of it and becomes heated and debilitated  another author of note has observed the same and says the union of the soul with the body is so intimate that they reciprocally share the good or evil which happen to either of them the mind or soul cannot put forth its powers when the body is tired with immoderate exercise and too close an application to study destroys the body by dissipating the animal spirits which are necessary to recruit it  the brain which is the immediate seat of these emotions the nerves which arise from it and the stomach which is furnished with many nerves of an exquisite sensation are the parts first attacked and commonly most injured by the immoderate labor of the mind but if it should continue for any length of time almost all the parts of the body become partakers of the injury  the first symptoms which indicate a weakness of the nervous system are a kind of pusillanimity we were before strangers to diffidence fear grief dejection and dispiritedness he who was the most intrepid man now becomes the most timorous the slightest undertaking frightens him the most trifling unforseen incident makes him tremble the slightest indisposition appears to him a fatal disease and the idea of death fills him with intolerable horrors some tyrants have condemned certain philosophers whom they hated to death but have never been able to make them fear it how much more effectually would their cruelty have been exercised if by suffering them still to live they could have inspired them with those fears of death hypochondriacs are tormented with we see instances every day of men of learning who perceiving the first signs of this distemper have been obliged to forsake their favorite studies whose nerves being weakened they become incapable of attention their memory fails their ideas are confused a sensation of heat in the head palpitations a total dejection and the apprehension of death makes the pen fall from their hands  the injury the mind has done the body soon recoils upon itself for it has been the will of the supreme being that as long as these two substances continued together the labors of the mind should in a certain degree depend upon the health of the body this truth has been ever acknowledged an author has emphatically declared that the props of the body supported the soul and that health increases the powers of the mind when the body is diseased the mind is not capable of reflection it is not therefore surprising that the mind should be weakened after it has exhausted the brain and debilitated the nerves  an eminent physician who lived long in a city where learning is much cultivated says that study begins by impairing the stomach and that if the complaint is not relieved it may degenerate into a melancholy and that a vitiated stomach attends learned people as surely as the shadow follows the body that he has seen patients who suffered for this immoderate thirst of learning first by a loss of appetite an entire inability of the digesting powers and a total debility which ensued afterward they have been tormented with spasms convulsions and at length with a total privation of all their senses  when the digestion is imperfect the humors imbibe a crude quality which renders them unfit for their various destinations and which particularly prevents nutrition upon which the reparation of all the powers depends to be convinced of the general influence of the stomach it is only necessary to observe the state of a person who labors under a difficult digestion the powers are lost in a few minutes a general uneasiness makes the weakness more insupportable the organs of sense are benumbed the faculties of the soul are exercised very imperfectly the memory and particularly the imagination seems to be annihilated in a word nothing makes a sensible man so much resemble an idiot as the difficulty of digestion this observation equally points out to us that of all disorders there are none which more quickly affect the soul than those of the nervous system  there is one general precaution which is to refrain from all liquors in great quantities they weaken digestion by relaxing the stomach drowning the degestive juices and by precipitating the aliments before they are digested they relax all the parts dissolve the humors excite making water or draining sweats i have seen disorders occasioned by weakness considerably diminished without any remedy but the mere retrenching of the quantity of liquor the patient usually drunk  we know that an unnatural state of the nerves of the stomach may either produc a craving or an aversion to food that low spirits and melancholy often proceed from that cause nor is it to be doubted that when the nerves of the stomach are for certain causes affected in a manner somewhat different an indifference for food a weak digestion a languor and coldness a slow pulse and wasting may be the consequences by proper food the nerves of the stomach are gratefully stimulated and the whole body is thence enlivened and strengthened so that besides its use for nutrition food in the stomach becomes altogether necessary in some delicate nervous people for keeping up the strength of the body and the due exercise of all its suctions the morbid affection of the nerves of the stomach by sympathy impairs the vigor and energy of the whole system  it is said in holy write that where much is given much will be required may i presume then to put a question which i wish to do without giving offense to god or the world how it has happened in all ages that men of the greatest sensibility of soul should be endued with such delicate nerves as pervert the mental faculties and prevent the soul from exerting its noblest powers to shine and illuminate in contemplation of the works of god  i shall conclude this section with dr chenes observation in his english malady the reading of which strikes the human mind with astonishment but of all the miseries that afflicts human life says that eminent physician and which principally relate to the body in this valley of tears i think nervous disorders in their extreme and last degree beyond all comparison the worst it was the observation of a great man that he had seen persons laboring under the gout stone cancer and every other disorder which could tear the human machine but had he compared them all and indeed scarce any willing to lay down cheerfully the load of clay we will except those who were supported by divine power but such as labored under an internal anxiety meaning those most cruel sinking suffocating and strangling nervous disorders they greatly exceeded it is almost the only misery to be dreaded and avoided in life if possible it can be by any means for when once the supporters are gone the dissolution is perfect  section iii the human body is made up of such frail materials that they must necessarily decay and often be put out of order  we are not only subject to pain and diseases but also to irregularities of the passions and influence of the weather all which affect the spirits intellects and memory so as to render the same person very different at different times in thinking speaking and acting as any one who is not robustly insensible must naturally discover from his own feelings at one time or other considering its admirable structure the number and exquisite fineness of its movements that in a healthy state all its parts must conspire to perform their proper office and that the least failure generally occasions some disease it appears matter of astonishment that we are more than the transitory beings of a day  in this frail and uncertain state the human system is subject to an inclement atmosphere without and the violent passions within it may suffer from intemperance in diet the advances of age and the prevalence of injurious habits so as to render it more unstable than the weatherglass and in a perpetual state of change from the cradle to the grave  well may human life thus surrounded by a train of unavoidable dangers and calamities be compared to a fleeting shadow which never contiues in one stay like an unballasted bark in a troubled ocean it becomes the sport of winds and tides and without the aid of religion reason and philosophy is in continual danger of being swallowed up and lost  perhaps however very few can properly be said to die of old age merely for even the life of old parr might probably have been still prolonged had he not changed his air and manner of living  here we may observe that by a kind of fatal necessity animal bodies are worn out and destroyed by that very cause which constitutes the principles of life namely the circulating power of the blood and consequently that the number of years to which man may attain will probably be in proportion to the velocity of the pulse if so it will then follow that such a particular state of the constitution as produces the greatest degree of strength and vigor in youth is not most likely to prolong life that those of weak solids and delicate habits in their early state grow old more slowly than others and if the viscera is sound become for a time more strong and healthy from the effect of age  the disorders produced by the efforts of the mind fall soonest upon such as are incessantly engaged in the contemplation of one object study says mr rousseau makes men tender weakens their constitution and when once the body has lost its powers those of the soul are not easily preserved application wears out the machine exhausts the spirits destroys the strength enervates the mind makes us pusillanimous unable either to bear fatigue or to keep our passions under  the whole body becomes hard in process of time and old age itself is a general induration in laboring men those parts most used in their respective employmens grow callous in men of letters the brain itself is attacked in this manner they become incapable of connecting ideas and grow old much before their time  in children the brain is too soft in old persons too hard and in the two extremes it is equally unfit to communicate the oscillations exerted by thinking galen has rightly observed that our memory fails first and forebodes the weakening of our reason the nerves are not the only parts affected by deep thinking for as gunzius has observed the weariness of the eyes is alone sufficient to produce nervous diseases there is no one but must have experienced as i have often done how much the head is weakened by long attention of the sight if after a fever or other indisposition it should happen to me before my strength is well recruited to fix my eyes for a long time on any object i am immediately seized with giddiness sickness at stomach and my whole body suffers a painful sensation of being fatigued and exhausted  if such are the injuries brought on the constitution by irregularity and excess of the passions it ought to be the care of every rational being to guard against their insults and to oppose their effects with becoming resolution and a virtuous resignation to the will of providence  happiness and misery are the lights and shades which fill up the outlines in the portrait of human life every man naturally endeavors to attain the one and avoid the other but by very different means which are often disproportioned to that end  we frequently deceive ourselves both in the pursuit and enjoyment of our wishes extravagance of hope often ends in disappointment and even a constant series of pleasurable events will at last lose their power to give them true relish and make them lasting the mind must refer to some former painful sensations  thus a person who always possessd health is scarce sensible of its value but when lost let it again return and he will bless the means which restored it none enjoy riches so much as those who have been at great pains to attain them he who always was affluent has no competent idea of indigence to contrast such a state or exalt his enjoyment were our exquisite pleasures too lasting they would lay so much stress on the vital powers of the body as would soon wear it out every extreme therefore corrects itself and every evil works its own cure  if the violent passions harrow up the soul and disturb its union with the body a conscience pure and uncorrupted the inestimable reward of virtue will best reconcile them to each other and cause them to dwell in harmony that will always speak peace to the mind whatever the world may say and shield it from the impotent attacks of slander and abuse whoever is over solicitous about censure fame or the possession of temporal enjoyments will seldom find repose an ungratious look from his superiors or unmerited insolence from those below him will vex and discompose him if he is anxious for long life a coffin or shroud the apparatus of death will alarm and appal his senses whilst he who dispenses with unavoidable ills with a philosphic indifference who is neither weary of living or afraid to die will find within himself an inexpressible and perpetual calm  by giving way to sorrow or anger they at last become habitual and reign triumphant in a word the government of the passions is as essential toward preventing diseases of the mind as temperance contributes to hinder them attacking the body  that man ought to be deemed richest who is the happiest and he is the most likely to become so who with a virtuous resignation is prepared for the unavoidable evils which flesh is heir to who expostulates with the folly and extravagance of his own desires and though a hard task at last convinces himself that what he likes best is not always best for him who preserves at all times a decent equality of mind is not arrogantly elated with the delusive smiles of prosperity nor servily cast down by the surly visage of misfortune  the organs of the body may be entirely unfit to be acted upon by the soul when it remains wrapped up in itself like a criminal in a dungeon some people are born with imperfect nerves which are stopped up and never all their lives unfold themselves and shake off the clog of matter which obstruct them  though the soul has a power over the involuntary motions of the body in a healthy state yet when the body is diseased or imperfectly formed the operation of the soul then is irregular  even the strength of the constitution is itself dangerous young people of excellent constitutions apply themselves to study with indefatigable industry the powerful action of the soul increases that of the organs and they are attacked with inflammatory diseases the consequence of irritation long kept up in vigorous habits sometimes they expire in the first attack more commonly they get the better of that and if they find themselves perfectly recovered their constitution recovering its vigor they give themselves up again to the same labors and relapse into the same disorders there are frequent instances of robust young men close applying to study who are attacked with inflammatory fevers every year at last in process of time being worn out by these attacks and by their labors they lose their strength and are seized with consumptive diseases against which they are no longer able to resist  health is frequently destroyed by excessive devotion an author has collected several interesting observations on this head in which devout melancholy is well delineated its symptoms are very unaccountable alarming and grievous and there are few practitioners who have not had opportunities of seeing some shocking instances of this disease the greatness and excellence of the object and the satisfaction the soul experiences in giving itself up to the contemplation of the almighty excites too lively a sensation and produces in the brain attention too violent and too continual to be supported for a long time together without injury it soon throws the soul into fanatical madness and exhausts the body some most amiable young persons led away by an erroneous system fade and fall into decay neglecting the duties of their calling in order to give their thoughts up wholly to the supreme author of their ng who could not have been more properly glorified than by a strict attention to those duties a student is still regrated one of the greatest abilities born with strong powers of the mind whose candor and other virtues would have been an acquisition to the church but who unfortunately devoted himself to a sect of which he soon was the victim the powers of his body decaying as fast as his mind became more zealously inflamed  sometimes even the most lucky thoughts arise in the midst of recreation one of the greatest geniuses of our age computed his immortal works walking about in the country the soul unfolds itself in open air but is imprisoned within the confined walls of a study it is elevated by the fragrance of flowers depressed by the smell of a lamp plutarchs comparison on this subject is very just and excellent a little water says he nourishes and strengthens plants and a greater quantity stifles them thus it is with the mind moderate labor is its food excessive labor destroys it when activity was mentioned as the second cause of the disorders here treated of exercise was certainly represented at the same time as one of the most powerful preservatives and restorers of the health of the learned  in the foregoing article the advantages of open air have been considered these are greatly enhanced if accompanied with some degree of motion the learned in general are not sufficiently convinced of the influence the body has on the soul although it was well known to our greatest men who have been sensible that the mind was subject to the powers of physic as well as the body the soul says des carts is so much influenced by the constitution and the state of the bodily organs that if it were possible to find out a method of increasing our penetration it should certainly be sought for in medicine walking alone is very beneficial but not quite sufficient and it cannot be too much recommended to them to ride out frequently on horseback this kind of exercise is of use to the head the breast and the viscera of the lower belly especially by preventing or dispelling their obstructions  the hypocondriac disease may also be reckoned among the evils learned men are exposed to from that kind of inactive life which disturbing the circulation in the abdodominal viscera produces obstructions in them this diease generally attacks the indolent the luxurious the unfortunate and the studious men of a melancholy temprament whose minds are capable of great attention and whose passions are not easily moved are in the advanced periods of life most liable to this disease it may rather be called a complication of maladies than a single one to what a wretched condition are the best of men often reduced by it their strength and appetite fail a perpetual gloom hangs over their minds they live in the constant dread of death and are continually in search of relief from medicine where alas it is not to be found  those most liable to this disease are the virtuous the valiant the brave and those of an enlarged understanding whom it would be the interest of the world to wish they were free from that and every other illness and except for that alloy they would have too large a share of human happiness to this we owe the irrepareable loss of doctor young and the best and most approved men that have appeared among us  hypochandriac persons ought never to fast long and their food should be solid and nourishing all acescent and windy vegetables are to be avoided flesh meats agree best with them and their drink should be old claret or generous madeira  in all persons afflicted with nervous disorders there is a great delicacy and sensibility of the whole nervous system and an uncommon degree of weakness of the organs of digestion these may be either natural or acquired when owing to a defect in the constitution they are hardly to be removed but may be mitigated by proper care  but nervous affections arise more frequently from causes which it is in a great measure in our power to avoid than from diseases or any original fault in the constitution excessive grief intense study improper diet and neglect of exercise are the great sources of this extensive class of diseases  grief indulged destroys the appetite and digestion depresses the spirits and induces an universal relaxation and debility of the whole system instances of this are daily to be seen the loss of a relation or any other misfortune in life is often sufficient to occasion the most complicated series of nervous symptoms such misfortunes indeed are not to be avoided but surely their effects by a vigorous and proper exertion of the mind might be renderd less hurtful the effects of intense study are pretty similar to those occasioned by grief it preys upon the animal spirits and destroys the appetite and digestion to prevent these effects studious persons ought according to the poet ooy with their books they should never study too long at a time nor attend long to one particular subject especially if it be of a serious nature they ought likewise to be attentive to their posture and should take care frequently to unbend their minds by music diversions or agreeable company  with regard to diet i shall only observe that nervous diseases may be occasioned either by excess or inanition both these extremes hurt digestion and vitiate the humors  but the most general cause of nervous disorders is indolence the active and laborious are seldom troubled with them they are reserved for the children of ease and affluence who generally feel their keenest force all i shall say to such persons is that the means of prevention and cure are both in their own power if the constitution of human nature be such that man must either labor or suffer diseases surely no individual has any right to expect an exemption from the general rule  if the stomach is bad either naturally or from errors in diet this organ will be affected by the exercise of the mind while the nerves shall remain in a sound state on the contrary if the nervous system is weak and the stomach strong nervous diseases of great importance will be brought on before the stomach is injured  a fit of illness undigested food or any similar cause often occasions broken unconnected dreams and prevents our receiving the arising from sound sleep the reason of which probably is the fermentation and discordance of the nutritive juices incapacitating our senses or organs through which the soul is empowred to act from being in a perfect state of rest the soul must consequently partake of that irregular and unconnected quality by which the bodily organs are at that juncture actuated but in death the case is quite reversed the soul instead of being clogged up and embarrassed by bodily impediments is absolutely and entirely freed from them for we cannot suppose it is longer confined to nerves and arteries which there is no possibility of its ever making any further use of such a supposition must be ridiculous so that in sleep the souls situation is directly contrary to what it must be in death in the first case it is by material influence prevented from exerting its powers whereas in death that is on its enlargement from its material body it finds itself for the first time at full liberty and in full power of expanding and exerting them to the utmost  it is evident that virtue and vice are not constitutional and dependent on any particular habit of body and though our material part has an influence over the soul in regard to the exertion of its faculties yet that influence extends only to the enlarging or contracting our intellectual faculties and not to our making a good or ill use of those faculties that rest solely in ourselves and if we make a wrong use of that power if we unnaturalize ourselves as i may say by deviating from the paths of virtue whom are we to blame the deity who has formed us as we should be or ourselves who with an ungrateful hand rejected the opportunity he has given us of attaining virtue and in consequence eternal felicity  are we not assured too by the deity that according to our different abilities situation various contingencies etc we shall hereafter be judged our actions will be scrutanizd in proportion to the talents entrusted to us and according to the opportunities and incitements we have had to make use of them and not taken in that superficial light mortals look on them it is not those who have the greatest share of but those who make the best use of their moral and intellectual powers who will be regarded hereafter justice and goodness are the deitys attributes and by them we are hereafter to be judged as to idiots etc who like the brute creation are under the dominion of matter at least have as little power of exerting their faculties the deitys justice will hardly expect from them duties which it is impossible they should perform what use they and many more beings are of in the creation we know not but let us not short sighted as we are for that reason arraign divine wisdom we are sure every part of the creation was ordained for some wise purpose though to what end we are perhaps ignorant and in regard to the diversity of power talents etc which we observe among men so far from being a blemish they are a great pros of the deitys wisdom instead of their being the cause of confusion it is on that the link which supports all chiefly depends was it otherways half the omnipotents power and goodness on earth would have been in vain  we may assure ourselves that death which is indeed but the souls birth instead of being a gloomy messenger is in reality our best friend since by his means we shall be freed from the fetters of the flesh and introduced into a state of freedom knowledge and i hope happiness where our intellectual powers will have full scope where we shall he all ethereal sense and capable of innumerable joys which in our present state we can have no conception of as swans are said to sing melodiously before death from an instinct of some extraordinary good approaching so should good men rejoice on their elinquishing this mortal state let us consider what happiness even in this life the contemplation of an eternity produces to indulge in the hopes of meeting again with our longlost best beloved friends of living in intimacy and conversing with not only the heoes and philosophers of all ages but with angels and other superior beings of indulging the amiable curiosity of searching into and admiring the works of the deity through the immensity of the creation where infinite variety must prove an infinite fund of unspeakable insatiable and ever increasing happiness must not reflections like these animate our spirits and stimulate us to virtue i own i often indulge the thought and am never so happy as when i am thus as it were anticipating eternity besides nothing contributes so much to cheerfulness religion humanity and all the social virtues as the contemplation and hopes of a futurity whereas to the contrary opinion is ever united a melancholy which rankles within us which preys upon our spirits and which by divesting us or all fears of a future judgment encourages vice and too often induces us to give such a loose to our passions as makes us incapable of happiness either in this world or the world to come  and for the good and virtuous the cause of their immortality is continually creasing even in this world the longer they exist the more they improve in knowledge and virtue and consequently the more they merit an eternity we might as well suppose the deity should annihilate angels and other superior beings as the souls of virtuous men when we most please him to imagine we shall be most severely punished by him were absurd and surely to the virtuous and happy annihilation must be the most dreadful of punishments the immateriality of the soul implies too that it is a substance incorruptible and invariable and consequently eternal unless it shall please the deity to annihilate it and can we suppose that truth and goodness which are emanations from the divine creator will not eternally exist  every part of the creation evinces in the most striking characters the existence of a deity and because we are not acquainted with the nature and essence of the deity shall we for that reason alone doubt there is a deity  the case is the same in all immaterial substances nor is it possible for us to be admitted to a nearer intimacy with them while we are confined to this bodily prison where as i before observed we can have no distinct idea of any thing but what is material since all our perceptions are the effects of material impulses and conveyed through material organs to the soul the human understanding is limited to every human boundaries how many things are there even in the material creation which seem mysterious and are kept from us yet this should not give us the least uneasiness since whatever is available to our happiness here or hereafter is laid open to us the knowledge of a deity and the souls existence are truths absolutely necessary to make us happy and virtuous  it is worth observing that we are assured in scripture  angels and other spiritual beings neither marry nor are given in marriage they all have one common parent the almighty  our bodies like all other material systems are not designed for eternal duration are ever variable and so ordered as to stand in need of daily recruits of food sleep etc during our sleep a swoon or any similar cause the soul being embarrassed and clogged up as it were is in a state of deliquium at least if it does think its actions are so incongruous as not to be traced in our waking hours notwithstanding which we are not to suppose that the soul is in reality more defective then than at another time but the organs through which it is obliged to act being obstructed its faculties are consequently impeded if we lose our eyefight or hearing the soul is not in the least maimed thereby it has but lost its instrument or bodily organ its original power is still the same and were our optical or auditory organs reduced to order the soul would again reexert its usual faculties  thus as an author observes the musician cannot if his instrument be disordered bring forth any harmony his skill nevertheless remains which on the instruments being reput in order he again exhibits idiotism forgetfulness dotage etc are not weaknesses of the soul but of the senses and we are not to suppose our immaterial principle in such cases loses its faculties more than the sun loses his meridian brightness when hid from us by dark clouds intervening thus during sleep which is absolutely necessary to the refreshment of our bodily part we must suppose there is such a relaxation of our material organs that our whole system becomes too languid for the soul to be capable of exerting its active faculties but when the body is recruited with proper strength the soul recovers its pristine power it again dictates to and governs the body and we may perceive it is the same thinking principle the very same soul that actuated us before sleep matter cannot divest the soul of its faculties though it can render it impossible for it to exert them upon the body which may be disordered so as not to be directed by it the souls faculties then are not annihilated but suspended from action or to speak more properly are wrapped up in itself a being may undoubtedly exist without giving appearance of its existence the soul therefore may exist without giving signs of its existence or affecting matter so as to be conscious of its own existence as in sleep without dreaming it remains the same invariable essence though the indisposition of the bodily organs renders it impossible to display those faculties from whence thought and reflection come  the soul h impassible consequently incapable of change all the changes that happen to an individual arise from the different affections of the bodily organs the soul of a newborn child is the same as that of an old man and that of a fool as that of a philosopher  the bodily organs on which the operations of the soul depend greatly vary by which the exercise of its faculties are proportionably lessened or improved but it is particular existence faculties and powers remain the same impassible to the laws of matter and motion the difference between the lowest and most abject and the highest and most elevated natural capacity depends upon the instruments by which the soul acts and is affected which seem to us to alter its operations the cause is in the material organs which make representations of its operation according to their just or imperfect mechanism if the bodily organs happen to be perfectly organized and exactly modulated to receive and convey to the sensorium or seat of the soul the ideas of objects with a proper impulse then it exerts its faculties in a reasonable manner the senses receive a just or sufficient degree of impulse from the objects which impulse the organs convey in a just and sufficient degree which excites in the soul the distinct idea of the object  the brightest wits the most exalted understandings may be reduced to a level with the most abject stupid and unintelligent fool by the mechanical affections of matter and motion we often see a man of the brightest parts and most enlarged understanding who has penetrated into the secret recesses of nature despoiled of all his wisdom and noble endowments by the tyranny of a violent nervous fever etc thus we behold him now divested of the exercise of his faculties but can we suppose this change made in the soul itself no certainly it remains the same and differs not from what it was before recover him from the fever etc and remove the impediment it has thrown upon the organs of the senses and the exercise of all the faculties of the soul returns his parts brighten his understanding revives and in short he becomes in every respect the same amiable person as he was before the fever etc seized him  thus we see that the bodily organs may be so disordered or the stimulus applied to them so great as to put it out of the souls power to suspend or contract them and though it is the source of all motion both voluntary and involuntary yet it may be reduced to an inactive passive state or forced into involuntary action  though all voluntary motion proceeds from the immediate influence of the soul yet some of the voluntary motions by the force of custom and habit come at length to be performed with little or no attention of the soul though it has full power to begin or stop the motion when it pleases thus a man may walk and not be sensible of it have an object before him without seeing it and put his hand to a thing without feeling it because he is intent upon something else therefore overlooks these smaller sensations and these voluntary motions are in some degree mechanically performed  i believe it will be allowed that our ideas or thoughts are immaterial that is are not bodily substances who ever thought there was any thing corporeal in a judgment a doubt etc if our thoughts are corporeal where could they be lodged how infinitely complicated and extended must that material soul be to be able to contain those immense volumes of learning which some men have treasured up in their souls  the large size the wonderful texture great care and security the god of nature has employed about the brain make it highly probable that it is designed for the noblest uses  the temple tabernacle or dwelling house of that immaterial being that immortal guest i hat that spark of the deity that breath of life the living soul or man  every thing we say or do our every action and thought proves and ascertains the reality of the soul the very doubting its existence is a strong proof of it whence proceeds the power of doubting it is evident that the particles of matter of which our bodies are formed were not long since lifeless vegitative particles for which we are indebted to the fields that nourished and produced them and which are but transplanted as it were into another soil these particles of matter though differently modified and formed into a most surprising piece of mechanism are in reality as to their original power and nature the same and as incapable of thought self motion etc as when growing in the field matter it is true by a proper modification may become a fit dwelling for thinking being what then shall we call that principle within us which doubts which reflects which dictates to us and sways us in every action of life what is it that endows us with the power of selfmotion which enables to recollect past actions to look forward into futurity and in a manner to foretell future consequences it is certainly somewhat of a different nature from the lifeless particles of which our bodies are formed it is somewhat which though we cannot rightly define we are sure is somewhat and this it is we call the soul  while the body is kept in order the soul is easy when it is not the soul is in pain when the functions of the body cease the soul quits the association but exists in a separate state for as every particle of the body however transformed will remain after the separation so will the soul also for whatever has once received a being from god cannot cease to be without his interposition we are told in scripture that man is made after gods own image now as the deity cannot be supposed a material being what can it imply but that our being like him is an immaterial immortal substance endowed with reason reflection and the power of distinguishing between good and evil etc it is it must be owned a very bold eastern metaphor as the difference and distance between us is so inexpressible  in describing the bliss of immortal beings we have while in this life no ideas more expressive than those which depend on the senses of seeing and hearing which senses seem principally designed for the service of our immortal part and may be called vehicles for the souls food as those of tasting smelling and feeling are designed purely for the bodys use after death the soul will doubtless be gifted with many powers and inlets to happiness or misery which we at present can have no idea of  it has been a received opinion in all ages that immensity swarms with invisible immaterial beings who are the agents of providence and witnesses of our most private actions  the thought of our existance terminating with this life naturally checks the soul in any generous pursuit contracts her views and fixes them on temporary and selfish ends it dethrones the reason extinguishes all noble and heroic sentiments encourages lust fraud violence and all kind of vice by which a man may wickedly make his fortune or indulge a pleasure without fear of temporal damage either in reputation health or fortune in short the inward compunctions of a wicked as well as the joys of an upright mind are grafted on the assurance of another state  hence arise the natural hopes and fears of men hence spring the means of future rewards and appearing pleasing to the deity though persecuted in this world and likewise the inward stings of conscience and dread of punishment attending prosperous vice though hid from human eyes  as it is probable that there may be different degrees of happiness for souls in proportion as they have been more or less perfect it is as probable too that in those stations souls will be furnished with opportunities of eternally improving in virtue and knowledge and consequently of increasing in happiness notwithstanding which gradation to perfection they most ever remain infinitely distant from the deity who is perfection itself  section iv o man greatly beloved by thy creator the darling of providence thou art distinguished by his goodness distinguish thyself also by thy one undivided aim to glorify him who has been at so much expense to gratify thee  while all these inferior creatures in silent eloquence declare the glory of god do thou lend them thy tongue be thou the high priest of the mute creation let their praise become vocal in thy songs adore the supreme benefactor for the blessings he showers down upon every order of beings adore him for numberless mercies which are appropriated to thyself but above all adore him for that noble gift of a rational and immortal soul  a celebrated modern author has elegantly expressed his sentiments on this subject  o ye timorous souls that are terrified at the found of the passing bell that turn pale at the fight of an opened grave and can scarce behold a coffin or a skull without a shuddering horror  o eternity eternity how are our boldest our strongest thoughts lost and overwhelmed in thee who can set landmarks to limit thy dimensions or find plumbers to fathom thy depths arethmeticians have figures to compute all the progressions of time astronomers have instruments to calculate the distances of the plannets but what numbers can state what lines gauge the lengths and breadths of eternity it is higher than heaven what can thou do deeper than hell what can thou know the measure thereof is longer than the earth broader than the sea mysterious mighty existence a sum not to be lessened by the largest deductions an extent not to be contracted by all possible diminutions none can truly say after the most prodigious waste of ages so much of eternity is gone for when millions of centuries are elapfed it is but just commencing and when millions more have run their ample round it will not be nearer ending yea when ages numerous as the bloom of spring increased by the herbage of summer both augmented by the leaves of autumn and all multiplied by the drops of rain which drown the winter  when these and ten thousand times ten thousand more  more than can be represented by any similitude or imagined by any conception  when all these are revolved and finished eternity vast boundless amazing eternity will only be beginning  man goes forth to his work and to his labor till the evening but then his strength fails his spirits fly and he stands in need not only of some respite from toil but of some kindly and sovereign refreshment what an admirable provision for this purpose is sleep sleep introduces a most welcome vacation both for the soul and body the exercises of the brain and the labors of the hand are at once discontinued so that the weary limbs repair their exhausted vigor while the pensive thoughts drop their load of sorrows and the busy ones rest from the fatigue of application most reviving cordial equally beneficial to our animal and intellectual powers it supplies the fleshly machine and keeps all its nice movements in a proper posture for easy play it animates the thinking faculties with fresh alacrity and rekindles their ardour for the studies of the dawn without these enlivening recruits how soon would the most robust constitution be wasted into a walking skeleton and the most learned sage degenerate into a hoary idiot  how many of our fellow creatures are at this very instant confined to the bed of languishing and complaining with that illustrious sufferer of old wearisome nights are appointed to me instead of indulging soft repose they are counting the tedious hours telling every striking clock or measuring the very moments by their throbbing pulse  how many harrassed with pain most passionately long to make some little truce with their agonies in peaceful slumbers how many sick with disquietude and restless even on their downy pillows would purchase this transient oblivion of their woes almost at any rate that which wealth cannot procure which multitudes sigh for in vain thy god has bestowed on thee times out of number  but sweet recollection ravishing expectation the songs of saints in light never admit a pause for sadness all heaven will resound with the melody of their gratitude and all eternity echo to their triumphant acclamations the hallelujahs of that world and the harmonious joy of it is inhabitants will be as lasting as the divine perfections they celebrate come then holy love and tune my heart descend celestial fire and touch my tongue that i may stand ready to strike up and bear my part in that great hosanna that everlasting hymn  yes yes ye flowery nations ye must all decay and indeed could you add the strength of an oak or the stability of a pyramid to all the delicacy of your texture yet short exceeding short even then would your duration be for i see that all things come to an end the pillars of nature are tottering the foundations of the round world are falling away the heavens themselves wax old like a garment but amidst these views of general ruin he is our refuge this is our consolation we know that our redeemer lives  what a striking argument is here for resignation unfeigned resignation to all the disposals of providence too often are our dissatisfied thoughts apt to find fault with divine dispensations we tacitly arraign our makers conduct or question his kindness with regard to ourselves we fancy our lot not so comodiously situated or our condition not so happily circumstanced as if we had been placed in some other station of life  be still then thou uneasy mortal know that god is unerringly wise and be assured that amidst the greatest multiplicity of beings he does not overlook thee thou art of far superior value in the estimate of omnipotence than all the herbage of the field if his sacred will ordains sickness for thy portion never dare to imagine that uninterrupted health would be more advantageous if he pleases to withhold or carry away children never presume to conclude that thy happiness is blasted because thy hopes of an increasing family are disappointed he that marshalls all the starry host and so accurately arranges every the meanest species of herbs he orders all the peculiarities all the changes of thy state with a vigilence that nothing can elude with a goodness that endures for ever bow thy head therefore in humble acquiescence rest satisfied that whatever is by the appointment of heaven is right is best alas how blind are mortals to future events how unable to discern what is really good  fools often account the life of the righteous but madness and their end to be without honor but they are numbered among the children of god and their lot their distinguished and eternal lot is among the saints however therefore an undiscerning world may despise and a profane world vilify the truly religious be this the supreme the invariable desire of my heart let me live the life and die the death of the righteous oh let my latter end and future state be like theirs  but most of all in that tremendous day when the heavens are rent assunder and wrapped up like a scroll when the almighty arm shall arrest the sun in his career and dash to pieces the structure of the universe when the dead both small and great shall be gathered before the throne of glory and the fate of all mankind shall hang on the very point of a final irreversible decision then blessed jesus let us be owned by thee and we shall not be ashamed defended by thee and we shall not be afraid o may we at that awful that unutterably important juncture be covered with the wings of thy redeeming love and we shall behold all the horrible convulsions of expiring nature with composure with comfort we shall even welcome the dissolution of all things as the times of refreshing from the presence of the lord  almighty god eternal sovereign of the universe whose intelligence i perticipate by whose power i am sustained whose existence and attributes investigate whose impulses i seem to feel incessantly prompting all my active powers to exert themselves for universal good to what sacred light what unexpolred source shall i fly for information how shall i dissipate the gloomy uncertainty whose incumbent horror depresses all my being and leaves its brightest hopes its noblest enterprises absorbed in endless and infinite despair in vain am i told that upon the mixture of the human character depend the varieties of its fortune misery is indeed the native consequente of vice but why should vice take place in human nature that error and mistake are the result of limited powers i can easily grant but will it follow from thence that uninterrupted peace and tranquillity are incompatible with finite existence is there no supposable state in which a mind though circumscribed in its powers and confined to a particular sphere of action may be free from misery  god of nature to whose eyes the depth of eternal wisdom the numberless vicissitudes of infinite possibility are obvious why am i and all the fraternal race of men born to the wretched inheritance of inexpiable guilt and immovable woe as images reflected by the polished surface of an opaque body vanish in swift sucession without impressing any mark of their existence and leave the open expanse unoccupied for others so swiftly pass the fluctuating race of men friends and allies robbed of half themselves dissolved in tears and anguish whilst expiring guilt entails on its connexions the detestable heritage of shame and execration  father of the human spirit amidst the general confusion of things in which the beams of thy gracious countenance alternately sink in impenetrable darkness or emerge in celestial glory to mortal eyes still still my soul persuades me not only of thy existence but of its infinite and inseparable perfections  finis
