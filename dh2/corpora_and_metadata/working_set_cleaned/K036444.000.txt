content a pastoral song by the late mr cunningham over moorlands and mountains rude barren and bare as wearied and wilderd i roam a gentle young shepherdess sees my despair and leads me over lawns to her home yellow sheaves from rich ceres her cottage had crowned green rushes were strewn on the floor her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round and decked the sod seats at the door we sat ourselves down to a cooling repast fresh fruits and she culled me the best whilst thrown from my guard by some glances she cast love slily stole into my breast i told my soft wishes she sweetly replied ye virgins her voice was divine i have rich ones rejected and great ones denied yet take me fond shepherd i am thine her air was so modest her aspect so meek so simple though sweet were her charms i kissed the ripe roses that glowed on her cheek and locked the dear maid in my arms now jocund together we tend a few sheep and if on the banks by the stream reclined on her bosom i sink into sleep her image still softens my dream together we range over the slowrising hills delighted with pastoral views or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distills and mark out new themes for my muse to pomp or proud titles she never did aspire the damsels of humble descent the cottager peace is well known for her sire the shepherds have named her content
