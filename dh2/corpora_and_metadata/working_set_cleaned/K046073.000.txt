the tears of genius  price one shilling and sixpence  the tears of genius  occasioned by the death of dr goldsmith  by courtney melmoth  london printed for t becket corner of the adelphi in the strand mdcclxxiv  to sir joshua reynolds sir the veneration i bear to the memory of doctor goldsmith has drawn me into the present publication and the sentiments of affection to be found in his dedication of the deserted village have induced me to inscribe this elegy to sir joshua reynolds who will naturally receive with kindness whatever is designed as a testimony of justice to a friend that is no more  in contemplating the death of this excellent man and admirable poet i have been led to contemplate likewise the fate of others for within a very few years our literary losses have been fatally multiplied and many of the most valuable members have been suddenly lopped off from science and society in pursuit of this undertaking where the same pathetic subject was to be considered to the end i resolved to set out upon an irregular principle that without enchaining myself to any critical uniformity i might have scope and latitude for whatever varieties of versification should fall in my way  as i was to deplore the loss of different writers each of which possessed very strongly a marking originality i thought it best to write a sort of epitaph upon each accordingly the following verses are intended as so many separate imitations of the style and manner of the authors which they commemorate  that the occasion which produced the elegy might not lose the strength of the impression by delay  for alas the traces of sorrow for the loss of the learned are soon worn out by the tumults of life  i hurried the composition to the press the moment i could withdraw my hand from the manuscript the whole of which was begun and finished within a few hours after the news reached me that dr goldsmith was dead  but i beg sir you will excuse the length of this address and believe me to be  your sincere admirer and most obedient servant courtney melmoth april  th      the tears of genius the villagebell tolls out the note of death and through the echoing air the lengthening sound with dreadful pause reverberating deep spreads the sad tidings over fair auburns vale there to enjoy the scenes her bard had praised in all the sweet simplicity of song genius in pilgrim garb sequestered sat and herded jocund with the harmless swains but when she heard the fateforeboding knell with startled step precipitate and swift and look pathetic full of dire presage the church way walk beside the neighboring green sorrowing she sought and there in black array borne on the shoulders of the swains he loved she saw the boast of auburn moved along touched at the view her pensive breast she struck and to the cypress which incumbent hangs with leaning slope and branch irregular over the mossd pillars of the sacred fane the briarbound graves shadowing with funeral gloom forlorn she hied and there the crowding woe swelled by the parent pressed on bleeding thought big ran the drops from her maternal eye fast broke the bosomsorrow from her heart and pale distress sat sickly on her cheek as thus her plaintive elegy began and must my children all expire shall none be left to strike the lyre courts death alone a learned prize falls his shafts only on the wise can no fit marks on earth be found from useless thousands swarming round what crowding ciphers cram the land what hosts of victims at command yet shall the ingenious drop alone shall science grace the tyrants throne thou murderer of the tuneful train i charge thee with my children slain scarce has the sun thrice urged his annual tour since half my race have felt thy barbarous power sore have thou thinnd each pleasing art and struck a muse with every dart bard after bard obeyed thy slaughtering call till scarce a poet lives to sing a brothers fall then let a widowed mother pay the tribute of a parting lay tearful inscribe the monumental strain and speak aloud her feelings and her pain and first farewell to thee my son she cried thou pride of auburns dale  sweet bard farewell long for thy sake the peasants tear shall flow and many a virginbosom heave with woe for thee shall sorrow sadden all the scene and every pastime perish on the green the sturdy farmer shall suspend his tale the woodmans ballad shall no more regale no more shall mirth each rustic sport inspire i ut every frolic every feat shall tire no more the evening gambol shall delight nor moonshine revels crown the vacant night but groupes of villagers each joy forgot shall form a sad assembly round the cot sweet bard farewell  and farewell auburns bliss the bashful lover and the yielded kiss the evening warble philomela made the echoing forest and the whispering shade the winding brook the bleat of brute content and the blithe voice that whistled as it went these shall no longer charm the plowmans care but sighs shall fill the pauses of despair goldsmith adieu the booklearnd priest for thee shall now in vain possess his festive glee the oftheard jest in vain he shall reveal for now alas the jest he cannot feel but ruddy damsels over thy tomb shall bend and conscious weep for their and virtues friend the milkmaid shall reject the shepherds song and cease to carol as she toils along all auburn shall bewail the fatal day when from her fields their pride was snatched away and even the matron of the cressy lake in piteous plight her palsied head shall shake while all adown the furrows of her face slow shall the lingering tears each other trace and oh my child severer woes remain to all the houseless and unshelterd train thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest and heap fresh anguish on the beggars breast for dear were thou to all the sons of pain to all that wander sorrow or complain dear to the learned to the simple dear for daily blessings marked thy virtuous year the rich received a moral from thy head and from thy heart the stranger found a bed distress came always smiling from thy door for god had made thee agent to the poor had formed thy feelings on the noblest plan to grace at once the poet and the man here genius paused to dry the gathering tear which nature started in her matron eye she paused an instant then the strain renewed thee too thou favorite of the moral strain pathetic gray for thee does genius mourn science and taste thy early fate shall plain and virtue drop a tear into thy urn often as nights curtain closes on the day and twilight robes the clouds in duskier hue a lovelone visit to thy tomb i pay while all the parent trembles at the view for how to the unconscious worm a prey so dear a child as thee can i resign ah how can genius ever forget her gray poet of nature all my powers were thine on thy blessed name with melted heart i dwell some kindred drops a loss like thine demands thou who could once for others wail so well now take thy tribute from a mothers hands though the engraved tomb and cloud aspiring bust to cams clear margin call not back thy breath yet shall fair fame immortalize thy dust and genius snatch thee from the realms of death often as i reach the spot where thou art laid thou whose bright sense could boast celestial fire those hands i cry the muses scepter swayed and waked to extacy the living lyre one morn i missed thee from the favorite tree and anxious searched the brook the lawn the grove another came but ah it was not thee oh the keen tortures of a parents love next through the sculptured porch i saw thee borne in slow procession by the sable train i saw thy corpse entombed beneath the thorn and over thy ashes sighed this funeral strain epitaph here low in dust a son of science lies by fame distinguished and to genius dear forgive the fault ye cynically wise if on his grave the parent sheds a tear long shall the muses mourn their pensive friend long shall a mothers bosom throb with woe over his loved tomb the duteous swains shall bend and albions daughters long bewail the blow now sighing stopped again the querulous power and ruminated thoughtful  over the turf swelled into mountains by the mingled dead she cast a serious eye  and now the hours the lightwingd messengers of hoary time brought on the sable zenith of the night cloudless and incomposd by gale or shower save that the zephir rising from the south rustled the light leaf of the spreading beech far through the caerule air the illumined moon her faint ray flung upon the shadowy earth struck by the scene imagination turned reflective on a loss still more severe a loss that all the muses mourn at once the cheek of genius streamed with warmer tears deepend the searching sigh and throbbd the heart as thus at length the bursting grief found way child of my heart  thou matchless soul of song guide of fair truth and leading star of fame etherial in thy talents as thy mind wise as all wisdom here below could be sublimely tuneful but not more sublime than delicate  nor more refined than good for virtue ever brightened in thy lay and beamed fresh graces through thy ardent song a song that dared a flight above the spheres caelestially ambitious heaveninspird thy hopes angelic and thy theme a god  thou muses miracle  thou nations pride whose worth yon silver queen of night proclaimed when thou her pitying sympathy addressed whose wisdom all our sages loudly praise sages of science by deep thought made sage whose virtue immortality rewards whose genius scorning narrow human ken and the pent limits of this pigmy world where in a circle circumscribed by fate the moleeyd mortal dimly gazes round and boasts his deep sagacity of sight important emmet  prideelated mite infinite atom  momentary worm  superior soars to scenes behind the cloud oh young  thou daybright poet of the night accept sincere the genuine plaint of woe maternal  struck immediate from the heart an heart that labors deep with various grief and thou oh cynthia  thou who lent thine aid caerulian and shed thy influence round chearing the darkness of thy poets fate a fate envelopd deep in fortunes gloom dark beyond all the horrors of the night when intercepting clouds repel thy rays and not a gleam softens the black opaque dark beyond common woes  death  dark distress ebon of soul more sabled than the styx as once his anguish thou with influence bland benign did seel  now kindly feel for me for me  sad relict of a prostrate race  partake a wretched parents soulheavd throb a parent rest of every filial joy and smote by deaths most desolating dart beneath thy sober sublunary shine tremulous tender melancholy  soft suited to soothe the solitary woe beneath thy shine  never did a greater bard latian athenian or in briton born pour on the ear of night a lovelier song never did thou patronize a nobler lay nor hear a strain more pensively divine fair in distress and querulously sweet oh how the poet breathed at every pause oh how the godhead dignified each line oh how the intrepid christian crowned the whole twas not the courtly period of the day formed to entrap the complimented fool twas not the airy fashionable page politely pert and musically dull the singsong nothing of some moonstruck elf twas genius spoke the language of the soul a language losty elegant and strong pathos of sense and energy of sound beyond the common flight of modern song beyond the tinsel of the rhimeing tribe which for the flimsy sonnet cull the flowers parnassian scarce deserving to be cropped the stinted scyons of the mountains foot to deck their may day garland of an hour beyond the soar of sentimental fools that delicately weave the web of wit and spin the silken moral from the brain industriously idle  cobwebthin the tender texture of a vacant skull and unsubstantial as the fairy scene formed by the frolicks of the fallen snow  far above such thy vigorous genius soared genius cherubic  near allied to heaven of heavenly themes ambitious  oh my son oh what a stroke upon the feeling heart oh what a fall to britain and to me and rises then my sorrow into guilt verges my fondness on impiety reason religion duty all forgot i almost mingle blushes with my woe confusion flings her crimson in my cheek and coloring conscience dies a deeper red fall did i say  say rather what a rise a rise highbounding to his native skies how great how vast how glorious how profound to us how vital  to himself how fair he wished for heaven and heaven has heard his prayer then let me hail his beatific shade  the wellrewarded spirit bowerd in bliss  yet nature feeble nature clinging to the chords and pressing hard upon the tender strings that move the finer feelings in our frame with arbitrary rage demands her claim and usurerlike exacts the parentsigh spite of the exultations i should feel the hymn of triumph and the peal of praise the tender tyrant tugs about my breast strikes on each pulse and sluices every vein  ah rebel nerves be still  or if too hard the thoughts of losing him the most adored bears on thy weaker sense  indulge a pause from nature  passion  torture and thyself oh turn my soul from the distracting theme probe not the agonizing wound too deep search not the sore with too minute an eye but from his dear idea turn away she turned  she stopped  but found no sweet relief the cormorant monster of the gorging grave had multiplied her woe  still ran her thoughts on some loved child which yet remained unsung another and another to her mind rose terrible  and starting thus she cried while grief in every feature wrote despair and shall i pass thee over thou gentle spirit  was there ought in thy propensions  or in thy way of journeying through the windings of this sad world  was there ought unfilial in thy feelings  ought undeserving or forbidding that should incline me to overlook thee  ah no  no  trust me gentle yorick i more than loved thee  there was a courtesy in thy demeanor  a milky and humane temperature about thy pulses  and a compassion in the turn of thy mind  however excursive  however retrograde  however digressive  that awaken the most tender recollection  a recollection which hurries the blood into the most affectionate extremities  gracious god what a throb was there  as i live  and as i love thee  and by the soul of thy venerable relation the tears are bathing my eyelashes while i am talking of thee  and could thou  oh that death should have made it necessary to cry alas in a parenthesis  could thou yorick at this moment lay thy hand upon my heart  the violence of the motion about the center would confess the mother  and the tumult of the vessels together with the rebounds of the pulsation might assure thee how thou art ranked in my estimation  estimation  hear me yorick there is another alas for thee  thou can not hear  genius has much to say of thee  thou were nothing else  thy heart and head and every delicate appendage were the constant champions of all the charities  all the civilities  thou had not indeed any parade  any ostensibility  or religious prudery about thee  but yet have thou done more to the cause of virtue than if thou had gone scowling through life  in all thy excursions  and whimsical meanders  sensibility took thee by the hand  by the heart i might have said  and made thee accessible to every tender entreaty  every soft petition found its way into thy pocket  the thing was irresistible  pity seconded the request sympathy thirded it  and if thou happily had nothing to bestow  why it was an hard case and would cost thee a tear  a drop of disappointment  an elixir to the sorrowing soul  a treasure rising from the fullness of a rich heart and it was given without grudging  so would it had it been crystal  i honored thy sentiments and i venerate thy memory  thou would not suffer a nettle to grow upon the grave of an enemy  nor shall genius ever suffer a weed to grow upon thine  peace  peace to thy shade  once more the matron ceased the mournful lay but the fresh anguish soon assailed her heart still called the populous tomb for her lament and bad her prove vicissitude of woe as thus she sighing spoke and now my loved shenstone for thee thou pride of the pastoral strain thou fairest resemblance of me dear elegant bard of the plain for thee will i pour the sad lay that shall echo the thickets among and weep as i muse on the day that robbed the poor swains of thy song full gentle and sweet was the note that flowed from his delicate heart simplicity smiled as he wrote and nature was polished by art but now as i look over thy bowers as each shrub and each stream i survey disaster invades the soft flowers for  oh  their loved masters away ah how should the woodlands be fair ah how the cool grottoes be gay the groves murmur death and despair the roses all droop and decay full well may they sorrow and fade  the dear shepherd that reared them is gone and well may the birds leave the shade  for their loves and their labors are flown then unseen let the eglantine blow unheeded the hyacynth lie unheard let the rivulets flow let the primroses flourish and die for the swain who should crop them is gone  he sung  and all nature admired he spoke  and all hearts were his own he fell  and all pity expired  scarce had she finished her disasterous song when thus again lamenting she began  i and oh she cried with frantic grief who now shall bring relief or where the cordial shall i find to soothe a mothers mind since lyttelton is dead well may ye hang the head and press your grassy bed ye conscious forests and ye waving groves for never shall ye see your master more to other scenes the aetherial spirit roves and tired of hagley seeks a fairer shore ii the muses listened to his polished strain and every wondering swain with pride came thronging to his rustic bower the dryads owned his power but when he waild his lovely lucy dead and his melodious sorrow told the shepherds leaned to hear the silvans dropped a tear then all in wild disorder fled rapt in the deepest shades recess they mourned their gentle lords distress and joined his prayers for lucy  but in vain iii and art thou gone my venerable son who shared with genius the exalted throne pride of my age and pillar of my care  mute is thy tuneful voice  o loss beyond repair ah lyttelton for thee the true tear long shall bathe this hoary breast for there thy worth and talents live impressed  engraved by sympathy oh fall severely felt to make a parent melt the tender breast to tear and wake despair and scarce a child the mighty grief to share iv how shall i paint the glories of his mind benevolent and kind his reason strong and elegantly clear to every virtue dear beyond the pride of pedant rules and maxims of the schools his genius knew the pleasing art to steal upon the heart to touch the finer passions of the mind and give the sterling moral to mankind v he was the very glory of my race even in the vale of life in reasons bloom adorned with every learned grace amidst the shouts of power and praise for many a year he wore the bays till tyrant death stopped his muchhonourd breath and swept the laureled hero to the tomb so when some oak that long supreme has stood the stately monarch of the imperial wood whose arms superior shed a verdure round and shadowed wide beneath the umbrageous ground long time we view its top impierce the skies its broad leaf flourish and its branches rise long time we gaze upon the glowing sight and eye with wonder its majestic height till time impatient for its destined prey full at the root directs the blow and down it drops below the mighty ruin of the groaning plain nor in lamenting the havoc which death has triumphantly made continued genius in the lettered generation can hawkesworth be forgotten a name which is particularly endeared to me by the affection which its owner bore to virtue and to science every stroke of his pen corresponding with every idea of his mind however playful or however pathetic always terminated in the most useful knowledge that knowledge which might regulate the conduct of life or afford tranquillity and quietude at the hour of expiration the ardour which uniformly animated his endeavors gave constant vigor to his thought activity to his powers and dignity to his sentiment nor did his excellence arise so much from the ambition which panted after fame and aimed at popularity  which appealed to the acclamations of the mob or sought the distinctions of this world as from the hearty hope of contributing in whatever degree to the investigation of truth the amendment of manners and the rectitude of the mind of those who have acquired a literary immortality there are few who could dispute with my hawkesworth strength of sense or elevation of expression and still fewer have given to the world so valuable or so copious a fund of virtuous entertainment amidst all the efforts of his intellect whether his instructions were prepared in the dress of history  or conveyed in the vehicle of fabulous narration  whether they assumed the graver style of argumentative profundity or whether they adopted the still deeper researches of philosophical raciocination  their constant greatness of design was equally apparent and the promotion of virtue was always strongly marked in the language of the writer my dear my regretted hawkesworth was indeed never long seduced by any temptations or abstracted by any scientific allurements from those views which are alone of intrinsic importance and which he well knew would retain that importance when all that now flutters to the fancy plays upon the passions and fascinates the heart shall confess their insignificance and fly like the atom that is driven before the tempest here interrupting broke upon her plaint the peering morn  the dundiscolourd clouds dispersing fast unveil the fleecy white fair dawns the newbornday and over the sky the ruddy crimson and the heavendipt blue mixed with the fainter yellows streaky gold chequering the air in rich variety fortell the suns uprise  from his broad beam too garish for the melancholy mind genius withdrew and closed her tender lay the end
