after the last days defeat proposes to the greeks to quit the siege and return to their country diomed opposes this and nestor seconds him praising his wisdom and resolution he orders the guard to be strengthened and a council summoned to deliberate what measures were to be followed in this emergency agamemnon pursues this advice and nestor farther prevails upon him to send ambassadors to achilles in order to move him to a reconciliation ulysses and ajax are made choice of who are accompanied by old phoenix they make each of them very moving and pressing speeches but are rejected with roughness by achilles who notwithstanding retains phoenix in his tent the ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp and the troops betake themselves to sleep  this book and the next following take up the space of one night which is the twenty seventh from the beginning of the poem the scene lies on the seashore the station of the grecian ships  the ninth book of the iliad thus joyful troy maintained the watch of night while fear pale comrade of inglorious flight and heavnbred horror on the grecian part sat on each face and saddend every heart as from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth a double tempest of the west and north swells over the sea from thracias frozen shore heaps waves on waves and bids the aegean roar this way and that the boiling deeps are tossed such various passions urged the troubled host great agamemnon grieved above the rest superior sorrows swelled his royal breast himself his orders to the heralds bears to bid to council all the grecian peers but bid in whispers these surround their chief in solemn sadness and majestic grief the king amidst the mournful circle rose down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows so silent fountains from a rocks tall head in sable streams softtrickling waters shed with more than vulgar grief he stood oppressed words mixed with sighs thus bursting from his breast ye sons of greece partake your leaders care fellows in arms and princes of the war of partial jove too justly we complain and heavenly oracles believed in vain a safe return was promised to our toils with conquest honored and enriched with spoils now shameful flight alone can save the host our wealth our people and our glory lost so jove decrees almighty lord of all jove at whose nod whole empires rise or fall who shakes the feeble props of human trust and towers and armies humbles to the dust haste then for ever quit these fatal fields haste to the joys our native country yields spread all your canvas all your oars employ nor hope the fall of heavndefended troy he said deep silence held the grecian band silent unmoved in dire dismay they stand a pensive scene till tydeus warlike son rolled on the king his eyes and thus begun when kings advise us to renounce our fame first let him speak who first has suffered shame if i oppose thee prince thy wrath withold the laws of council bid my tongue be bold thou first and thou alone in fields of fight durst brand my courage and defame my might nor from a friend the unkind reproach appeared the greeks stood witness all our army heard the gods o chief from whom our honors spring the gods have made thee but by halves a king they gave thee scepters and a wide command they gave dominion over the seas and land the noblest power that might the world control they gave thee not  a brave and virtuous soul is this a genrals voice that would suggest fears like his own to every grecian breast confiding in our want of worth he stands and if we fly it is what our king commands go thou inglorious from the embatteld plain ships thou have store and nearest to the main a nobler care the grecians shall employ to combat conquer and extirpate troy here greece shall stay or if all greece retire my self will stay till troy or i expire my self and sthenelus will fight for fame god bad us fight and twas with god we came he ceased the greeks loud acclamations raise and voice to voice resounds tydides praise wise nestor then his reverend figure reared he spoke the host in still attention heard o truly great in whom the gods have joined such strength of body with such force of mind in conduct as in courage you excel still first to act what you advise so well those wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves applauding greece with common voice approves kings thou can blame a bold but prudent youth and blame even kings with praise because with truth and yet those years that since thy birth have run would hardly style thee nestors youngest son then let me add what yet remains behind a thought unfinished in that generous mind age bids me speak nor shall the advice i bring distaste the people or offend the king cursed is the man and void of law and right unworthy property unworthy light unfit for public rule or private care that wretch that monster who delights in war whose lust is murder and whose horrid joy to tear his country and his kind destroy this night refresh and fortify thy train between the trench and wall let guards remain be that the duty of the young and bold but thou o king to council call the old great is thy sway and weighty are thy cares thy high commands must spirit all our wars with thracian wines recruit thy honored guests for happy counsels flow from sober feasts wise weighty counsels aid a state distressed and such a monarch as can choose the best see what a blaze from hostile tents aspires how near our fleet approach the trojan fires who can unmoved behold the dreadful light what eye beholds em and can close to night this dreadful interval determines all to morrow troy must flame or greece must fall thus spoke the hoary sage the rest obey swift through the gates the guards direct their way his son was first to pass the lofty mound the generous thrasymed in arms renowned next him ascalaphus iaalmen stood the double offspring of the warriorgod deipyrus aphareus merion join and lycomed of creons noble line sevn were the

counsels bent convened the princes in his ample tent each seized a portion of the kingly feast but stayed his hand when thirst and hunger ceast then nestor spoke for wisdom long approved and slowly rising thus the council moved monarch of nations whose superior sway assembled states and lords of earth obey the laws and scepters to thy hand are given and millions own the care of thee and heaven o king the counsels of my age attend with thee my cares begin in thee must end thee prince it fits alike to speak and hear pronounce with judgment with regard give ear to see no wholesome motion be withstood and ratify the best for public good nor though a meaner give advice repine but follow it and make the wisdom thine hear then a thought not now conceived in have at once my present judgment

around all this i give his vengeance to control and sure all this may move his mighty soul pluto the grizly god who never spares who feels no mercy and who hears no prayers lives dark and dreadful in deep hells abodes and mortals hate him as the worst of gods great though he be it fits him to obey since more than his my years and more my sway the monarch thus the reverend nestor then great agamemnon glorious king of men such are thy offers as a prince may take and such as fits a generous king to make let chosen delegates this hour be sent my self will name them to pelides tent let phaenix lead revered for hoary age great ajax next and ithacus the sage yet more to sanctify the word you send let hodius and eurybates attend now pray to jove to grant what greece demands pray in deep silence and with purest hands he said and all approved the heralds bring the cleansing water from the living spring the youth with wine the sacred goblets crowned and large libations drenched the sands around the rite performed the chiefs their thirst allay then from the royal tent they took their way wise nestor turns on each his careful eye forbids to offend instructs them to apply much he advised them all ulysses most to deprecate the chief and save the host through the still night they march and hear the roar of murmuring billows on the sounding shore to neptune ruler of the seas profound whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround they pour forth vows their embassy to bless and calm the rage of stern aeacides and now arrived where on the sandy bay the myrmidonian tents and vessels lay amused at ease the godlike man they found pleased with the solemn harps harmonious sound the wellwrought harp from conquered thebae came of polished silver was its costly frame with this he sooths his angry soul and sings the immortal deeds of heroes and of kings patroclus only of the royal train placed in his tent attends the lofty strain full opposite he sat and listened long in silence waiting till he ceased the song unseen the grecian embassy proceeds to his high tent the great ulysses leads achilles starting as the chiefs he spied leaped from his seat and laid the harp aside with like surprise arose menaetius son pelides grasped their hands and thus begun princes all hail whatever brought ye here or strong necessity or urgent fear welcome though greeks for not as foes ye came to me more dear than all that bear the name with that the chiefs beneath his roof he led and placed in seats with purple carpets spread then thus  patroclus crown a larger bowl mix purer wine and open every soul of all the warriors yonder host can send thy friend most honors these and these thy friend he said patroclus over the blazing fire heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire the brazen vase automedon sustains which flesh of porker sheep and goat contains achilles at the genial feast presides the parts transfixes and with skill divides mean while patroclus sweats the fire to raise the tent is brightned with the rising blaze then when the languid flames at length subside he strows a bed of glowing embers wide above the coals the smoking fragments turns and sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns with bread the glittering canisters they load which round the board menaetius son bestowed himself opposed to ulysses full in sight each portion parts and orders every rite the first fat offerings to the immortals due amidst the greedy flames patroclus threw then each indulging in the social feast his thirst and hunger soberly represt that done to phaenix ajax gave the sign not unperceived ulysses crowned with wine the foaming bowl and instant thus began his speech addressing to the godlike man health to achilles happy are thy guests not those more honored whom atrides feasts though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards that agamemnons regal tent affords but greater cares sit heavy on our souls not eased by banquets or by flowing bowls what scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear the dead we mourn and for the living fear greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands and owns no help but from thy saving hands troy and her aids for ready vengeance call their threatening tents already shade our wall hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim and point at every ship their vengeful flame for them the father of the gods declares theirs are his omens and his thunder theirs see full of jove avenging hector rise see heaven and earth the raging chief defies what fury in his breast what lightning in his eyes he waits but for the morn to sink in flame the ships the greeks and all the grecian name heavens how my countrys woes distract my mind lest fate accomplish all his rage designed and must we gods our heads inglorious lay in trojan dust and this the fatal day return achilles oh return though late to save thy greeks and stop the course of fate if in that heart or grief or courage lies rise to redeem ah yet to conquer rise the day may come when all our warriors slain that heart shall melt that courage rise in vain regard in time o prince divinely brave those wholesome counsels which thy father gave when peleus in his aged arms embraced his parting son these accents were his last my child with strength with glory and success thy arms may juno and minerva bless trust that to heaven  but thou thy cares engage to calm thy passions and subdue thy rage from gentler manners let thy glory grow and shun contention the sure source of woe that young and old may in thy praise combine the virtues of humanity be thine  this now despised advice thy father gave ah check thy anger and be truly brave if thou will yield to great atrides prayers gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares if not  but hear me while i number over the proffered presents an exhaustless store ten weighty talents of the purest gold and twice ten vases of refulgent mold sevn sacred tripods whose unsullied frame yet knows no office nor has felt the flame twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force and still victorious in the dusty course rich were the man whose ample stores exceed the prizes purchased by their winged speed sevn lovely captives of the lesbian line skilled in each art unmatched in form divine the same he chose for more than vulgar charms when lesbos sunk beneath thy conquering arms all these to buy thy friendship shall be paid and joined with these the long contested maid with all her charms briseis he will resign and solemn swear those charms were only thine untouched she stayed uninjurd she removes pure from his arms and guiltless of his loves these instant shall be thine and if the powers give to our arms proud ilions hostile towers then shall thou store when greece the spoil divides with gold and brass thy loaded navys sides besides full twenty nymphs of trojan race with copious love shall crown thy warm embrace such as thy self shall choose who yield to none or yield to helens heavenly charms alone yet hear me farther when our wars are over if safe we land on argos fruitful shore there shall thou live his son his honors share and with orestes self divide his care yet more  three daughters in his court are bred and each well worthy of a royal bed laodice and iphigenia fair and bright chrysothemis with golden hair her shall thou wed whom most thy eyes approve he asks no presents no reward for love himself will give the dower so vast a store as never father gave a child before sevn ample cities shall confess thy sway thee enope and phaerae thee obey cardamyle with ample turrets crowned and sacred pedasus for vines renowned aepea fair the pastures hyra yields and rich antheia with her flowery fields the whole extent to pylos sandy plain along the verdant margin of the main there heifers graze and laboring oxen toil bold are the men and generous is the soil there shall thou reign with power and justice crowned and rule the tributary realms around such are the proffers which this day we bring such the repentance of a suppliant king but if all this relentless thou disdain if honor and if interest plead in vain yet some redress to suppliant greece afford and be amongst her guardian gods adored if no regard thy suffering country claim hear thy own glory and the voice of fame for now that chief whose unresisted ire made nations tremble and whole hosts retire proud hector now the unequal fight demands and only triumphs to deserve thy hands then thus the goddessborn ulysses hear a faithful speech that knows nor art nor fear what in my secret soul is understood my tongue shall utter and my deeds make good let greece then know my purpose i retain nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain who dares think one thing and another tell my heart detests him as the gates of hell then thus in short my fixed resolves attend which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend long toils long perils in their cause i bore but now the unfruitful glories charm no more fight or not fight a like reward we claim the wretch and hero find their prize the same alike regretted in the dust he lies who yields ignobly or who bravely dies of all my dangers all my glorious pains a life of labors lo what fruit remains as the bold bird her helpless young attends from danger guards them and from want defends in search of prey she wings the spacious air and with the untasted food supplies her care for thankless greece such hardships have i braved her wives her infants by my labors saved long sleepless nights in heavy arms i stood and sweat laborious days in dust and blood i sacked twelve ample cities on the main and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain then at atrides haughty feet were laid the wealth i gathered and the spoils i made your mighty monarch these in peace possessed some few my soldiers had himself the rest some present too to every prince was paid and every prince enjoys the gift he made i only must refund of all his train see what preeminence our merits gain my spoil alone his greedy soul delights my spouse alone must bless his lustful nights the woman let him as he may enjoy but what is the quarrel then of greece to troy what to these shores the assembled nations draws what calls for vengeance but a womans cause are fair endowments and a beauteous face beloved by none but those of atreus race the wife whom choice and passion both approve sure every wise and worthy man will love nor did my fair one less distinction claim slave as she was my soul adored the dame wronged in my love all proffers i disdain deceived for once i trust not kings again ye have my answer  what remains to do your king ulysses may consult with you what needs he the defense this arm can make has he not walls no human force can shake has he not fenced his guarded navy round with piles with ramparts and a trench profound and will not these the wonders he has done repel the rage of priams single son there was a time it was when for greece i fought when hectors prowess no such wonders wrought he kept the verge of troy nor dared to wait achilles fury at the scaean gate he tried it once and scarce was saved by fate but now those ancient enmities are over to morrow we the favoring gods implore then shall you see our parting vessels crowned and hear with oars the hellespont resound the third day hence shall pthia greet our sails if mighty neptune send propitious gales pthia to her achilles shall restore the wealth he left for this detested shore thither the spoils of this long war shall pass the ruddy gold the steel and shining brass my beauteous captives thither i will convey and all that rests of my unravishd prey one only valued gift your tyrant gave and that resumed the fair lyrnessian slave then tell him loud that all the greeks may hear and learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear for armed in impudence mankind he braves and meditates new cheats on all his slaves though shameless as he is to face these eyes is what he dares not if he dares he dies tell him all terms all commerce i decline nor share his council nor his battle join for once deceived was his but twice were mine no  let the stupid prince whom jove deprives of sense and justice run where frenzy drives his gifts are hateful kings of such a kind stand but as slaves before a noble mind not though he proffered all himself possessed and all his rapine could from others wrest not all the golden tides of wealth that crown the manypeopled orchomenian town not all proud thebes unrivaled walls contain the worlds great empress on the egyptian plain that spreads her conquests over a thousand states and pours her heroes through a hundred gates two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars from each wide portal issuing to the wars though bribes were heaped on bribes in number more than dust in fields or sands along the shore should all these offers for my friendship call it is he that offers and i scorn them all atrides daughter never shall be led an illmatchd consort to achilles bed like golden venus though she charmed the heart and vyd with pallas in the works of art some greater greek let those high nuptials grace i hate alliance with a tyrants race if heaven restore me to my realms with life the reverend peleus shall elect my wife thessalian nymphs there are of form divine and kings that sue to mix their blood with mine blessed in kind love my years shall glide away content with just hereditary sway there deaf for ever to the martial strife enjoy the dear prerogative of life life is not to be bought with heaps of gold not all apollos pythian treasures hold or troy once held in peace and pride of sway can bribe the poor possession of a day lost herds and treasures we by arms regain and steeds unrivaled on the dusty plain but from our lips the vital spirit fled returns no more to wake the silent dead my fates long since by thetis were disclosed and each alternate life or fame proposed here if i stay before the trojan town short is my date but deathless my renown if i return i quit immortal praise for years on years and longextended days convinced though late i find my fond mistake and warn the greeks the wiser choice to make to quit these shores their native seats enjoy nor hope the fall of heavndefended troy joves arm displayed asserts her from the skies her hearts are strengthened and her glories rise go then to greece report our fixed design bid all your counsels all your armies join let all your forces all your arts conspire to save the ships the troops the chiefs from fire one stratagem has failed and others will ye find achilles is unconquered still go then  digest my message as ye may  but here this night let reverend phaenix stay his tedious toils and hoary hairs demand a peaceful death in pthias friendly land but whether he remain or sail with me his age be sacred and his will be free the son of peleus ceased the chiefs around in silence wrapped in consternation drowned attend the stern reply then phaenix rose down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows and while the fate of suffering greece he mourned with accents weak these tender words returned divine achilles will thou then retire and leave our hosts in blood our fleets on fire if wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind how shall thy friend thy phaenix stay behind the royal peleus when from pthias coast he sent thee early to the achaian host thy youth as then in sage debates unskilled and new to perils of the direful field he bade me teach thee all the ways of war to shine in councils and in camps to dare never ah never let me leave thy side no time shall part us and no fate divide not though the god that breathed my life restore the bloom i boasted and the port i bore when greece of old beheld my youthful flames delightful greece the land of lovely dames my father faithless to my mothers arms old as he was adored a strangers charms i tried what youth could do at her desire to win the damsel and prevent my sire my sire with curses loads my hated head and cries ye furies barren be his bed infernal jove the vengeful fiends below and ruthless proserpine confirmed his vow despair and grief distract my laboring mind gods what a crime my impious heart designed i thought but some kind god that thought suppressed to plunge the poniard in my fathers breast then meditate my flight my friends in vain with prayers entreat me and with force detain on fat of rams black bulls and brawny swine they daily feast with draughts of fragrant wine strong guards they placed and watched nine nights entire the roofs and porches flamed with constant fire the tenth i forced the gates unseen of all and favored by the night over leaped the wall my travels thence through spacious greece extend in pthias court at last my labors end your sire received me as his son caressed with gifts enriched and with possessions blessed the strong dolopians thenceforth owned my reign and all the coast that runs along the main by love to thee his bounties i repaid and early wisdom to thy soul conveyed great as thou art my lessons made thee brave a child i took thee but a hero gave thy infant breast a like affection showed still in my arms an everpleasing load or at my knee by phoenix would thou stand no food was grateful but from phoenix hand i pass my watchings over thy helpless years the tender labors the compliant cares the gods i thought reversed their hard decree and phoenix felt a fathers joys in thee thy growing virtues justified my cares and promised comfort to my silver hairs now by thy rage thy fatal rage resigned a cruel heart ill suits a manly mind the gods the only great and only wise are moved by offerings vows and sacrifice offending man their high compassion wins and daily prayers atone for daily sins prayers are joves daughters of celestial race lame are their feet and wrinkled is their face with humble mien and with dejected eyes constant they follow where injustice flies injustice swift erect and unconfined sweeps the wide earth and tramples over mankind while prayers to heal her wrongs move slow behind who hears these daughters of almighty jove for him they mediate to the throne above when man rejects the humble suit they make the sire revenges for the daughters sake from jove commissioned fierce injustice then descends to punish unrelenting men oh let not headlong passion bear the sway these reconciling goddesses obey due honors to the seed of jove belong due honors calm the fierce and bend the strong were these not paid thee by the terms we bring were rage still harbored in the haughty king nor greece nor all her fortunes should engage thy friend to plead against so just a rage but since what honor asks the general sends and sends by those whom most thy heart commends the best and noblest of the grecian train permit not these to sue and sue in vain let me my son an ancient fact unfold a great example drawn from times of old hear what our fathers were and what their praise who conquered their revenge in former days where calydon on rocky mountains stands once fought the aetolian and curetian bands to guard it those to conquer these advance and mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance the silver cynthia bade contention rise in vengeance of neglected sacrifice on oeneus fields she sent a monstrous boar that levelled harvests and whole forests tore this beast when many a chief his tusks had slain great meleager stretched along the plain then for his spoils a new debate arose the neighbor nations thence commencing foes strong as they were the bold curetes failed while meleagers thundering arm prevailed till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast for rage invades the wisest and the best cursed by althaea to his wrath he yields and in his wifes embrace forgets the fields she from marpessa sprung divinely fair and matchless idas more than man in war the god of day adored the mothers charms against the god the father bent his arms the afflicted pair their sorrows to proclaim from cleopatra changed this daughters name and called alcyone a name to show the fathers grief the mourning mothers woe to her the chief retired from stern debate but found no peace from fierce althaeas hate althaeas hate the unhappy warrior drew whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew she beat the ground and called the powers beneath on her own son to wreak her brothers death hell heard her curses from the realms profound and the red fiends that walk the nightly round in vain aetolia her delivrer waits war shakes her walls and thunders at her gates she sent ambassadors a chosen band priests of the gods and elders of the land besought the chief to save the sinking state their prayers were urgent and their proffers great full fifty acres of the richest ground half pasture green and half with vinyards crowned his suppliant father aged oeneus came his sisters followed even the vengeful dame althaea sues his friends before him fall he stands relentless and rejects em all mean while the victors shouts ascend the skies the walls are scaled the rolling flames arise at length his wife a form divine appears with piercing cries and supplicating tears she paints the horrors of a conquered town the heroes slain the palaces overthrown the matrons ravished the whole race enslaved the warrior heard he vanquished and he saved the aetolians long disdained now took their turn and left the chief their broken faith to mourn learn hence betimes to curb pernicious ire nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire accept the presents draw thy conquering sword and be amongst our guardian gods adored thus he the stern achilles thus replied my second father and my reverend guide thy friend believe me no such gifts demands and asks no honors from a mortals hands jove honors me and favors my designs his pleasure guides me and his will confines and here i stay if such his high behest while lifes warm spirit beats within my breast yet hear one word and lodge it in thy heart no more molest me on atrides part is it for him these tears are taught to flow for him these sorrows for my mortal foe a generous friendship no cold medium knows burns with one love with one resentment glows one should our interests and our passions be my friend must hate the man that injures me do this my phoenix it is a generous part and share my realms my honors and my heart let these return our voyage or our stay rest undetermined till the dawning day he ceased then ordered for the sages bed a warmer couch with numerous carpets spread with that stern ajax his long silence broke and thus impatient to ulysses spoke hence let us go  why waste we time in vain see what effect our low submissions gain liked or not liked his words we must relate the greeks expect them and our heroes wait proud as he is that ironheart retains its stubborn purpose and his friends disdains stern and unpitying if a brother bleed on just atonement we remit the deed a sire the slaughter of his son forgives the price of blood discharged the murderer lives the haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign and gifts can conquer every soul but thine the gods that unrelenting breast have steeled and cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield one womanslave was ravished from thy arms lo sevn are offered and of equal charms then hear achilles be of better mind revere thy roof and to thy guests be kind and know the men of all the grecian host who honor worth and prize thy valor most oh soul of battles and thy peoples guide to ajax thus the first of greeks replied well have thou spoke but at the tyrants name my rage rekindles and my souls on flame it is just resentment and becomes the brave disgraced dishonored like the vilest slave return then heroes and our answer bear the glorious combat is no more my care not till amidst yon sinking navy slain the blood of greeks shall dye the sable main not till the flames by hectors fury thrown consume your vessels and approach my own just there the impetuous homicide shall stand there cease his battle and there feel our hand this said each prince a double goblet crowned and cast a large libation on the ground then to their vessels through the gloomy shades the chiefs return divine ulysses leads meantime achilles slaves prepared a bed with fleeces carpets and soft linen spread there till the sacred morn restored the day in slumbers sweet the reverend phoenix lay but in his inner tent an ampler space achilles slept and in his warm embrace fair diomede of the lesbian race last for patroclus was the couch prepared whose nightly joys the beauteous iphis shared achilles to his friend consigned her charms when scyros fell before his conquering arms and now the elected chiefs whom greece had sent passed through the hosts and reached the royal tent then rising all with goblets in their hands the peers and leaders of the achaian bands hailed their return atrides first begun say what success divine laertes son achilles high resolves declare to all returns the chief or must our navy fall great king of nations  ithacus replied fixed is his wrath unconquered is his pride he slights thy friendship thy proposals scorns and thus implored with fiercer fury burns to save our army and our fleets to free is not his care but left to greece and thee your eyes shall view when morning paints the sky beneath his oars the whitening billows fly us too he bids our oars and sails employ nor hope the fall of heavnprotected troy for jove oershades her with his arm divine inspires her war and bids her glory shine such was his word what farther he declared these sacred heralds and great ajax heard but phoenix in his tent the chief retains safe to transport him to his native plains when morning dawns if other he decree his age is sacred and his choice is free ulysses ceased the great achaian host with sorrow seized in consternation lost attend the stern reply tydides broke the general silence and undaunted spoke why should we gifts to proud achilles send or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend his countrys woes he glories to deride and prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride be the fierce impulse of his rage obeyed our battles let him or desert or aid then let him arm when jove or he think fit that to his madness or to heaven commit what for our selves we can is always ours this night let due repast refresh our powers for strength consists in spirits and in blood and those are owed to generous wine and food but when the rosy messenger of day strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray ranged at the ships let all our squadrons shine in flaming arms a longextended line in the dread front let great atrides stand the first in danger as in high command shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise then each to heaven the due libations pays till sleep descending over the tents bestows the grateful blessings of desired repose observations on the ninth book observations on the ninth book i we have here a new scene of action opened the poet has hitherto given us an account of what happened by day only the two following books relate the adventures of the night  it may be thought that homer has crowded a great many actions into a very short time in the ninth book a council is convened an embassy sent a considerable time passes in the speeches and replies of the ambassadors and achilles in the tenth book a second council is called after this a debate is held dolon is intercepted diomed and ulysses enter into the enemys camp kill rhesus and bring away his horses and all this done in the narrow compass of one night  it must therefore be remembered that the ninth book takes up the first part of the night only that after the first council was dissolved there passed some time before the second was summoned as appears by the leaders being awakened by menelaus so that it was almost morning before diomed and ulysses set out upon their design which is very evident from the words of ulysses book  0      so that although a great many incidents are introduced yet every thing might easily have been performed in the allotted time  ii verse   from thracia s shore homer has been supposed by eratosthenes and others to have been guilty of an error in saying that zephyrus or the west wind blows from thrace whereas in truth it blows toward it but the poet speaks so either because it is fabled to be the rendezvous of all the winds or with respect to the particular situation of troy and the aegean sea either of these replies are sufficient to solve that objection  the particular parts of this comparison agree admirably with the design of homer to express the distraction of the greeks the two winds representing the different opinions of the armies one part of which were inclined to return the other to stay eustathius  iii verse    but bid in silence the reason why agamemnon commands his heralds to summon the leaders in silence is for fear the enemy should discover their consternation by reason of their nearness or perceive what their designs were in this extremity eustathius  iv verse    agamemnon s speech the critics are divided in their opinion whether this speech which is word for word the same with that he makes in lib   be only a feint to try the army as it is there or the real sentiments of the general dionysius of halicarnassus explains it as the former with whom madam dacier concurs she thinks they must be both counterfeit because they are both the same and believes homer would have varied them had the design been different she takes no notice that eustathius is of the contrary opinion as is also monsieur de la motte who argues as if he had read him  agamemnon says he in the second iliad thought himself assured of victory from the dream which jupiter had sent to him and in that confidence was desirous to bring the greeks to a battle but in the ninth book his circumstances are changed he is in the utmost distress and despair upon his defeat and therefore his proposal to raise the siege is in all probability sincere if homer had intended we should think otherwise he would have told us so as he did on the former occasion and some of the officers would have suspected a feint the rather because they had been imposed upon by the same speech before but none of them suspect him at all diomed thinks him so much in earnest as to reproach his cowardice nestor applauds diomeds liberty and agamemnon makes not the least defense for himself  dacier answers that homer had no occasion to tell us this was counterfeit because the officers could not but remember it to have been so before and as for the answers of diomed and nestor they only carry on the same feint as dionysius has proved whose reasons may be seen in the following note  i do not pretend to decide upon this point but which way soever it be i think agamemnons design was equally answered by repeating the same speech so that the repetition at least is not to be blamed in homer what obliged agamemnon to that feint in the second book was the hatred he had incurred in the army by being the cause of achilless departure this made it but a necessary precaution in him to try before he came to a battle whether the greeks were disposed to it and it was equally necessary in case the event should prove unsuccessful to free himself from the odium of being the occasion of it therefore when they were now actually defeated to repeat the same words was the readiest way to put them in mind that he had proposed the same advice to them before the battle and to make it appear unjust that their ill fortune should be charged upon him see the   th and   th notes on the second iliad  v verse    the speech of diomed i shall here translate the criticism of dionysius on this passage he asks what can be the drift of diomed when he insults agamemnon in his griefs and distresses for what diomed here says seems not only very ill timed but inconsistent with his own opinion and with the respect he had shown in the beginning of this very speech if i upbraid thee prince thy wrath withold the laws of council bid my tongue be bold this is the introduction of a man in temper who is willing to soften and excuse the liberty of what is to follow and what necessity only obliges him to utter but he subjoins a resentment of the reproach the king had formerly thrown upon him and tells him that jupiter had given him power and dominion without courage and virtue these are things which agree but ill together that diomed should upbraid agamemnon in his adversity with past injuries after he had endured his reproaches with so much moderation and had reproved sthenelus so warmly for the contrary practice in the fourth book if any one answer that diomed was warranted in this freedom by the bravery of his warlike behavior since that reproach he supposes this hero very ignorant how to demean himself in prosperity the truth is this whole accusation of diomeds is only a feint to serve the designs of agamemnon for being desirous to persuade the greeks against their departure he effects that design by this counterfeited anger and license of speech and seeming to resent that agamemnon should be capable of imagining the army would return to greece he artificially makes use of these reproaches to cover his argument this is farther confirmed by what follows when he bids agamemnon return if he pleases and affirms that the grecians will stay without him nay he carries the matter so far as to boast that if all the rest should depart himself and sthenelus alone would continue the war which would be extremely childish and absurd in any other view than this  vi verse    the speech of nestor  nestor continues dionysius seconds the oration of diomed we shall perceive the artifice of his discourse if we reflect to how little purpose it would be without this design he praises diomed for what he has said but does it not without declaring that he had not spoken fully to the purpose and fallen short in some points which he ascribes to his youth and promises to supply them then after a long preamble when he has turned himself several ways as if he was sporting in a new and uncommon vein of oratory he concludes by ordering the watch to their stations and advising agamemnon to invite the elders of the army to a supper there out of many counsels to choose the best all this at first sight appears absurd but we must know that nestor too speaks in figure diomed seems to quarrel with agamemnon purely to gratify him but nestor praises his liberty of speech as it were to vindicate a real quarrel with the king the end of all this is only to move agamemnon to supplicate achilles and to that end he so much commends the young mans freedom in proposing to call a council only of the eldest he consults the dignity of agamemnon that he might not be exposed to make this condescension before the younger officers and he concludes by an artful inference of the absolute necessity of applying to achilles from the present posture of their affairs see what a blaze from hostile tents aspires how near our fleets approach the trojan fires this is all nestor says at this time before the general assembly of the greeks but in his next speech when the elders only are present he explains the whole matter at large and openly declares that they must have recourse to achilles dion hal  p    plutarch de and poetis takes notice of this piece of decorum in nestor who when he intended to move for a mediation with achilles chose not to do it in public but proposed a private meeting of the chiefs to that end if what these two great authors have said be considered there will be no room for the trivial objection some moderns have made to this proposal of nestors as if in the present distress he did no more than impertinently advise them to go to supper  vii verse    they gave thee sceptres etc this is the language of a brave man to affirm and say boldly that courage is above scepters and crowns scepters and crowns were indeed in former times not hereditary but the recompense of valor with what art and haughtiness diomed sets himself indirectly above agamemnon eustathius  viii verse    and nearest to the main there is a secret stroke of satyr in these words diomed tells the king that his squadron lies next the sea insinuating that they were the most distant from the battle and readiest for flight eustathius  ix verse    god bade us fight and twas with god we came this is literal from the greek and therein may be seen the style of holy scripture where it is said that they come with god or that they are not come without god meaning that they did not come without his order numquid sine domino ascendi in terram istam says rabshekah to hezekiah in isaiah      this passage seems to be very beautiful homer adds it to show that the valor of diomed which puts him upon remaining alone with sthenelus when all the greeks were gone is not a rash and mad boldness but a reasonable one and founded on the promises of god himself who cannot lie dacier  x verse    oh truly great nestor could do no less than commend diomeds valor he had lately been a witness of it when he was preserved from falling into the enemys hands till he was rescued by diomed eustathius  xi verse    cursed is the man nestor says the same author very artfully brings in these words as a general maxim in order to dispose agamemnon to a reconciliation with achilles he delivers it in general terms and leaves the king to make the application this passage is translated with liberty for the original comprizes a great deal in a very few words    it will be proper to give a particular explication of each of these  says eustathius signifies one who is a vagabond or foreigner the athenians kept a register in which all that were born were enrolled whence it easily appeared who were citizens or not  therefore signifies one who is deprived of the privilege of a citizen  is one that had forfeited all title to be protected by the laws of his country  one that has no habitation or rather one that was not permitted to partake of any family sacrifice for  is a family goddess and jupiter sometimes is called   there is a sort of gradation in these words  signifies a man that has lost the privileges of his country  those of his own tribe and  those of his own family  xii verse    between the trench and wall it is almost impossible to make such particularities as these appear with any tolerable elegance in poetry and as they cannot be raised so neither must they be omitted this particular space here mentioned between the trench and wall is what we must carry in our mind through this and the following book otherwise we shall be at a loss to know the exact scene of the actions and councils that follow  xiii verse     the fires they light they lighted up a fire that they might not seem to be under any consternation but to be upon their guard against any alarm eustathius  xiv verse     when thirst and hunger ceast the conduct of homer in this place is very remarkable he does not fall into a long description of the entertainment but complies with the exigence of affairs and passes on to the consultation eustathius  xv verse     and make the wisdom thine eustathius thought that homer said this because in councils as in the army all is attributed to the princes and the whole honor ascribed to them but this is by no means homers thought what he here says is a maxim drawn from profoundest philosophy that which often does men the most harm is envy and the shame of yielding to advice which proceeds from others there is more greatness and capacity in following good advice than in proposing it by executing it we render it our own and we ravish even the property of it from its author and eustathius seems to incline to this thought when he afterward says homer makes him that follows good advice equal to him that gives it but he has not fully expressed himself dacier  xvi verse   0 at once my present judgment and my past nestor here by the word  means the advice he gave at the time of the quarrel in the first book he says as it was his opinion then that agamemnon ought not to disgrace achilles so after the maturest deliberation he finds no reason to alter it nestor here launches out into the praises of achilles which is a secret argument to induce agamemnon to regain his friendship by showing the importance of it eustathius  xvii verse     this wondrous hero it is remarkable that agamemnon here never uses the name of achilles though he is resolved to court his friendship yet he cannot bear the mention of his name the impression which the dissension made is not yet worn off though he expatiates in commendation of his valor eustathius  xviii verse     if gifts immense his mighty soul can bow the poet says eustathius makes a wise choice of the gifts that are to be proffered to achilles had he been ambitious of wealth there are golden tripods and ten talents of gold to bribe his resentment if he had been addicted to the fair sex there was a kings daughter and seven fair captives to win his favor or if he had been ambitious of greatness there were seven wealthy cities and a kingly power to court him to a reconciliation but he takes this way to show us that his anger was stronger than all his other passions it is farther observable that agamemnon promises these presents at three different times first at this instant secondly on the taking of troy and lastly after their return to greece this division in some degree multiplies them dacier  xix verse     ten weighty talents the ancient critics have blamed one of the verses in the enumeration of these presents as not sufficiently flowing and harmonious the pause is ill placed and one word does not fall easily into the other this will appear very plain if we compare it with a more numerous verse   the ear immediately perceives the music of the former line every syllable glides smoothly away without offending the ear with any such roughness as is found in the second the first runs as swiftly as the wind which it describes but the latter is a broken interrupted uneven verse but it is certainly pardonable in this place where the music of poetry is not necessary the mind is entirely taken up in learning what presents agamemnon intended to make achilles and is not at leisure to regard the ornaments of versification and even those pauses are not without their beauties as they would of necessity cause a stop in the delivery and so give time for each particular to sink into the mind of achilles eustathius  xx verse     sevn sacred tripods there were two kinds of tripods in the one they used to boil water the other was entirely for show to mix wine and water in says athenaeus the first were called  or cauldrons for common use and made to bear the fire the other were  and made chiefly for ornament it may be asked why this could be a proper present for achilles who was a martial man and regarded nothing but arms it may be answered that these presents were very well suited to the person to whom they were sent as tripods in ancient days were the usual prizes in games and they were given by achilles himself in those which he exhibited in honor of patroclus the same may be said of the female captives which are also among the prizes in the games of patroclus eustathius  xxi verse     twelve steeds unmatched from hence it is evident that games used to be celebrated in the grecian army during the time of war perhaps in honor of the deceased heroes for had agamemnon sent achilles horses that had been victorious before the beginning of the trojan war they would by this time have been too old to be of any value eustathius  xxii verse     laodice and iphigenia etc these are the names of agamemnons daughters among which we do not find electra but some affirm says eustathius that laodice and electra are the same as iphianassa is the same with iphigenia and she was called so either by way of surname or by reason of her complexion which was  flava or by way of derision  quasi  because she was an old maid as appears from euripides who says that she remained long a virgin  and in sophocles she says of herself  i wander a disconsolate unmarryd virgin which shows that it was ever looked upon as a disgrace to continue long so  xxiii verse     i ask no presents  my self will give the dower for in greece the bridegroom before he married was obliged to make two presents one to his betrothed wife and the other to his father in law this custom is very ancient it was practiced by the hebrews in the time of the patriarchs abrahams servant gave necklaces and earrings to rebecca whom he demanded for isaac genesis       shechem son of hamor says to jacob and his sons whose sister he was desirous to espouse ask me never so much dowry and gifts genesis       for the dowry was for the daughter this present served for her dowry and the other presents were for the father in the first book of samuel       saul makes them say to david who by reason of his poverty said he could not be son in law to the king the king desires not any dowry and in the two last passages we see the presents were commonly regulated by the father of the bride there is no mention in homer of any present made to the father but only of that which was given to the married daughter which was called  the dowry which the father gave to his daughter was called  wherefore agamemnon says here  dacier  xxiv verse  0  pluto the grizly god who never spares the meaning of this may be gathered from aeschylus cited here by eustathius    death is the only god who is not moved by offerings whom you cannot conquer by sacrifices and oblations and therefore he is the only god to whom no altar is erected and no hymns are sung  xxv verse     let phoenix lead how comes it to pass that phoenix is in the grecian camp when undoubtedly he retired with his pupil achilles eustathius says the ancients conjectured that he came to the camp to see the last battle and indeed nothing is more natural to imagine than that achilles would be impatient to know the event of the day when he was himself absent from the fight and as his revenge and glory were to be satisfied by the ill success of the grecians it is highly probable that he sent phoenix to enquire after it eustathius farther observes phoenix was not an ambassador but only the conductor of the embassy this is evident from the words themselves which are all along delivered in the dual number and farther from achilless requiring phoenix to stay with him when the other two departed  xxvi verse     great ajax next and ithacus the sage the choice of these persons is made with a great deal of judgment achilles could not but reverence the venerable phoenix his guardian and tutor ajax and ulysses had been disgraced in the first book line     as well as he and were therefore instances of that forgiveness they came to ask besides it was the greatest honor that could be done to achilles to send the most worthy personages in the army to him ulysses was inferior to none in eloquence but to nestor ajax was second to none in valor but to achilles  ajax might have an influence over him as a relation by descent from aeacus ulysses as an orator to these are joined hodius and eurybates two heralds which tho it were not customary yet was necessary in this place both to certify achilles that this embassage was the act of agamemnon himself and also to make these persons who had been witnesses before god and man of the wrong done to achilles in respect to briseis witnesses also of the satisfaction given him eustathius  xxvii verse     much he advised them all ulysses most there is a great propriety in representing nestor as so particularly applying himself on this occasion to ulysses though he of all men had the least need of his instructions yet it is highly natural for one wise man to talk most to another  xxviii verse     pleased with the solemn harps harmonious sound  homer says plutarch to prove what an excellent use may be made of music feigned achilles to compose by this means the wrath he had conceived against agamemnon he sung to his harp the noble actions of the valiant and the achievements of heroes and demigods a subject worthy of achilles homer moreover teaches us in this fiction the proper season for music when a man is at leisure and unemployd in greater affairs for achilles so valorous as he was had retired from action through his displeasure to agamemnon and nothing was better suited to the martial disposition of this hero than these heroic songs that prepared him for the deeds and toils he afterward undertook by the celebration of the like in those who had gone before him such was the ancient music and to such purposes it was applied plut of music the same author relates in the life of alexander that when the lyre of paris was offered to that prince he made answer he had little value for it but much desired that of achilles on which he sung the actions of heroes in former times  xxix verse     princes all hail this short speech is wonderfully proper to the occasion and to the temper of the speaker one is under a great expectation of what achilles will say at the sight of these heroes and i know nothing in nature that could satisfy it but the very thing he here accosts them with  xxx verse     mix purer wine the meaning of this word  is very dubious some say it signifies warm wine from  ferveo according to aristotle it is an adverb and implies to mix wine quickly and others think it signifies pure wine in this last sense herodotus uses it  which in english is thus when the spartans have an inclination to drink their wine pure and not diluted they propose to drink after the manner of the scythians some of whom coming ambassadors to sparta taught cleomenes to drink his wine unmixed i think this sense of the word is most natural and achilles might give this particular order not to dilute the wine so much as usually because the ambassadors who were brave men might be supposed to be much fatigued in the late battle and to want a more than usual refreshment eustathius see plutarch symp l   c    xxxi verse     patroclus over the blazing fire etc the reader must not expect to find much beauty in such descriptions as these they give us an exact account of the simplicity of that age which for all we know might be a part of homers design there being no doubt a considerable change of customs in greece from the time of the trojan war to those wherein our author lived and it seemed demanded of him to omit nothing that might give the greeks an idea of the manners of their predecessors but however that matter stood it should methinks be a pleasure to a modern reader to see how such mighty men whose actions have survived their persons three thousand years lived in the earliest ages of the world the ambassadors found this hero says eustathius without any attendants he had no ushers or waiters to introduce them no servile parasites about him the latter ages degenerated into these pieces of state and pageantry  the supper also is described with an equal simplicity three princes are busied in preparing it and they who made the greatest figure in the field of battle thought it no disparagement to prepare their own repast the objections some have made that homers gods and heroes do every thing for themselves as if several of those offices were unworthy of them proceeds from the corrupt idea of modern luxury and grandeur whereas in truth it is rather a weakness and imperfection to stand in need of the assistance and ministry of others but however it be methinks those of the nicest taste might relish this entertainment of homers when they consider these great men as soldiers in a camp in whom the least appearance of luxury would have been a crime  xxxii verse     patroclus over the blazing fire madam daciers general note on this passage deserves to be transcribed  homer says she is in the right not to avoid these descriptions because nothing can properly be called vulgar which is drawn from the manner and usages of persons of the first dignity and also because in his tongue even the terms of cookery are so noble and of so agreeable a sound and he likewise knows how to place them so well as to extract a perfect harmony from them so that he may be said to be as excellent a poet when he describes these small matters as when he treats of the greatest subjects it is not so either with our manners or our language cookery is left to servants and all its terms so low and disagreeable even in the sound that nothing can be made of them that has not some taint of their meanness this great disadvantage made me at first think of abridging this preparation of the repast but when i had well considered it i was resolved to preserve and give homer as he is without retrenching any thing from the simplicity of the heroic manners i do not write to enter the list against homer i will dispute nothing with him my design is only to give an idea of him and to make him be understood the reader will therefore forgive me if this description has none of its original graces  xxxiii verse     in a brazen vase the word  signifies the vessel and not the meat itself as euphorion conjectured giving it as a reason that homer makes no mention of boiled meat but this does not hinder but that the meat might be parboiled in the vessel to make it roast the sooner this with some other notes on the particulars of this passage belong to eustathius and madam dacier ought not to have taken to herself the merit of his explanations  xxxiv verse     and sprinkles sacred salt many reasons are given why salt is called sacred or divine but the best is because it preserves things incorrupt and keeps them from dissolution so thunder says plutarch sympos l   qu  0 is called divine because bodies struck with thunder will not putrify besides generation is divine because god is the principle of all things and salt is most operative in generation lycophron calls it  for this reason venus was feigned by the poets to spring from the sea  xxxv verse     to phoenix ajax gave the sign ajax who was a rough soldier and no orator is impatient to have the business over he makes a sign to phoenix to begin but ulysses prevents him perhaps ulysses might flatter himself that his oratory would prevail upon achilles and so obtain the honor of making the reconciliation himself or if he were repulsed there yet remained a second and third resource in ajax and phoenix who might renew the attempt and endeavor to shake his resolution there would still be some hopes of success as one of these was his guardian the other his relation one may farther add to these reasons of eustathius that it would have been improper for phoenix to have spoken first since he was not an ambassador and therefore ulysses was the fitter person as being empowered by that function to make an offer of the presents in the name of the king  xxxvi verse     health to achilles there are no discourses in the iliad better placed better timed or that give a greater idea of homers genius than these of the ambassadors to achilles these speeches are not only necessarily demanded by the occasion but disposed with art and in such an order as raises more and more the pleasure of the reader ulysses speaks the first the character of whose discourse is a welladdressd eloquence so the mind is agreeably engaged by the choice of his reasons and applications achilles replies with a magnanimous freedom whereby the mind is elevated with the sentiments of the hero phoenix discourses in a manner touching and pathetick whereby the heart is moved and ajax concludes with a generous disdain that leaves the soul of the reader inflamed this order undoubtedly denotes a great poet who knows how to command attention as he pleases by the arrangement of his matter and i believe it it not possible to propose a better model for the happy disposition of a subject these words are monsieur de la mottes and no testimony can be more glorious to homer than this which comes from the mouth of an enemy  xxxvii verse     not those more honored whom atrides feasts i must just mention daciers observation with what cunning ulysses here slides in the odious name of agamemnon as he praises achilles that the ear of this impetuous man might be familiarizd to that name  xxxviii verse     he waits but for the morn to sink in flame the ships the greeks etc there is a circumstance in the original which i have omitted for fear of being too particular in an oration of this warmth and importance but as it preserves a piece of antiquity i must not forget it here he says that hector will not only fire the fleet but bear off the statues of the gods which were carved on the prows of the vessels these were hung up in the temples as a monument of victory according to the custom of those times  xxxix verse     but hear me while i number over the proffered presents monsieur de la motte finds fault with homer for making ulysses in this place repeat all the offers of agamemnon to achilles not to answer that it was but necessary to make known to achilles all the proposals or that this distinct enumeration served the more to move him i think one may appeal to any person of common taste whether the solemn recital of these circumstances does not please him more than the simple narration could have done which monsieur de la motte would have put in its stead ulysses made all the offers agamemnon had commissioned him  xl verse  0  achilles s speech nothing is more remarkable than the conduct of homer in this speech of achilles he begins with some degree of coolness as in respect to the ambassadors whose persons he esteemed yet even there his temper just shows itself in the insinuation that ulysses had dealt artfully with him which in two periods rises into an open detestation of all artifice he then falls into a sullen declaration of his resolves and a more sedate representation of his past services but warms as he goes on and every minute he but names his wrongs flies out into extravagance his rage awakened by that injury is like a fire blown by a wind that sinks and rises by fits but keeps continually burning and blazes but the more for those intermissions  xli verse     as the bold bird etc this simile says la motte must be allowed to be just but was not fit to be spoken in a passion one may answer that the tenderness of the comparison renders it no way the less proper to a man in a passion it being natural enough the more one is disgusted at present the more to recollect the kindness we have formerly shown to those who are ungrateful eustathius observes that so soft as the simile seems it has nevertheless its fierte for achilles herein expresses his contempt for the greeks as a weak defenseless people who must have perished if he had not preserved them and indeed if we consider what is said in the preceding note it will appear that the passion of achilles ought not as yet to be at the height  xlii verse     i sacked twelve ample cities eustathius says that the anger of achilles not only throws him into tautology but also into ambiguity for says he these words may either signify that he destroyed twelve cities with his ships or barely cities with twelve ships but eustathius in this place is like many other commentators who can see a meaning in a sentence that never entered into the thoughts of an author it is not easy to conceive how achilles could have expressed himself more clearly there is no doubt but  agrees with the same word that  does in the following line which is certainly  and there is a manifest enumeration of the places he had conquered by sea and by land  xliii verse   0 the wife whom choice and passion both approve sure every wise and worthy man will love the argument of achilles in this place is very apropos with reference to the case of agamemnon if i translated it verbatim i must say in plain english every honest man loves his wife thus homer has made this rash this fiery soldier governed by his passions and in the rage of youth bear testimony to his own respect for the ladies but it seems poltis king of thrace was of another opinion who would have parted with two wives out of pure goodnature to two mere strangers as i have met with the story somewhere in plutarch when the greeks were raising forces against troy they sent ambassadors to this poltis to desire his assistance he inquired the cause of the war and was told it was the injury paris had done menelaus in taking his wife from him if that be all said the good king let me accomodate the difference indeed it is not just the greek prince should lose a wife and on the other side it is pity the trojan should want one now i have two wives and to prevent all this mischief i will send one of them to menelaus and the other to paris it is a shame this story is so little known and that poor poltis yet remains uncelebrated i cannot but recommend him to the modern poets  xliv verse     your king ulysses may consult with you achilles still remembers what agamemnon said to him when they quarreled other brave warriors will be left behind to follow me in battle as we have seen in the first book he answers here without either sparing ajax or ulysses as much his friends as they are they have their share in this stroke of raillery eustathius  xlv verse     has he not walls this is a bitter satyr says eustathius against agamemnon as if his only deeds were the making of this wall this ditch these pallisades to defend himself against those whom he came to besiege there was no need of these retrenchments whilst achilles fought but as dacier observes this satyr does not affect agamemnon only but nestor too who had advised the making of these retrenchments and who had said in the second book if there are a few who separate themselves from the rest of the army let them stay and perish     probably this had been reported to achilles and that hero revenges himself here by mocking these retrenchments  xlvi verse     pthia the third day hence etc monsieur de la motte thinks the mention of these minute circumstances not to agree with the passionate character of the speaker that he shall arrive at pthia in three days that he shall find there all the riches he left when he came to the siege and that he shall carry other treasures home dacier answers that we need only consider the present situation of achilles and his cause of complaint against agamemnon and we shall be satisfied here is nothing but what is exactly agreeable to the occasion to convince the ambassadors that he will return home he instances the easiness of doing it in the space of three days agamemnon had injured him in the point of booty he therefore declares he had sufficient treasures at home and that he will carry off spoils enough and women enough to make amends for those that prince had ravished from him every one of these particulars marks his passion and resentment  xlvii verse     one only valued gift your tyrant gave the injury which agamemnon offered to achilles is still uppermost in his thoughts he has but just dismissed it and now returns to it again these repetitions are far from being faults in achilless wrath whose anger is perpetually breaking out upon the same injury  xlviii verse     kings of such a kind stand but as slaves before a noble mind the words in the greek are i despise him as a carian the carians were people of boeotia the first that sold their valor and were ready to fight for any that gave them their pay this was looked upon as the vilest of actions in those heroical ages i think there is at present but one nation in the world distinguished for this practice who are ready to prostitute their hands to kill for the highest bidder  eustathius endeavors to give many other solutions of this place as that  may be mistaken for  from  pediculus but this is too mean and trivial to be homers sentiment there is more probability that it comes from   and so  by the change of the eta into alpha and then the meaning will be that achilles hates him as much as hell or death agreeable to what he had said a little before    verse  00 not all proud thebes etc these several circumstances concerning thebes are thought by some not to suit with that emotion with which achilles here is supposed to speak but the contrary will appear true if we reflect that nothing is more usual for persons transported with anger than to insist and return to such particulars as most touch them and that exaggeration is a figure extremely natural in passion achilles therefore by showing the greatness of thebes its wealth and extent does in effect but show the greatness of his own soul and of that insuperable resentment which renders all these riches though the greatest in the world contemptible in his sight when he compares them with the indignity his honor has received  l verse  00 proud thebes unrivaled walls etc the city which the greeks call thebes the egyptians heliopolis says diodorus lib   part   was in circuit a hundred and forty stadia adorned with stately buildings magnificent temples and rich donations it was not only the most beautiful and noble city of egypt but of the whole world the fame of its wealth and grandeur was so celebrated in all parts that the poet took notice of it in these words      though others affirm it had not a hundred gates but several vast porches to the temples from whence the city was called the hundredgated only as having many gates yet it is certain it furnished twenty thousand chariots of war for there were a hundred stables along the river from memphis to thebes toward lybia each of which contained two hundred horses the ruins whereof are shown at this day the princes from time to time made it their care to beautify and enlarge this city to which none under the sun was equal in the many and magnificent treasures of gold silver and ivory with innumerable colossuss and obelisques of one entire stone there were four temples admirable in beauty and greatness the most ancient of which was in circuit thirteen stadia and five and forty cubits in height with a wall of four and twenty foot broad the ornaments and offerings within were agreeable to this magnificence both in value and workmanship the fabric is yet remaining but the gold silver ivory and precious stones were ransacked by the persians when cambyses burned the temples of egypt there were found in the rubbish above three hundred talents of gold and no less than two thousand three hundred of silver the same author proceeds to give many instances of the magnificence of this great city the description of the sepulchers of their kings and particularly that of osymanduas is perfectly astonishing to which i refer the reader  strabo farther informs us that the kings of thebes extended their conquests as far as scythia bactria and india  li verse     not all apollo s pythian treasures the temple of apollo at delphos was the richest temple in the world by the offerings which were brought to it from all parts there were statues of massy gold of a human size figures of animals in gold and several other treasures a great sign of its wealth is that the phocians pillaged it in the time of philip the son of amyntas which gave occasion to the holy war it is said to have been pillaged before and that the great riches of which homer speaks had been carried away eustathius  lii verse   0 the vital spirit bled returns no more nothing sure could be better imagined or more strongly paint achilless resentment than this commendation which homer puts into his mouth of a long and peaceable life that hero whose very soul was possessed with love of glory and who preferred it to life itself lets his anger prevail over this his darling passion he despises even glory when he cannot obtain that and enjoy his revenge at the same time and rather than lay this aside becomes the very reverse of himself  liii verse     my fates long since by thetis were disclosed it was very necessary for homer to put the reader more than once in mind of this piece of achilless story there is a remark of monsieur de la motte which deserves to be transcribed entire on this occasion  the generality of people who do not know achilles by the iliad and who upon a most noted fable conceive him invulnerable all but in the heel find it ridiculous that he should be placed at the head of heroes so true it is that the idea of valor implies it always from danger  should a giant well armed fight against a legion of children whatever slaughter he should make the pity any one would have for them would not turn at all to any admiration of him and the more he should applaud his own courage the more one would be offended at his pride   achilles had been in this case if homer besides all the superiority of strength he has given him had not found the art of putting likewise his greatness of soul out of all suspicion  he has perfectly well succeeded in feigning that achilles before his setting out to the trojan war was sure of meeting his death the destinies had proposed to him by the mouth of thetis the alternative of a long and happy but obscure life if he stayed in his own state or of a short but glorious one if he embraced the vengeance of the greeks he wishes for glory in contempt of death and thus all his actions all his motions are so many proofs of his courage he runs in hastening his exploits to a death which he knows infallibly attends him what does it avail him that he routs every thing almost without resistance it is still true that he every moment encounters and faces the sentence of his destiny and that he devotes himself generously for glory homer was so sensible that this idea must force a concern for hero that he scatters it throughout his poem to the end that the reader having it always in view may esteem achilles even for what he performs without the least danger    live verse     how shall thy friend thy phoenix stay behind this is a strong argument to persuade achilles to stay but dressed up in the utmost tenderness the venerable old man rises with tears in his eyes and speaks the language of affection he tells him that he would not be left behind him though the gods would free him from the burden of old age and restore him to his youth but in the midst of so much fondness he couches a powerful argument to persuade him not to return home by adding that his father sent him to be his guide and guardian phoenix ought not therefore to follow the inclinations of achilles but achilles the directions of phoenix eustathius  the art of this speech of phoenix says dionysius  lib   consists in his seeming to agree with all that achilles had said achilles he sees will depart and he must go along with him but in assigning the reasons why he must go with him he proves that achilles ought not to depart and thus while he seems only to show his love to his pupil in his inability to stay behind him he indeed challenges the others gratitude for the benefits he had conferred upon him in his infancy and education at the same time that he moves achilles he gratifies agamemnon and that this was the real design which he disguised in that manner we are informed by achilles himself in the reply he makes for homer and all the authors that treat of this figure generally contrive it so that the answers made to these kind of speeches discover all the art and structure of them achilles therefore asks him is it for him these tears are taught to flow for him these sorrows for my mortal foe you see the scholar reveals the art and dissimulation of his master and as phoenix had recounted the benefits done him he takes off that expostulation by promising to divide his empire with him as may be seen in the same answer  lv verse     he sent thee early to the achaian host achilles says eustathius according to some of the ancients was but twelve years old when he went to the wars of troy  and it may be gathered from what the poet here relates of the education of achilles under phoenix that the fable of his being tutored by chiron was the invention of latter ages and unknown to homer  mr bail in his article of achilles has very well proved this he might indeed as he grew up have learned music and physic of chiron without having him formally as his tutor for it is plain from this speech that he was put under the direction of phoenix as his governor in morality when his father sent him along with him to the siege of troy  lvi verse     my father faithless to my mothers arms etc homer has been blamed for introducing two long stories into this speech of phoenix this concerning himself is said not to be in the proper place and what achilles must needs have heard over and over it also gives say they a very ill impression of phoenix himself and makes him appear a very unfit person to be a teacher of morality to the young hero it is answered that though achilles might have known the story before in general it is proboble phoenix had not till now so pressing an occasion to make him discover the excess his fury had transported him to in attempting the life of his own father the whole story tends to represent the dreadful effects of passion and i cannot but think the example is the more forcible as it is drawn from his own experience  lvii verse     to win the damsel the counsel that this mother gives to her son phoenix is the same that achitophel gave to absalom to hinder him from ever being reconciled to david et ait achitophel ad absalom ingredere ad concubinos patris tui quas dimisit ad custodiendam domum ut cum audierit omnis israel quod foedaveris patrem tuum roborentur tecum manus eorum   samuel     0 dacier  lviii verse     prevent my sire this decency of homer is worthy observation who to remove all the disagreeable ideas which might proceed from this intrigue of phoenix with his fathers mistress took care to give us to understand in one single word that amyntor had no share in her affections which makes the action of phoenix the more excusable he does it only in obedience to his mother in order to reclaim his father and oblige him to live like her husband besides his father had yet no commerce with this mistress to whose love he pretended had it been otherwise and had phoenix committed this sort of incest homer would neither have presented this image to his reader nor peleus chosen phoenix to be governor to achilles dacier  lix verse     infernal jove the greek is  the ancients gave the name of jupiter not only to the god of heaven but likewise to the god of hell as is seen here and to the god of the sea as appears from aeschylus they thereby meant to show that one sole deity governed the world and it was to teach the same truth that the ancient statuaries made statues of jupiter which had three eyes priam had one of them in that manner in the court of his palace which was there in laomedons time after the taking of troy when the greeks shared the booty it fell to stheneluss lot who carried it into greece dacier  lx verse     despair and grief distract etc i have taken the liberty to replace here four verses which aristarchus had cut out because of the horror which the idea gave him of a son who is going to kill his father but perhaps aristarchuss niceness was too great these verses seem to me necessary and have a very good effect for phoenixs aim is to show achilles that unless we overcome our wrath we are exposed to commit the greatest crimes he was going to kill his own father achilles in the same manner is going to let his father phoenix and all the greeks perish if he does not appease his wrath plutarch relates these four verses in his treatise of reading the poets and adds  aristarchus frightened at this horrible crime cut out these verses but they do very well in this place and on this occasion phoenix intending to show achilles what wrath is and to what abominable excesses it hurries men who do not obey reason and who refuse to follow the counsels of those that advise them these sort of curtailings from homer often contrary to all reason gave room to lucian to feign that being in the fortunate islands he asked homer a great many questions among other things says he in his second book of his true history i asked him whether he had made all the verses which had been rejected in his poem he assured me they were all his own which made me laugh at the impertinent and bold criticisms of zenodorus and aristarchus who had retrenched them dacier  lxi verse     i pass my watchings over thy helpless years in the original of this place phoenix tells achilles that as he placed him in his infancy on his lap he has often cast up the wine he had drank upon his clothes i wish i had any authority to say these verses were foisted into the text for though the idea be indeed natural it must be granted to be so very gross as to be utterly unworthy of homer nor do i see any color to soften the meanness of it such images in any age or country must have been too nauseous to be described  lxii verse     prayers are jove s daughters nothing can be more beautiful noble or religious than this divine allegory we have here goddesses of homers creation he sets before us their pictures in lively colors and gives these fancied beings all the features that resemble mankind who offer injuries or have recourse to prayers  prayers are said to be the daughters of jove because it is he who teaches man to pray they are lame because the posture of a suppliant is with his knee on the ground they are wrinkled because those that pray have a countenance of dejection and sorrow their eyes are turned aside because through an awful regard to heaven they dare not lift them thither they follow ate or injury because nothing but prayers can atone for the wrongs that are offered by the injurious ate is said to be strong and swift of foot etc because injurious men are swift to do mischief this is the explanation of eustathius with whom dacier agrees but when she allows the circumstance of lameness to intimate the custom of kneeling in prayer she forgets that this contradicts her own assertion in one of the remarks on iliad   where she affirms that no such custom was used by the greeks and indeed the contrary seems inferred in several places of homer particularly where achilles says in the  0  th verse of the eleventh book the greeks shall stand round his knees supplicating to him the phrases in that language that signify praying are derived from the knee only as it was usual to lay hold on the knee of the person to whom they supplicated  a modern author imagines ate to signify divine justice a notion in which he is single and repugnant to all the mythologists besides the whole context in this place and the very application of the allegory to the present case of achilles whom he exhorts to be moved by prayers notwithstanding the injustice done him by agamemnon makes the contrary evident  lxiii verse     not greece nor all her fortunes plato in the third book of his republic condemns this passage and thinks it very wrong that phoenix should say to achilles that if they did not offer him great presents he would not advise him to be appeased but i think there is some injustice in this censure and that plato has not rightly entered into the sense of phoenix who does not look upon these presents on the side of interest but honor as a mark of agamemnons repentance and of the satisfaction he is ready to make wherefore he says that honor has a mighty power over great spirits dacier  lxiv verse     permit not these to sue and sue in vain in the original it is    i am pretty confident there is not any manner of speaking like this used throughout all homer nor two substantives so odly coupled to a verb as  and  in this place we may indeed meet with such little affectations in ovid  aurigam puriter animaque rotisque expulit  and the like but the taste of the ancients in general was too good for these fooleries i must have leave to think the verse  etc an interpolation the sense is complete without it and the latter part of the line  seems but a tautology after what is said in the six verses preceding  lxv verse     let me my son an ancient fact unfold phoenix says eustathius lays down as the foundation of his story that great men in former ages were always appeased by presents and entreaties and to confirm this position he brings meleager as an instance but it may be objected that meleager was an ill chosen instance being a person whom no entreaties could move the superstructure of this story seems not to agree with the foundation eustathius solves the difficulty thus homer did not intend to give an instance of a heros compliance with the entreaties of his friends but to show that they who did not comply were sufferers themselves in the end so that the connection of the story is thus the heroes of former times were used always to be won by presents and entreaties meleager only was obstinate and suffered because he was so  the length of this narration cannot be taxed as unseasonable it was at full leisure in the tent and in the night a time of no action yet i cannot answer but the tale may be tedious to a modern reader i have translated it therefore with all possible shortness as will appear upon a comparison the piece itself is very valuable as it preserves to us a part of ancient history that had otherwise been entirely lost as quintilian has remarked the same great critic commends homers manner of relating it narrare quis significantius potest quam qui curetum aetolorumque praelia exponit lib  0 c    lxvi verse     alcyone a name to show etc it appears says madam dacier by this passage and by others already observed that the greeks often gave names as did the hebrews not only with respect to the circumstances but likewise to the accidents which happened to the fathers and mothers of those they named thus cleopatra is called alcyone from the lamentations of her mother i cannot but think this digression concerning idas and marpessa too long and not very much to the purpose  lxvii verse  0  she paints the horrors of a conquered town the heroes slain the palaces overthrown the matrons ravished the whole race enslaved it is remarkakable with what art homer here in a few words sums up the miseries of a city taken by assault  it had been unpardonable for cleopatra to have made a long representation to meleager of these miseries when every moment that kept him from the battle could not be spared it is also to be observed how perfectly the features of meleager resemble achilles they are both brave men ambitious of glory both of them described as giving victory to their several armies while they fought and both of them implacable in their resentment eustathius  lxviii verse     achilles s answer to phoenix the character of achilles is excellently sustained in all his speeches to ulysses he returns a flat denial and threatens to leave the trojan shores in the morning to phoenix he gives a much gentler answer and begins to mention agamemnon with less disrespect  after ajax had spoken he seems determined not to depart but yet refuses to bear arms till it is to defend his own squadron thus achilless character is every where of a piece he begins to yield and not to have done so would not have spoke him a man to have made him perfectly inexorable had shown him a monster thus the poet draws the heat of his passion cooling by slow degrees which is very natural to have done otherwise had not been agreeable to achilless temper nor the readers expectation to whom it would have been shocking to have seen him passing from the greatest storm of anger to a quiet calmness eustathius  lxix verse     while lifes warm spirit beats within my breast eustathius observes here with a great deal of penetration that these words of achilles include a sort of oracle which he does not understand for it sometimes happens that men full of their objects say things which besides the sense natural and plain to every body include another supernatural which they themselves do not understand and which is understood by those only who have penetration enough to see through the obscurity of it thus oedipus often speaks in sophocles and holy scripture furnishes us with great examples of enthusiastic speeches which have a double sense here we manifestly see that achilles in speaking a very simple and common thing foretells without thinking of it that his abode on that fatal shore will equal the course of his life and consequently that he shall die there and this double meaning gives a sensible pleasure to the reader dacier  lxx verse     the speech of ajax i have before spoken of this short soldierlike speech of ajax dionysius of halicarnassus says of it that the person who entreats most and with most liberty who supplicates most and presses most is ajax it is probable that ajax rises up when he speaks the word let us go he does not vouchsafe to address himself to achilles but turns himself to ulysses and speaks with a martial eloquence  lxxi verse     the price of blood discharged it was the custom for the murderer to go into banishment one year but if the relations of the person murdered were willing the criminal by paying them a certain fine might buy off the exile and remain at home it may not be amiss to observe that  quasi  properly signifies a mulct paid for murder ajax sums up this argument with a great deal of strength we see says he a brother forgive the murder of his brother a father that of his son but achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman eustathius  lxxii verse     revere the roof and to thy guests be kind eustathius says there is some difficulty in the original of this place why should ajax draw an argument to influence achilles by putting him in mind to reverence his own habitation the latter part of the verse explains the former we says ajax are under your roof and let that protect us from any ill usage send us not away from your house with contempt who came hither as friends as supplicants as ambassadors  lxxiii verse     well have thon spoke but at the tyrants name my rage rekindles we have here the true picture of an angry man and nothing can be better imagined to heighten achilless wrath he owns that reason would induce him to a reconciliation but his anger is too great to listen to reason he speaks with respect to them but upon mentioning agamemnon he flies into rage anger is in nothing more like madness than that madmen will talk sensibly enough upon any indifferent matter but upon the mention of the subject that caused their disorder they fly out into their usual extravagance  lxxiv verse     such was his word it may be asked here why ulysses speaks only of the answer which achilles made him at first and says nothing of the disposition to which the discourses of phoenix and ajax had brought him the question is easily answered it is because achilles is obstinate in his resentment and that if at length a little moved by phoenix and shaken by ajax he seemed disposed to take arms it is not out of regard to the greeks but only to save his own squadron when hector after having put the greeks to the sword shall come to insult it thus this inflexible man abates nothing of his rage it is therefore prudent in ulysses to make this report to agamemnon to the end that being put out of hopes of the aid with which he flattered himself he may concert with the leaders of the army the measures necessary to save his fleet and troops eustathius  lxxv verse     why should we gifts etc this speech is admirably adapted to the character of diomed every word is animated with a martial courage and worthy to be delivered by a gallant soldier he advised fighting in the beginning of the book and continues still in that opinion and he is no more concerned at the speech of achilles now than he was at that of agamemnon before  the tenth book of the iliad the argument the nightadventure of diomed and ulysses upon the refusal of achilles to return to the army the distress of agamemnon is described in the most lively manner he takes no rest that night but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contriving all possible methods for the public safety menelaus nestor ulysses and diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains they call a council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemys camp to learn their posture and discover their intentions diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise and makes choice of ulysses for his companion in their passage they surprise dolon whom hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the grecians from him they are informed of the situation of the trojan and auxiliary forces and particularly of rhesus and the thracians who were lately arrived they pass on with success kill rhesus with several of his officers and seize the famous horses of that prince with which they return in triumph to the camp  the same night continues the scene lies in the two camps  the tenth book of the iliad all night the chiefs before their vessels lay and lost in sleep the labors of the day all but the king with various thoughts oppressed his countrys cares lay rolling in his breast as when by lightenings joves aetherial power foretells the rattling hail or weighty shower or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore or bids the brazen throat of war to roar by fits one flash succeeds as one expires and heaven flames thick with momentary fires so bursting frequent from atrides breast sighs following sighs his inward fears confessed now over the fields dejected he surveys from thousand trojan fires the mounting blaze hears in the passing wind their music blow and marks distinct the voices of the foe now looking backwards to the fleet and coast anxious he sorrows for the endangered host he rends his hairs in sacrifice to jove and sues to him that ever lives above inly he groans while glory and despair divide his heart and wage a doubtful war a thousand cares his laboring breast revolves to seek sage nestor now the chief resolves with him in wholesome counsels to debate what yet remains to save the afflicted state he rose and first he cast his mantle round next on his feet the shining sandals bound a lions yellow spoils his back concealed his warlike hand a pointed javelin held meanwhile his brother pressed with equal woes alike denied the gifts of soft repose laments for greece that in his cause before so much had suffered and must suffer more a leopards spotted hide his shoulders spread a brazen helmet glittered on his head thus with a javelin in his hand he went to wake atrides in the royal tent already waked atrides he descried his armor buckling at his vessels side joyful they met the spartan thus begun why puts my brother his bright armor on sends he some spy amidst these silent hours to try yon camp and watch the trojan powers but say what hero shall sustain that task such bold exploits uncommon courage ask guideless alone through nights dark shade to go and midst a hostile camp explore the foe to whom the king in such distress we stand no vulgar counsels our affairs demand greece to preserve is now no easy part but asks high wisdom deep design and art for jove averse our humble vows denies and bows his head to hectors sacrifice what eye has witnessed or what ear believed in one great day by one great arm achieved such wondrous deeds as hectors hand has done and we beheld the last revolving sun what honors the beloved of jove adorn sprung from no god and of no goddess born yet such his acts as greeks unborn shall tell and curse the battle where their fathers fell now speed thy hasty course along the fleet there call great ajax and the prince of creet our self to hoary nestor will repair to keep the guards on duty be his care for nestors influence best that quarter guides whose son with merion over the watch presides to whom the spartan these thy orders born say shall i stay or with dispatch return there shall thou stay the king of men replied else may we miss to meet without a guide the paths so many and the camp so wide still with your voice the sloathful soldiers raise urge by their fathers fame their future praise forget we now our state and lofty birth not titles here but works must prove our worth to labor is the lot of man below and when jove gave us life he gave us woe this said each parted to his several cares the king to nestors sable ship repairs the sage protector of the greeks he found stretched in his bed with all his arms around the variouscolourd scarf the shield he rears the shining helmet and the pointed spears the dreadful weapons of the warriors rage that old in arms disdained the peace of age then leaning on his hand his watchful head the hoary monarch raised his eyes and said what art thou speak that on designs unknown while others sleep thus range the camp alone seekst thou some friend or nightly sentinel stand off approach not but thy purpose tell o son of neleus thus the king rejoined pride of the greeks and glory of thy kind lo here the wretched agamemnon stands the unhappy general of the grecian bands whom jove decrees with daily cares to bend and woes that only with his life shall end scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain and scarce my heart support its load of pain no taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known confused and sad i wander thus alone with fears distracted with no fixed design and all my peoples miseries are mine if ought of use thy waking thoughts suggest since cares like mine deprive thy soul of rest impart thy counsel and assist thy friend now let us jointly to the trench descend at every gate the fainting guard excite tired with the toils of day and watch of night else may the sudden foe our works invade so near and favored by the gloomy shade to him thus nestor trust the powers above nor think proud hectors hopes confirmed by jove how ill agrees the views of vain mankind and the wise counsels of the eternal mind audacious hector if the gods ordain that great achilles rise and rage again what toils attend thee and what woes remain lo faithful nestor thy command obeys the care is next our other chiefs to raise ulysses diomed we chiefly need mages for strength oileus famed for speed some other be dispatched of nimbler feet to those tall ships remotest of the fleet where lie great ajax and the king of crete to rouse the spartan i my self decree dear as he is to us and dear to thee yet must i tax his sloth that claims no share with his great brother in this martial care him it behooved to every chief to sue preventing every part performed by you for strong necessity our toils demands claims all our hearts and urges all our hands to whom the king with reverence we allow thy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now my generous brother is of gentle kind he seems remiss but bears a valiant mind through too much defrence to our sovereign sway content to follow when we lead the way but now our ills industrious to prevent long ever the rest he rose and sought my tent the chiefs you named already at his call prepare to meet us near the navywall assembling there between the trench and gates near the nightguards our chosen council waits then none said nestor shall his rule withstand for great examples justify command with that the venerable warrior rose the shining greaves his manly legs enclose his purple mantle golden buckles joined warm with the softest wool and doubly lined then rushing from his tent he snatched in have his steely lance that lightened as he past the camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd stopped at ulysses tent and called aloud ulysses sudden as the voice was sent awakes starts up and issues from his tent what new distress what sudden cause of fright thus leads you wandering in the silent night o prudent chief the pylian sage replied wise as thou art be now thy wisdom tried whatever means of safety can be sought whatever counsels can inspire our thought whatever methods or to fly or fight all all depend on this important night he heard returned and took his painted shield then joined the chiefs and followed through the field without his tent bold diomed they found all sheathed in arms his brave companions round each sunk in sleep extended on the field his head reclining on his bossy shield a wood of spears stood by that fixed upright shot from their flashing points a quivering light a bulls black hide composed the heros bed a splendid carpet rolled beneath his head then with his foot old nestor gently shakes the slumbering chief and in these words awakes rise son of tydeus to the brave and strong rest seems inglorious and the night too long but sleepst thou now when from yon hills the foe hangs over the fleet and shades our walls below at this soft slumber from his eyelids fled the warrior saw the hoary chief and said wondrous old man whose soul no respite knows though years and honors bid thee seek repose let younger greeks our sleeping warriors wake ill fits thy age these toils to undertake my friend he answered generous is thy care these toils my subjects and my sons might bear their loyal thoughts and pious loves conspire to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire but now the last despair surrounds our host no hour must pass no moment must be lost each single greek in this conclusive strife stands on the sharpest edge of death or life yet if my years thy kind regard engage employ thy youth as i employ my age succeed to these my cares and rouse the rest he serves me most who serves his country best this said the hero over his shoulders slung a lions spoils that to his ankles hung then seized his ponderous lance and strode along meges the bold with ajax famed for speed the warrior roused and to the entrenchments led and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard a wakeful squadron each in arms prepared the unwearied watch their listening leaders keep and couching close repel invading sleep so faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain with toil protected from the prowling train when the gaunt lioness with hunger bold springs from the mountains towered the guarded fold throbreaking woods her rustling course they hear loud and more loud the clamours strike their ear of hounds and men they start they gaze around watch every side and turn to every sound thus watched the grecians cautious of surprise each voice each motion drew their ears and eyes each step of passing feet increased thaffright and hostile troy was ever full in sight nestor with joy the wakeful band surveyed and thus accosted through the gloomy shade it is well my sons your nightly cares employ else must our host become the scorn of troy watch thus and greece shall live  the hero said then over the trench the following chieftains led his son and godlike merion marched behind for these the princes to their council joined the trenches past the assembled kings around in silent state the consistory crowned a place there was yet undefiled with gore the spot where hector stopped his rage before when night descending from his vengeful hand reprieved the relics of the grecian band the plain beside with mangled corpse was spread and all his progress marked by heaps of dead there sat the mournful kings when neleus son the council opening in these words begun is there he said a chief so greatly brave his life to hazard and his country save lives there a man who singly dares to go to yonder camp or seize some straggling foe or favored by the night approach so near their speech their counsels and designs to hear if to besiege our navies they prepare or troy once more must be the seat of war this could he learn and to our peers recite and pass unharmd the dangers of the night what fame were his through all succeeding days while phoebus shines or men have tongues to praise what gifts his grateful country would bestow what must not greece to her delivrer owe a sable ewe each leader should provide with each a sable lambkin by her side at every rite his share should be increased and his the foremost honors of the feast fear held them mute alone untaught to fear tydides spoke  the man you seek is here through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way some god within commands and i obey but let some other chosen warrior join to raise my hopes and second my design by mutual confidence and mutual aid great deeds are done and great discovries made the wise new prudence from the wise acquire and one brave hero fans anothers fire contending leaders at the word arose each generous breast with emulation glows so brave a task each ajax strove to share bold merion strove and nestors valiant heir the spartan wished the second place to gain and great ulysses wished nor wished in vain then thus the king of men the contest ends thou first of warriors and thou best of friends undaunted diomed what chief to join in this great enterprise is only thine just be thy choice without affection made to birth or office no respect be paid let worth determine here the monarch spoke and inly trembled for his brothers sake then thus the godlike diomed rejoined my choice declares the impulse of my mind how can i doubt while great ulysses stands to lend his counsels and assist our hands a chief whose safety is minervas care so famed so dreadful in the works of war blessed in his conduct i no aid require wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire it fits thee not before these chiefs of fame replied the sage to praise me or to blame praise from a friend or censure from a foe are lost on hearers that our merits know but let us haste  night rolls the hours away the redning orient shows the coming day the stars shine fainter on thaetherial plains and of nights empire but a third remains thus having spoke with generous ardour pressed in arms terrific their huge limbs they dressed a twoedged faulchion thrasymed the brave and ample buckler to tydides gave then in a leathern helm he cased his head short of its crest and with no plume overspread such as by youths unused to arms are worn no spoils enrich it and no studs adorn next him ulysses took a shining sword a bow and quiver

five girls beside the reverend herald told rich was the son in brass and rich in gold not blessed by nature with the charms of face but swift of foot and matchless in the race hector he said my courage bids me meet this high achievement and explore the fleet but first exalt thy scepter to the skies and swear to grant me the demanded prize the immortal courses and the glittering car that bear

around his shoulders hung a ferrets downy fur his helmet lined and in his hand a pointed javelin shined then never to return he sought the shore and trod the path his feet must tread no more scarce had he passed the steeds and trojan throng still bending forward as he coursd along when on the hollow way the approaching tread ulysses marked and thus to diomed o friend i hear some step of hostile feet moving this way or hastening to the fleet some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main or nightly pillager that strips the slain yet let him pass and win a little space then rush behind him and prevent his pace but if too swift of foot he flies before confine his course along the fleet and shore betwixt the camp and him our spears employ and intercept his hoped return to troy with that they stepped aside and stooped their head as dolon passed behind a heap of dead along the path the spy unwary flew soft at just distance both the chiefs pursue so distant they and such the space between as when two teams of mules divide the green to whom the hind like shares of land allows when now few furrows part the approaching ploughs now dolon listening heard them as they past hector he thought had sent and checked his have till scarce at distance of a javelins throw no voice succeeding he perceived the foe as when two skilful hounds the levret wind or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind now lost now seen they intercept his way and from the herd still turn the flying prey so fast and with such fears the trojan flew so close so constant the bold greeks pursue now almost on the fleet the dastard falls and mingles with the guards that watch the walls when brave tydides stopped a generous thought inspired by pallas in his bosom wrought lest on the foe some forward greek advance and snatch the glory from his lifted lance then thus aloud whoever thou art remain this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain he said and high in air the weapon cast which wilful erred and over his shoulder past then fixed in earth against the trembling wood the wretch stood propd and quiverd as he stood a sudden palsy seized his turning head his loose teeth chatterd and his color fled the panting warriors seize him as he stands and with unmanly tears his life demands o spare my youth and for the breath i owe large gifts of price my father shall bestow vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told and steel well tempered and refulgent gold to whom ulysses made this wise reply whoever thou art be bold nor fear to die what moves thee say when sleep has closed the sight to roam the silent fields in dead of night came thou the secrets of our camp to find by hector prompted or thy daring mind or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led through heaps of carnage to despoil the

achilles car and those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war urged me unwilling this attempt to make to learn what counsels what resolves you take if now subdued you fix your hopes on flight and tired with toils neglect the watch of night bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize  ulysses with a scornful smile replies far other rulers those proud steeds demand and scorn the guidance of a

and as the wretch prepared with humble blandishment to stroke his beard like lightning swift the wrathful faulchion flew divides the neck and cuts the nerves in two one instant snatched his trembling

this said the spoils with dropping gore defaced high on a spreading tamarisk he placed then heaped with reeds and gathered boughs the plain to guide their footsteps to the place again through the still night they cross the devious fields slippery with blood over arms and heaps of shields arriving where the thracian squadrons lay and eased in sleep the labors of the day ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band the horses yoked beside each warrior stand their arms in order on the ground reclined through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined amidst lay rhesus stretched in sleep profound and the white steeds behind his chariot bound the welcome sight ulysses first descries and points to diomed the tempting prize the man the coursers and the car behold described by dolon

this said her heros bosom warms breathed in his heart and strung his nervous arms where ever he passed a purple stream pursued his thirsty faulchion fat with hostile blood bathed all his footsteps died the fields with gore and a low groan remurmurd through the shore so the grim lion from his nightly den oerleaps the fences and invades the pen on sheep or goats resistless in his way he falls and foaming rends the guardless prey nor stopped the fury of his vengeful hand till twelve lay breathless of the thracian band ulysses following as his partner slew back by the foot each slaughtered warrior drew the milkwhite coursers studious to convey safe to the ships he wisely cleared the way lest the fierce steeds not yet to battles bred should start and tremble at the heaps of dead now twelve dispatched the monarch last they found tydides faulchion fixed him to the ground just then a deathful dream minerva sent a warlike form appeared before his tent whose visionary steel his bosom tore so dreamed the monarch and awaked no more ulysses now the snowy steeds detains and leads them fastened by the silver reins these with his bow unbent he lashed along the scourge forgot on rhesus

where rhesus armor lay or heave with manly force and lift away while unresolved the son of tydeus stands pallas appears and thus her chief commands enough my son from farther slaughter cease regard thy safety and depart in peace haste to the ships the gotten spoils enjoy nor tempt too far the hostile gods of troy the voice divine confessed the martial maid in haste he mounted and her word obeyed the coursers fly before ulysses bow swift as the wind and white as wintersnow not unobserved they passed the god of light had watched his troy and marked minervas flight saw tydeus son with heavenly succor blessed and vengeful anger filled his sacred breast swift to the trojan camp descends the power and wakes hippocoon in the morninghour on rhesus side accustomed to attend a faithful kinsman and instructive friend he rose and saw the field deformed with blood an empty space where late the coursers stood the yetwarm thracians panting on the coast for each he wept but for his rhesus most now while on rhesus name he calls in vain the gathering tumult spreads over all the plain on heaps the trojans rush with wild affright and wondering view the slaughters of the night mean while the chiefs arriving at the shade where late the spoils of hectors spy were laid ulysses stopped to him tydides bore the trophee dropping yet with dolons gore then mounts again again their nimble feet the coursers ply and thunder toward the fleet old nestor first perceived the approaching sound bespeaking thus the grecian peers around methinks the noise of trampling steeds i hear thickning this way and gathering on my ear perhaps some horses of the trojan breed so may ye gods my pious hopes succeed the great tydides and ulysses bear returned triumphant with this prize of war yet much i fear ah may that fear be vain the chiefs outnumberd by the trojan train perhaps even now pursued they seek the shore or oh perhaps those heroes are no more scarce had he spoke when lo the chiefs appear and spring to earth the greeks dismiss their fear with words of friendship and extended hands they greet the kings and nestor first demands say thou whose praises all our host proclaim thou living glory of the grecian name say whence these coursers by what chance bestowed the spoil of foes or present of a god not those fair steeds so radiant and so gay that draw the burning chariot of the day old as i am to age i scorn to yield and daily mingle in the martial field but sure till now no coursers struck my sight like these conspicuous through the ranks of fight some god i deem conferred the glorious prize blessed as ye are and favorites of the skies the care of him who bids the thunder roar and minerva her whose fury bathes the world with gore father not so sage ithacus rejoined the gifts of heaven are

other spoils from conquered dolon came a wretch whose swiftness was his only fame by hector sent our forces to explore he now lies headless on the sandy shore then over the trench the bounding coursers flew the joyful greeks with loud acclaim pursue strait to tydides high pavilion born the matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn the neighing coursers their new fellows greet and the full racks are heaped with generous wheat but dolons armor to his ships conveyed high on the painted stern ulysses laid a trophy destined to the blueeyd maid now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain they cleanse their bodies in the neighboring main then in the polished bath refreshed from toil their joints they supple with dissolving oil in due repast indulge the genial hour and first to pallas the libations pour they sit rejoicing in her aid divine and the crowned goblet foams with floods of wine observations on the tenth book observations on the tenth book i it is observable says eustathius that the poet very artfully repairs the loss of the last day by this nocturnal stratagem and it is plain that such a contrivance was necessary the army was dispirited and achilles inflexible but by the success of this adventure the scale is turned in favor of the grecians  ii verse   all but the king etc homer here with a very small alteration repeats the verses which begin the second book he introduces agamemnon with the same pomp as he did jupiter he ascribes to him the same watchfulness over men as he exercised over the gods and jove and agamemnon are the only persons awake while heaven and earth are asleep eustathius  iii verse   or sends soft snows scaligers criticism against this passage that it never lightens and snows at the same time is sufficiently refuted by experience see bossu of the epic poem lib   c   and barness note on this place  iv verse   or bids the brazen throat of war to roar there is something very noble and sublime in this image the vast jaws of war is an expression that very poetically represents the voraciousness of war and gives us a lively idea of an insatiate monster eustathius  v verse   by fits one flash succeeds etc it requires some skill in homer to take the chief point of his similitudes he has often been misunderstood in that respect and his comparisons have frequently been strained to comply with the fancies of commentators this comparison which is brought to illustrate the frequency of agamemnons sighs has been usually thought to represent in general the groans of the king whereas what homer had in his view was only the quick succession of them  vi verse    now over the fields etc aristotle answers a criticism of some censurers of homer on this place they asked how it was that agamemnon shut up in his tent in the night could see the trojan camp at one view and the fleet at another as the poet represents it it is says aristotle only a metaphorical manner of speech to cast ones eye means but to reflect upon or to revolve in ones mind and that employed agamemnons thoughts in his tent which had been the chief object of his eyes the day before  vii verse    he rends his hairs in sacrifice to jove i know this action of agamemnon has been taken only as a common expression of grief and so indeed it was rendered by accius as cited by tully tusc quaest l   scindens dolor identidem intonsam comam but whoever reads the context will i believe be of opinion that jupiter is mentioned here on no other account than as he was applied to in the offering of these hairs in an humble supplication to the offended deity who had so lately manifested his anger  viii verse    he rose and first he cast his mantle round i fancy it will be entertaining to the reader to observe how well the poet at all times suits the descriptions to the circumstances of the persons we must remember that this book continues the actions of one night the whole army is now asleep and the poet takes this opportunity to give us a description of several of his heroes suitable to their proper characters agamemnon who is every where described as anxious for the good of his people is kept awake by a fatherly care for their preservation menelaus for whose sake the greeks had suffered so greatly shares all their misfortunes and is restless while they are in danger nestor a provident wise old man sacrifices his rest even in the extremity of age to his love for his country ulysses a person next to nestor in wisdom is ready at the first summons he finds it hard while the greeks suffer to compose himself to sleep but is easily awaked to march to its defense but diomed who is every where described as a daring warrior sleeps unconcerned at the nearness of the enemy and is not awaked without some violence he is said to be asleep but he sleeps like a soldier in complete arms  i could not pass over one circumstance in this place in relation to nestor it is a pleasure to see what care the poet takes of his favorite councellor he describes him lying in a soft bed wraps him up in a warm cloak to preserve his age from the coldness of the night but diomed a gallant young hero sleeps upon the ground in open air and indeed every warrior is dressed in arms peculiar to that season the hide of a lion or leopard is what they all put on being not to engage an enemy but to meet their friends in council eustathius  ix verse    sends he some spy etc menelaus in this place starts a design which is afterward proposed by nestor in council the poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other and that the valiant would be ready to execute a design which so venerable a counselor had formed eustathius  x verse    such wondrous deeds as hector s hand etc we hear agamemnon in this place launching into the praises of a gallant enemy but if any one think that he raises the actions of hector too high and sets him above achilles himself this objection will vanish if he considers that he commends him as the bravest of mere men but still he is not equal to achilles who was descended from a goddess agamemnon undoubtedly had achilles in his thoughts when he says sprung from no god etc but his anger will not let him even name the man whom he thus obliquely praises  eustathius proceeds to observe that the poet ascribes the gallant exploits of hector to his piety and had he not been favored by jove he had not been thus victorious  he also remarks that there is a double tautology in this speech of agamemnon as  and  this proceeds from the wonder which the king endeavors to express at the greatness of hectors actions he labors to make his words answer the great idea he had conceived of them and while his mind dwells upon the same object he falls into the same manner of expressing it this is very natural to a person in his circumstances whose thoughts are as it were pent up and struggle for an utterance  xi verse    the paths so many etc it is plain from this verse as well as from many others that the art of fortification was in some degree of perfection in homers days here are lines drawn that traverse the camp every way the ships are drawn up in the manner of a rampart and sally ports made at proper distances that they might without difficulty either retire or issue out as the occasion should require eustathius  xii verse    seekst thou some friend or nightly sentinel it has been thought that nestor asks this question upon the account of his son thrasymedes who commanded the guard that night he seems to be under some apprehension lest he should have remitted the watch and it may also be gathered from this passage that in those times the use of the watchword was unknown because nestor is obliged to crowd several questions together before he can learn whether agamemnon be a friend or an enemy the shortness of the questions agrees admirably with the occasion upon which they were made it being necessary that nestor should be immediately informed who he was who passed along the camp if a spy that he might stand upon his guard if a friend that he might not cause an alarm to be given to the army by multiplying questions eustathius  xiii verse    lo here the wretched agamemnon stands eustathius observes that agamemnon here paints his distress in a very pathetical manner while the meanest soldier is at rest the general wanders about disconsolate and is superior now in nothing so much as in sorrow but this sorrow proceeds not from a base abject spirit but from a generous disposition he is not anxious for the loss of his own glory but for the sufferings of his people it is a noble sorrow and springs from a commendable tenderness and humanity  xiv verse     my generous brother is of gentle kind agamemnon is every where represented as the greatest example of brotherly affection and he at all times defends menelaus but never with more address than now nestor had accused menelaus of sloth the king is his advocate but pleads his excuse only in part he does not entirely acquit him because he would not contradict so wise a man as nestor nor does he condemn him because his brother at this time was not guilty but he very artfully turns the imputation of nestor to the praise of menelaus and affirms that what might seem to be remissness in his character was only a deference to his authority and that his seeming inactivity was but an unwillingness to act without command eustathius  xv verse     a wood of spears stood by etc the picture here given us of diomed sleeping in his arms with his soldiers about him and the spears sticking upright in the earth has a near resemblance to that in the first book of samuel chapter      saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him  xvi verse     from yon hill the foe etc it is necessary if we would form an exact idea of the battles of homer to carry in our minds the place where each action was fought it will therefore be proper to enquire where that eminence stood upon which the trojans encamped this night eustathius is inclinable to believe it was callicolone the situation of which you will find in the map of homers battles but it will appear from what dolon says     of hectors being encamped at the monument of ilus that this eminence must be the tumulus on which that monument was situate and so the old scholiast rightly explains it  xvii verse     but now the last despair surrounds our host the different behavior of nestor upon the same occasion to different persons is worthy observation agamemnon was under a concern and dejection of spirit from the danger of his army to raise his courage nestor gave him hopes of success and represented the state of affairs in the most favorable view but he applies himself to diomed who is at all times enterprizing and incapable of despair in a far different manner he turns the darkest side to him and gives the worst prospect of their condition this conduct says eustathius shows a great deal of prudence it is the province of wisdom to encourage the disheartened with hopes and to qualify the forward courage of the daring with fears that the valor of the one may not sink through despair nor that of the other fly out into rashness  xviii verse  0  and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard it is usual in poetry to pass over little circumstances and carry on the greater menelaus in this book was sent to call some of the leaders the poet has too much judgment to dwell upon the trivial particulars of his performing his message but lets us know by the sequel that he had performed it it would have clogged the poetical narration to have told us how menelaus waked the heroes to whom he was dispatched and had been but a repetition of what the poet had fully described before he therefore says the same author drops these particularities and leaves them to be supplied by the imagination of the reader it is so in painting the painter does not always draw at the full length but leaves what is wanting to be added by the fancy of the beholder  xix verse     so faithful dogs etc this simile is in all its parts just to the description it is meant to illustrate the dogs represent the watch the flock the greeks the fold their camp and the wild beast that invades them hector the place posture and circumstance are painted with the utmost life and nature  eustathius takes notice of one particular in this description which shows the manner in which their sentinels kept the guard the poet tells us that they sat down with their arms in their hands i think that this was not so prudent a method as is now used it being almost impossible for a man that stands to drop asleep whereas one that is seated may easily be overpowered by the fatigue of a long watch eustathius  xx verse     then over the trench the following princes led the reason why nestor did not open the council within the trenches was with a design to encourage the guards and those whom he intended to send to enter the trojan camp it would have appeared unreasonable to send others over the entrenchments upon a hazardous enterprise and not to have dared himself to set a foot beyond them this also could not fail of inflaming the courage of the grecian spies who would know themselves not to be far from assistance while so many of the princes were passed over the ditch as well as they eustathius  xxi verse     is there he said a chief so greatly brave nestor proposes his design of sending spies into the trojan army with a great deal of address he begins with a general sentence and will not choose any one hero for fear of disgusting the rest had nestor named the person he would have paid him a complement that was sure to be attended with the hazard of his life and that person might have believed that nestor exposed him to a danger which his honor would not let him decline while the rest might have resented such a partiality which would have seemed to give the preference to another before them it therefore was wisdom in nestor to propose the design in general terms whereby all the gallant men that offered themselves satisfied their honor by being willing to share the danger with diomed and it was no disgrace to be left behind after they had offered to hazard their lives for their country eustathius  xxii verse     or seize some straggling foe it is worthy observation with how much caution nestor opens this design and with how much courage diomed accepts it nestor forms it with coolness but diomed embraces it with warmth and resolution nestor only proposes that some man would approach the enemy and intercept some straggling trojan but diomed offers to penetrate the very camp nestor was afraid lest no one should undertake it diomed overlooks the danger and presents himself as willing to march against the whole army of troy eustathius  xxiii verse   0 to birth or office no respect be paid eustathius remarks that agamemnon artfully steals away his brother from danger the foundness he bears to him makes him think him unequal to so bold an enterprise and prefer his safety to his glory he farther adds that the poet intended to condemn that faulty modesty which makes one sometimes prefer a nobleman before a person of more real worth to be greatly born is an happiness but no merit whereas personal virtues show a man worthy of that greatness to which he is not born  it appears from hence how honorable it was of old to go upon these parties by night or undertake those offices which are now only the task of common soldiers gideon in the book of judges as dacier observes goes as a spy into the camp of midian though he was at that time general of the israelites  xxiv verse     blessed in his conduct there required some address in diomed to make his choice without offending the grecian princes each of them might think it an indignity to be refused such a place of honor diomed therefore chooses ulysses not because he is braver than the rest but because he is wiser this part of his character was allowed by all the leaders of the army and none of them thought it a disparagement to themselves as they were men of valor to see the first place given to ulysses in point of wisdom no doubt but the poet by causing diomed to make this choice intended to insinuate that valor ought always to be tempered with wisdom to the end that what is designed with prudence may be executed with resolution eustathius  xxv verse   0 it fits thee not to praise me or to blame the modesty of ulysses in this passage is very remarkable though undoubtedly he deserved to be praised yet he interrupts diomed rather than he would be a hearer of his own commendation what diomed spoke in praise of ulysses was uttered to justify his choice of him to the leaders of the army otherwise the praise he had given him would have been no better than flattery eustathius  xxvi verse      night rolls the hours away the stars shine fainter on the aetherial plains and of nights empire but a third remains it has been objected that ulysses is guilty of a threefold tautology when every word he uttered shows the necessity of being concise if the night was nigh spent there was the less time to lose in tautologies but this is so far from being a fault that it is a beauty ulysses dwells upon the shortness of the time before the day appears in order to urge diomed to the greater speed in prosecuting the design eustathius  xxvii verse     but a third remains one ought to take notice with how much exactness homer proportions his incidents to the time of action these two books take up no more than the compass of one night and this design could not have been executed in any other part of it the poet had before told us that all the plain was enlightened by the fires of troy and consequently no spy could pass over to their camp till they were almost sunk and extinguished which could not be till near the morning  it is observable that the poet divides the night into three parts from whence we may gather that the grecians had three watches during the night the first and second of which were over when diomed and ulysses set out to enter the enemys camp eustathius  xxviii verse  00 a twoedged faulchion thrasymed the brave etc it is a very impertinent remark of scaliger that diomed should not have gone from his tent without a sword the expedition he now goes upon could not be foreseen by him at the time he rose he was awaked of a sudden and sent in haste to call some of the princes besides he went but to council and even then carried his spear with him as homer had already informed us i think if one were to study the art of cavilling there would be more occasion to blame virgil for what scaliger praises him giving a sword to euryalus when he had one before aen    0   xxix verse  0  then in a leathern helm it may not be improper to observe how conformably to the design the poet arms these two heroes ulysses has a bow and arrows that he might be able to wound the enemy at a distance and so retard his flight till he could overtake him and for fear of a discovery diomed is armed with an helmet of leather that the glittering of it might not betray him eustathius  there is some resemblance in this whole story to that of nisus and euryalus in virgil and as the heroes are here successful and in virgil unfortunate it was perhaps as great an instance of virgils judgment to describe the unhappy youth in a glittering helmet which occasioned his discovery as it was in homer to arm his successful one in the contrary manner  xxx verse  0  a wellprovd casque mr barnes has a pretty remark on this place that it was probably from this description  that the ancient painters and tragic poets constantly represented ulysses with the pileus on his head but this particularity could not be preserved with any grace in the translation  xxxi verse     this from amyntor etc the succession of this helmet descending from one hero to another is imitated by virgil in the story of nisus and euryalus euryalus phaleras rhamnetis and aurea bullis cingula tiburti remulo ditissimus olim quae mittit dona hospitio cum jungeret absens caedicus ille suo moriens dat habere nepoti post mortem bello rutuli pugnamque potiti it was anciently a custom to make these military presents to brave adventurers so jonathan in the first book of samuel stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and his bow and his girdle chapter       xxxii verse     ulysses hailed the glad omen this passage sufficiently justifies diomed for his choice of ulysses diomed who was most renowned for valor might have given a wrong interpretation to this omen and so have been discouraged from proceeding in the attempt for though it really signified that as the bird was not seen but only heard by the sound of its wings so they should not be discovered by the trojans but perform actions which all troy should hear with sorrow yet on the other hand it might imply that as they discovered the bird by the noise of its wings so they should be betrayed by the noise they should make in the trojan army the reason why pallas does not send the bird that is sacred to her self but the heron is because it is a bird of prey and denoted that they should spoil the trojans eustathius  xxxiii verse     through dust through blood etc zenophon has imitated this passage but what the poet gives us in one line the historian portracts into several sentences  etc when the battle was over one might behold the ground died red with blood and covered with the dead spears broken and drawn swords some on the ground some in the bodies of the slain eustathius  xxxiv verse     nor less bold hector etc it is the remark of eustathius that homer sends out the trojan spy in this place in a very different manner from the grecian ones before having been very particular in describing the counsel of the greeks he avoids tiring the reader here with parallel circumstances and passes it in general terms in the first a wise old man proposes the adventure with an air of deference in the second a brave young man with an air of authority the one promises a small gift but very honorable and certain the other a great one but uncertain and less honorable because it is given as a reward so that diomed and ulysses are inspired with the love of glory dolon is possessed with a thirst of gain they proceed with a sage and circumspect valor he with rashness and vanity they go in conjunction he alone they cross the fields out of the road he follows the common track in all this there is a contraste that is admirable and a moral that strikes every reader at first sight  xxxv verse   0 dolon his name it is scarce to be conceived with what conciseness the poet has here given us the name the fortunes the pedigree the office the shape the swiftness of dolon he seems to have been eminent for nothing so much as for his wealth though undoubtedly he was by place one of the first rank in troy hector summons him to this assembly amongst the chiefs of troy nor was he unknown to the greeks for diomed immediately after he had seized him calls him by his name perhaps being an herald he had frequently passed between the armies in the execution of his office  the ancients observed upon this place that it was the office of dolon which made him offer himself to hector the sacred character gave him hopes that they would not violate his person should he happen to be taken and his riches he knew were sufficient to purchase his liberty besides all which advantages he had hopes from his swiftness to escape any pursuers eustathius  xxxvi verse     not blessed by nature with the charms of face the original is  which some ancient critics thought to include a contradiction because the man who is illshapd can hardly be swift in running taking the word  as applied in general to the air of the whole person but aristotle acquaints us that word was as proper in regard to the face only and that it was usual with the cretans to call a man with a handsome face  so that dolon might want a good face and yet be wellshapd enough to make an excellent racer poet c     xxxvii verse     swear to grant me etc it is evident from this whole narration that dolon as a man of no worth or courage his covetousness seems to be the sole motive of his undertaking this exploit and whereas diomed neither desired any reward nor when promised required any assurance of it dolon demands an oath and will not trust the promise of hector he every where discovers a base spirit and by the sequel it will appear that this vain boaster instead of discovering the army of the enemy becomes a traitor to his own eustathius  xxxviii verse   0 the immortal coursers and the glittering car hector in the foregoing speech promises the best horses in the grecian army as a reward to any one who would undertake what he proposed dolon immediately demands those of achilles and confines the general promise of hector to the particular horses of that brave hero  there is something very extraordinary in hectors taking a solemn oath that he will give the chariots and steeds of achilles to dolon the ancients says eustathius knew not whose vanity most to wonder at that of dolon or hector the one for demanding this or the other for promising it though we may take notice that virgil liked this extravagance so well as to imitate it where ascanius without being asked promises the horses and armor of turnus to nisus on his undertaking a like enterprise vidisti quo turnus equo quibus ibat in armis aureus ipsum illum clypeum cristasque rubentes excipiam sorti jam nunc tua praemia nise unless one should think the rashness of such a promise better agreed with the ardour of this youthful prince than with the character of an experienced warrior like hector  xxxix verse   0  such the space between as when two teams of mules etc i wonder eustathius takes no notice of the manner of ploughing used by the ancients which is described in these verses and of which we have the best account from dacier she is not satisfied with the explanation given by didymus that homer meant the space which mules by their swiftness gain upon oxen that plow in the same field the grecians says she did not plow in the manner now in use they first broke up the ground with oxen and then plowed it more lightly with mules when they employed two plows in a field they measured the space they could plow in a day and set their plows at the two ends of that space and those plows proceeded toward each other this intermediate space was constantly fixed but less in proportion for two plows of oxen than for two of mules because oxen are slower and toil more in a field that has not been yet turned up whereas mules are naturally swifter and make greater speed in a ground that has already had the first plowing i therefore believe that what homer calls  is the space left by the husbandmen between two plows of mules which till the same field and as this space was so much the greater in a field already plowed by oxen he adds what he says of mules that they are swifter and fitter to give the second plowing than oxen and therefore distinguishes the field so plowed by the epithet of deep  for that space was certain of so many acres or perches and always larger than in a field as yet untilled which being heavier and more difficult required the interval to be so much the less between two plows of oxen because they could not dispatch so much work homer could not have served himself of a juster comparison for a thing that passed in the fields at the same time he shows his experience in the art of agriculture and gives his verses a most agreeable ornament as indeed all the images drawn from this art are peculiarly entertaining  this manner of measuring a space of ground by a comparison from plowing seems to have been customary in those times from that passage in the first book of samuel chapter       and the first slaughter which jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within as it were half a furrow of an acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow  xl verse     quiverd as he stood etc the poet here gives us a very lively picture of a person in the utmost agonies of fear dolons swiftness forsakes him and he stands shackled by his cowardice the very words express the thing he describes by the broken turn of the greek verses and something like it is aimed at in the english        xli verse     be bold nor fear to die it is observable what caution the poet here uses in reference to dolon ulysses does not make him any promises of life but only bids him very artfully not to think of dying so that when diomed kills him he was not guilty of a breach of promise and the spy was deceived rather by the art and subtlety of ulysses than by his falsehood dolons understanding seems entirely to be disturbed by his fears he was so cautious as not to believe a friend just before without an oath but here he trusts an enemy without so much as a promise eustathius  xlii verse     urged me unwilling it is observable that the cowardice of dolon here betrays him into a falsehood though eustathius is of opinion that the word in the original means no more than contrary to my judgment  xliii verse     where lies encamped the night was now very far advanced the morning approached and the two heroes had their whole design still to execute ulysses therefore complies with the necessity of the time and makes his questions very short though at the same time very full in the like manner when ulysses comes to show diomed the chariot of rhesus he uses a sudden transition without the usual form of speaking  xliv verse     no certain guards homer to give an air of probability to this narration lets us understand that the trojan camp might easily be entered without a discovery because there were no sentinels to guard it this might happen partly through the security which their late success had thrown them into and partly through the fatigues of the former day besides which homer gives us another very natural reason the negligence of the auxiliar forces who being foreigners had nothing to lose by the fall of troy  xlv verse     where ever yon fires ascend this is not to be understood of those fires which hector commanded to be kindled at the beginning of this night but only of the household fires of the trojans distinct from the auxiliars the expression in the original is somewhat remarkable but implies those people that were natives of troy  and  signifying the same thing so that  and  mean to have houses or hearths in troy eustathius  xlvi verse     divides the neck it may seem a piece of barbarity in diomed to kill dolon thus in the very act of supplicating for mercy eustathius answers that it was very necessary that it should be so for fear if he had deferred his death he might have cried out to the trojans who hearing his voice would have been upon their guard  xlvii verse     just then a deathful dream minerva sent all the circumstances of this action the night rhesus buried in a profound sleep and diomed with the sword in his hand hanging over the head of that prince furnished homer with the idea of this fiction which represents rhesus dying fast asleep and as it were beholding his enemy in a dream plunging a sword into his bosom this image is very natural for a man in this condition awakes no farther than to see confusedly what environs him and to think it not a reality but a vision eustathius dacier  xlviii verse  0  and wakes hippocoon apollos waking the trojans is only an allegory to imply that the light of the morning awakened them eustathius  xlix verse     old nestor first perceived etc it may with an appearance of reason be asked whence it could be that nestor whose sense of hearing might be supposed to be impaired by his great age should be the first person among so many youthful warriors who hears the tread of the horses feet at a distance eustathius answers that nestor had a particular concern for the safety of diomed and ulysses on this occasion as he was the person who by proposing the undertaking had exposed them to a very signal danger and consequently his extraordinary care for their preservation did more than supply the disadvantage of his age this agrees very well with what immediately follows for the old man breaks out into a transport at the sight of them and in a wild sort of joy asks some questions which could not have proceeded from him but while he was under that happy surprise eustathius  l verse     of thracian lineage etc it is observable says eustathius that homer in this place unravels the series of this nights exploits and inverts the order of the former narration this is partly occasioned by a necessity of nestors enquiries and partly to relate the same thing in a diffeway that he might not tire the reader with an exact repetition of what he knew before  li verse     and twelve beside etc how comes it to pass that the poet should here call dolon the thirteenth that was slain whereas he had already numbered up thirteen besides him eustathius answers that he mentions rhesus by himself by way of eminence then coming to recount the thracians he reckons twelve of em so that taking rhesus separately dolon will make the thirteenth  lii verse     they cleanse their bodies in the main etc we have here a regimen very agreeable to the simplicity and austerity of the old heroic times these warriors plunge into the sea to wash themselves for the salt water is not only more purifying than any other but more corroborates the nerves they afterward enter into a bath and rub their bodies with oil which by softening and moistening the flesh prevents too great a dissipation and restores the natural strength eustathius  liii verse     in due repast etc it appears from hence with what preciseness homer distinguishes the time of these actions it is evident from this passage that immediately after their return it was daylight that being the time of taking such a repast as is here described  live i cannot conclude the notes to this book without observing that what seems the principal beauty of it and what distinguishes it among all the others is the liveliness of its paintings the reader sees the most natural nightscene in the world he is led step by step with the adventurers and made the companion of all their expectations and uncertainties we see the very color of the sky know the time to a minute are impatient while the heroes are arming our imagination steals out after them becomes privy to all their doubts and even to the secret wishes of their hearts sent up to minerva we are alarmed at the approach of dolon hear his very footsteps assist the two chiefs in pursuing him and stop just with the spear that arrests him we are perfectly acquainted with the situation of all the forces with the figure in which they lie with the disposition of rhesus and the thracians with the posture of his chariot and horses the marshy spot of ground where dolon is killed the tamarisk or aquatic plants upon which they hang his spoils and the reeds that are heaped together to mark the place are circumstances the most picturesque imaginable and though it must be owned that the human figures in this piece are excellent and disposed in the properest actions i cannot but confess my opinion that the chief beauty of it is in the prospect a finer than which was never drawn by any pencil  the eleventh book of the iliad the argument the third battle and the acts of agamemnon agamemnon having armed himself leads the grecians to battle hector prepares the trojans to receive them while jupiter juno and minerva give the signals of war agamemnon bears all before him and hector is commanded by jupiter who sends iris for that purpose to decline the engagement till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field he then makes a great slaughter of the enemy ulysses and diomed put a stop to him for a while but the latter being wounded by paris is obliged to desert his companion who is encompassed by the trojans wounded and in the utmost danger till menelaus and ajax rescue him hector comes against ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the greeks in the mean time machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an arrow by paris and carried from the fight in nestors chariot achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sends patroclus to enquire which of the greeks was wounded in that manner nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of some former wars which he remembered tending to put patroclus upon persuading achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in achilless armor patroclus in his return meets eurypilus also wounded and assists him in that distress  this book opens with the eight and twentieth day of the poem and the same day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth books the scene lies in the field near the monument of ilus  the eleventh book of the iliad the saffron morn with early blushes spread now rose refulgent from tithonus bed with newborn day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light when baleful eris sent by joves command the torch of discord blazing in her hand through the red skies her bloody sign extends and wrapped in tempests over the fleets descends high on ulysses bark her horrid stand she took and thundered through the seas and land even ajax and achilles heard the sound whose ships remote the guarded navy bound thence the black fury through the grecian throng with horror sounds the loud orthian song the navy shakes and at the dire alarms each bosom boils each warrior starts to arms no more they sigh inglorious to return but breathe revenge and for the combat burn the king of men his hardy host inspires with loud command with great example fires himself first rose himself before the rest his mighty limbs in radiant armor dressed and first he cased his manly legs around in shining greaves with silver buckles bound the beaming cuirass next adorned his breast the same which once king cinyras possessed the fame of greece and her assembled host had reached that monarch on the cyprian coast twas then the friendship of the chief to gain this glorious gift he sent nor sent in vain ten rows of azure steel the work infold twice ten of tin and twelve of ductile gold three glittering dragons to the gorget rise whose imitated scales against the skies reflected various light and arching bowed like colored rainbows over a showry cloud  joves wondrous bow of three celestial dies placed as a sign to man amid the skies a radiant baldrick over his shoulder tied sustained the sword that glittered at his side gold was the hilt a silver sheath encasd the shining blade and golden hangers graced his bucklers mighty orb was next displayed that round the warrior cast a dreadful shade ten zones of brass its ample brims surround and twice ten bosses the bright unequal crowned tremendous gorgon frowned upon its field and circling terrors filled the expressive shield within its concave hung a silver thong on which a mimic serpent creeps along his azure length in easy waves extends till in three heads the embroidered monster ends last over his brows his fourfold helm he placed with nodding horsehair formidably graced and in his hands two steely javelins wields that blaze to heaven and lighten all the fields that instant juno and the martial maid in happy thunders promised greece their aid high over the chief they clashd their arms in air and leaning from the clouds expect the war close to the limits of the trench and mound the fiery coursers to their chariots bound the squires restrained the foot with those who wield the lighter arms rushed forward to the field to second these in close array combined the squadrons spread their sable wings behind now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun as with the light the warriors toils begun even jove whose thunder spoke his wrath distilled red drops of blood over all the fatal field the woes of men unwilling to survey and all the slaughters that must stain the day near ilus tomb in order ranged around the trojan lines possessed the rising ground there wise polydamas and hector stood aeneas honored as a guardian god bold polybus agenor the divine the brotherwarriors of antenors line with youthful acamas whose beauteous face and fair proportion matched the etherial race great hector covered with his spacious shield plies all the troops and orders all the field as the red star now shows his sanguine fires through the dark clouds and now in night retires thus through the ranks appeared the godlike man plunged in the rear or blazing in the van while streamy sparkles restless as he flies flash from his arms as lightning from the skies as sweating reapers in some wealthy field ranged in two bands their crooked weapons wield bear down the furrows till their labors meet thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet so greece and troy the field of war divide and falling ranks are strowd on every side none stooped a thought to base inglorious flight but horse to horse and man to man they fight not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey each wounds each bleeds but none resign the day discord with joy the scene of death descries and drinks large slaughter at her sanguin eyes discord alone of all the immortal train swells the red horrors of this direful plain the gods in peace their golden mansions fill ranged in bright order on the olympian hill but general murmurs told their griefs above and each accused the partial will of jove meanwhile apart superior and alone the eternal monarch on his awful throne wrapped in the blaze of boundless glory sat and fixed fulfilled the just decrees of fate on earth he turned his allconsidring eyes and marked the spot where ilions towers arise the sea with ships the fields with armies spread the victors rage the dying and the dead thus while the morningbeams increasing bright over heavens pure azure spread the growing light commutual death the fate of war confounds each adverse battle goard with equal wounds but now what time in some sequestered vale the weary woodman spreads his sparing meal when his tired arms refuse the axe to rear and claim a respite from the sylvan war but not till half the prostrate forests lay stretched in long ruin and exposed to day then nor till then the greeks impulsive might pierced the black phalanx and let in the light great agamemnon then the slaughter led and slew bienor at his peoples head whose squire oileus with a sudden spring leaped from the chariot to revenge his king but in his front he felt the fatal wound which pierced his brain and stretched him on the ground atrides spoiled and left them on the plain vain was their youth their glittering armor vain now soiled with dust and naked to the sky their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie two sons of priam next to battle move the product one of marriage one of love in the same car the brotherwarriors ride this took the charge to combat that to guide far other task than when they wont to keep on idas tops their fathers fleecy sheep these on the mountains once achilles found and captive led with pliant osiers bound then to their sire for ample sums restored but now to perish by atrides sword pierced in the breast the baseborn isus bleeds cleft through the head his brothers fate succeeds swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls and stripped their features to his mind recalls the trojans see the youths untimely die but helpless tremble for themselves and fly so when a lion ranging over the lawns finds on some grassy lare the couching fawns their bones he cracks their reeking vitals draws and grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws the frighted hind beholds and dares not stay but swift through rustling thickets bursts her way all drowned in sweat the panting mother flies and the big tears roll trickling from her eyes amidst the tumult of the routed train the sons of false antimachus were slain he who for bribes his faithless counsels sold and voted helens stay for paris gold atrides marked as these their safety sought and slew the children for the fathers fault their headstrong horse unable to restrain they shook with fear and dropped the silken rein then in their chariot on their knees they fall and thus with lifted hands for mercy call oh spare our youth and for the life we owe antimachus shall copious gifts bestow soon as he hears that not in battle slain the grecian ships his captive sons detain large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told and steel welltempered and persuasive gold these words attended with a flood of tears the youths addressed to unrelenting ears the vengeful monarch gave this stern reply if from antimachus ye spring ye die the daring wretch who once in council stood to shed ulysses and my brothers blood for proffered peace and sues his seed for grace no die and pay the forfeit of your race this said pisander from the car he cast and pierced his breast supine he breathed his last his brother leaped to earth but as he lay the trenchant faulchion lopped his hands away his severed head was tossed among the throng and rolling drew a bloody trail along then where the thickest fought the victor flew the kings example all his greeks pursue now by the foot the flying foot were slain horse trod by horse lay foaming on the plain from the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise shade the black host and intercept the skies the brasshoofd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound and the thick thunder beats the laboring ground still slaughtring on the king of men proceeds the distancd army wonders at his deeds as when the winds with raging flames conspire and over the forests roll the flood of fire in blazing heaps the groves old honors fall and one refulgent ruin levells all before atrides rage so sinks the foe whole squadrons vanish and proud heads lie low the steeds fly trembling from his waving sword and many a car now lighted of its lord wide over the field with guideless fury rolls breaking their ranks and crushing out their souls while his keen faulchion drinks the warriors lives more grateful now to vulturs than their wives perhaps great hector then had found his fate but jove and destiny prolonged his date safe from the darts the care of heaven he stood amidst alarms and deaths and dust and blood now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay through the mid field the routed urge their way where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown that path they take and speed to reach the town as swift atrides with loud shouts pursued hot with his toil and bathed in hostile blood now near the beechtree and the scaean gates the hero haults and his associates waits meanwhile on every side around the plain dispersed disordered fly the trojan train so flies a herd of beeves that hear dismayed the lions roaring through the midnight shade on heaps they tumble with successless haste the savage seizes draws and rends the last not with less fury stern atrides flew still pressed the rout and still the hindmost slew hurled from their cars the bravest chiefs are killed and rage and death and carnage load the field now storms the victor at the trojan wall surveys the towers and meditates their fall but jove descending shook the idaean hills and down their summits poured a hundred rills the unkindled lightning in his hand he took and thus the manycolourd maid bespoke iris with haste thy golden wings display to godlike hector this our word convey while agamemnon wastes the ranks around fights in

he spoke and iris at his word obeyed on wings of winds descends the various maid the chief she found amidst the ranks of war close to the bulwarks on his glittering car the goddess then o son of priam hear from jove i come and his high mandate bear while agamemnon wastes the ranks around fights in the front and bathes with blood the ground abstain from fight yet issue forth commands and trust the war to less important hands but when or wounded by the spear or dart the chief shall mount his chariot and depart then jove shall string thy arm and fire thy breast then to her ships shall flying greece be pressed till to the main the burning sun descend and sacred night her awful shade extend she said and vanished hector with a bound vaults from his chariot on the trembling ground in clanging arms he grasps in either hand a pointed lance and speeds from band to band revives their ardour turns their steps from flight and wakes anew the dying flames of fight they stand to arms the greeks their onset dare condense their powers and wait the coming war new force new spirit to each breast returns the fight renewed with fiercer fury burns the king leads on all fix on him their eye and

his daughters charms  theanos sister to his youthful arms but called by glory to the wars of troy he leaves untasted the first fruits of joy from his loved bride departs with melting eyes and swift to aid his dearer country flies with twelve black ships he reached percopes strand thence took the long laborious march by land now fierce for fame before the ranks he springs towering in arms and braves the king of kings atrides first discharged the missive spear the trojan stooped the javelin passed in air then near the corselet at the monarchs heart with all his strength the youth directs his dart but the broad belt with plates of silver bound the point rebated and repelled the wound encumbered with the dart atrides stands till grasped with force he wrenchd it from his hands at once his weighty sword discharged a wound full on his neck that felled him to the ground stretched in the dust the unhappy warrior lies and sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes oh worthy better fate oh early slain thy countrys friend and virtuous though in vain no more the youth shall join his consorts side at once a virgin and at once a bride no more with presents her embraces meet or lay the spoils of

eldest hope was nigh tears at the sight came starting from his eye while pierced with grief the muchloved youth he viewed and the pale features now deformed with blood then with his spear unseen his

conquests on the foe but pierced by this to endless darkness go and add one spectre to the realms below he spoke while socus seized with sudden fright trembling gave way and turned his back to flight between his shoulders pierced the following dart and held its passage through the panting heart wide in his breast appeared the grizly wound he falls his armor rings against the ground then thus ulysses gazing on the slain famed son of hippasus there press the plain there ends thy narrow span assigned by fate heaven owes ulysses yet a longer date ah wretch no father shall thy corpse compose thy dying eyes no tender mother close but hungry birds shall tear those balls away and hovering vulturs scream around their prey me greece shall honor when i meet my doom with solemn funrals and a lasting tomb then raging with intolerable smart he writhes his body and extracts the dart the dart a tide of spouting gore pursued and gladdend troy with sight of hostile blood now troops on troops the fainting chief invade forced he recedes and loudly calls for aid thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears the wellknown voice thrice menelaus hears alarmed to ajax telamon he cried who shares his labors and defends his side o friend ulysses shouts invade my ear distressed he seems and no assistance near strong as he is yet one opposed to all oppressed by multitudes the best may fall greece robbed of him must bid her hosts despair and feel a loss not ages can repair then where the cry directs his course he bends great ajax like the god of war attends the prudent chief in sore distress they found with bands of furious trojans compassed round as when some huntsman with a flying spear from the blind thicket wounds a stately deer down his cleft side while fresh the blood distills he bounds aloft and scuds from hills to hills till lifes warm vapor issuing through the wound wild mountainwolves the fainting beast surround just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade the lion rushes through the woodland shade the wolves though hungry scour dispersed away the lordly savage vindicates his prey ulysses thus unconquered by his pains a single warrior half an host sustains but soon as ajax heaves his towrlike shield the scattered crowds fly frighted over the field atrides arm the sinking hero stays and saved from numbers to his car conveys victorious ajax plies the routed crew and first doryclus priams son he slew on strong pandocus next inflicts a wound and lays lysander bleeding on the ground as when a torrent swelled with wintry rains pours from the mountains over the deluged plains and pines and oaks from their foundations torn a countrys ruins to the seas are born fierce ajax thus oerwhelms the yielding throng men steeds and chariots roll in heaps along but hector from this scene of slaughter far raged on the left and ruled the tide of war loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain and deep scamander swells with heaps of slain there nestor and idomeneus oppose the warriors fury there the battle glows there fierce on foot or from the chariots height his sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight the spouse of helen dealing darts around had pierced machaon with a distant wound in his right shoulder the broad shaft appeared and trembling greece for her physician feared to nestor then idomeneus begun glory of greece old neleus valiant son ascend thy chariot haste with speed away and great machaon to the ships convey a wise physician skilled our wounds to heal is more than armies to the public weal old nestor mounts the seat beside him rode the wounded offspring of the healing god he lends the lash the steeds with sounding feet shake the dry field and thunder towered the fleet but now cebriones from hectors car surveyed the various fortune of the war while here he cried the flying greeks are slain trojans on trojans yonder load the plain before great ajax see the mingled throng of men and chariots driven in heaps along i know him well distinguished over the field by the broad glittering of the sevnfold shield thither o hector thither urge thy steeds there danger calls and there the combat bleeds there horse and foot in mingled deaths unite and groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight thus having spoke the drivers lash resounds swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds stung by the stroke the coursers scour the fields over heaps of carcasses and hills of shields the horses hoofs are bathed in heroes gore and dashing purple all the car before the groaning axle sable drops distills and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels here hector plunging through the thickest fight broke the dark phalanx and let in the light by the long lance the sword or pondrous stone the ranks lie scattered and the troops overthrown ajax he shuns through all the dire debate and fears that arm whose force he felt so late but partial jove espousing hectors part shot heavnbred horror through the grecians heart confused unnervd in hectors presence grown amazed he stood with terrors not his own over his broad back his moony shield he threw and glaring round by tardy steps withdrew thus the grim lion his retreat maintains beset with watchful dogs and shouting swains repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls though rage impells him and though hunger calls long stands the showring darts and missile fires then sowrly slow the indignant beast retires so turned stern ajax by whole hosts repelled while his swollen heart at every step rebelled as the slow beast with heavy strength indud in some wide field by troops of boys pursued though round his sides a wooden tempest rain crops the tall harvest and lays waste the plain thick on his hide the hollow blows resound the patient animal maintains his ground scarce from the field with all their efforts chased and stirs but slowly when he stirs at last on ajax thus a weight of trojans hung the strokes redoubled on his buckler rung confiding now in bulky strength he stands now turns and backward bears the yielding bands now stiff recedes yet hardly seems to fly and threats his followers with retorted eye fixed as the bar between two warring powers while hissing darts descend in iron showers in his broad buckler many a weapon stood its surface bristled with a quivering wood and many a javelin guiltless on the plain drinks the dry dust and thirsts for blood in vain but bold eurypylus his aid imparts and dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts whose eager javelin launched against the foe great apisaon felt the fatal blow from his torn liver the red current flowed and his slack knees desert their dying load the victor rushing to despoil the dead from paris bow a vengeful arrow fled fixed in his nervous thigh the weapon stood fixed was the point but broken was the wood back to the lines the wounded greek retired yet thus retreating his associates fired what god o grecians has your hearts dismayed oh turn to arms it is ajax claims your aid this hour he stands the mark of hostile rage and this the last brave battle he shall wage haste join your forces from the gloomy grave the warrior rescue and your country save thus urged the chief a generous troop appears who spread their bucklers and advance their spears to guard their wounded friend while thus they stand with pious care great ajax joins the band each takes new courage at the heros sight the hero rallies and renews the fight thus raged both armies like conflicting fires while nestors chariot far from fight retires his coursers steeped in sweat and stained with gore the greeks preserver great machaon bore that hour achilles from the topmost height of his proud fleet oerlookd the fields of fight his feasted eyes beheld around the plain the grecian rout the slaying and the slain his friend machaon singled from the rest a transient pity touched his vengeful breast strait to maenetius muchloved son he sent graceful as mars patroclus quits his tent in evil hour then fate decreed his doom and fixed the date of all his woes to come why calls my friend thy loved injunctions lay whatever thy will patroclus shall obey o first of friends  pelides thus replied still at my heart and ever at my side the time is come when yon despairing host shall learn the value of the man they lost now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan and proud atrides tremble on his throne go now to nestor and from him be taught what wounded warrior late his chariot brought for seen at distance and but seen behind his form recalled machaon to my mind nor could i through yon cloud discern his face the coursers past me with so swift a pace the hero said his friend obeyed with haste through intermingled ships and tents he past the chiefs descending from their car he found the panting steeds eurymedon unbound the warriors standing on the breezy shore to dry their sweat and wash away the gore here paused a moment while the gentle gale conveyed that freshness the cool seas exhale then to consult on farther methods went and took their seats beneath the shady tent the draught prescribed fair hecamede prepares arsinous daughter graced with golden hairs whom

and stood before the tent old nestor rising then the hero led to his high seat the chief refused and said it is now no season for these kind delays the great achilles with impatience stays to great achilles this respect i owe who asks what hero wounded by the foe was born from combat by thy foaming steeds with grief i see the great machaon bleeds this to report my hasty course i bend thou know the fiery temper of my friend can then the sons of greece the sage rejoined excite compassion in achilles mind seeks he the sorrows of our host to know this is not half the story of our woe tell him not great machaon bleeds alone our bravest heroes in the navy groan ulysses agamemnon diomed and stern eurypylus already bleed but ah what flattering hopes i entertain achilles heeds not but derides our pain even till the flames consume our fleet he stays and waits the rising of the fatal blaze chief after chief the raging foe destroys calm he looks on and every death enjoys now the slow course of allimpairing time unstrings my nerves and ends my manly prime oh had i still that strength my youth possessed when this bold arm the epeian powers oppressed the bulls of elis in glad triumph led and stretched the great itymonaeus dead then from my fury fled the trembling swains and ours was all the plunder of the plains fifty white flocks full fifty herds of swine as many goats as many lowing kine and thrice the number of unrivaled steeds all teeming females and of generous breeds these as my first essay of arms i won old neleus gloried in his conquering son thus elis forced her long

bold brothers i alone remain oppressed we armed and now this conquest gained my sire three hundred chosen sheep obtained that large reprizal he might justly claim for prize defrauded and insulted fame when elis monarch in the public course detained his chariot and victorious horse the rest the people shared my self surveyed the just partition and due victims paid three days were past when elis rose to war with many a courser and with many a car the sons of actor at their armys head young as they were the vengeful squadrons led high on a rock fair thryoessa stands our utmost frontier on the

foot i fled amidst our chariots for the goddess led along fair arenes delightful plain soft minyas rolls his waters to the main there horse and foot the pylian troops unite and sheathed in arms expect the dawning light thence ever the sun advanced his noonday flame to great alphaeus sacred source we came there first to jove our solemn rites were paid an untamed heifer pleased the blueeyd maid a bull alphaeus and a bull was slain to the blue monarch of the watery main in arms we slept beside the winding flood while round the town the fierce epeians stood soon as the sun with allrevealing ray flamed in the front of heaven and gave the day bright scenes of arms and works of war appear the nations meet there pylos elis here the first who fell beneath my javelin bled king augias son and

died but neptune shrouds the youthful heroes in a veil of clouds over heapy shields and over the prostrate throng collecting spoils and slaughtring all along through wide buprasian fields we forced the foes where over the vales the olenian rocks arose till pallas stopped us where alisium flows even there the hindmost of their rear i slay and the same arm that led concludes the day then back to pyle triumphant take my way there to high jove were public thanks assigned as first of gods to nestor of mankind such then i was impelled by youthful blood so proved my valor for my countrys good achilles with unactive fury glows and gives to passion what to greece he owes how shall he grieve when to the eternal shade her hosts shall sink nor his the power to aid o friend my memory recalls the day when gathering aids along the grecian sea i and ulysses touched at pthias port and entered peleus hospitable court a bull to jove he slew in sacrifice and poured libations on the flaming thighs thy self achilles and thy reverend sire menoetius turned the fragments on the fire achilles sees us to the feast invites social we sit and share the genial rites we then explained the cause on which we came urged you to arms and found you fierce for fame your ancient fathers generous precepts gave peleus said only this  my son be brave menoetius thus though great achilles shine in strength superior and of race divine yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend let thy just counsels aid and rule thy friend thus spoke your father at thessalias court words now forgot though now of vast import ah try the utmost that a friend can say such gentle force the fiercest minds obey some favoring god achilles heart may move though deaf to glory he may yield to love if some dire oracle his breast alarm if ought from heaven withold his saving arm some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine if thou but lead the myrmidonian line clad in achilles arms if thou appear proud troy may tremble and desist from war pressed by fresh forces her oerlabourd train shall seek their walls and greece respire again this touched his generous heart and from the tent along the shore with hasty strides he went soon as he came where on the crowded strand the public mart and courts of justice stand where the tall fleet of great ulysses lies and altars to the guardian gods arife there sad he met the brave evaemons son large painful drops from all his members run an arrows head yet rooted in his wound the fable blood in circles marked the ground as faintly reeling he confessed the smart weak was his pace but dauntless was his heart divine compassion touched patroclus breast who sighing thus his bleeding friend addressed ah hapless leaders of the grecian host thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast is this your fate to glut the dogs with gore far from your friends and from your native shore say great eurypylus shall greece yet stand resists she yet the raging hectors hand or are her heroes doomed to die with shame and this the period of our wars and fame eurypylus replies no more my friend greece is no more this day her glories end even to the ships victorious troy pursues her force increasing as her toil renews those chiefs that used her utmost rage to meet lie pierced with wounds and bleeding in the fleet but thou patroclus act a friendly part lead to my ships and draw this deadly dart with lukewarm water wash the gore away with healing balms the raging smart allay such as sage chiron sire of pharmacy once taught achilles and achilles thee of two famed surgeons podalirius stands this hour surrounded by the trojan bands and great machaon wounded in his tent now wants that succor which so often he lent to him the chief what then remains to do the event of things the gods alone can view charged by achilles great command i fly and bear with haste the pylian kings reply but thy distress this instant claims relief he said and in his arms upheld the chief the slaves their masters slow approach surveyed and hides of oxen on the floor displayed there stretched at length the wounded hero lay patroclus cut the forky steel away then in his hands a bitter root he bruised the wound he washed the styptick juice infused the closing flesh that instant ceased to glow the wound to torture and the blood to flow observations on the eleventh book observations on the eleventh book i as homers invention is in nothing more wonderful than in the great variety of characters with which his poems are diversified so his judgment appears in nothing more exact than in that propriety with which each character is maintained but this exactness must be collected by a diligent attention to his conduct through the whole and when the particulars of each character are laid together we shall find them all proceeding from the same temper and disposition of the person if this observation be neglected the poets conduct will lose much of its true beauty and harmony  i fancy it will not be unpleasant to the reader to consider the picture of agamemnon drawn by so masterly an hand as that of homer in its full length after having seen him in several views and lights since the beginning of the poem  he is a master of policy and stratagem and maintains a good understanding with his council which was but necessary considering how many different and independent nations and interests he had to manage he seems fully conscious of his own superior authority and always knows the time when to exert it he is personally very valiant but not without some mixture of fierceness highly resentful of the injuries done his family even more than menelaus himself warm both in his passions and affections particularly in the love he bears his brother in short he is as homer himself in another place describes him both a good king and a great warrior  it is very observable how this hero rises in the eye and esteem of the reader as the poem advances it opens with many circumstances very much to the disadvantage of his character he insults the priest of apollo and outrages achilles but in the second book he grows sensible of the effects of his rashness and takes the fault entirely upon himself in the fourth he shows himself a skilful commander by exhorting reproving and performing all the offices of a good general in the eighth he is deeply touched by the sufferings of his army and makes all the peoples calamities his own in the ninth he endeavors to reconcile himself to achilles and condescends to be the petitioner because it is for the public good in the tenth finding those endeavors ineffectual his concern keeps him the whole night awake in contriving all possible methods to assist them and now in the eleventh as it were resolving himself to supply the want of achilles he grows prodigiously in his valor and performs wonders in his single person  thus we see agamemnon continually winning upon our esteem as we grow acquainted with him so that he seems to be like that goddess the poet describes who was low at the first but rising by degrees at last reaches the very heavens  ii verse   when baleful eris etc with what a wonderful sublimity does the poet begin this book he awakens the readers curiosity and sounds an alarm to the approaching battle with what magnificence does he usher in the deeds of agamemnon he seems for a while to have lost all view of the main battle and lets the whole action of the poem stand still to attend the motions of this single hero instead of an herald he brings down a goddess to inflame the army instead of a trumpet or such warlike music juno and minerva thunder over the field of battle jove rains down drops of blood and averts his eyes from such a scene of horrors  by the goddess eris is meant that ardour and impatience for the battle which now inspired the grecian army they who just before were almost in despair now burn for the fight and breath nothing but war eustathius  iii verse    orthian song this is a kind of an odaic song invented and sung on purpose to fire the soul to noble deeds in war such was that of timotheus before alexander the great which had such an influence upon him that he leaped from his seat and laid hold on his arms eustathius  iv verse    king cinyras it is probable this passage of cinyras king of cyprus alludes to a true history and what makes it the more so is that this island was famous for its mines of several metals eustathius  v verse    arching bowed etc eustathius observes that the poet intended to represent the bending figure of these serpents as well as their color by comparing them to rainbows dacier observes here how close a parallel this passage of homer bears to that in genesis where god tells noah i have set my bow in the clouds that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and the earth  vi verse    the foot and those who wield the lighter arms rush forward here we see the order of battle is inverted and opposite to that which nestor proposed in the fourth book for it is the cavalry which is there sustained by the infantry here the infantry by the cavalry but to deliver my opinion i believe it was the nearness of the enemy that obliged agamemnon to change the disposition of the battle he would break their battalions with his infantry and complete their defeat by his cavalry which should fall upon the flyers dacier  vii verse  0 red drops of blood these prodigies with which homer embellishes his poetry are the same with those which history relates not as ornaments but as truths nothing is more common in history than showers of blood and philosophy gives us the reason of them the two battles which had been fought on the plains of troy had so drenched them with blood that a great quantity of it might be exhaled in vapors and carried into the air and being there condensed fall down again in dews and drops of the same color eustathius  viii verse    as the red star we have just seen at full length the picture of the general of the greeks here we see hector beautifully drawn in miniature this proceeded from the great judgment of the poet twas necessary to speak fully of agamemnon who was to be the chief hero of this battle and briefly of hector who had so often been spoken of at large before this is an instance that the poet well knew when to be concise and when to be copious it is impossible that any thing should be more happily imagined than this similitude it is so lively that we see hector sometimes shining in arms at the head of his troops and then immediately lose sight of him while he retires in the ranks of the army eustathius  ix verse    as sweating reapers twill be necessary for the understanding of this similitude to explain the method of mowing in homers days they mowed in the same manner as they plowed beginning at the extremes of the field which was equally divided and proceeding till they met in the middle of it by this means they raised an emulation between both parties which should finish their share first if we consider this custom we shall find it a very happy comparison to the two armies advancing against each other together with an exact resemblance in every circumstance the poet intended to illustrate  x verse     what time in some sequestered vale the weary woodman etc one may gather from hence that in homers time they did not measure the day by hours but by the progression of the sun and distinguished the parts of it by the most noted employments as in the    of the odysseis     from the rising of the judges and here from the dining of the labourer  it may perhaps be entertaining to the reader to see a general account of the mensuration of time among the ancients which i shall take from spondanus at the beginning of the world it is certain there was no distinction of time but by the light and darkness and the whole day was included in the general terms of the evening and the morning munster makes a pretty observation upon this custom our longlivd forefathers says he had not so much occasion to be exact observers how the day passed as their frailer sons whose shortness of life makes it necessary to distinguish every part of time and suffer none of it to slip away without their observation  it is not improbable but that the chaldaeans many ages after the flood were the first who divided the day into hours they being the first who applied themselves with any success to astrology the most ancient sundial we read of is that of achaz mentioned in the second book of kings chapter  0 about the time of the building of rome but as these were of no use on clouded days and in the night there was another invention of measuring the parts of time by water but that not being sufficiently exact they laid it aside for another by sand  it is certain the use of dials was earlier among the greeks than the romans twas above three hundred years after the building of rome before they knew any thing of them but yet they had divided the day and night into twenty four hours as appears from varro and macrobius though they did not count the hours as we do numerically but from midnight to midnight and distinguished them by particular names as by the cock crowing the dawn the midday etc the first sundial we read of among the romans which divided the day into hours is mentioned by pliny lib   cap  0 fixed upon the temple of quirinus by l papyrius the censor about the    th year of the wars with pyrrhus but the first that was of any use to the public was set up near the rostra in the forum by valerius messala the consul after the taking of catana in sicily from whence it was brought thirty years after the first had been set up by papyrius but this was still an imperfect one the lines of it not exactly corresponding with the several hours yet they made use of it many years till q marcius philippus placed another by it greatly improved but these had still one common defect of being useless in the night and when the skies were overcast all these inventions being thus ineffectual scipio nasica some years afterward measured the day and night into hours from the dropping of water  yet near this time it may be gathered that sundials were very frequent in rome from a fragment preserved by aulus gellius and ascribed to plautus the lines are so beautiful that i cannot deny the reader the satisfaction of seeing them they are supposed to be spoken by an hungry parasite upon a sight of one of these dials ut illum dii perdant primus qui horas repperit quique adeo primus statuit heic solarium qui mihi comminuit misero articulatim diem nam me puero uterus hic erat solarium multo omnium istorum optimum and verissumum ubi iste monebat esse nisi cum nihil erat nunc etiam quod est non est nisi soli lubet itaque adeo jam oppletum est oppidum solariis major pars populi aridi reptant fame we find frequent mention of the hours in the course of this poem but to prevent any mistake it may not be improper to take notice that they must always be understood to mean the seasons and not the division of the day by hours  xi verse     the greeks impulsive might we had just before seen that all the gods were withdrawn from the battle that jupiter was resolved even against the inclinations of them all to honor the trojans yet we here see the greeks breaking through them the love the poet bears to his countrymen makes him aggrandize their valor and overruled even the decrees of fate to vary his battles he supposes the gods to be absent this day and they are no sooner gone but the courage of the greeks prevails even against the determination of jupiter eustathius  xii verse     naked to the sky eustathius refines upon this place and believes that homer intended by particularizing the whiteness of the limbs to ridicule the effeminate education of these unhappy youths but as such an interpretation may be thought below the majesty of an epic poem and a kind of barbarity to insult the unfortunate i thought it better to give the passage an air of compassion as the words are equally capable of either meaning i imagined the reader would be more pleased with the humanity of the one than with the satyr of the other  xiii verse     these on the mountains once achilles found homer says eustathius never lets any opportunity pass of mentioning the hero of his poem achilles he gives here an instance of his former resentment and at once varies his poetry and exalts his character nor does he mention him cursorily he seems unwilling to leave him and when he pursues the thread of the story in a few lines takes occasion to speak again of him this is a very artful conduct by mentioning him so frequently he takes care that the reader should not forget him and shows the importance of that hero whose anger is the subject of his poem eustathius  xiv verse     antimachus who once in council stood to shed ulysses and my brothers blood it is observable that homer with a great deal of art interweaves the true history of the trojan war in his poem he here gives a circumstance that carries us back from the tenth year of the war to the very beginning of it so that although the action of the poem takes up but a small part of the last year of the war yet by such incidents as these we are taught a great many particulars that happen through the whole series of it eustathius  xv verse     lopped his hands away i think one cannot but compassionate the fate of these brothers who suffer for the sins of their father notwithstanding the justice which the commentators find in this action of agamemnon and i can much less imagine that his cutting off their hands was meant for an express example against bribery in revenge for the gold which antimachus had received from paris eustathius is very refining upon this point but the grave spondanus outdoes them all who has found there was an excellent conceit in cutting off the hands and head of the son the first because the father had been for laying hands on the grecian ambassadors and the second because it was from his head that the advice proceeded of detaining helena  xvi verse     now by the foot the flying foot etc after homer with a poetical justice has punished the sons of antimachus for the crimes of the father he carries on the narration and presents all the terrors of the battle to our view we see in the lively description the men and chariots overthrown and hear the tramplings of the horses feet thus the poet very artfully by such sudden alarms awakens the attention of the reader that is apt to be tired and grow remiss by a plain and more cool narration  xvii verse     the brasshoofd steeds eustathius observes that the custom of shoeing horses was in use in homers time and calls the shoes  from the figure of an half moon  xviii verse     more grateful now to vulturs than their wives this is a reflection of the poet and such an one as arises from a sentiment of compassion and indeed there is nothing more moving than to see those heroes who were the love and delight of their spouses reduced suddenly to such a condition of horror that their very wives dare not look upon them i was very much surprised to find a remark of eustathius upon this which seems very wrong and unjust he would have it that there is in this place an ellipsis for says he which comprehends a severe raillery homer would imply that those dead warriors were now more agreeable to vulturs than they had ever been in all their days to their wives this is very ridiculous to suppose that these unhappy women did not love their husbands is to insult them barbarously in their affliction and every body can see that such a thought in this place would have appeared mean frigid and out of season homer always endeavors to excite compassion by the grief of the wives whose husbands are killed in the battle dacier  xix verse     now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay by the exactness of homers description we see as in a landscape the very place where this battle was fought agamemnon drives the trojans from the tomb of ilus where they encamped all the night that tomb stood in the middle of the plain from thence he pursues them by the wild fig tree to the beechtree and from thence to the very scaean gate thus the scene of action is fixed and we see the very rout through which the one retreats and the other advances eustathius  xx verse     iris with haste thy golden wings display it is evident that some such contrivance as this was necessary the trojans we learn from the beginning of this book were to be victorious this day but if jupiter had not now interposed they had been driven even within the walls of troy by this means also the poet consults both for the honor of hector and that of agamemnon agamemnon has time enough to show the greatness of his valor and it is no disgrace to hector not to encounter him when jupiter interposes  eustathius observes that the poet gives us here a sketch of what is drawn out at large in the story of this whole book this he does to raise the curiosity of the reader and make him impatient to hear those great actions which must be performed before agamemnon can retire and hector be victorious  xxi verse     ye sacred nine the poet to win the attention of the reader and seeming himself to be struck with the exploits of agamemnon while he recites them who when the battle was rekindled rushes out to engage his enemies invokes not one muse as he did in the beginning of the poem but as if he intended to warn us that he was about to relate something surprising he invokes the whole nine and then as if he had received their inspiration goes on to deliver what they suggested to him by means of this apostrophe the imagination of the reader is so filled that he seems not only present but active in the scene to which the skill of the poet has transported him eustathius  xxii verse     iphidamas the bold and young homer here gives us the history of this iphidamas his parentage the place of his birth and many circumstances of his private life this he does to diversify his poetry and to soften with some amiable embellishments the continual horrors that must of necessity strike the imagination in an uninterrupted narration of blood and slaughter eustathius  xxiii verse   0 theano s sister that the reader may not be shocked at the marriage of iphidamas with his mothers sister it may not be amiss to observe from eustathius that consanguinity was no impediment in greece in the days of homer nor is iphidamas singular in this kind of marriage for diomed was married to his own aunt as well as he  xxiv verse     the fierce ilythiae these ilythiae are the goddesses that homer supposes to preside over childbirth he arms their hands with a kind of an instrument from which a pointed dart is shot into the distressed mother as an arrow is from a bow so that as eris has her torch and jupiter his thunder these goddesses have their darts which they shoot into women in travail he calls them the daughters of juno because she presides over the marriage bed eustathius here says dacier we find the style of the holy scripture which to express a severe pain usually compares it to that of women in labor thus david pain came upon them as upon a woman in travail and isaiah they shall grieve as a woman in travail and all the prophets are full of the like expressions  xxv verse     lo angry jove forbids your chief to stay eustathius remarks upon the behavior of agamemnon in his present distress homer describes him as racked with almost intolerable pains yet he does not complain of the anguish he suffers but that he is obliged to retire from the fight  this indeed as it proved his undaunted spirit so did it likewise his wisdom had he showed any unmanly dejection it would have dispirited the army but his intrepidity makes them believe his wound less dangerous and renders them not so highly concerned for the absence of their general  xxvi verse     say muse when jove the trojan s glory crowned the poet just before has given us an invocation of the muses to make us attentive to the great exploits of agamemnon here we have one with regard to hector but this last may perhaps be more easily accounted for than the other for in that after so solemn an invocation we might reasonably have expected wonders from the hero whereas in reality he kills but one man before he himself is wounded and what he does afterward seems to proceed from a frantic valor arising from the smart of the wound we do not find by the text that he kills one man but overthrows several in his fury and then retreats so that one would imagine he invoked the muses only to describe his retreat  but upon a nearer view we shall find that homer shows a commendable partiality to his own countryman and hero agamemnon he seems to detract from the greatness of hectors actions by ascribing them to jupiter whereas agamemnon conquers by the dint of bravery and that this is a just observation will appear by what follows those greeks that fall by the sword of hector he passes over as if they were all vulgar men he says nothing of them but that they died and only briefly mentions their names as if he endeavored to conceal the overthrow of the greeks but when he speaks of his favorite general agamemnon he expatiates and dwells upon his actions and shows us that those that fell by his hand were all men of distinction such as were the sons of priam of antenor and antimachus it is true hector killed as many leaders of the greeks as agamemnon of the trojans and more of the common soldiers but by particularizing the deaths of the chiefs of troy he sets the deeds of agamemnon in the strongest point of light and by his silence in respect to the leaders whom hector slew he casts a shade over the greatness of the action and consequently it appears less conspicuous  xxvii verse  0  but wise ulysses called tydides forth there is something instructive in the most seemingly common passages of homer who by making the wise ulysses direct the brave diomed in all the enterprises of the last book and by maintaining the same conduct in this intended to show this moral that valor should always be under the guidance of wisdom thus in the eighth book when diomed could scarce be restrained by the thunder of jupiter nestor is at hand to moderate his courage and this hero seems to have made a very good use of those instructions his valor no longer runs out into rashness though he is too brave to decline the fight yet he is too wise to fight against jupiter  xxviii verse     great diomed himself was seized with fear there seems to be some difficulty in these words this brave warrior who has frequently met hector in the battle and offered himself for the single combat is here said to be seized with fear at the very sight of him this may be thought not to agree with his usual behavior and to derogate from the general character of his intrepidity but we must remember that diomed himself has but just told us that jupiter fought against the grecians and that all the endeavors of himself and ulysses would be in vain this fear therefore of diomed is far from being dishonorable it is not hector but jupiter of whom he is afraid eustathius  xxix verse     ilus monument i thought it necessary just to put the reader in mind that the battle still continues near the tomb of ilus by a just observation of that we may with pleasure see the various turns of the fight and how every step of ground is won or lost as the armies are repulsed or victorious  xxx verse   0 just as he stooped agastrophus s crest to seize and draw the corselet from his breast one would think that the poet at all times endeavored to condemn the practice of stripping the dead during the heat of action he frequently describes the victor wounded while he is so employed about the bodies of the slain thus in the present book we see agamemnon diomed ulysses elephenor and eurypylus all suffer as they strip the men they slew and in the sixth book he brings in the wise nestor directly forbidding it eustathius  xxxi verse     but pierced his foot it cannot but be a satisfaction to the reader to see the poet smitten with the love of his country and at all times consulting its honor this day was to be glorious to troy but homer takes care to remove with honor most of the bravest greeks from the field of battle before the trojans can conquer thus agamemnon diomed and ulysses must bleed before the poet can allow his countrymen to retreat eustathius  xxxii verse     the laughing trojan eustathius is of opinion that the poet intended to satyrize in this place the unwarlike behavior of paris such an effeminate laugh and gesture is unbecoming a brave warrior but agrees very well with the character of paris he is before said to be more delighted with the soft amorous lyre than with the warlike sound of the battle nor do i remember that in the whole iliad any one person is described in such an indecent transport though upon a much more glorious or successful action he concludes his ludicrous insult with a circumstance very much to the honor of diomed and very much to the disadvantage of his own character who reveals to an enemy the fears of troy and compares the greeks to lions and the trojans to sheep diomed is the very reverse of him he despises and lessens the wound he received and in the midst of his pain would not gratify his enemy with the little joy he might give him by letting him know it  xxxiii verse     and questions thus his own unconquered soul this is a passage which very much strikes me we have here a brave hero making a noble soliloquy or rather calling a council within himself when he was singly to encounter an army it is impossible for the reader not to be in pain for so gallant a man in such an imminent danger he must be impatient for the event and his whole curiosity must be awakened till he knows the fate of ulysses who scorned to fly though encompassed by an army  xxxiv verse   0 by pallas care it is a just observation that there is no moral so evident or so constantly carried on through the iliad as the necessity mankind at all times has of divine assistance nothing is performed with success without particular mention of this hector is not saved from a dart without apollo or ulysses without minerva homer is perpetually acknowledging the hand of god in all events and ascribing to that only all the victories triumphs rewards or punishments of men thus the grand moral he laid down at the entrance of his poem  the will of god was fulfilled runs through his whole work and is with a most remarkable care and conduct put into the mouths of his greatest and wisest persons on every occasion  homer generally makes some peculiar god attend on each hero for the ancients believed that every man had his particular tutelary deity these in succeeding times were called demons or genii who as they thought were given to men at the hour of their birth and directed the whole course of their lives see cebess tablet menander as he is cited by ammianus marcellinus styles them  the invisible guides of life  xxxv verse     famed son of hippasus homer has been blamed by some late censurers for making his heroes address discourses to the dead passion says dacier dictates these speeches and it is generally to the dying not to the dead that they are addressed however one may say that they are often rather reflections than insults were it otherwise homer deserves not to be censured for feigning what histories have reported as truth we find in plutarch that mark antony upon sight of the dead body of brutus stopped and reproached him with the death of his brother caius whom brutus had killed in macedonia in revenge for the murder of cicero i must confess i am not altogether pleased with the railleries he sometimes uses to a vanquished warrior which inhumanities if spoken to the dying would i think be yet worse than after they were dead  xxxvi verse     and hovering vulturs scream around their prey this is not literally translated what the poet says gives us the most lively picture imaginable of the vulturs in the act of tearing their prey with their bills they beat the body with their wings as they rend it which is a very natural circumstance but scarce possible to be copied by a translator without losing the beauty of it  xxxvii verse     me greece shall honor when i meet my doom with solemn funerals   we may see from such passages as these that honors paid to the ashes of the dead have been greatly valued in all ages this posthumous honor was paid as a public acknowledgment that the person deceased had deserved well of his country and consequently was an incitement to the living to imitate his actions in this view there is no man but would be ambitious of them not as they are testimonies of titles or riches but of distinguished merit  xxxviii verse     great ajax like the god of war attends the silence of other heroes on many occasions is very beautiful in homer but peculiarly so in ajax who is a gallant rough soldier and readier to act than to speak the present necessity of ulysses required such a behavior for the least delay might have been fatal to him ajax therefore complying both with his own inclinations and the urgent condition of ulysses makes no reply to menelaus but immediately hastens to his relief the reader will observe how justly the poet maintains this character of ajax throughout the whole iliad who is often silent when he has an opportunity to speak and when he speaks it is like a soldier with a martial air and always with brevity eustathius  xxxix verse     a wise physician the poet passes a very signal commendation upon physicians the army had seen several of the bravest of their heroes wounded yet were not so much dispirited for them all as they were at the single danger of machaon but the person whom he calls a physician seems rather to be a surgeon the cutting out of arrows and applying anodynes being the province of the latter however as eustathius says we must conclude that machaon was both a physician and surgeon and that those two professions were practiced by one person  it is reasonable to think from the frequency of their wars that the profession in those days was chiefly chirurgical celsus says expressly that the diaetetic was long after invented but that botany was in great esteem and practice appears from the stories of medea circe etc we often find mention among the most ancient writers of women eminent in that art as of agamede in this very book   0 who is said like solomon to have known the virtues of every plant that grew on the earth and of polydamne in the fourth book of the odysseis     etc  homer i believe knew all that was known in his time of the practice of these arts his methods of extracting of arrows stanching of blood by the bitter root fomenting of wounds with warm water applying proper bandages and remedies are all according to the true precepts of art there are likewise several passages in his works that show his knowledge of the virtues of plants even of those qualities which are commonly tho perhaps erroneously ascribed to them as of the moly against enchantments the willow which causes barrenness the nepenthe etc  xl verse     but partial jove etc the address of homer in bringing off ajax with decency is admirable he makes hector afraid to approach him he brings down jupiter himself to terrify him so that he retreats not from a mortal but a god  this whole passage is inimitably just and beautiful we see ajax drawn in the most bold and strong colors and in a manner alive in the description we see him slowly and sullenly retreat between two armies and even with a look repulsing the one and protecting the other there is not one line but what resembles ajax the character of a stubborn but undaunted warrior is perfectly maintained and must strike the reader at the first view he compares him first to the lion for his undauntedness in fighting and then to the ass for his stubborn slowness in retreating though in the latter comparison there are many other points of likeness that enliven the image the havoc he makes in the field is represented by the tearing and trampling down the harvests and we see the bulk strength and obstinacy of the hero when the trojans in respect to him are compared but to troops of boys that impotently endeavor to drive him away  eustathius is silent as to those objections which have been raised against this last simile for a pretended want of delicacy this alone is conviction to me that they are all of a later date for else he would not have failed to have vindicated his favorite poet in a passage that had been applauded many hundreds of years and stood the test of ages  but monsieur dacier has done it very well in his remarks upon aristotle in the time of homer says that author an ass was not in such circumstances of contempt as in ours the name of that animal was not then converted into a term of reproach but it was a beast upon which kings and princes might be seen with dignity and it will not be very discreet to ridicule this comparison which the holy scripture has put into the mouth of jacob who says in the benediction of his children issachar shall be as a strong ass monsieur de la motte gives up this point and excuses homer for his choice of this animal but is unhappily disgusted at the circumstance of the boys and the obstinate gluttony of the ass which he says are images too mean to represent the determined valor of ajax and the fury of his enemies it is answered by madam dacier that what homer here images is not the gluttony but the patience the obstinacy and strength of the ass as eustathius had before observed to judge rightly of comparisons we are not to examine if the subject from whence they are derived be great or little noble or familiar but we are principally to consider if the image produced be clear and lively if the poet has the skill to dignify it by poetical words and if it perfectly paints the thing it is intended to represent a company of boys whipping a top is very far from a great and noble subject yet virgil has not scrupled to draw from it a similitude which admirably expresses a princess in the violence of her passion ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum intenti ludo exercent ille actus habena curvatis fertur spatiis stupet inscia supra impubesque manus mirata volubile buxum dant animos plagae  etc aen lib   however upon the whole a translator owes so much to the taste of the age in which he lives as not to make too great a complement to a former and this induced me to omit the mention of the word ass in the translation i believe the reader will pardon me if on this occasion i transcribe a passage from mr boileaus notes on longinus  there is nothing says he that more disgraces a composition than the use of mean and vulgar words insomuch that generally speaking a mean thought expressed in noble terms is more tolerable than a noble thought expressed in mean ones the reason whereof is that all the world are not capable to judge of the justness and force of a thought but there is scarce any man who cannot especially in a living language perceive the least meanness of words nevertheless very few writers are free from this vice longinus accuses herodotus the most polite of all the greek historians of this defect and livy salust and virgil have not escaped the same censure is it not then very surprising that no reproach on this account has been ever cast upon homer though he has composed two poems each more voluminous than the aeneid and though no author whatever has descended more frequently than he into a detail of little particularities yet he never uses terms which are not noble or if he uses humble words or phrases it is with so much art and industry that as dionysius observes they become noble and harmonious undoubtedly if there had been any cause to charge him with this fault longinus had spared him no more than herodotus we may learn from hence the ignorance of those modern critics who resolving to judge of the greek without the knowledge of it and never reading homer but in low and inelegant translations impute the meannesses of his translators to the poet himself and ridiculously blame a man who spoke in one language for speaking what is not elegant in another they ought to know that the words of different languages are not always exactly correspondent and it may often happen that a word which is very noble in greek cannot be rendered in another tongue but by one which is very mean thus the word asinus in latin and ass in english are the vilest imaginable but that which signifies the same animal in greek and hebrew is of dignity enough to be employed on the most magnificent occasions in like manner the terms of a hogherd and cowkeeper in our language are insufferable but those which answer to them in greek  and  are graceful and harmonious and virgil who in his own tongue entitled his eclogs bucolica would have been ashamed to have called them in ours the dialogues of cowkeepers  xli verse     back to the lines the wounded greek retires we see here almost all the chiefs of the grecian army withdrawn nestor and ulysses the two great counselors agamemnon diomed and eurypylus the bravest warriors all retreated so that now in this necessity of the greeks there was occasion for the poet to open a new scene of action or else the trojans had been victorious and the grecians driven from the shores of troy to show the distress of the greeks at this period from which the poem takes a new turn twill be convenient to cast a view on the posture of their affairs all human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes and all assistance from the gods forbid by jupiter whereas the trojans see their general at their head and jupiter himself fights on their side upon this hinge turns the whole poem the distress of the greeks occasions first the assistance of patroclus and then the death of that hero draws on the return of achilles it is with great art that the poet conducts all these incidents he lets achilles have the pleasure of seeing that the greeks were no longer able to carry on the war without his assistance and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the poem eustathius  xlii verse     that hour achilles etc though the resentment of achilles would not permit him to be an actor in the battle yet his love of war inclines him to be a spectator and as the poet did not intend to draw the character of a perfect man in achilles he makes him delighted with the destruction of the greeks because it conspired with his revenge that resentment which is the subject of the poem still prevails over all his other passions even the love of his country for though he begins now to pity his countrymen yet his anger stifles those tender emotions and he seems pleased with their distress because he judges it will contribute to his glory eustathius  xliii verse     his friend machaon etc it may be asked why machaon is the only person whom achilles pities eustathius answers that it was either because he was his countryman a thessalian or because aesculapius the father of machaon presided over physic the profession of his preceptor chiron but perhaps it may be a better reason to say that a physician is a public good and was valued by the whole army and it is not improbable but he might have cured achilles of a wound during the course of the trojan wars  xliv verse     now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan the poet by putting these words into the mouth of achilles leaves room for a second embassy and since achilles himself mentions it one may think it would not have been unsuccessful but the poet by a more happy management makes his friend patroclus the advocate of the greeks and by that means his return becomes his own choice this conduct admirably maintains the character of achilles who does not assist the greeks through his kindness to them but from a desire of revenge upon the trojans his present anger for the death of his friend blots out the former one for the injury of agamemnon and as he separated from the army in a rage so he joins it again in the like disposition eustathius  xlv verse     and took their seats beneath the shady tent the poet here steals away the reader from the battle and relieves him by the description of nestors entertainment i hope to be pardoned for having more than once repeated this observation which extends to several passages of homer without this piece of conduct the frequency and length of his battles might fatigue the reader who could not so long be delighted with continued scenes of blood  xlvi verse     a goblet sacred to the pylian kings there are some who can find out a mystery in the plainest things they can see what the author never meant and explain him into the greatest obscurities eustathius here gives us a very extraordinary instance of this nature the bowl by an allegory figures the world the spherical form of it represents its roundness the greek word which signifies the doves being spelled almost like the pleiades is said to mean that constellation and because the poet tells us the bowl was studded with gold those studs must needs imply the stars  xlvii verse     yet heaved with ease by him there has ever been a great dispute about this passage nor is it apparent for what reason the poet should tell us that nestor even in his old age could more easily lift this bowl than any other man this has drawn a great deal of raillery upon the old man as if he had learnt to lift it by frequent use an insinuation that nestor was no enemy to wine others with more justice to his character have put another construction upon the words which solves the improbability very naturally according to this opinion the word which is usually supposed to signify another man is rendered another old man meaning machaon whose wound made him incapable to lift it this would have taken away the difficulty without any violence to the construction but eustathius tells us the propriety of speech would require the word to be not  but  when spoken but of two but why then may it not signify any other old men  xlviii verse     pours a large potion the potion which hecamede here prepares for machaon has been thought a very extraordinary one in the case of a wounded person and by some critics held in the same degree of repute with the balsam of fierabras in don quizot but it is rightly observed by the commentators that machaon was not so dangerously hurt as to be obliged to a different regimen from what he might use at another time homer had just told us that he stayed on the seaside to refresh himself and he now enters into a long conversation with nestor neither of which would have been done by a man in any great pain or danger his loss of blood and spirits might make him not so much in fear of a fever as in want of a cordial and accordingly this potion is rather alimentary than medicinal if it had been directly improper in this case i cannot help fancying that homer would not have failed to tell us of machaons rejecting it yet after all some answer may be made even to the grand objection that wine was too inflammatory for a wounded man hippocrates allows wine in acute cases and even without water in cases of indigestion he says indeed in his book of ancient medicine that the ancients were ignorant both of the good and bad qualities of wine and yet the potion here prescribed will not be allowed by physicians to be an instance that they were so for wine might be proper for machaon not only as a cordial but as an opiate asclepiades a physician who flourished at rome in the time of pompey prescribed wine in fevers and even in phrenzies to cause sleep caelius aurelianus lib   c     xlix verse  0  can then the sons of greece etc it is customary with those who translate or comment on an author to use him as they do their mistress they can see no faults or rather convert his very faults into beauties but i cannot be so partial to homer as to imagine that this speech of nestors is not greatly blameable for being too long he crowds incident upon incident and when he speaks of himself he expatiates upon his own great actions very naturally indeed to old age but unseasonably in the present juncture when he comes to speak of his killing the son of augeas he is so pleased with himself that he forgets the distress of the army and cannot leave his favorite subject till he has given us the pedigree of his relations his wifes name her excellence the command he bore and the fury with which he assaulted him these and many other circumstances as they have no visible allusion to the design of the speech seem to be unfortunately introduced in short i think they are not so valuable upon any other account as because they preserve a piece of ancient history which had otherwise been lost  what tends yet farther to make this story seem absurd is what patroclus said at the beginning of the speech that he had not leisure even to sit down so that nestor detains him in the tent standing during the whole narration  they that are of the contrary opinion observe that there is a great deal of art in some branches of the discourse that when nestor tells patroclus how he had himself disobeyed his fathers commands for the sake of his country he says it to make achilles reflect that he disobeys his father by the contrary behavior that what he did himself was to retaliate a small injury but achilles by fighting may save the grecian army he mentions the wound of agamemnon at the very beginning with an intent to give achilles a little revenge and that he may know how much his greatest enemy has suffered by his absence there are many other arguments brought in the defense of particular parts and it may not be from the purpose to observe that nestor might designedly protract the speech that patroclus might himself behold the distress of the army thus every moment he detained him enforced his arguments by the growing misfortunes of the greeks whether this was the intention or not it must be allowed that the stay of patroclus was very happy for the greeks for by this means he met eurypylus wounded who confirmed him into a certainty that their affairs were desperate without achilless aid  as for nestors second story it is much easier to be defended it tends directly to the matter in hand and is told in such a manner as to affect both patroclus and achilles the circumstances are well adapted to the person to whom they are spoken and by repeating their fathers instructions he as it were brings them in seconding his admonitions  l verse     the bulls of elis in glad triumph led elis is the whole southern part of peloponnesus between achaia and messenia it was originally divided into several districts or principalities afterward it was reduced to two the one of the elians who were the same with the epeians the other of nestor this remark is necessary for the understanding what follows in homers time the city elis was not built dacier  li verse     at the public course detained his chariot it is said that these were particular games which augeas had established in his own state and that the olympic games cannot be here understood because hercules did not institute them till he had killed this king and delivered his kingdom to phyleus whom his father augeas had banished the prizes of these games of augeas were prizes of wealth as golden tripods etc whereas the prizes of the olympic games were only plain chaplets of leaves or branches besides it is probable homer knew nothing of these chaplets given at the games nor of the triumphal crowns nor of the garlands wore at feasts if he had he would some where or other have mentioned them eustathius  lii verse     the sons of actor these are the same whom homer calls the two molions namely eurytus and cteatus thryoessa in the lines following is the same town which he calls thryon in the catalogue the river minyas is the same with anygrus about half way between pylos and thryoessa called minyas from the minyans who lived on the banks of it it appears from what the poet says of the time of their march that it is half a days march between pylos and thryoessa eustathius strabo lib    liii verse     there to high jove were public thanks assigned as first of gods to nestor of mankind there is a resemblance between this passage and one in the sacred scripture where all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king   chronicles     0  live verse     peleus said only this  my son be brave the conciseness of this advice is very beautiful achilles being hasty active and young might not have burdened his memory with a long discourse therefore peleus comprehends all his instructions in one sentence but menoetius speaks more largely to patroclus he being more advanced in years and mature in judgment and we see by the manner of the expression that he was sent with achilles not only as a companion but as a monitor of which nestor puts him in mind to show that it is rather his duty to give good advice to achilles than to follow his caprice and espouse his resentment eustathius  lv verse     ah try the utmost etc it may not be ungrateful to the reader to see at one view the aim and design of nestors speech by putting patroclus in mind of his fathers injunctions he provokes him to obey him by a like zeal for his country by the mention of the sacrifice he reprimands him for a breach of those engagements to which the gods were witnesses by saying that the very arms of achilles would restore the fortunes of greece he makes a high complement to that hero and offers a powerful insinuation to patroclus at the same time by giving him to understand that he may personate achilles eustathius  lvi verse     if ought from heaven withold his saving arm nestor says this upon account of what achilles himself spoke in the ninth book and it is very much to the purpose for nothing could sooner move achilles than to make him think it was the general report in the army that he shut himself up in his tent for no other reason but to escape death with which his mother had threatened him in discovering to him the decrees of the destinies dacier  lvii verse     of two famed surgeons though podalirius is mentioned first for the sake of the verse both here and in the catalogue machaon seems to be the person of the greatest character upon many accounts besides it is to him that homer attributes the cure of philoctetes who was lame by having let an arrow dipped in the gall of the hydra of lerna fall upon his foot a plain mark that machaon was an abler physician than chiron the centaure who could not cure himself of such a wound podalirius had a son named hypolochus from whom the famous hippocrates was descended  lviii verse     but this distress this instant claims relief eustathius remarks that homer draws a great advantage for the conduct of his poem from this incident of the stay of patroclus for while he is employed in the friendly task of taking care of eurypylus he becomes an eyewitness of the attack upon the entrenchments and finds the necessity of using his utmost efforts to move achilles  the twelfth book of the iliad the argument the battle at the grecian wall the greeks being retired into their entrenchments hector attempts to force them but it proving impossible to pass the ditch polydamas advises to quit their chariots and manage the attack on foot the trojans follow his counsel and having divided their army into five bodies of foot begin the assault but upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons which appeared on the left hand of the trojans polydamas endeavors to withdraw them again this hector opposes and continues the attack in which after many actions sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall hector also casting a stone of a vast size forces open one of the gates and enters at the head of his troops who victoriously pursue the grecians even to their ships  the twelfth book of the iliad while thus the heros pious cares attend the cure and safety of

fierce to the left he drives where from the plain the flying grecians strove their ships to gain swift through the wall their horse and chariots past the gates halfopend to receive the last thither exulting in his force he flies his following host with clamours rend the skies to plunge the grecians headlong in the main such their proud hopes but all their hopes were vain to guard the gates two mighty chiefs attend who from the lapiths warlike race descend this polypaetes great perithous heir and that leonteus like the god of war as two tall oaks before the wall they rise their roots in earth their heads amidst the skies whose spreading arms with leafy honors crowned forbid the tempest and protect the ground high on the hills appears their stately form and their deep roots for ever brave the storm so graceful these and so the shock they stand of raging asius and his furious band orestes acamas in front appear and oenomaus and thoon close the rear in vain their clamours shake the ambient fields in vain around them beat their hollow shields the fearless brothers on the grecians call to guard their navies and defend the wall even when they saw troys sable troops impend and greece tumultuous from her towers descend forth from the portals rushed the intrepid pair opposed their breasts and stood themselves the war so two wild boars spring furious from their den roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men on every side the crackling trees they tear and root the shrubs and lay the forest bare they gnash their tusks with fire their eye balls roll till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul around their heads the whistling javelins sung with sounding strokes their brazen targets rung fierce was the fight while yet the grecian powers maintained the walls and manned the lofty towers to save their fleet the last efforts they try and stones and darts in mingled tempests fly as when sharp boreas blows abroad and brings the dreary winter on his frozen wings beneath the lowhung clouds the sheets of snow descend and whiten all the fields below so fast the darts on either army pour so down the rampires rolls the rocky shower heavy and thick resound the battered shields and the deaf echo rattles round the fields with shame repulsed with grief and fury driven the frantic asius thus accuses heaven in powers immortal who shall now believe can those too flatter and can jove deceive what man could doubt but troys victorious power should humble greece and this her fatal hour but look how wasps from hollow crannies drive to guard the entrance of their common hive darkning the rock while with unwearied wings they strike thassailants and infix their stings a race determined that to death contend so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend gods shall two warriors only guard their gates repel an army and defraud the fates these empty accents mingled with the wind nor moved great joves unalterable mind to godlike hector and his matchless might was owed the glory of the destined fight like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried and all the gates sustained an equal tide through the long walls the stony showers were heard the blaze of flames the flash of arms appeared the spirit of a god my breast inspire to raise each act to life and sing with fire while greece unconquered kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair and all her guardian gods in deep dismay with unassisting arms deplored the day even yet the dauntless lapithae maintain the dreadful pass and round them heap the slain first damasus by polypoetes steel pierced through his helmets brazen vizor fell the weapon drank the mingled brains and gore the warrior sinks tremendous now no more next ormenus and pylon yield their breath nor less leonteus strows the field with death first through the belt hippomachus he goard then sudden waved his unresisted sword antiphates as through the ranks he broke the faulchion struck and fate pursued the stroke iamenus orestes menon bled and round him rose a monument of dead meantime the bravest of the the trojan crew bold hector and polydamas pursue fierce with impatience on the works to fall and wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall these on the farther bank now stood and gazed by heaven alarmed by prodigies amazed a signal omen stopped the passing host their martial fury in their wonder lost joves bird on sounding pinions beat the skies a bleeding serpent of enormous size his talons trussed alive and curling round he stung the bird whose throat received the wound mad with the smart he drops the fatal prey in airy circles wings his painful way floats on the winds and rends the heavens with cries amidst the host the fallen serpent lies they pale with terror mark its spires unrolld and joves portent with beating hearts behold then first polydamas the silence broke long weighed the signal and to hector spoke how often my brother thy reproach i bear for words well meant and sentiments sincere true to those counsels which i judge the best i tell the faithful dictates of my breast to speak his thought is every freemans right in peace and war in council and in fight and all i move deferring to thy sway but tends to raise that power which i obey then hear my words nor may my words be vain seek not this day the grecian ships to gain for sure to warn us jove his omen sent and thus my mind explains its clear event the victor eagle whose sinister flight retards our host and fills our hearts with fright dismissed his conquest in the middle skies allowed to seize but not possess the prize thus though we gird with fires the grecian fleet though these proud bulwarks tumble at our feet toils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed more woes shall follow and more heroes bleed so bodes my soul and bids me thus advise for thus a skilful seer would read the skies to him then hector with disdain returned fierce as he spoke his eyes with fury burned are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue thy will is partial not thy reason wrong or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent what coward counsels would thy madness move against the word the will revealed of jove the leading sign the irrevocable nod and happy thunders of the favoring god these shall i slight and guide my wavering mind by wandering birds that flit with every wind ye vagrants of the sky your wings extend or where the suns arise or where descend to right to left unheeded take your way while i the dictates of high heaven obey without a sign his sword the brave man draws and asks no omen but his countrys cause but why should thou suspect the wars success none fears it more as none promotes it less though all our chiefs amid yon ships expire trust thy own cowardice to scape their fire troy and her sons may find a general grave but thou can live for thou can be a slave yet should the fears that wary mind suggests spread their cold poison through our soldiers breasts my javelin can revenge so base a part and free the soul that quivers in thy heart furious he spoke and rushing to the wall calls on his host his host obey the call with ardour follow where their leader flies redoubling clamours thunder in the skies jove breaths a whirlwind from the hills of i would and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide he fills the greeks with terror and dismay and gives great hector the predestined day strong in themselves but stronger in his aid close to the works their rigid siege they laid in vain the mounds and massy beams defend while these they undermine and those they rend upheave the piles that prop the solid wall and heaps on heaps the smoaky ruins fall greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms shield touching shield a longrefulgent row whence hissing darts incessant rain below the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower and rouse with flame divine the grecian power the generous impulse every greek obeys threats urge the fearful and the valiant praise fellows in arms whose deeds are known to fame and you whose ardour hopes an equal name since not alike endud with force or art behold a day when each may act his part a day to fire the brave and warm the cold to gain new glories or augment the old urge those who stand and those who faint excite drown hectors vaunts in loud exhorts of fight conquest not safety fill the thoughts of all seek not your fleet but sally from the wall so jove once more may drive their routed train and troy lie trembling in her walls again their ardour kindles all the grecian powers and now the stones descend in heavier showers as when high jove his sharp artillry forms and opes his cloudy magazine of storms in winters bleak uncomfortable reign a snowy inundation hides the plain he stills the winds and bids the skies to sleep then pours the silent tempest thick and deep and first the mountain tops are covered over then the green fields and then the sandy shore bent with the weight the nodding woods are seen and one bright waste hides all the works of men the circling seas alone absorbing all drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall so from each side increased the stony rain and the white ruin rises over the plain thus godlike hector and his troops contend to force the ramparts and the gates to rend nor troy could conquer nor the greeks would yield till great sarpedon towrd amid the field for mighty jove inspired with martial flame his matchless son and urged him on to fame in arms he shines conspicuous from afar and bears aloft his ample shield in air within whose orb the thick bullhides were rolled ponderous with brass and bound with ductile gold and while two pointed javelins arm his hands majestic moves along and leads his lycian bands so pressed with hunger from the mountains brow descends a lion on the flocks below so stalks the lordly savage over the plain in sullen majesty and stern disdain in vain loud mastives bay him from from afar and shepherds gaul him with an iron war regardless furious he pursues his way he foams he roars he rends the panting prey resolved alike divine sarpedon glows with generous rage that drives him on the foes he views the towers and meditates their fall to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall then casting on his friend an ardent look fired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke why boast we glaucus our extended reign where xanthus streams enrich the lycian plain our numerous herds that range the fruitful field and hills where vines their purple harvest yield our foaming bowls with purer nectar crowned our feasts enhancd with musics sprightly sound why on those shores are we with joy surveyed admired as heroes and as gods obeyed unless great acts superior merit prove and vindicate the bountous powers above it is ours the dignity they give to grace the first in valor as the first in place that when with wondering eyes our martial bands behold our deeds transcending our commands such they may cry deserve the sovereign state whom those that envy dare not imitate could all our care elude the gloomy grave which claims no less the fearful than the brave for lust of fame i should not vainly dare in fighting fields nor urge thy soul to war but since alas ignoble age must come disease and deaths inexorable doom the life which others pay let us bestow and give to fame what we to nature owe brave though we fall and honored if we live or let us glory gain or glory give he said his words the listening chief inspire with equal warmth and rouse the warriors fire the troops pursue their leaders with delight rush to the foe and claim the promised fight menestheus from on high the storm beheld threatening the fort and blackning in the field around the walls he gazed to view from far what aid appeared tavert the approaching war and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood of fight insatiate prodigal of blood in vain he calls the din of helms and shields rings to the skies and ecchos through the fields the brazen hinges fly the walls resound heaven trembles roar the mountains thunders all the ground then thus to thoos  hence with speed he said and urge the bold ajaces to our aid their strength united best may help to bear the bloody labors of the doubtful war hither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force but if too fiercely there the foes contend let telamon at least our towers defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe swift as the word the herald speeds along the lofty ramparts through the martial throng and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore opposed in combat on the dusty shore ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands your aid said thoos peteus son demands your strength united best may help to bear the bloody labors of the doubtful war thither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force but if too fiercely here the foes contend at least let telamon those towers defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe strait to the fort great ajax turned his care and thus bespoke his brothers of the war now valiant lycomede exert your might and brave oileus prove your force in fight to you i trust the fortune of the field till by this arm the foe shall be repelled that done expect me to complete the day  then with his sevnfold shield he strode away with equal steps bold teucer pressed the shore whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore high on the walls appeared the lycian powers like some black tempest gathering round the towers the greeks oppressed their utmost force unite prepared to labor in the unequal fight the war renews mixed shouts and groans arise tumultuous clamor mounts and thickens in the skies fierce ajax first the advancing host invades and sends the brave epicles to the shades sarpedons friend across the warriors way rent from the walls a rocky fragment lay in modern ages not the strongest swain could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain he poised and swung it round then tossed on high it flew with force and labored up the sky full on the lycians helmet thundering down the ponderous ruin crushed his battered crown as skilful diverse from some airy steep headlong descend and shoot into the deep so falls epicles then in groans expires and murmuring to the shades the soul retires while to the ramparts daring glaucus drew from teucers hand a winged arrow flew the bearded shaft the destined passage found and on his naked arm inflicts a wound the chief who feared some foes insulting boast might stop the progress of his warlike host concealed the wound and leaping from his height retired reluctant from the unfinished fight divine sarpedon with regret beheld disabld glaucus slowly quit the field his beating breast with generous ardour glows he springs to fight and flies upon the foes alcmaon first was doomed his force to feel deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel then from the yawning wound with fury tore the spear pursued by gushing streams of gore down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armor rings against the ground swift to the battlement the victor flies tugs with full force and every nerve applies it shakes the ponderous stones disjointed yield the rolling ruins smoke along the field a mighty breach appears the walls lie bare and like a deluge rushes in the war at once bold toucer draws the twanging bow and ajax sends his javelin at the foe fixed in his belt the feathered weapon stood and through his buckler drove the trembling wood but jove was present in the dire debate to shield his offspring and avert his fate the prince gave back not meditating flight but urging vengeance and severer fight then raised with hopes and fired with glorys charms his fainting squadrons to new fury warms o where ye lycians is the strength you boast your former fame and ancient virtue lost the breach lies open but your chief in vain attempts alone the guarded pass to gain unite and soon that hostile fleet shall fall the force of powerful union conquers all this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew they join they thicken and the assault renew unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare and fixed support the weight of all the war nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers as on the confines of adjoining grounds two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds they tugg they sweat but neither gain nor yield one foot one inch of the contended field thus obstinate to death they fight they fall nor these can keep nor those can win the wall their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound loud strokes are heard and rattling arms resound the copious slaughter covers all the shore and the high ramparts drop with human gore as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads from side to side the trembling balance nods while some laborious matron just and poor with nice exactness weighs her woolly store till poised aloft the resting beam suspends each equal weight nor this nor that descends so stood the war till hectors matchless might with fates prevailing turned the scale of fight fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies and fires his host with loud repeated cries advance ye trojans lend your valiant hands have to the fleet and toss the blazing brands they hear they run and gathering at his call raise scaling engines and ascend the wall around the works a wood of glittering spears shoots up and all the rising host appears a ponderous stone bold hector heaved to throw pointed above and rough and gross below not two strong men the enormous weight could raise such men as live in these degenerate days yet this as easy as a swain could bear the snowy fleece he tossed and shook in air for jove upheld and lightened of its load the unweildy rock the labor of a god thus armed before the folded gates he came of massy substance and stupendous frame with iron bars and brazen hinges strong on lofty beams of solid timber hung then thundering through the planks with forceful sway drives the sharp rock the solid beams give way the folds are shattered from the crackling door leap the resounding bars the flying hinges roar now rushing in the furious chief appears gloomy as night and shakes two shining spears a dreadful gleam from his bright armor came and from his eye balls flashed the living flame he moves a god resistless in his course and seems a match for more than mortal force then pouring after through the gaping space a tide of trojans flows and fills the place the greeks behold they tremble and they fly the shore is heaped with death and tumult rends the sky observations on the twelfth book observations on the twelfth book i it may be proper here to take a general view of the conduct of the iliad the whole design turns upon the wrath of achilles that wrath is not to be appeased but by the calamities of the greeks who are taught by their frequent defeats the importance of this hero for in epic as in tragic poetry there ought to be some evident and necessary incident at the winding up of the catastrophe and that should be founded upon some visible distress this conduct has an admirable effect not only as it gives an air of probability to the relation by allowing leisure to the wrath of achilles to cool and die away by degrees who is every where described as a person of a stubborn resentment and consequently ought not to be easily reconciled but also as it highly contributes to the honor of achilles which was to be fully satisfied before he could relent  ii verse   without the gods how short a period etc homer here teaches a truth conformable to sacred scripture and almost in the very words of the psalmist unless the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it  iii verse    then neptune and apollo etc this whole episode of the destruction of the wall is spoken as a kind of prophecy where homer in a poetical enthusiasm relates what was to happen in future ages it has been conjectured from hence that our author flourished not long after the trojan war for had he lived at a greater distance there had been no occasion to have recourse to such extraordinary means to destroy a wall which would have been lost and worn away by time alone homer says aristotle foresaw the question might be asked how it came to pass that no ruins remained of so great a work and therefore contrived to give his fiction the nearest resemblance to truth inundations and earthquakes are sufficient to abolish the strongest works of man so as not to leave the least remains where they stood but we are told this in a manner wonderfully noble and poetical we see apollo turning the course of the rivers against the wall jupiter opening the cataracts of heaven and neptune rending the foundations with his trident that is the sun exhales the vapors which descend in rain from the air or ether this rain causes an inundation and that inundation overturns the wall thus the poetry of homer like magic first raises a stupendous object and then immediately causes it to vanish  what farther strengthens the opinion that homer was particularly careful to avoid the objection which those of his own age might raise against the probability of this fiction is that the verses which contain this account of the destruction of the wall seem to be added and interpolated after the first writing of the iliad by homer himself i believe the reader will incline to my opinion if he considers the manner in which they are introduced both here and in the seventh book where first this wall is mentioned there describing how it was made he ends with this line  after which is inserted the debate of the gods concerning the method of its destruction at the conclusion whereof immediately follows a verse that seems exactly to connect with the former  in like manner in the present book after the fourth verse  that which is now the thirty sixth seems originally to have followed  etc and all the lines between which break the course of the narration and are introduced in a manner not usual in homer seem to have been added for the reason abovesaid i do not insist much upon this observation but i doubt not several will agree to it upon a review of the passages  iv verse    nine continual days some of the ancients thought it incredible that a wall which was built in one day by the greeks should resist the joint efforts of three deities nine days to solve this difficulty crates the mallesian was of opinion that it should be writ  one day but there is no occasion to have recourse to so forced a solution it being sufficient to observe that nothing but such an extraordinary power could have so entirely ruined the wall that not the least remains of it should appear but such a one as we have before said homer stood in need of eustathius  v verse    the forces part in five distinguished bands the trojan army is divided into five parts perhaps because there were five gates in the wall so that an attack might be made upon every gate at the same instant by this means the greeks would be obliged to disunite and form themselves into as many bodies to guard five places at the same time  the poet here breaks the thread of his narration and stops to give us the names of the leaders of every battalion by this conduct he prepares us for an action entirely new and different from any other in the poem eustathius  vi verse     asius alone confiding in his car it appears from hence that the three captains who commanded each battalion were not subordinate one to the other but commanded separately each being empowered to order his own troop as he thought fit for otherwise asius had not been permitted to keep his chariot when the rest were on foot one may observe from hence that homer does not attribute the same regular discipline in war to the barbarous nations which he had given to his grecians and he makes some use too of this defect to cast the more variety over this part of the description dacier  vii verse     unhappy hero etc homer observes a poetical justice in relation to asius he punishes his folly and impiety with death and shows the danger of despising wise counsel and blaspheming the gods in pursuance of this prophecy asius is killed in the thirteenth book by idomeneus  viii verse     this polypoetes  and that leonteus etc these heroes are the originals of pandarus and bitias in virgil we see two gallant officers exhorting their soldiers to act bravely but being deserted by them they execute their own commands and maintain the pass against the united force of the battalions of asius nor does the poet transgress the bounds of probability in the story the greeks from above beat off some of the trojans with stones and the gateway being narrow it was easy to be defended eustathius  ix verse     the speech of asius this speech of asius is very extravagant he exclaims against jupiter for a breach of promise not because he had broken his word but because he had not fulfilled his own vain imaginations this conduct though very blameable in asius is very natural to persons under a disappointment who are ever ready to blame heaven and turn their misfortunes into a crime eustathius  x verse     jove s bird on sounding pinions etc virgil has imitated this passage in the eleventh aeneid     utque volans alte raptum cum fulva draconem fert aquila implicuitque pedes atque unguibus haesit saucius at serpens sinuosa volumina versat arrectisque horret squamis and sibilat ore arduus insurgens illa haud minus urget obunco luctantem rostro simul aethera verberat alis which macrobius compares with this of homer and gives the preference to the original on account of virgils having neglected to specify the omen his praetermissis quod sinistra veniens vincentium prohibebat accessum and accepto a serpente morsu praedam dolor dejecit factoque tripudio solistimo cum clamore dolorem testante praetervolat quae animam parabolae dabant velut exanime in latinis versibus corpus remansit sat l   c    but methinks this criticism might have been spared had he considered that virgil had no design or occasion to make an omen of it but took it only as a natural image to paint the posture of two warriors struggling with each other  xi verse     the speech of polydamas the address of of polydamas to hector in this speech is admirable he knew that the daring spirit of that hero would not suffer him to listen to any mention of a retreat he had already stormed the walls in imagination and consequently the advice of polydamas was sure to meet with a bad reception he therefore softens every expression and endeavors to flatter hector into an assent and though he is assured he gives a true interpretation of the prodigy he seems to be diffident but that his personated distrust may not prejudice the interpretation he concludes with a plain declaration of his opinion and tells him that what he delivers is not conjecture but science and appeals for the truth of it to the augurs of the army eustathius  xii verse     the speech of hector this speech of hectors is full of spirit his valor is greater than the skill of polydamas and he is not to be argued into a retreat there is something very heroic in that line  his sword the brave man draws and asks no omen but his countrys cause and if any thing can add to the beauty of it it is in being so well adapted to the character of him who speaks it who is every where described as a great lover of his country  it may seem at the first view that hector uses polydamas with too much severity in the conclusion of his speech but he will be sufficiently justified if we consider that the interpretation of the omen given by polydamas might have discouraged the army and this makes it necessary for him to decry the prediction and insinuate that the advice proceeded not from his skill but his cowardice eustathius  xiii verse     to right to left unheeded take your way eustathius has found out four meanings in these two lines and tells us that the words may signify east west north and south this is writ in the true spirit of a critic who can find out a mystery in the plainest words and is ever learnedly obscure for my part i cannot imagine how any thing can be more clearly expressed i care not says hector whether the eagle flew on the right toward the sunrising which was propitious or on the left toward his setting which was unlucky  xiv verse     jove raised a whirlwind it is worth our notice to observe how the least circumstance grows in the hand of a great poet in this battle it is to be supposed that the trojans had got the advantage of the wind of the grecians so that a cloud of dust was blown upon their army this gave room for this fiction of homer which supposes that jove or the air raised the dust and drove it in the face of the grecians eustathius  xv verse     till great sarpedon etc the poet here ushers in sarpedon with abundance of pomp he forces him upon the observation of the reader by the greatness of the description and raises our expectations of him intending to make him perform many remarkable actions in the sequel of the poem and become worthy to fall by the hand of patroclus eustathius  xvi verse     so pressed with hunger from the mountains brow descends a lion this comparison very much resembles that of the prophet isaiah chapter      where god himself is compared to a lion like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down that he may fight upon mount sion dacier  xvii verse     the speech of sarpedon to glaucus in former times kings were looked upon as the generals of armies who to return the honors that were done them were obliged to expose themselves first in the battle and be an example to their soldiers upon this sarpedon grounds his discourse which is full of generosity and nobleness we are says he honored like gods and what can be more unjust than not to behave our selves like men he ought to be superior in virtue who is superior in dignity what strength is there and what greatness in that thought it includes justice gratitude and magnanimity justice in that he scorns to enjoy what he does not merit gratitude because he would endeavor to recompense his obligations to his subjects and magnanimity in that he despises death and thinks of nothing but glory eustathius dacier  xviii verse     could all our care etc there is not a more forcible argument than this to make men contemn dangers and seek glory by brave actions immortality with eternal youth is certainly preferable to glory purchased with the loss of life but glory is certainly better than an ignominious life which at last though perhaps late must end it is ordained that all men shall die nor can our escaping from danger secure us immortality it can only give us a longer continuance in disgrace and even that continuance will be but short though the infamy everlasting this is incontestable and whoever weighs his actions in these scales can never hesitate in his choice but what is most worthy of remark is that homer does not put this in the mouth of an ordinary person but ascribes it to the son of jupiter eustathius dacier  xix verse     whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore it is remarkable that teucer who is excellent for his skill in archery does not carry his own bow but has it born after him by pandion i thought it not improper to take notice of this by reason of its unusualness it may be supposed that teucer had changed his arms in this fight and complied with the exigence of the battle which was about the wall he might judge that some other weapon might be more necessary upon this occasion and therefore committed his bow to the care of pandion eustathius  xx verse     a rocky fragment etc in this book both ajax and hector are described throwing stones of a prodigious size but the poet who loves to give the preference to his countrymen relates the action much to the advantage of ajax ajax by his natural strength performs what hector could not do without the assistance of jupiter eustathius  xxi verse     not two strong men the difference which our author makes between the heroes of his poem and the men of his age is so great that some have made use of it as an argument that homer lived many ages after the war of troy but this argument does not seem to be of any weight for supposing homer to have writ two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty years after the destruction of troy this space is long enough to make such a change as he speaks of peace luxury or effeminacy would do it in a much less time dacier  xxii verse     swift to the battlement the victor flies from what sarpedon here performs we may gather that this wall of the greeks was not higher than a tall man from the great depth and breadth of it as it is described just before one might have concluded that it had been much higher but it appears to be otherwise from this passage and consequently the thickness of the wall was answerable to the wideness of the ditch eustathius  xxiii verse     as on the confines of adjoining ground this simile says eustathius is wonderfully proper it has one circumstance that is seldom to be found in homers allusions it corresponds in every point with the subject it was intended to illustrate the measures of the two neighbors represent the spears of the combatants the confines of the fields shows that they engaged hand to hand and the wall which divides the armies gives us a lively idea of the large stones that were fixed to determine the bounds of adjoining fields  xxiv verse     as when two scales etc this comparison is excellent on account of its justness for there is nothing better represents an exact equality than a balance but homer was particularly exact in having neither described a woman of wealth and condition for such a one is never very exact not valuing a small inequality nor a slave for such a one is ever regardless of a masters interest but he speaks of a poor woman that gains her livelihood by her labor who is at the same time just and honest for she will neither defraud others nor be defrauded her self she therefore takes care that the scales be exactly of the same weight  it was an ancient tradition and is countenanced by the author of homers life ascribed to herodotus that the poet drew this comparison from his own family being himself the son of a woman who maintained her self by her own industry he therefore to extol her honesty a qualification very rare in poverty gives her a place in his poem eustathius  finis blazon or coat of arms dieu et mon droit   george r
