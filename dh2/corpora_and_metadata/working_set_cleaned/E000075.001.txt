and sold at the lectureroom beaufortbuildings and by the following booksellers d i eaton newgatestreet smith portsmouthstreet lincolnsinnfields and burks crispinstreet spitalfields      iv v preface generally speaking the object of a preface is or ought to be to advertise the reader of the kind of entertainment to which he is invited by the author but with periodical publications this object can rarely be proposed for as the preface is generally the last part of the work in point of composition the strong probability is that the generality of readers like the author himself have traced the work through its respective stages before the preface comes under consideration this is particularly the case with the present performance for though twelve hundred and fifty copies have been printed i have the satisfaction to find that i am upon the eve of being called upon for a second edition before the last number of the first is completed few of the persons therefore to whom this prologue is presented can be supposed unacquainted with the plot and incidents of the drama it is to precede yet as i am about concluding the first volume of a work in every thing but its form of a very singular nature i cannot but feel myself called upon to say something by way of apology for its appearance the various publications with which the world has been sometimes benefited and sometimes infested have been suggested by a variety of circumstances and authors have been stimulated in their vi labours by a variety of causes—the greater number of books undoubtedly have originated either in the love of fame or the desire of profit and neither of these objects i believe when properly regulated are in the least dishonourable either to the understanding or the heart but there are some which owe their origin to higher motives—and among these the author flatters himself that the tribune has some pretensions to be ranked those who are acquainted with the expences of publication and who compare the quantity of matter with the price of these pamphlets will immediately perceive that the sale of a thousand copies at threepence per number and two hundred and fifty at sixpence after all deductions for the profit of booksellers and other incidental circumstances can never make any pecuniary compensation to the publisher and as for same he must be infatuated indeed who looks for an increase of literary reputation from the hasty transcripts of a course of lectures two of which he is to prepare and deliver every week excellence is only to be attained by flow and elaborate process and the world considers the degree of merit produced not the circumstances which may have influenced the production if therefore i had regarded only my interest or my reputation the probability is that this periodical paper had never appeared—especially as it might have been expected that such a work would rather blunt than excite the curiosity of the public who are generally less disposed to go and hear that which they suppose they shall have the opportunity though perhaps they may never have the inclination to read but the fact is that though the late prosecutions have influenced me in some degree to vary my mode they have not abated my desire of disseminating information such as it is in my power to communicate vii among the oppressed and industrious orders of society and at the same time that it was impossible either from the limits of my premises from the very large expences of my situation or from the necessary precaution of preserving what the aristocratic prejudices of the world would term the respectability of my lectures to render the terms of admission more easy than they are i flattered myself that the class of people to whom i have alluded might be in some degree benefited and enlightened by the doctrines which these lectures are intended to enforce feeling myself called upon to guard against a repetition of such gross forgeries as had been advanced against me upon my late trial by the employment of a shorthand writer i therefore began to calculate whether i could not turn this circumstance to the advantage of the cause in which my life has already been endangered and in which my soul still continues to be embarked the result was a determination to send into the world at the cheapest possible rate the following publication printing at the same time a small edition upon fine paper for the use of those whose circumstances better enabled them to reward the labours of men who have nothing but their talents and exertions to bestow upon the public cause as it is impossible that in an undertaking like mine there should not be considerable inequalities my first intention was to have set apart those lectures which i conceived most successful in point for publication in separate volumes and to have published extracts only from the others but upon further reflection i have changed my plan and my present intention to which i have partly adhered in the latter part of this volume and which will guide me in a more general manner in the next is to publish in this periodical manner those of a more viii temporary nature and to reserve for future revision and improvement those which are more referable to general principles in conformity to this resolution there are some of the lectures delivered towards the latter end of the course which though yet unprinted call aloud for publication—particularly those on barracks and fortifications and on the dearness and scarcity of provisions it cannot however be expected that i should chain myself down to the metropolis to the total neglect of health relaxation and comfort during the whole summer in order to superintend this publication and as i am not at present provided with any person to whom i can entrust the correction of the press i must decline the regular continuance of this publication till the resumption of the lectures in september next in the mean time however i shall put the lectures above specified in a train to be published at convenient periods that the work may not be entirely dropped during the summer season and that the expectation of those who have testified their approbation of those discourses in particular may not be disappointed june  0      ix   the tribune a periodical publication consisting chiefly of the political lectures of j thelwall the tribune no i saturday   th march      on the distresses of the industrious poor from the lecture on the proper means of averting national calamities delivered by j thelwall on wednesday   th feb the day appointed for a solemn fast   take physic pomp—   expose thyself to feel what wretches feel   —shakespeare   citizens the occasion upon which we meet and the publicity of my opinions upon subjects any way connected with superstition may occasion many to expect that i call you together merely for the purpose of ridicule it may not therefore be amiss to apprise you that such as have formed this expectation will find themselves in a considerable degree disappointed however absurd the idea of averting national calamities by superstitious observances in itself may be the situation of the country is much too serious to be made the subject of idle pastime during two years the unparalleled devastations of a cruel unjust and impolitic war have been heaping disgrace after disgrace and misfortune after misfortune upon a nation whose soil and situation separated as it is by nature from the despotic governments and ambitious intrigues of the continent might have secured the united reign of peace and felicity if these advantages had not been so fatally counteracted by the blunders and infatuated projects of ministerial ambition in vain do we look for that abundance which a soil so fertile ought to have secured—in vain do we look for that cheerful and healthblooming industry which these natural advantages and the patient assiduity of britons might entitle us to   expect instead of these beggary and emaciation encounter us in every street our towns and villages present one universal picture of calamity and dejection and the pencil of history should it transmit to future ages a faithful representation of the present state of society in britain must be principally employed in delineating groups of disconsolate widows and unfriended orphans supplicating from the contemptuous hand of charity the scantiest portion of that sustenance which they ought to have been receiving in abundance and independency from the industry of the husband and the father tax after tax is levied—contribution after contribution is demanded—and burthen after burthen heaped upon our bending shoulders every shilling of which must come in the first instance from the labours of the poor—for all production originates with them in the mean time all the useful occupations of life are in a manner suspended—the labours of the builder are arrested and the unfinished tenement moulders into premature ruin—the mallet of the artisan resounds no more—the shuttle sleeps and cobwebs hang upon the loom—let spittalfields and the constituents of mr windham contradict me if i speak untruly commerce is half annihilated the arts decline and science toils no more in the diffusion of intellect and happiness the investigation of the causes of our miseries is become the only occupation of the speculative mind and the only employments of manual industry are the trades which are connected with the aggravation of those miseries nor does the evil rest here the body politic of britain is not only diseased it is suffering daily amputation its most important members are hourly lopped away by a depopulating war   princes and lords may flourish and may fade   a breath may make them as a breath hath made   but a bold peasantry their countrys pride   when once tis lost can never be supplied   —goldsmith   yet this peasantry—this pride of the country—if the country knew what it ought to be proud of—the productive energies of man or the baubles or distinction—this peasantry we suffer to be annihilated—this pride laid low in a rediculous i had almost said an unprincipled crusade to restore the fallen despotism of france for this the husband is   torn from his wife—the father from his helpless infants and the son from the aged parents with whom he used to share the scanty earnings of his industry for this the marshes of flanders are manured and the dykes of holland choaked with british blood for this the personal liberty of englishmen is invaded with impunity by the lawless violence of pressgangs our youth are ensnared by the artifices of recruiting parties trading magistrates are vested with a despotic authority over the lower orders of the community and our streets are nightly infested by the snares and atrocious depredations of crimps and kidnappers one consolation and only one relieves the mind of the philanthropist in the contemplation of this gloomy picture and that strange to say arises from our disasters and defeats the project is not likely to succeed the despotism of the bourbons—that despotism hitherto so fatal to the repose and to the morals of europe will not be restored and the dead bodies of our countrymen that were intended to have been made the steppingstones for the ambition of a prince of condé and a comte dartois have paved the way for the triumphant armies of a republic invincible from the conviction that every individual is fighting for his own independence and his own rights still however uninfluenced by experience—untaught by calamity and implicitly resigned to the interested councils of those dastard emigrants—those superstitious priests and profligate nobles whose intrigues have already been so fatal to their own sovereign our infatuated cabinet persevere in their quixotic projects still are the ranks of our flying armies recruited by these detestable means while our stagnated commerce and ruined manufactures present to the most useful order of men only the melancholy alternative of perishing by the sword abroad or by lingering famine at home we cannot wonder therefore that the depopulation which the sword produces is so considerably increased by another species of depopulation i mean by emigration nor will it give so great a degree of astonishment to your minds when i state that   00 individuals during one week in the last summer arrived between sunday and sunday from england scotland and ireland at the town of new york alone and that the whole amount of the individuals who had emigrated from this country to the hospitable shores of america during   the last summer was no less than eighty thousand men women and children i say when you consider the calamities under which the country groans you will not be surprised that i am enabled to state to you from authentic documents that during the last summer eighty thousand individuals from scotland england and ireland have bid a final farewel to their native fields their relatives and friends to assist the population of america rather than endure the united torments of penury and persecution to which they must be here exposed and of what description are the people we have thus lost not like the eighty thousand locusts that fled from a neighbouring country not dreaming monks and swindling nobility remember citizens i am speaking of the nobility of france not of the nobility of england the emigrants driven from this country were not eighty thousand dreaming monks and swindling nobility but eighty thousand of the best sinews the strong fibres the nerves of the state chiefly useful labourers from whose application alone all the wealth power and grandeur of the country must be derived if therefore so many vital fibres continue to be torn from the heart of britain will it be surprising if we should find that a dead palsy has seized one side of the country when as may possibly be the case ere long we find ourselves called upon by the progress of events for all our energies and all our magnanimity to repel the hostile attacks that may be aimed not at the extremities only but at the very seat of life yet citizens thinned as the population has thus been what is the fate of those who yet remain have those persons who have fled to the hospitable shores of america secured by that flight abundance to those whom they have left behind alass how melancholy a reverse presents itself to our observation calculate the present proportion between the increase in the price of labour and in the price of the necessary articles of life and estimate if you can without a blush the meagre pittance with which the industry is repaid that secures the comforts and multiplies the luxuries of the opulent and privileged orders behold the condition of our labourers those even who can obtain employment for their industry at any rate—see them in defiance of all their toil and assiduity reduced to the miserable prospect of not being able to supply a necessary quantity of wholesome food for themselves and their distressed families   to what causes shall we trace these distempers for we must know the nature of the disease before we attempt to apply a remedy to what cause i say shall we attribute these phenomena in the state of the national health the first that presents itself to us is that immense foreign exportation which is the consequence of this just necessary and prosperous war the loaf that should feed the useful labourer is sent to supply the destroying soldier—english hessian austrian hanoverian sardinian or prussian the peasant languishes and the manufacturer starves that the fruits of their industry may satisfy the cravings of those who are fighting not i believe for the liberties of englishmen but for the preservation of the places and emoluments of those by whom the liberties of england are invaded but even this intention does not succeed the stores intended for these motley legions are lost in the dykes of holland in the marshes of flanders in the ravaged territories of the petty princes of germany whom the power of britain is no longer competent to defend it is sent to some british or some friendly army at some given post and when it arrives there it finds no such army in existence the tricoloured flag is waving where the british standard was expected to be hailed the reliques of our brave battalions have fled to some distant post and the stores either fall into the hand of the enemy or are wickedly destroyed in hopes that the foes we cannot conquer may experience the same famine with the friends we cannot preserve thus to the calamities which proceed from the political insanity of our rulers are to be added those which result from the absolute impossibility of supplying a flying army without sending three times the quantity of provisions which a victorious army would require independent of this it seems as though the elements themselves had conspired to aggravate our misfortunes i shall not allude to the frosts in holland the dutch best know whether they were calamities or blessings—i shall not attempt to plead their cause as far as we can see holland believes it has had too much of our friendly interference already but i do believe that whatever dutchmen may think englishmen must feel that a considerable aggravation of their calamities has been produced by the inclement season   i do not stand here to uphold the doctrines of superstition i do not pretend to peer above the clouds and discover the secrets of a supposed ruling providence that is no part of my profession i speak of facts i wish you to know how great your calamity is and what are the moral means of redress i speak only to moral agents and therefore have nothing to do with supernatural causes but the greater the calamities are the greater is the crying necessity of applying relief and it is the duty of the statesman not only to cure those disasters which result from the political wickedness or absurdity of the rulers but to provide remedies also for those which result from accidental circumstances—from physical causes from derangements of the elements and internal disasters for this it was that government was chiefly instituted yes citizens as it is the duty of the physician to apply not only remedies to the diseases which result from intemperance but to those also which proceed from accidents which may betide the human body and over the causes of which we can have no dominion so with the political physician it is his duty to apply the remedy not only to the evils which result from his own follies and absurdities but to the consequences also of those natural calamities which he could not foresee and which therefore no human virtue could prevent and i do affirm that this was the purpose for which governments were principally instituted for these are the only calamities likely to befal any nation independent of those which result from the government itself all the calamities of war all the inconveniences to which any nation is exposed in consequence of foreign and external circumstances are the effects of the government itself and never could exist but from the particular conduct of the governors it is therefore for the purpose of regulating those internal circumstances which result necessarily from the state of society or are the consequences of those accidents or derangements to which the physical universe is perpetually liable that government is in reality instituted for these are misfortunes to which society and in many instances even unassociated man must be perpetually subject from the yet unfathomed laws of the system we inhabit it is necessary therefore for the better security and accommodation of man or at least it has hitherto appeared so   that institutions should exist composed of individuals whose superior knowledge and leisure for reflection may enable them to discover the proper remedies for these inevitable and unforeseen calamities and to direct the popular attention to the means of counteracting their effects these institutions constitute what is called government and woe to that nation whose governors forget the real objects of their institution in the selfish pursuit of factious aggrandisement and the mad and destructive projects of war and conquest i say then if it has happened from the cooperation of political and physical causes that calamities have been brought upon the nation it behoves those entrusted with the administration of the government first of all prior to all external concerns prior to all considerations of foreign alliance or hostility to consider and apply the remedies which the internal situation of the country happens to demand if then to you as to me the strong probability should appear that during this inclement season hundreds nay thousands of our fellow beings must have perished from those diseases which result from scanty and unwholesome food from the want of proper protection from the inclemency of the season and from the want of fuel to warm their frozen joints—if the probability should appear that the dearth of provisions existing and likely to be encreased from the encreased exportation of the necessaries of life to our armies on the continent cooperating with the physical calamities of floods frosts and inundations are likely still further to aggravate the distresses of the country to a degree little short of famine itself—it results as a deduction of reason—it results as an imperious duty that the nation at large but principally the governors of the nation are called upon to seek with diligence and to apply with alacrity such remedies as may snatch us from this severe accumulation of disasters citizens it will be said that a sort of relief has been applied we shall be told of the benevolences in parishes we shall be told of the subscriptions of persons enjoying    or   000l a year who have liberally subscribed one guinea in one place because it was not their own parish and two in another because it was their own we shall be told perhaps that abundant relief has been given to the distressed portions of society   citizens this is a specious but a dangerous mode of proceeding towards the relief of our fellow beings if this is the condition under which so many of our fellow citizens groan some remedy not a remedy of charity of benevolence as it is called but a remedy of political amelioration ought to be applied that will impartially reach them all parish associations may amuse the wretched with delusive hopes and present a vain glorious picture of public munificence but can never afford an adequate remedy to the evil i shall not dwell upon the peculations of parish officers and contractors it is sufficient to observe that by parish associations nothing but a partial remedy will ever be applied and that not for the purpose of removing the distress but of increasing the dependence of the lower orders of the people he who is attached to the faction in power who can can cringe and creep to the petty officers and dependants of of that faction may perchance obtain relief but i myself have witnessed the manner in which the applications of those may be repulsed however great their miseries who are suspected of being deficient in these loyal virtues or who have the misfortune to be recommended by individuals whose principles are not entirely agreeable to gentlemen high in office i have known poor wretches refused relief from the fund raised at the general expence of the district or chid with surly insolence and dismissed with a scanty disproportionate pittance because the persons who recommended them—the individuals who knew their distresses were jacobins as they are called persons attached not to individual men but to broad and general principles persons who believe that principle as it is the soul of political existence is more to be revered than the leaders of little paltry associations of men of rank—more venerable than even those corporate institutions which arrogate to themselves a kind of omnipotence while at the same time they are in reality but the tools of individuals who some how or other have got to the lead but who by the grovelling passions they so frequently exhibit one would suppose to have been intended to be placed at the foot of society citizens whatever may have been the calamities of the people whatever the partial relief of those calamities i am afraid they have not yet arrived at their height   when i read—and who has not read the melancholy accounts of floods and inundations when i consider how many pastures have been laid waste how many fields of promised grain destroyed i cannot but look forward with gloomy apprehension towards that prospect of famine or little short of famine which presents itself to our view and if i can hereafter show and i trust i can show that there are political remedies which might remove this grievance what are the deserts of those individuals who have power to apply these remedies but whose pride whose avarice of office prevents them from listening to the voice of calamity and renders them blind to that happiness which might be produced by pursuing measures consistent with the wishes and interests of the people but which they conceive would be detrimental to their own selfish interests and the permanency of their places and emoluments the impotence and absurdity of superstitious observances from the same what are the proper objects to which the statesman ought to turn his attention what the proper pursuits in which the nation ought at this time to be engaged ought we to appeal to the moral energies of the human mind to the powers of reason to the faculties of intellect or to yield to the cowardly dictates of superstition are we in short to apply to moral and political resources for redress or like the stupid neopolitans carry about in long processions the head of saint januarius to avert the earthquake rumbling under our feet and suspend the explosions of the volcano which is flaming over our heads and threatning us with immediate destruction yes citizens you can see the absurdity of this you can feel what a ridiculous figure st januarius makes in the midst of this tremendous scene but o blindness of selflove o folly of national partiality you cannot perceive that there is scarcely a shade of difference between the practices of naples and of britain for how are englishmen at  0 this time employed are not priests in their pulpits and devotees upon their knees pouring forth their souls in sublime rhapsodies to an invisible being to induce him to do for them what if it is right they ought to do for themselves and if it is wrong such a being certainly would not do for them are they not offering up their petitions as they say to a benevolent and merciful creator to enable them to cut the throats to desolate the fields to burn the towns and villages to make widows of the wives and orphans of the children of their fellow creatures—according to their own calculation of their brethren thus intreating this merciful being to lend his assistance to practices so cruel and so profligate that even the beasts of prey are strangers to them they devour indeed the brutes of other species but leave to man alone the enlightened province of destroying his fellow man instead of appealing to the virtuous resources of the human character instead of endeavouring to find what kind of stuff britons are made of instead of restoring them to their rights that they may recover their energies are not persons hired to preach the doctrines most agreeable to their employers rushing into the utmost extremities of superstitious absurdity and endeavouring to preserve those employers from the ruin and destruction in which they have involved themselves—by what by reformation and atonement no but by the vain attempt to make divine perfection for so they call the object of their worship the participator of their guilt and praying for thunders and lightnings to consume the individuals who have presumed to differ from them in political and religious opinions and whom their folly and presumption have converted from generous friends to the nation into implacable enemies to the government citizens if reason is not to be the arbiter if superstition is to be appealed to let me ask what difference is there between a pair of protestant lawn sleeves and the relics of a roman saint if we are to seek redress not by our exertions but by the prayers and mediations of some intermediate being some demigod placed between man and divinity what difference can reason discover between st januarius and his grace of peterborough or of durham citizens the real friends of humanity have no occasion for this hypocritical mummery they disdain to appeal to a superstition    which their actions show they do not believe and which they do not pretend to comprehend liberty benevolence and truth are the trinity in unity of their perpetual adoration these are the objects to which the attention of the human mind should be directed if all that is preached and believed is true the being to whom they address their prayers sits immoveable in the heavens lost in a blaze of light which we cannot penetrate and in his own divine perfections superior to external motives and incapable of change pursues the eternal tenor of his way and nothing can be so ridiculous as the attempt of human weakness to divert him from this eternal course but truth we can discover benevolence we can feel and liberty the glorious principle of liberty we can promote let us consider then whether those great deities of rational adoration are not more likely to furnish us with the means of extricating ourselves from that weight of calamity which political priestcraft and superstitious policy have so heavily accumulated upon the shoulders of mankind than all the juggling between priests and machiavelian politicians which have so long been carried on let us labour to enlighten our fellow citizens—let us for political maladies seek for political relief endeavour by every means in our power to apply the assistance of moral amelioration to moral calamities and explore the means by which one physical cause may counteract the mischiefs of another thus and thus only can we remedy what superstition never yet could cure but those who have an interest in imposing upon mankind have found out another mode of remedy fasts and prayers are instituted for the purposes of sanguinary ambition you are told to humble yourselves for the crimes which your rulers have committed you are taught to pray that they may continue to slaughter and you are taught to fast and you have been taught it long enough—you are taught to fast that they may riot in luxurious profusion    on the means of redressing the calamities of the nation from the same what then are the means of redress for which the calamities of the nation call for redress of political calamities let us apply ourselves to correct the vices the errors the delusive ambition which have led to those calamities and if the present situation of the country with respect to policy results from the quixotic imagination that a handful of britons could subdue the enthusiastic myriads of france—if we have attempted to trample their infant liberty in the duft without considering with what gigantic energy that infancy was endued—if we have madly supposed that the pigmy efforts of a pitt a dundas a loughborough a jenkinson and a colonel mack could subdue this gigantic energy and reduce a mighty nation once more to the tramels of despotism—and if this has been the political source of our calamities let us acknowledge that we see our error that we see the folly of our attempt and ere it be too late consider how we can save our own country from that very famine and destruction with which we threatened to depopulate the streets of paris this also would lead to the remedy of those internal calamities that have fallen upon us by calling forth the resources of nature and the energies of a well directed industry and as for those heavier calamities which may threaten to assail us at our own door—if britons as perhaps may be the case are speedily to be called upon to defend their own habitations and their own families from those hostile aggressions with which they so unjustly and so absurdly threatened the enemy they have thus provoked let our governors appeal in time to those popular concessions those conciliating acts of justice which have been so long and so intemperately refused but without which i fear that unanimity and energy can never be expected which circumstances so alarming may require to restore us to our vigour let them restore us to our rights let them convince us that it is for ourselves and ourselves alone that we are strugling nor suffer us to suspect for a moment that we are contending for our own chains for the security of our oppressors and the perpetuity of our oppressions remove the possibility of this suspicion and then shall it be found that the british character has not lost its energy but    that we are still as capable of vindicating our own cause as ever we were in the most brilliant periods of our history then shall it appear in the eyes of europe that britons still retain that resolute and unanimous affection for the real interests of their country which can alone secure its protection or improve its happiness for the alleviation of calamities of another description let us also labour to abolish luxury and every man may do much towards this reformation let us in our own houses at our own tables by our exhortations to our friends by our admonitions to our enemies persuade mankind to discard those tinsel ornaments and ridiculous superfluities which enfeeble our minds and entail voluptuous diseases on the affluent while diseases of a still more calamitous description overwhelm the oppressed orders of society from the scarcity resulting from this extravagance thus let us administer to the relief of those who having the same powers of enjoyment with ourselves have a right to at least an equal participation of all the necessaries of life which are the product of their labour let us seek also to restore the freedom of commerce let us consider that while the ports of nations are open scarcity can never exist to any alarming degree every country if not prevented by political impediments will send its surplus productions to the best market the best market is always the country which is most in want and therefore those who have most of any particular commodity will carry it to that port where its scarcity is most notorious so that the effects of that scarcity will hardly be perceptible to the community at large let us consider what the real utility of commerce is not that it may swell as at present the opulence of a few individuals give the luxuries of the globe to the great mans table and thus inflate his pride with the imagination that he is a being of superior species to those by whose toil his appetites are pampered no the real advantage of commerce is that the surplus resources of one nation exchanged for the surplus resources of another may prevent excessive want and scarcity from being felt by any individual portion of the universe let us consider then for one moment what are the real causes of the political and natural calamities of the country and we cannot be long before we find redress the greater part of our calamities result from a ridiculous an unjust and therefore an unnecessary war and that state of corruption into which the democratic branch of our constitution has so unfortunately fallen it is from those that the    political distresses of the great body of the people arise and let it be remembered that even the physical calamities those which originated in the severities of the season may also be removed by the same species of redress which may remove the other calamities in the first place then let us consider how we can put a period to the present disasterous war let us see how we can conciliate the affections of the irritated republic of france and how we can convert again into our dearest friends those people whom our unjust interference with their internal concerns has compelled to be our bitterest foes or to speak more correctly the bitterest foes of our ministerial directors let us remember that however a few desperate individuals may have stained with crimes the revolution of that country and however we may deplore the excesses into which the aspiring disposition of some individuals may have plunged a mighty nation yet on the other hand we see in the virtues they have exhibited a character so great and glorious that nothing but the delusive cant of political corruption could have induced us for a moment to brand them with those epithets so liberally and so impoliticly bestowed let us apply ourselves assiduously to compose the differences and restore the peace and cordial intercourse of europe and let us recollect that if this intercourse this peace and affection can be restored whatever calamities the elements may chance to inflict upon an individual country will be presently removed even by that interested but yet in its effects philanthropic spirit which indues mankind so universally to barter those commodities they can spare with other nations that stand in need of them citizens let us also seeking for a more immediate redress consider what our natural resources are let us consider that this is a country watered by innumerable streams not only imparting fresh verdure to the fields they flow through but teeming also with that food which but from the unjust monoply with which it is incumbered might supply the necessities of all our industrious poor for proof of this we need only appeal to facts one of those fish which is certainly among the most luxurious of the finny tribe the salmon was so abundant in this country before the streams were made the property of individuals that it was necessary in many parts of the country to insert a clause in the indentures of poor boys from the parish to prevent their being fed upon this delicious dainty more than three times in a week i refer you to the    indentures of the city of winchester particularly where the clause is still retained though it is difficult now in that town to get a morsel of that fish without paying two and sixpence or three shillings per pound for it circumstances also of equal impolicy and injustice have produced an artificial scarcity of salt water fish and a red herring which some years ago might be bought for a halfpenny is not now to be had for less than threehalfpence or twopence what then is the cause of this will any man make me believe that the fishes are infected also with the rage of emigration—will you tell me that they also have drank the poisonous doctrines of jacobinism and become discontented with that glorious constitution under which for so many centuries they have so happily been eaten and that therefore the herrings have fled from the coasts of scotland and the salmon deserted our rivers and together with the other factious inhabitants of our streams and shores have fled with atheistical abhorrence of all regular government to the coasts and rivers of french anarchy or the distant and happy shores of america that they might enjoy the pleasure of being eaten without alloy from the consideration that they were put in the mouths of what they rebelliously consider as bondmen and slaves no citizens it is the infernal spirit of monopoly that cruel and wasteful demon that has rendered poverty want and distress the portion of the mass of the people of this country that has produced in the midst of abundance this cruel artificial scarcity citizens is it not enough that men should have a property in that which has been procured by the labours of their ancestors is it not enough that the soil which from time immemorial has been worked by a herd of men who were to receive a scanty portion only of its produce should be the property of a few wealthy and privileged individuals is it not enough that the birds of the air should be monopolized by these men must the wild inhabitants of the very waves must all the common bounties of nature be also considered as articles of monopolizing accumulation shall one or two men grasp to themselves the whole product of our rivers and then make an agreement with a fishmonger to waste and destroy whatever cannot be sold at an extravagant price rather than suffer the swinish multitude to feast upon luxuries with which the tables of the great ought to be exclusively furnished and thus produce an artificial scarcity into the country so ruinous    to the population so detestable in its principles so alarming in its effects citizens the harvests of our waves if i may use the metaphor if once relieved from this intolerable exercise might always be reaped in abundance and when plenty smiled not in our valleys it might still sparkle in our streams and in the neighbourhood of our shores whose finny produce might compensate in some degree for the accidental scarcity of the field the surplus production also of those streams and shores might produce by the exchange of a liberal commerce abundance of the necessary supplies of which the country might stand in need look to the coasts of scotland look to the little islands the hebrides and the orkneys behold how populous the surrounding waves see the whole ocean one animated mass as it were one thronged association of little beings who offer themselves as the food of man consider that in the neighbourhood of one island even upon a very moderate calculation more than one hundred thousand millions of the finest herrings are devoured annually by one species of fowl only the solan goose that frequents the rockey shores consider also that the bays of that country are frequented by such huge quantities of them that the whales which might be caught there also instead of sending to greenland for them may be seen eating their way through the innumerable shoals that throng every part of the shores why is it then that they do not come to our markets in such quantities as to render superfluity not want the lot of man why is it that the superfluous produce of this fishery is not imported by the inhabitants of these coasts and islands in such quantities as to produce in return an abundant supply of those necessaries and comforts of which those barren fragments of our isle stand so much in need why is this fishery neglected and resigned to the more politic and industrious dutch who almost engross the exclusive advantages of that trade and thus sell to us at an increased price the produce of our own coasts and bays why stamp this shameful indignity on the british character for it is in reality a much more shameful indignity than any of the offensive decrees of the french convention against which aristocrats and alarmists have so querilously declaimed i will tell you citizens—the flagrant impolicy of government is the sole cause of this scarcity and this insult it is this that has brought the country into a situation like that of tantalus where the waves rise to our lips and yet we cannot    drink and the food hangs down to our very mouths and yet we cannot eat to this situation are we reduced by those who constantly engaged in the intrigues of party in the coalitions of faction in the management as it is called of majorities in the house of commons—in adjusting the interests of proprietors of rotten boroughs in disposing i had like to have said like cattle of those people whom they ought to preserve are too busy to attend to the insignificant consideration of providing for the comfortable sustenance of millions but it is not only by their neglects that we suffer we are equally injured by their impolitic regulations citizens i shall read from buchanans general view of the british fishery what he says upon this subject what added greatly to the hurt of the fishing trade in scotland in these latter times appears to have arisen from the regulations and heavy restrictions respecting foreign and home made salt these are particularly hurtful to the isles without storehouses to supply them with salt in their neighbourhood and the poor inhabitants or fishers are incapable of procuring it from its extravagant price when sold by merchants and its immense distance to purchase that article at first hand where it may be had at a moderate price this circumstance deserves serious consideration all herrings cured for home sale are subject to a duty of one shilling per barrel if used in scotland and only threepence or fourpence if used in england which heavy duty must greatly retard the fisheries and is too glaring an imposition to pass long without amendment the customhouse fees in scotland are become a nuisance to the adventurers so heavy as to absorb the greatest part of the bounty especially on small vessels this also calls aloud for redress a man of respectability named macbride and now in london declares that he saw eighteen barrels of fresh herrings given for one barrel of salt to the master of a smack and three barrels for one shilling sterling—the owners judging this trifle better than to allow them to rot without salt as has been the case before an intelligent minister on skye told the author that he had seen heaps upon heaps rotting on the shore and until carried off to dung the ground no man durst pass by on the leeward of them for the rotten offensive effluvia emitted from the fish    is it not better then to turn our attention to the redress of these evils than to be engaged in ridiculous crusades to restore a fallen despotism and reinstate a superstitious priesthood in a country where they have been torn from their pedestals and trampled down by the enlightened energy of the people citizens it will be asked what should be the first step towards the general reform that seems so requisite—the first step perhaps i shall be expected to say is the restoration of peace but alas that cannot be restored till other steps have been taken so long as those men now at the helm shall remain in power no more i fear must the olivebranch of peace wave over this devoted country never more i fear must that tranquillity and happiness be restored to europe for which we have so long and so ardently longed the first step i believe towards the redress of our national calamities must be taken by the people by manly and spirited but peaceable remonstrances by the unanimous voice of the friends of liberty throughout the country and i believe in that description i include at this time by far the greatest part of the nation the unanimous voice of the friends of liberty must be uplifted against the abuses and corruptions which have crept into the administration of the country with these boldly but peaceably we must endeavour to hurl from the seat of ill gotten power those men who jehu like are driving us to destruction we must seek for the redress of our grievances by removing from the power of future injury those men to whom our present injuries are to be attributed yes citizens i believe it is necessary to shew our indignation our detestation our abhorrence of the mad the frantic and destructive measures which the present administration are pursuing but let me be understood—when i say we ought to shew our indignation i mean not violence—i mean that we ought to shew that benevolent feeling which disdains to see the miseries of our fellow creatures without attempting to obtain redress i do not mean that by frantic impetuosity you should plunge the devoted country into desolation i hope i have a heart that really shudders at the idea of civil discord as much as the aristocratic hypocrites and cowardly alarmists of the day pretend and which would never consent to uplift the arm of violence but in absolute selfdefence when it is palpably necessary to the preservation of that life or that personal liberty which every individual undoubtedly has a right and which it is his duty to vindicate because    without vindicating that he can never have the power of discharging any other duty to himself or his fellow creatures by manly exertions then—and by manly i mean benevolent and peaceable for fury and devastation though sometimes those fiends have inhabited the forms of men fury and devastation are not the passions of human beings—humanity is lost when we appeal to desolating violence by manly and spirited remonstrances then i would have you seek redress and your courage and your fortitude i would have you display—by shewing what you are ready to suffer in the cause of reason and of man not what you are ready to inflict on the deluded and therefore selfish antagonist of this cause this is the sort of energy i wish the human character to display—this is the sort of argument i wish to enforce—the energy of mind not the energies of the dagger—the logic of assassination but think not citizens if you should accomplish the fall of a particular faction that your work is done you may if you please like the fox in the fable drive away the insatiable swarm of gnats that are now molesting you—but when they are driven away another swarm still more hungry may come upon you and the devouring system still go on you must show that it is principles not men you contend for—that you are indifferent to the name of a pitt or a fox that you scorn alike all party distinctions and all party prejudices—that you venerate nothing but the virtuous principle of liberty and are attached to no man any farther than as he may be the organ of this principle the instrument by which its energies may operate for the public good if therefore a change of men should take place think not that all is done resign not yourselves to supineness remember you must show that your spirits are teeming with the love of liberty that you are seeking the reformation of those abuses in the commons house of parliament which if you had obtained before you never could have laboured under your present calamities and therefore treat with equal indignation every administration that does not by active exertions shew its zealous attachment to these principles of liberty never lose sight of this grand political truth that there is no redress for a nation situated as we are but in a fair full and free representation of the people in the commons house of parliament  0 the following extracts from buchanans general view of the fishery of great britain will shew that the foregoing statements have not been exaggerated from the vast multitude of fowls about st kilda we are sure that the fish must be very plenty there let us for a moment says the rev kenneth maulay minister who acted as missionary there confine our attention to the consumption made by one single species of the numberless fowls that feed on the herrings the solan goose is almost insatiably voracious he flies with great force and velocity toils all day with very little intermission and digests his food in a very short time he disdains to eat any thing worse than herrings or mackarel unless it be in a very hungry place which he takes care to avoid or abandon we take it for granted that there are an hundred thousand of that kind round the rocks of st kilda and this calculation is by far too moderate as no less than twenty thousand of them are killed yearly including the young ones we shall suppose that the solan goose sojourns in those seas for about seven months in the year and that each of them destroys five herrings in a day a subsistence by no means adequate to so greedy a creature unless it were more than half supported of other fishes here we have one hundred thousand millions of the finest fishes in the world devoured annually by one single species of the st kilda birds on the west side of the long isle the very whales might be harpooned with ease and safety instead of going to greenland or the author might have added to the south seas in quest of them at much heavier expences and greater danger annually the most critical time for harpooning them is when they are seen devouring the herrings by great mouthfuls and each gap they make is constantly filled with fresh supplies wishing to fly beyond danger but cannot for the thick bank before them as they stand pent up in lochs by the heavy storm and the strongest whale dares not pierce through them seeing he could not move his fins for the immense throng much less rise to the surface to breathe therefore the monster is seen behind the herring like a horse eating at the face of a hayrick    the following ode occasioned by the first of those splendid events that distinguished the commencement of the french revolution was the earliest political production of the lecturer as a public speaker he had interested himself in the party questions of the day and displayed his zeal in the discussions upon the slave trade—discussions which so happily prepared the minds of britons for the reception of those great truths which the investigation provoked by events upon the continent brought to light but his muse had never before been enlisted under the banners of political liberty the poem was inserted in one of the periodical publications of the day but has never made its appearance in any collection of the authors works— o d e on the

patriot honours bloom    the tribune no ii saturday   st march      dangerous tendency of the attempt to suppress political discussion—from the lecture on the moral and political importance of the liberty of speech while prudent and moderate measures leave the door open to peaceful investigation men of talents and moral character step forward into the field of politics and never fail to take the lead of all popular meetings and associations which nature seems to have intended them for while this continues all is peaceful and rational enquiry and the people though bold are orderly nor even when persecution inflames their passions are they easily provoked to actual intemperance but when words are construed into treason and the people can no longer unbosom themselves to their friends at a tavern or associate together for the diffusion of political information but at the peril of their lives the benevolent and moderate part of mankind retire from the scene of action to brood with prophetic anxiety over the melancholy prospect enquiry is it is true in some degree suppressed and the counsellors of these overbearing measures are apt to congratulate themselves on their supposed success but the calm is more dreadful than the hurricane they have suspended in the ferment of half smothered indignation feelings of a more gloomy complexion are generated and characters of a very different stamp are called into action men who have neither genius nor benevolence succeed those who had both and with no other stimulus than fury and no other talent but sullen hypocrisy and intrigue embark in projects which every friend of humanity must abhor and which while the free open and manly character of the species    was yet uncrushed by the detestable system of persecuting opinions never could have entered the imagination whoever will consult the page of history will find that in every country on the earth where liberty has been alternately indulged and trampled this has been but too uniformly and exactly the progress of the human mind let us ask then this serious question—is it possible for any person to be a more dangerous enemy to the peace and personal safety of any sovereign than he who advises the persecution of opinion and the suppression of peaceable associations examination of mr pitts statement of the flourishing state of our commerce—from the lecture on the budget citizens it is very well known that among those persons who call themselves politicians the first object of calculation is revenue by which their wars and their projects may be carried on it is very well known that the lives of individuals are considered only in a secondary point of view that they only calculate how long they can get money enough to procure men to be slaughtered at their command and consider but little the groans the anguish the miseries of those poor wretches who are devoted to destruction and whose families they leave to still worse destruction behind them if this is the case it is of some importance to state what situation they stand in even with respect to their own system to shew them how near they are towards exhausting those resources which are to them of the utmost importance for if they should chuse to argue thus it is true the population of the country is considerably thinned it is true that the sword has wasted many that pestilence and disease in foreign climates has wasted more that many have perished through the hardships and calamities to which they were exposed in this country and that thousands and tens of thousands yearly fly from these shores to america to avoid their portion of the inconveniences of the present ruinous system but still we can raise revenue still we can bring money into the public exchequer by which we can hire men to cut throats at our bidding and so long as we are served it is a matter of    very little consequence in what country the individuals are born who are murdered for our pastime and aggrandisement if i say they should argue in this way it is of some importance to remind them in reply how long those pecuniary resources so much dearer than the lives of human beings may last remember the state of the public revenue and know that however affluent however powerful however magnificent in resources a country may be however willing the inhabitants of that country to spend their last guinea their last shilling still the last guinea and the last shilling is all that you can have and when they have spent the whole you can have no possible means of obtaining more it will be of importance then to shew the very rapid accumulation of that public debt under which we groan i say under which we groan for it is my intention to prove in the course of this lecture that revenue is supported by the groans of those who are doomed in consequence of the ruinous system we pursue to labour without end and procure no comfort to themselves and families by that labour citizens i shall not now expatiate upon the cruel system of war in general i shall not attempt to paint to you all those horrors which belong to a system of this kind neither shall i attempt to bring before you on the present occasion all the peculiar aggravations with which the present war is attended the infamy the false and shuffling pretences with which it has been accompanied the precipitancy and pride with which it was rushed into the vain boasting with which it has long been bolstered up and the failure of every project by which those boasts ought to have been supported neither shall i dwell in particular upon the depravity and wickedness of one country interfering with the internal concerns of another and endeavouring to prevent any set of people from forming for themselves such a constitution as they themselves think fit neither shall i at present call your attention to the inconsistency of those who support this measure i might it is true if i were so inclined by animadverting on the constitution of corsica and the manner in which that constitution is said to have been formed and comparing it with the doctrines and principles held up by those who have occasioned that constitution to be adopted shew how themselves practically deny the very principal they have laid down and affirm in the most open way every doctrine which those    who have maintained the cause of liberty have endeavoured to uphold that they have ratified the universal right of the great body of the people to form their own government to enfranchise themselves from one and set up another and that they have laid down that right as resting upon the system of universal suffrage that is the right every individual has of forming a representative government in which he himself has collaterally a voice equal with that of any other individual in the country citizens the ravages and depopulation produced by this war as i have already observed are not the main object of this lecture my present intention is to consider the waste of public revenue the rapid manner in which by exertion after exertion foolishly directed and still more foolishly conducted we are exhausting the power of the country and drawing rapidly towards that situation in which the expences and the corruption of the system under which they live can no longer be supported citizens it is very true that the honourable chancellor of the exchequer upholds a doctrine in the house of commons totally inconsistent with that sort of conclusion which it is my purpose to draw but you are to remember what have been the doctrines and what have been the sentiments of that being during the last two or three years in particular you are also to call to your recollection what sort of proof they have endured when they have been put to the test of experiment and if you find that in every individual instance when he has tried the experiment the result has been diametrically opposite to the theory he has laid down i shall then have a right to conclude that you have no great reason to place any confidence in his professions and plausable stories however able he may be to dress them up in the semblance of truth however prompt to support them with bold assertions if he set out with telling you that the english army would march to the gates of paris and is now almost in a paroxysm of despair lest the french army should be at the gates of london if he promised you at the very outset of the war that in all probability that war would be terminated in the first campaign and if we are now at the beginning of the third and he is now telling you truly that five times the resources are necessary now that were requisite when he first commenced if at the outset of the war he also promised you the wealth the    advantages the exclusive possession of the whole west india settlements and if it should appear to you that the result of the experiment has been that sir charles grey and admiral jervis and two or three other individuals have in reality procured considerable and ample fortunes for themselves but that the mass of their followers reaped no other harvest than the yellow plague which with great difficulty was prevented from being imported into this country and raging with infectious pestilence among us also if it should appear to you that in the present prospect of affairs and i refer you to the ministerial papers the strong probability is not only that the islands we have captured but our own islands also will be ultimately seized upon by that people whom we threatened to strip of every thing but who if we prosecute this mad crusade any longer are likely to strip us of every thing—even of the independency of our own country if all this be true there is very little foundation for trusting to the boastful confidence of this man when he tells you that the resources of the country are still equal to the prosecution of this war that the purse of the nation like the widows cruise in sacred writ is inexhaustible and the more you drain from it the more will be found at the bottom he tells you it is true that the commerce of the country is in a very flourishing situation but if this be true how come the manufactures of the country upon which that commerce depends to be in a situation so deplorable how is it that notwithstanding all the depopulation which has taken place by emigration notwithstanding all the depopulation that has taken place by the sword notwithstanding all the depopulation that has taken place by diseases springing from the inclement season and the miserable condition of those who had not wherewithall to repel the inclemency of that season—neither comfortable food proper cloathing for their limbs coals for their grates nor glass to their windows to shut out the bleak and bitter winds—how is it that notwithstanding this depopulation the most fortunate of those manufacturers who still remain can scarcely ever procure full work and when they do generally receive but two thirds of the pay they used to receive—how comes it that so many hundreds and thousands of families in spitalfields in norwich and other manufacturing towns are totally deprived of all employment—are crying in vain for bread and that you are obliged to raise large contributions in every corner of the kingdom—to do what to protect the lame  0 the blind the deaf the dumb no—but to afford half a meal to those individuals who still possess the power and the disposition to work and who would if the country had been wisely governed have been able to have earned a plentiful subsistence for themselves and families to have received much better pay while at the same time every individual of the higher classes might have received encreased instead of diminished profits from their labours that manufactures should decline and yet commerce increase appears almost as reasonable as that the whole surface of the earth should be buried under the ocean add yet every species of vegetation be produced in greater abundance than before but he tells you that you are not to listen to arguments you are not to listen to the sophistical declamations of men who persuade you that you ought to be discontented that you are unhappy for i tell you says he that you are happy and i will prove it to you and how will i prove it to you by shewing the quantity of enjoyment which you at this time possess by shewing you that you and your families are well cloathed and fed by shewing you that you can keep comfortable houses over your heads and that there is no danger of being turned out like vagabonds because you cannot pay the rent—no i cannot give you these demonstrations but i can give you better i can set down so many figures upon a piece of paper and then if you will not be convinced by the sacred truths of arithmetic in opposition to all your feelings and sensations then you are a grumbling factious jacobinical set of people—a swinish herd—you ought to be muzzled with proclamations you ought to be prosecuted for sedition—you ought to be hanged drawn and quartered for high treason now for the proof of the flourishing state of your commerce says this profound expositor of cockers arithmetic look at the situation of your export trade and you will find that at this time it is in as flourishing a situation as it was even in the best periods previous to the war for in      the commerce in british manufactures amounted to £     000 in      the exports amounted to £   0 000 the foreign merchandize in      amounted to £    000 and in      it amounted to £    000 so that the total of the exports in      was only £   0 000 while in      the total of the exports was £     000 thus then    according to his mode of argument though the demand for british manufactures has avowedly declined upwards of two millions the state of the commerce in this country is more flourishing than it was before you entered into the war and therefore as men are nothing at all and money is every thing you ought to continue the war to all eternity because though you lose your population you increase your wealth but citizens if you will permit me to argue precisely in the same manner that the right honourable chancellor of the exchequer chuses to argue without your permission there is no absurdity upon the face of the earth that i will not demonstrate i am content as he is content to select nothing but facts from which i draw my arguments but permit me to select such facts only as i please and boldly assert that these are the whole of the facts and there is no conclusion however contradictory to common sense that i could not prove especially if i had at my back so large and dead a majority of your representatives as they are called as that gentleman possesses to cry out—hear hear hear—are very bold assertion which flatters their prejudices and supports their interests grant me these advantages and i will prove to you that the blackest raven is whiter than the driven snow and that pitt is an intelligent and upright minister but citizens suppose we investigate a little the delusions of this statement i am not prepared to affirm whether in this account of the exports are included the articles exported for the accomodation of the armies of europe—the armies of britain—the armies of our good and faithful allies of prussia and of austria—of the disinterested king of sardinia—of the cordial duke of tuscany—and all the humane princes and pious princebishops of the germanic continent—and ultimately indeed for those of france itself—if among the boasted exports these are to be taken into the calculation and be it remembered that these are most assuredly entered as exports in the books of the custom house we shall find a very easy way of accounting for a very considerable part of this extraordinary exportation for certain it is that the quantities of commerce and manufactures of a particular description which have been sent out of this country is such as so exceed all belief in those who have not had the good fortune as i had during a part of last summer to be in some degree spectators of it but this be it remembered is an exportation that brings no return and consequently is so many    millions added to the losses and calamities not to the resources and profits of the nation—so much to be deducted not so much to be added in the calculation of our capacity to continue the present war these things however are wrapped up in the veil of political mystery they are not meant for the eye of the swinish multitude and therefore it is that the account is stated in the gross and you are left to rout out the particulars if you can—if your appetites are keen enough and your snouts are competent to the task the minister knows well enough—it is the most important part of his trade and if he had not been in the secret it is impossible he should have kept his shop open so long—he knows when to be perplexingly explanatory and when impenetrably concise—when to throw down your food in lumps you cannot digest and when to fritter it into wafers which you have not time to pick up or beat it into whipsyllabubs to amuse your eyes and therefore it is that in the present instance when speaking of your exports he carefully avoids particular enumeration he gives you a lumping pennyworth at once and then shines away about your happiness and his generosity to prevent you from investigating the materials of which it is composed but citizens to put this entirely out of the question—let us remember another thing namely that the advantages of commerce do not depend entirely on the export trade he should not only have told us what was sent out of the country but he ought to have given us some hint and i think he would have done so if it had suited his purpose of what had been sent into the country in return but here is the difference—if he had stated the import commerce he could have stated only the amount of those cargoes which arrived safe in port and the endless catalogue of raptures must have been deducted but in stating the exports only he was at liberty to calculate upon the gross amount of all the cargoes shipped by our merchants whether they arrived in safety at the place of their destination or were conducted under the tricoloured banner to the ports of toulon or brest if then we have been sending abroad every thing which the industry of former years has produced and i have already shown you that it could not be the production of the last year that was thus exported if that which has been sent out during the last year has not ben returned by some equivalent then the greater the exportation the greater the calamity the    greater the misery the scarcity the want the desperation of the country and why let me ask—if the commerce of the country was so flourishing—why has there been such a multitude of bankruptcies weekly recorded in the gazettes why but because neither the specie of the country which is sent so liberally to continental despots nor the exports of which so pompous a display is made are repaid either by the gratitude of those despots or by the returns of foreign commerce so as to support even the ordinary circumstances of internal traffic and how should they be returned the former is swallowed up in the insatiable vortex of german pride and tyranny and the profits of the latter from the superior energy of the republican marine have found their way to the treasury of the convention let me observe then citizens that unless those who boast of the flourishing situation of the country can state to us the returns that have been made for the commerce that has been exported but little triumph will attach to them in consequence of the large exports partly occasioned by the frequent captures of the enemy which reduce the merchants of this flourishing and happy country though they are to be paid but once to execute their orders twice in consequence of which the double exports are entered upon the books a circumstance which while it aggravates our calamities has furnished the minister with the means of boasting of our prosperity and resources and let it be remembered that the vaunts which have been made by the ministers of the french convention that they should march to london in apparel procured by english merchants victualled with provisions supplied by the english government and armed with the cannons bayonets and muskets which the english themselves had forged was not in all respects an empty boast i shall not dwell upon the innumerable stores which have been captured in the struggle upon the continent but let us remember that frequent statements have been made to the public the authenticity of which may be established by searching the books at lloyds that more than twice the number of vessels captured from the french by the english have been captured from the english by the french such is the excellent manner in which our commerce is protected such the glorious fruits which the monied interest reaps for its blind attachment to the present minister nay i state the difference too coldly the loss is not to be estimated by this numerical difference the vessels we    have thus lost in predatory warfare have been mostly capital merchantmen fraught with valuable cargoes while those which we have captured in return were principally small craft of little value the important parts of the french commerce sailing generally in large fleets with strong convoys under the wing of their whole naval power and thus arriving safe in their ports in defiance of our boasted empire of the ocean while our invaluable merchandise—the treasure of our souls—but the contrast is too degrading i forbear to conclude the picture it might be too painful to the sensibility of our wealthy merchants a set of men for whose wisdom and humanity i have certainly the most profound respect on the exhausted state of our natiomal resources and the consequent condition of our labourers and manufacturers from the same citizens— if merchants and monied men in the fury of unfounded alarm are determined to rush into bankruptcy to preserve their property they certainly have a right to do so according to the present organization of society every individual has also a right to shew them the precipice upon which they are treading of the real condition of the mass of the people in the midst of our boasted prosperity some sketches have been given already and i shall have frequent opportunities to review the subject but citizens what can be so absurd in speculation as well as in experience as to talk of the flourishing state and the happiness of a country that is loaded with such an enormous millstone of debt as hangs round the neck of this if the subject is not too dry for your attention let us call to recollection the real state of our revennes and finances let us in the first place pay a little attention to a few facts relative to the national debt with which we are incumbered by the providence the virtue and the enlightened politics of those ancestors to whose institutions we are called upon to bow down with implicit veneration in january      before we engaged in the present wise and necessary war by which so great a part of that debt was doubtless intended to be paid the nation was already involved    in a debt of £  0000000 the interest of which together with the expences of collection may be estimated at near ten millions such then was the annual deduction to be made from the gross product of the labour of our industrious peasants and manufacturers simply to defray the interest of debts contracted without their consent and from the expenditure of which they never reaped any individual advantage whatever i say from the labours of our peasants and manufacturers for it should be remembered citizens that the real sources of all revenue and indeed all the enjoyments and necessaries of life are the labours of those classes of society whom we treat with so much contempt but to whom if we were just we should acknowledge the greatest of all possible obligations it is upon the shoulders then of the industrious poor that the enormous weight of this burden is laid for it is they who must produce those articles which are given in exchange for that specie which defrays not only the interest of this debt but the whole expences of the government let us consider then how very considerable a damp must necessarily be produced upon the spirit of industry upon the ingenious inventions and labours of mankind by this enormous burthen let us remember that the poor labourers and manufacturers have in the first instance to produce not only that which is necessary for the support of their own existence and that of their families not only that which is necessary to produce a large profit to their immediate employers not only that which is necessary to pay the enormous expences of the government under which they live but annually also very nearly ten millions of specie for defraying the interest of those debts which their ancestors contracted by which they never were benefited and which have no other influence than to strengthen the hands of their rulers and to increase the price of provisions and every individual article by which the accommodations of life can be supplied to these are to be added also the burden which is laid upon their shoulders by tythes by parochial assessments by rates of innumerable kinds and which amount to an extent never yet fairly and faithfully calculated let us add then to this ten millions of annual interest seven millions more for the annual ordinary expences of the country and thus we shall find independent of the expences of the religious establishments independent of the expences of the inferior governments of parishes and districts the enormous sum of seventeen annual    millions even in years of peace to be produced out of the laboars of the lower orders of society—that is to say a sum almost equal to the whole annual receipts of one million of peasants mechanics and manufacturers taking the average price of labour at seven shillings per week which after the accidental but inevitable deductions from sickness vacation c is as much as it can be rated at so that if we calculate the really productive inhabitants that is to say the laborious orders of the community at one million two hundred thousand effective men which is a large calculation considering that the whole number capable of bearing arms of all ranks and denominations whatever have never been estimated at more than a million and a half we shall find that nearly one half is necessarily deducted from the price of their labour for this part of the national burthens alone even when the nation is at peace—in other words but for these burthens and incumberances the price of commodities remaining as they are every labourer and mechanic might receive twice the wages that he now receives without deducting in the least from the profit of his employers or the convenience of the consumers and if to this we add the great number of unproductive hands now employed in the collection assessment and regulation of the various and intricate branches of revenue by which this enormous demand is provided for who would otherwise be employed in productive exertion it is impossible to calculate the advantages that might have resulted to every class of people placemen pensioners and contractors alone excepted had this fatal system of funding credit the consequences of our eternal wars never been adopted nor can we suppose that any thing now produced by the efforts of the nation bears the smallest proportion to what might be produced by a just and liberal spirit of government that regarded the real welfare of every order of society instead of being engaged in that squabble for places and pensions that contention for the monopoly of power and the aggravation of revenue which constitutes the whole history of the ins and outs the factions the cabals and the contentions of this country there are other calculations i know which make the interest of the national debt amount to near twelve millions and the expences of government to five millions only however it is of small consequence whether the expences of government are seven and the interest ten millions or whether the interest of the national debt is twelve millions and the expences of the government five if a burden of seventeen    millions is heaped upon the annual industry of the people it is scarcely worth investigating upon which side two or three millions of it are in reality laid that which it is most important to remember is that in consequence of this burden every individual in the country has been compelled for many years to undergo double the fatigues he need to have undergone for the same earnings he now enjoys and that if on the other hand he had chosen to make use of the whole of the industry which at this time he employs he might have twice as much comfort at his table twice as comfortable a cottage to live in twice as comfortable cloathing and twice the quantity of enjoyments for himself and his family that he had even before the commencement of the present war but citizens if this was the condition of the country when we were first engaged in this war what must we think of the frenzy what must we think of the quixotism of that man who under such circumstances plunged into so mad so extravagant so ridiculous a crusade as the present let us remember how rapidly this debt has always accumulated during the continuance of war however successful that war might be however powerful and faithful the allies with whom we were engaged and however small the power with which we had to contend war is always a losing trade all that the victor can boast is that he has received a smaller number of honourable scars than the enemy he has vanquished he perhaps having only lost a leg and an arm while the other has lost both legs and arms together at any rate the most important members of the nation must be lopped off and therefore if there were not some strange delusion among the people propagated by men whose interests were hostile to the general good not one war could have taken place where fifty have defiled the page of history but the present war has not only been particularly disgraceful it has not only been marked by treachery and by crimes which never before sullied the name of britain it has also with respect to pecuniary calculations been extraordinarily fatal for when was there a period in which two campaigns had plunged any nation into the enormous accumulated debt of seventy millions of money yet in the pamphlet lately published by mr walker of manchester review of political events page   0 it is proved that seventy millions have already been expended in this just and necessary war add then those seventy millions to the two hundred and sixty which you had before and you have a debt of three hundred    and thirty millions with which you are at this time burdened and the interest of which that is to say upwards of twelve millions sterling is every year to be wrung from the toil of the peasant and manufacturer to be substracted from those comforts of life which ought to be the fruits of industry it is to be collected by drawing from their purses not only all the means of indulgence but even of information as to the cause of the oppression for the poverty of the people would have no charms in the eyes of certain individuals if they did not believe that the consequence of that poverty would be ignorance and the consequence of that ignorance implicit subjection to their wills therefore it is that duty upon duty is to be laid upon newspapers and pamphlets that every bit of paper that can be used through the medium of the press to convey intelligence to the people is to be made an object of excessive taxation not so much for the purpose of revenue as of preventing the progress of information thus it is that the fine gilt paper upon which lords and ladies write their amorous billets and their little invitations of compliment are to be burdened with a less degree of taxation than the clumsy coarse paper which may chance to convey intelligence to the swinish multitude now citizens there is another part of this subject which must be stated to you namely the increased expence of the operation of government it might formerly be disputed by those who were inclined to amuse themselves with those calculations whether the expences of government were something more than five millions or something less than seven but this dispute would now be vain and idle indeed it might be something whether you were paying five millions or seven towards a particular object but when it is doubled trebled and quadrupled what signifies contesting about trifles what signifies arguing in what manner the animal has been cut up whether a little more went to the loin or a little more to the haunch the whole animal almost is gone and it is of little importance to poor john bull in what particular portions he has been disposed of from six or seven millions annually the expences of government are now extended to twenty millions and a half such is the difference between the expence with which men may live in some degree of peace and happiness and in which they may live disturbed by those hostile passions which are disgraceful to the human character and whose only fruit    is mutual butchery man rioting in the blood of man and nation in the blood of nation till whole oceans are insufficient to wash the guilt from those who occasioned the fierce contention so that an annual deduction is to be made from the fruits of industry of thirtytwo millions and a half for national burdens which together with three millions and a half of poors rates and five millions to state it at the lowest tythes and other parochial assessments amounts altogether to fortyone millions and therefore as the whole amount of the annual wages actually paid to all the labourers and working manufacturers in the nation estimating them as i have at so high a calculation as one million two hundred thousand men—and averaging their pay after all incidental deductions at seven shillings per week amounts to no more than twentyone millions nine hundred thousand pounds it follows that the money paid in taxes is in reality near twice as much as that which is paid to all the labouring poor citizens i do not mean to contend that a country can subsist without taxation but the experiment ought to be how little it can do with not how much it can bear i do not contend that you can have government and not support the expence of that government it is the degree not the thing i complain of when i endeavour to shew you the whole magnitude of the evil it does not therefore follow that i think the whole ought to be swept away certainly not but i mean to draw this inference that every thing superfluous in that system ought to be retrenched because in proportion as you retrench these superfluities you increase the happiness of mankind the evil has already spread to a great extent you ought therefore to be the more careful how you increase it and not like desperate traders on the eve of bankruptcy carelessly to rush deeper still into ruin because you are so deep already you ought to forbear the cruel ruinous system of war which has brought you into that debt you ought to retrench as if you were faithfully represented you might by the votes of your representatives retrench the extravagant expences of government i mean the expences of corruption not those expences which are necessary for the regular government of the country for the promotion of internal happiness and protection against hostile invasion  0 but chiefly the men of property ought to be aware how they heap mischief upon mischief for the supposed preservation of that property i would i could see them half as careful of that property as the friends of liberty are i wish i could convince them of the danger of stretching the cord till it breaks for if it should break miserable to them must be the consequence and break it must if it be not relaxed if the government thus go on adding war to war campaign to campaign million upon million and seventy million upon seventy million they must in time exhaust the resources of the country to such a degree that the country can no longer bear the weight of the interest even and when this is the case what is to become of the capital for remember your capital is but moonshine a bubble you have the name of it you have the entries on the books but shew me the bullion that can realize it bank notes and exchequer bills may supply the place of currency while the credit of the nation is supported—that is to say while the people are able and willing to pay the interest but when the bubble bursts you may tie them on strings to make tails for kites for their value will be only their weight in paper if the bubble should burst and burst i repeat it it must if the blast of war continues thus to swell it beyond all proportion woe unto the rulers who have been the causes of its bursting the frenzy of those who are ruined by the explosion will fall i fear with a heavy hand—they will forget what willing tools they have been to their own destruction and consider themselves as inhumanly betrayed yet this war at least so big with destruction is in reality all their own—the war of the monied alarmists of the meeting at merchant taylors hall infatuated monopolists whither are you running—hastening to inevitable ruin over the trampled rights of your fellow men if you would preserve your property the real king of your thoughts the only god of your adoration urge not your country down the precipice of bankruptcy by which your property must be destroyed if you love your own security consider how that security may be preserved if national credit is no more as the word indicates than the bubble of confidence remember that the bubble must burst when inflated beyond its bounds half—two thirds of the produce of human labour may be seized by the hand of power to pay the interest which supports this bubble of annihilated capital    nay perhaps the people may be so sluggish that three fourths may be taken with impunity but another such campaign or two as the last another such budget or two as the present and three fourths will no longer do but beware how you go beyond should the people once demur to the claims of the taxgatherer the richest stockholder is from that day a beggar those then are the enemies of property who continue this mad and ruinous war not they who cry aloud for peace those are the enemies of law and order who heap burthen upon burthen without remorse not those who say to you alleviate the sufferings of your fellow citizens enable them to be happy or they will not be contented it is not in the nature of man enable them to receive an honest competency for their labours let your policy and institutions contribute to their happy subsistence and you will retain your situation in tranquillity these are not the doctrines of anarchy the real promoters of commotion and anarchy are those who would silence complaint by chastisement who would check the progress of reason by barbarous coercion who would make truth sedition and argument high treason these are the enemies of order because these are driving their fellow beings to desperation and who shall answer for the conduct of man when desperation has taken possession of his mind picture of the horrors of war—from the same thus then citizens the labour of the people of this country their diligence and their ingenuity are exhausted for what to procure them the comforts of life no to procure them the advantages of intellect and virtue no to purchase the empty bubble reputation which after all is to be sought in the cannons mouth no not even this it is paid for disgrace defeat reproach infamy and misery the happiness that should result is squandered and lost with respect to the individuals at least by whom it is produced a few contractors beings who live only in the midst of storms and hurricanes and who exult amidst the wrecks of nature and fatten on the spoils of misery—these may be enriched—may build themselves palaces may roll in gilded chariots may aspire to city honours may enlighten the senate    of their country with their lucid and mellifluous eloquence and perhaps may confer coronial dignity upon the descendants of their illustrious blood this may be the effect to them but what are the effects to the nation at large go if you will to the plains of flanders where imagination will present every turf and hillock heaving with the groans of your expiring countrymen go to the the frozen dykes and rivers of holland see your fellow citizens bleeding fourth their souls in anguish writhing with the double torments of grinding wounds and biting frosts smarting through every pore and like poisoned arrows rendering every scar eventually mortal see their accumulated horrors think of their wild varieties of woe—their miseries without alleviation happy thrice happy the individual whose death is received by an instantaneous stroke whom the friendly ball frees from the lingering misery of those who trampled under the feet of their fellow men or bruised by the iron hoof of horses lie languishing perhaps for hours—perhaps for days for nights—and are relieved perchance at last by the murderous hand of some female fury who follows the camp and traverses the field of death for plunder—behold all this i say and this is but a feeble picture and then look at the splendid palaces of your contractors and avoid the boiling indignation of the honest heart if you can citizens—you must shut your eyes or you will perceive the truth perceiving the truth you will learn to abhor the cruelty abhorring the cruelty you will learn to remonstrate with the authors of that cruelty and by the united voice of reason and justice endeavour to heal the wounds with which human nature has so long been bleeding but this is not all miserable as has been the lot of these beings it is happy in proportion to that of the relations they have left behind you my generous auditors who live among the comforts of life—for though the generality of you roll not perhaps in that affluence which i have described you know not half the miseries to which human nature is exposed you must feel something of it yourselves or you must have relatives or connexions in that rank of life where that misery is mostly found or you must have been thrown by accident or curiosity into those groups of wretchedness with which the country abounds to be able to form any conception whatever of the degree of calamity under which thousands i might have said millions    of people in this happy and flourishing country are at this time languishing what is the lot of the widow and orphan what is the condition of those who might with smiling rapture have looked up to the industrious father or husband whose toils procured their comforts and protected them from injury and insult what must be the feelings of those who are stripped of their natural guardians and doomed to beg as blessings the insulting charity the embittered benevolence of purseproud beings whose successful selfishness has made them the lords and tyrants of the parishes that furnish the scanty and precarious morsel for their relief but these are not the only sufferers every man who hears me suffers the richest merchant suffers the poor mechanic suffers more it is true but what of that wealth is of more importance than human happiness and if i can convince you therefore that the wealthy merchant has his share in the suffering however small i may have some chance of convincing our rulers of the necessity of redress i say then every individual throughout the country suffers by this waste of public money and this profligate perversion in the expenditure of it for what can be more profligate than to employ that which might give comfort and happiness to millions in the destruction the murder the cool deliberate murder for every battle is in fact a massacre of those who had a right to this comfort and happiness emigrants——from the same among a variety of curious charges in the estimate of expenditure presented to us at the opening of the budget we have for the suffering clergy and laity of france £     0 so that out of the taxes which you every individual of you must contribute towards the support of the state ninetyeight thousand four hundred pounds are taken to relieve—who your distressed manufacturerers no the poor beings whose little all has been lost by the inundations at norwich and other places no but the profligate monks who with intolerance and superstition in their knapsacks have    travelled here to open the pandoras box of their exploded religion and taint the morals and manners of the people by the detestable doctrines over which they have been brooding in their solitary retirements these are the individuals for whom the peasant is to labour in the field and the manufacturer in his workshop these are the men who are to have a portion of the poor mans loaf while that poor man possesses not sufficient for himself and his craving family i say the poor mans loaf for show me the article that can be consumed by the lowest individual in society that is not subject to taxation how often has the bread been taxed before it goes to your mouth is it not taxed in the barn is it not taxed in the market is it not taxed in the mill is it not taxed in the labour of the individual is it not taxed in the iron that ploughs the earth—in all the implements of husbandry is it not taxed in the cattle of the farmer and the factor is it not taxed by the soldier is it not taxed by the priest in short is it not taxed again and again till it is astonishing considering how many accumulations of taxation it has gone through that the price is not even more extravagant than it is yet a part of what has been thus earned and thus dragged through the sieve of taxation is it to be torn away to feed the very wretches whose pride and superstition have kindled the war that is desolating europe and who have infected the cabinet of this country by their evil councils and blinded it to the real interests of humanity anecdotes of crimping the following anecdotes are inserted upon the most unequivocal authority and may tend to impress the minds of the advocates for the present war with some idea of the domestic calamities and growing depravities of human character which are the inevitable consequences of its prosecution in september      a young recruit about half a year standing who was himself employed in the honourable office of procuring soldiers for the service—an office which like that of some other procurers and procuresses is better paid    than honester professions found means to persuade a younger brother to enlist and proceeded with him to a neighbouring magistrate for the purpose of taking the customary oaths the magistrate suspecting the purpose of his approaching visitors and feeling for the situation of an already unfortunate mother caused himself to be declared absent finding his surmises true he permitted a person to be privately sent to the mother acquainting her of the circumstance he was however obliged to appear before the mother arrived and it was with the utmost difficulty he could find excuses to resist for awhile the continual demands of the elder brother to perform his duty at last the mother appeared in sight whom when the elder brother saw he redoubled his importunities but without success the mother entered figure to yourself the contending passions of a mother in such a situation she used prayers and threats and then prayers again to her unnatural son not to rob her thus of her children appealed to the feelings of her other son but though he cried bitterly it was in vain the elder monster had played his part too well he coolly desired the magistrate to do his duty o how miserable am i exclaimed the mother it is not a year ago since i was happy happy indeed with four children who all supported themselves by honest industry here are two of them my daughter married a soldier and after following him up and down the country and living in the most wretched manner and with the most wretched people is now gone to the wars my youngest son is still at home but you wretch how long will you let him remain with me he is but twelve years old and you know you are always teazing him to leave me and become a soldier the magistrate and his family were all in tears but he was obliged to conclude the business they tell us that anarchy would be the consequence of attending to those who oppose war and state craft is not this anarchy or something worse a happy family are all thrown into confusion the elder son sells his brothers and the daughter becomes an outcast every principle of morality generosity and feeling as well as order and regularity for which they so much contend is here entirely destroyed besides what interest has this family in this war what good could setting up a king in france do to them would their work be easier—their pay be better—or their bread be cheaper what had they to fear from what was done in    france honest industry cannot be worse off than at present and if the lower class of people in general have no interest in the war what but swindling and murder is to carry it on at the expence of their lives their connections and every thing that is dear on another occasion when this same magistrate was on the point of administering the oath to a youth who had enlisted the door suddenly burst open an aged man darted in and fell flat upon his face as if never more to rise again silent astonishment seized on all—when the old man collected strength to raise his head and exclaim only for gods sake stop he was the father of the youth the magistrate refused to administer the oath till he had heard his request in a short time he recovered and gave vent to his agony at the thoughts of losing his son he had he said followed him the moment he heard of his intention and had run several miles his years would not have permitted him to walk half so far on another occasion but his anxiety and despair had given him strength he could not expect to live long but if his beloved son and only comfort of his old age thus abandoned him short and miserable indeed would be the remainder of his days but the bounty had stolen into the sons heart—destroyed his lately generous feelings and doomed him perhaps to be soon numbered with slaughtered thousands or become a mangled and horrible spectacle the rest of his days a living witness to the effects of corruption and war m j a striking instance of the wanton barbarity of despotic power the tendency of inordinate power to corrupt the human heart has frequently been remarked by philosophers by moralists and historians and the remark is more than sufficiently illustrated by the records of that people the romans with whose history every lad of tolerable education becomes familiar in his scholastic exercises in short it is impossible to read the slightest accounts of the reigns of nero and the croud of monsters who stained the roman purple without reflecting    that the shocking barbarities with which these tyrants amused their leisure hours are such as no human being accountable to public censure and educated under the restraints of equal laws could ever have thought of even in the wildest paroxysms of rage when inflamed by injuries and struggling with the most imminent dangers nay notwithstanding the tendency of every thing that depresses the human character to harden the heart not even the wild troops of emancipated slaves who have occasionally broken loose upon the ancient and modern world ever displayed the exulting levity and epicurianism of barbarity which has marked the characters of these imperial slanders of the roman name the mind just freed from the chains of intolerable slavery will it is true by its natural elasticity fly to the opposite extreme of licentiousness and the impolicy of a treacherous or illtimed opposition will often inflame it to madness till in the furious pursuit of revenge such acts are perpetrated as the advocates of despotisin may repeat with exulting exaggeration and the friends of liberty shudder to hear but for the despot alone who claims a property in millions of his fellowcreatures is reserved the calm and tranquil gratification of having racks and instruments of torture in his apartments that he may amuse his fancy as he eats his voluptuous meal with the groans and agonies of the victims selected for his morning recreation it may however be supposed that there were some particular circumstances in the character and situation of the roman tyrants which prompted these excesses of barbarity but in fact no reason can be assigned but the tendency of unlimited power to corrupt the heart for the records of every despotic government display the effects of a similar disposition and if the cruelty has not been carried to the same horrid excess it is only because the despotism has been more restrained among the instances of the wanton inhumanity of turkish tyrants with which a miscellaneous course of reading has furnished me i need only quote the following to shew that the barbarities of despotic monarchs do not require the common excuses of revenge or fear or even the slighter provocations of capricious aversion—murder is their amusement and the blood of their unoffending slaves may flow to illustrate their criticisms of those arts which ought to civilize and refine mankind gentil bellini a venetian painter born in the year      being employed by the republic of venice in painting the noble works still to be seen in the councilchamber procured so    high and general a reputation that mahomet ii emperor of the turks wrote to the republic to request that they would send him to constantinople that he might employ his pencil for the gratification of that court bellini accordingly went and painted many excellent pieces among the rest was the decollation of st john the baptist who is revered as a great prophet by the turks mahomet admired the proportion and shadowing of the work but he remarked one defect in the execution of the skin of the neck from which the head was separated and in order to prove the truth of his observation the royal monster sent for one of his slaves and ordered his head to be struck off in the painters presence this sight so shocked the lesscritical feelings of the artist that he could not be easy till he obtained his dismission from such a den of despotisth and barbarity this request at length was granted and bellini returned to the more humane confines of his native country where he lived upon the pension liberally bestowed upon him by the republic till he attained his eightieth year auld reekies corporation politics or the scotch method of procuring addresses practised with

thanks again   exile      the tribune no iii saturday   th march      on the probable consequences of continuing the present system of ambition and hostility from the first lecture on the nature and calamities of war i know very well that even in the most superficial manner in which this subject can be treated there are many persons without these walls and perhaps some few within who may think this a very improper enquiry for an individual like myself to enter into for it cannot but be known to you that it is held out by those who are the advocates of a system of corruption and delusion that those who pay ought not to enquire into the reason of the expenditure and that those who bleed should never investigate the nature of that quarrel in consequence of which their blood is shed but the friends of reason and of justice will hold a different opinion they will be ready to agree with me that it is at all times not the right only but the duty of every individual to enquire into the nature of those transactions he is called upon to support and that every individual before he expends his property ought to have some view of the application that is to be made of that property and before he rushes into scenes of slaughter and desolation ought to be well assured that the principle for which he is contending is such that the happiness to society to result from it will more than amply repay all the desolation and all the scenes of horror which are to be produced i am aware that to maintain doctrines of this kind—to affirm that man has rights and that it is his duty to enquire into the nature of those rights—to affirm that man is a moral agent and that therefore it is his duty to enquire into the manner in which this agency is to be employed are principles and doctrines which in the present day are stigmatized by the name of jacobinism however citizens though  0 i never was particularly inclined to idolize that name yet if the distinction is to be drawn if as montgaillard has affirmed—there are to be but two parties and every one who is not a friend to the ancient despotism and tyranny of france is to be branded as a jacobine—if we either must wish for the restoration of that tyranny and the establishment of something like it among ourselves or we must be called anarchists and jacobins i will put up with the insult i will be called an anarchist or a jacobine for i know very well they are not names but principles that constitute the real value of the human character and i never can uphold as a principle the enormous faith of millions made for one if then it ever was the duty if it ever was the interest of the people to investigate the operations and proceedings of the government under which they live—if it was ever right to enquire which is to be preferred the peaceful reign of reason arts and sciences or the desolating dominion of war and slaughter surely it is a tenfold duty it is a tenfold interest at this time when we reflect under what a weight and accumulation of burdens we groan and how many calamities and disasters have blasted at once the prosperity and the fame of britain let us then make some little enquiry into that ruinous system of war and desolation under which we at this time live if life indeed it can be called to that mass of people so large a portion of which are shivering in want and wretchedness and are doomed to untimely graves not absolutely it is true by the griping fangs of famine but by those debilitating diseases which are the consequeoces of the want of proper sustenance we have long been amused with egotistical tales of british glory national grandeur and commercial prosperity these pompous words like the maxims and oracles of ancient superstition have been uttered from behind the sacred curtains of the cabinet they have been dealt abroad by the highpriests of the house of representatives and have been echoed again by the artizans drooping under their labour and the peasants pining for want in the midst of that plenty they produced from nation to nation from shore to shore these pompous egotisms have been reechoed national vanity has not been the peculiar property of any people and the arrogance of britain has been equalled at least if not surpassed by the adulating vanity of the old despotism of france    hence suspicious envy and rival animosities—hence have two nations two courts i ought to say and their deluded followers been precipitated into mutual hatred and scenes of cruel carnage to gratify that vanity which had so insidiously been inspired hence comes the monstrous doctrines of natural enmity and the supposition that every country which approximates towards another must necessarily be the enemy of that country because its grandeur and prosperity by which little more is meant than the splendour of courts and the power of ministers might rival the grandeur and prosperity of its neighbour what has been the blessed consequence the old despotism of france depopulated her regions in a vain struggle for the universal sovereignty of the continent britain also has depopulated her country by an equally ambitious and ridiculous attempt at the exclusive empire of the ocean and thus these two great boasters the general disturbers of mankind would grasp the sovereignty of the universe the one by her myriads of marshalled slaves the other by her empire of the ocean what has been the result look in the first instance to the country whose ambition we have so long blamed while we have been so fatally blind to our own look what were the fruits to the gallic monarchy of this monstrous scene of war and slaughter with which it so long embroiled and depopulated europe see the sinews of the state exhausted see that grinding oppression which fell upon the lower orders of society see that embarrassment of finances which resulted from this continued struggle and behold at last between its accumulated burdens its vices and follies this fabric of gigantic despotism falls crumbling into the dust amidst groans and carnage and all the miseries that arise from disorganized society—miseries however not to be considered in general as the crimes of those who immediately produced them but of those whose monstrous vices—whose barbarous ambition—whose system of war and oppression rendered convulsion necessary as the only means of national salvation the people when driven to desperation will act from the dictates of despair revenues when exhausted must be productive of explosions fatal to those who have exhausted them while absolute ignorance reigns it is true a spunge may be applied and we have seen that france has in this manner more than once retrieved herself but when information and enquiry are afloat a government that means to perpetuate itself must cultivate frugality frugality can alone    be supported by a system of peace and a system of real peace cannot be continued but by consulting the happiness and welfare of the people and regarding the prosperity even of the lowest orders of society the old despotism of france either unhappily or happily for mankind—but why do i doubt why do i speak with sceptical diffidence upon such a question why not affirm at once that the old despotism of france unhappily for itself indeed but happily for mankind was blind to these great and important truths a little more moderation in the rulers of the last halfcentury might have kept france in slavery to this day might have prevented those explosions it is true and those calamities under which the nation has lately groaned but it might have procrastinated generation after generation and century after century a degree of subjection on the one hand and tytanny on the other to which i shall not scruple to say no being possessed of moral and intellectual faculties ought ever to submit and from which be it sedition or be it high treason i cannot but rejoice to see mankind emancipated with respect to england let us see what is the harvest which it has reaped from manuring the field of glory with its blood and sowing it with its treasures from pursuing with mad infatuation the bubble of sanguinary reputation a bubble it is true which monarchs and courtiers may enjoy amidst the plaudits of a theatre or the adulation of a palace but which the peasant and the artizan must seek in the cannons mouth and which when he has obtained enables him to leave to his widow and orphans no other legacy than beggary and wretchedness no other dowry than the bitter fragments of charity that fall from the proud mans table much has been said by historians of the triumphs of british arms her glories in continental wars and her magnificent exploits by sea we have not it is true heard many of those plaudits during the present war but in former exploits of this kind our ears have been tickled our imaginations inflated with pompous details of myriads slain in the field of battle and thousands and tens of thousands of our fellow beings blown in mangled fragments through the air or strewed like wrecks over the surface of the ocean but what have been the fruits of those triumphs what have been the profits of those glorious exploits which humanity so much exults in look to your heaths and villages your manufacturing towns and trading cities see in every populous street obscure    hamlet and solitary cottage what happiness what triumphs on every conntenance behold the aged and infirm solacing themselves in ease and plenty and the young and vigorous banqueting on all the harmless luxuries of the earth enjoying every delight and every comfort which glory and honour and such big sounding words if they mean any thing must certainly include alas alas wherever you turn behold the sad reverse—behold the melancholy effects of these victories written in other characters if you will believe the facts of history if you will compare the condition of the lower orders of society by considering what in former times was the degree of proportion between the prices of labour and the prices of provisions you will see that all these triumphs have to the great body of the people brought nothing but a plenteous harvest of wretchedness and misery to the mass of the people i say and facts will bear me out no other fruits have been produced from these sanguinary labours but misery and dejection but ignorance and want they therefore have but little reason for glorying in these mighty triumphs or for hazarding their lives in support of this depopulating system would not this view of society lead one to suspect either that there has been a great deal of vain boasting in those reports of triumphs and successful atchievements with which the page of former history has so inflated the breasts of britons or else that this glory is in reality nothing but a bubble—a painted vapour which like the rainbow in the fable tempts the deluded shepherd to fly from hill to hill in quest of an imaginary treasure while the wolves of power seize upon his little flock as the proper reward of his infatuation perhaps both these statements are in reality just at any rate it is evident that whatever may be the pompous language that is held out to us this system of war and glory instead of a project of national advantage and by national advantage i mean advantage to the great body of the inhabitants of the nation is an evil of most enormour extent to remedy the effects of which calls for all our energy and all our unanimity i say citizens it is our duty to take this subject into consideration and i also say that if we consider what the state of britain is at this time and what was the state of france previous to that explosion which destroyed the monarchy and aristocracy of that country we should find that aristocrats and    royalists if they could see their own interest instead of irritating the public mind by persecution instead of aggravating the burthens and calamities of the people by an obstinate perseverance in this ruinous war would ardently join in the endeavour to avert a similar catastrophe from the government of this country by the only means by which it can be averted—by restoring the country to peace and immediately throwing a large portion of the burthens already contracted from the shoulders of the common people to the shoulders of those placemen pensioners and contractors who have been so long enriching themselves by this horrid traffic for we must admit that similar causes will produce similar effects if therefore the despotic constitution of france was overthrown—and i am glad it was overthrown—this sentiment was interrupted by a burst of enthusiastic applause yes citizens i avow that such is my abhorrence and detestation for despotism that i rejoice in its overthrow in france and there are some other despotic governments i mean the superstitious tyranny of turkey the barbarous despotism of morocco the capricious cruelties of the japanese—which i should rejoice to see involved in the same fate nor would it grieve me much if the pious orderly and regular government of russia and the other conscientious partitioners of devoted poland were on the verge of a similar catastrophe i should be happy indeed if this overthrow in other countries were attended with less violence and fewer crimes than it has been in france and i should hope that it would be so because the example of the errors of france will be an awful warning to other parts of the universe and when they shall choose to struggle for their liberty they will have less of the illiberal spirit of suspicion less intrigue less disposition to slaughter and violence more philosophy more information more experience and therefore more temperance more benevolence and a more thorough conviction that principles and not men are the objects of attention for men are but machines performing under the inevitable laws of necessity precisely the part which under circumstances exactly similar any other individual must inevitably have performed and if men are not voluntary criminals—if their crimes are only the inevitable consequences of the systems under which they have acted what justice—what necessity can there be to stain a holy cause with cruel vengeance and inflict a wanton punishment upon individuals when the system is no more that produced their crimes    if i say then the despotism of france was overthrown on account of the abject misery into which the mass of the people were plunged by the profligate expenditure of the public money in foreign exploits and crusades and the eventual embarrassments of the revenues of that country it is the duty of ministers to take care that the orderly benevolent and just government of england is not overthrown by a system of war and taxation inevitably tending to reduce the people and the revenues to the same calamitous situation and yet citizens much as this duty and this prudence should press upon the heart of every reflecting man what is the conduct of those in power consider how frequently shock after shock paroxysin after paroxysin of this frantic mania this lust of war and glory has followed during the last century and how debilitated the frame of this country has become in consequence and yet the paroxysm of the disease is again upon us and there seems not to be one political professor of the healing science inclined to examine how many more attacks of this voluntary disease the fibres and stamina of the country will endure without being shaken to dissolution citizens when i first began to deliver political lectures to a smaller circle than i have now the happiness to address this subject occupied a considerable part of my attention and i find by looking over one of the few fragments which escaped the general pillage of the   th and   th of may last that i then endeavoured to state what the circumstances were under which we at first engaged in this ridiculous crusade i find i then stated that we commenced a war of the most alarming complexion with a debt of between   0 and   0 millions already upon our shoulders with an annual taxation of near seventeen millions and with a population which though it appeared too large considering the monstrous waste and consumption of those monopolists who for destroying the liberties of the country are rewarded by its luxuries yet scanty indeed considering what the country properly cultivated is capable of supporting if sheltered by the laws of liberty truth and equality—i mean equality of rights equality of opportunities for turning the faculties of the individual to advantage if citizens these arguments deserved any weight at that period let us reflect a little how considerably this weight is now increased let us remember the gigantic strides which these evils have made during the two short years in which    we have been engaged in the present war let me recal to your minds some of those facts which in the course of the present season i have submitted to you let us remember that during the last summer  0000 individuals emigrated from england scotland and ireland to the more happy and inviting shores of america and that therefore the decrease of population during these two years by emigration alone in all human probability particularly if we consider how during the last three months accumulation of difficulty has been heaped upon accumulation how distress has been added to distress and insult offered in aggravation to insult we cannot calculate the whole depopulation from this source at less than   0000 useful inhabitants let us add to this the depopulation of famine and the sword if you consider the immense armies that have been sustained on the continent if you consider the expeditions to the west indies glorious and profitable to this country indeed if you consider that even aristocrats allow that     officers lost their lives in that expedition and calculate the general ratio with respect to the men if you consider how small a portion this armament bears to the whole and if you call to mind that the present number of troops on the continent bears a very small proportion indeed to the numbers that were sent at the very opening of the first campaign notwithstanding that month after month and week after week the youth of this country have been drained in hundreds and in thousands to recruit our armies i think that my calculation of the depopulation by military and naval expeditions cannot be extravagant if i estimate it at   0000 individuals i know this calculation will appear very large and i know very well that the human mind must be so filled with horror at the aggregate idea of   0000 massacres—for i can give the murders of an unnecessary war no better name that your minds will be but little disposed to admit so large a calculation but i believe i have not rated it too high consider then that this depopulation is of the most serious kind that our armies are mostly composed of men from that age when youth begin to increase the species to that period when they cease to be useful to the country in this respect that you are therefore taking away the heart and sinews of the country and that the men you slaughter in your ridiculous crusades might have doubled the population of the succeeding ages—as well as the present quantity of the necessaries of    life when you take all these circumstances into consideration you will be palsied with terror and apprehension at the probable consequence for consider putting together the emigrations and the slaughters you have an amount of   0000 fourfifths that is to say    000 of which at least must have been the most effective members of the state either for productive labour or necessary defence now you will consider that the population has never been reckoned higher than twelve million i take the three countries into consideration then you will consider that of this population you are only to reckon one million and a half as effective men that is to say men capable of bearing arms for the repulsion of foreign interference you have therefore a positive diminution in two years of nearly one fourth of the effective population of the country and full one fourth of those individuals upon whose manual exertions we can depend for the necessaries and comforts of life for the calculation of effective men is taken in all the ranks and classes of society but some of these ranks and classes are employed only in destroying not in producing the necessaries and comforts of life i stated to you also citizens on the last evening that from     millions and an half our national debt was increased to     millions and an half i gave you then the documents by which the fact was proved i have stated also to you from documents equally authentic that the annual burthen was increased from something less than seven million to almost thirtytwo millions and an half such then are the burdens under which we at present uphold the doctrine that war is to be continued and depopulation to go on that though beaten at every point though disappointed in every undertaking not from the want of energy in the people but from the want of virtue justice and wisdom in those by whom the people have been deluded though disappointed in every expectation though disgraced in every effort though obliged to appeal to bribery and corruption instead of the open and manly exertions in which this country used to pride itself mixing with machiavelian art in all the intrigues and vices of italian politics—notwithstanding all this still we are told we are to go on the government of france is not to be treated with we are to carry sword and fire to the gates of paris mark citizens how these political mountebanks outherod herod    laugh no more at the pompous boasts of katterfelto or the project of the bottle conjurer the conquest of france has been advertised by the chief juggler of the day and the credulous world has thronged to the exhibition but when the feat was to be performed the conjurer as usual escaped at the back door the conquest of france—o calumniated crusaders howrational and moderate were your objects—o much injured louis xiv upon what slight grounds have you been accused of restless and immoderate ambition—o tame and feeble cervantes with what a timid pencil and faint colours have you painted the portrait of a disordered imagination such was the exclamation of the great oracle of opposition—the demosthenes of the british senate in his letter to his constituents of westminster prophetic exclamation how completely confirmed by every subsequent event yet still we are to persist and though like a crab we have been travelling backwards for two whole years we are still to keep our eyes upon the gates of paris and still in imagination to rout the convention and destroy the myriads of armies they are pouring into the field but it is not only this accumulated weight upon our shoulders that impedes us we are palsied also upon another side—look at the different situation of our allies think of holland for whose sake we are told we undertook this war—look at the scheldt will the brabanters and the dutch quarrel now whether the scheldt shall be navigated will one side of the river cooperate with us while we are defending the other alas the two banks are equally hostile and to the right and the left those whom you called your friends and treated like the worst of enemies those whom you fought for and those whom you fought against are combined against you and perhaps the navy of holland which sunk into such contempt under the torpid reign of the stadtholder may recover its wonted energy under a republic and joining the navy of its new ally may show the world that batavians are the same people they formerly were that it was the government alone that had become lethargic and that freedom restored them to their wonted valour and if for so many years in former periods they alone kept the navy of this country at bay reflect a minue whether by your haughty deportment refusing to treat because it is the people and not the stadtholder that sends    the ambassador—reflect i say what may be the consequences—if the navy of holland unites with the navy of france the nautical skill of the dutch with the republican enthusiasm of the gauls should their united thunders be directed against the shores of this country i own i do not look with that bold confidence upon the event which your rulers would pretend while inwardly they shake with coward palsies holland detached from your side brabant then wavering now confirmed the friend of france tuscany whom you plunged into the war whether he would or no extricating himself by an honourable peace granted with magnificent generosity by that enemy whom we pretend to say is so treacherous that we cannot treat with them russia still slumbering over her promises and her treaties fattened and satiated with the massacres of warsaw and exhibiting without a mask what are the views the virtues of this canting heroine and of that regular and orderly government of which she is the consecrated head prussia receiving your money but never furnishing the stipulated troops accepting your subsidies with one hand and with the other signing the preliminary articles of negociation with your enemy such is the picture of europe such are the allies who are still to be treated with and trusted after repeated acts of the most flagitious treachery while another country from which you have not in its present form of government experienced any treachery whatever you are told it is not to be treated with at all because if it happens to break a peace forsooth it will not be broken in that regular and orderly manner of which the diplomatic faith and consistent virtues of the old established governments have given you so many curious specimens but still we have one hope one wooden leg after another with which we have attempted to prop up our decrepid cause has it is true been broken and thrown away but still we have a crutch on one side we can lean upon austria and though we do pay a little dear for the support yet it is better than to suffer an entire overthrow—of what of our territories no they are only endangered by continuing the war of our prosperity no the minister takes care that nobody shall share with him the honour of destroying that it is the windmill of cabinet influence whose overthrow is dreaded the vanity and wild projects of our heavenborn minister yes citizens we stand it is true upon the fickle hope of german faith the empire the emperor—hear the sounding  0 name ye crouds adore the wonderful charm remember that even breach of faith ceases to be treachery when gilt by this pompous title remember that though repeated experience has shewn you the faithlessness of those who wear it and though all the facts of history shew you the open sincerity of republican governments—yet such is the magic power of this word emperor—and indeed of every other word that implies but royalty that the very breach of faith proves you ought still to trust while experience itself can furnish no reason to conclude that you ought ever to confide in a country branded with so atheistical a title as republic the emperors promises such as they are though he seems to have modesty enough not to be extremely explicit in them are still to be relied upon and thus crippled in your alliances weighed down by debt weakened by depopulation we are to repeat our crusade to rush once more into the field of slaughter and sacrifice at the altar of this infernal moloch the husbandman and the manufacturer whose labours might administer to the comforts and felicities of life and all for what to sooth the vanity and superstition of the monks and cowardly aristocrats of france who monopolize the confidence of our minister and pour into the ears of our rulers that poison of despotic treachery which has already brought to the scaffold their own unfortunate sovereign who was weak enough to imbibe its influence for these and their visionary prospects we are to pursue the most expensive hopeless and ridiculous war ever undertaken by europe not excepting the crusade that left so indelible a stain upon the intellects of the   th century if however one grain of reflection still remains in britain if we are not entirely intoxicated by the mania of alarm let us pause a little and survey the precipice upon which we stand still thy rude voice a while thou brazen trumpet ere again thou provoke mankind to deeds of cruelty and wickedness silence awhile the dreadful thunders of the alldevouring cannon and let reason uplift her powerful voice for what purpose are we thus going to bathe our faulchions in the blood of our fellowmen for what reason are we to expose our bosoms to their destroying swords suppose you could succeed my countrymen would your taxes be lessened would the commodities of life be procured at a cheaper rate would you—i put aside for the present the calamities and miseries you suffer during the struggle would you find yourselves in a situation more comfortable and happy would the wants of nature be better supplied    would the innocent luxuries of life be enjoyed in greater abundance would your minds be more unshackled enquiry be more free would science—and above all the science of political amelioration raise up its head with greater triumph than it did before alas alas these are circumstances i fear never entered into the calculation of those who have plunged us into the present undertaking these are calculations for metaphysical jacobins and those who are mad enough to suppose that man has unalienable rights and that one human being has as just a title to improve his faculties for the happiness of himself and family as another—such visionaries as these may enter into calculations of human happiness and human knowledge but the enlightened statesman soars above them his eye sublimed above the clouds of common life rolls in golden and beatific visions and dwells upon the sublimities of places and pensions upon the heaven of power and emolument there he bathes his luxurious fancy wantons in the prospects of coronets titles stars and coloured ribbons and leaves to such insignificant beings who think about their fellow creatures the idle speculation of what is good or what is ill for man but citizens though placemen and pensioners may not think fit to enter into such calculations it is worth your while to do so and you ought to do it for yourselves for if you will not enquire into your own rights how can you expect that others will be so superfluous as to enquire them for you if you do not value your own prosperity why should others if you do not think it worth while to make calculations upon your own happiness why should others who have no conection no common interest with you trouble their heads about it they can be more happily employed in counting their places their chancellorships their tellerships their lordwardensships their treasuryships their sinecures and their patronages and therefore if you will not enquire into your own rights why blame others for not enquiring into them for you how can you expect that which you will not do for yourselves should be done for you by placemen pensioners and proprietors of rotten boroughs to stimulate to this enquiry is the object for which i call you together in this place remember it is not from listening to lectures it is not from frequenting now and then a debating society it is not from turning over the leaves of a book that you are to expect improvement and wisdom your    minds must labour if you expect them to be benefited your minds must labour if you wish to discover that truth which assisted by benevolence may redress the wrongs of your fellow citizens and yourselves if you will idly listen with implicit confidence to any man it matters not who he is—whether priest prime minister or political lecturer you may listen it is true to the doctrines of another but if you make not use of your own reason to enquire and investigate whether they are true or false you may be affected indeed with warmth and petulance but will never attain the true philosophical light of truth and benevolence scrutinize every thing you hear from every one and most of all every thing that you hear from me i am a man subject to all the passions and delusions of human nature all the frailties of passion are upon me all the ignorance which the prejudices early inculcated in the present system have a tendency to produce and i have had many disadvantages in the pursuit of knowledge under which many of you perhaps have not laboured think not therefore that i wish you to take for granted every thing i tell you you must have your knowledge not as the parrot has his by rote but from the labours of your own minds from the feelings and conviction of your own hearts these will i believe conduct you to this conclusion that war is equally a calamity to the nation that makes it and the nation against whom it is directed that the system of war has plunged this country into innumerable calamities and that the overthrow of that system the return of reason and the permanent happiness of the country can only be secured by a full fair and equal representation of the people in the commons house of parliament the duty and interest of the people to enquire into the causes and conduct of wars in the guilt of which they are involved by contributing to their support—from the second lecture on war in my former lecture on this subject i seriously recommended you to consider no individual as infallible to look up with veneration to no mans opinions to estimate all opinions    and all sentiments in proportion to the conviction they bring to your own minds and not the partial attachments you may have for the persons who submit them to you i endeavoured to shew you that all instruction all reading all eloquence are no further useful than as they cultivate the seeds of enquiry in the minds of those who listen or peruse and as they furnish them with materials wherewith to work for themselves in those grand enquiries in which it is the happiness and interest of man to be engaged i advised you seriously to consider for yourselves how far this system of war is good or bad in itself how far the pretences for it have been realized and if realized how far they were worth the price that was paid for them i shall now endeavour to shew you that it is equally your duty and your interest and that a considerable degree of moral turpitude attaches to that individual who by his personal services or by his property contributes to the prosecution of any war the justice of whose principle he has not investigated of the probability of whose success he has not formed some estimate and whose objects he has not properly weighed citizens let us consider that the morals the happiness and the prosperity of every individual are involved in every war in which the country may be engaged let us consider that we all have every thing at stake that not only the comforts of life not only that liberty and independence which we so much prize but the very existence of every individual may be involved in the event however securely we may fit at home however carelessly we may read the gazettes which announce the slaughter of thousands let us recollect that in the giddy changes of the wheel of fortune the war which is now at a distance may come home to us slaughter and devastation may confront us at our own doors and those who have so madly and so franticly engaged to carry desolation through the streets of paris may fly through the streets of london before the face of those very parisians whose habitations they so madly threatened with conflagration and whose sires and relatives with slaughter if then the lives and happiness of every individual are at stake surely all ought to give themselves some pains to calculate the chances of cards and endeavour to discover the rules of the desperate game they are playing    war says citizen gerrald in his excellent pamphlet a convention the only means of saving us from ruin though declared by the government must be supported by the people parliament imposes taxes but you pay them the king declares war but it is the blood of the peasant and manufacturer which flows in the battle it is the purse of the tradesman and the artificer which is emptied in the contest let us recollect also that not only in the catastrophe but in the guilt we are participators whatever turpitude may attach itself to the war in general so far as it depends upon our exertions or our sluggishness lays at our doors comparison between the guilt of a common murderer and the deliberate projector of unnecessary war from the same as war can only be just in one of the parties it follows of course that in the other it must be murder nay i believe that in nine wars out of ten it has not been just either on the one side nor on the other if however it appears in any particular contest that the individuals who compose one government have made use of every exertion to produce negociation instead of slaughter if they have sent ambassador after ambassador to treat with the cabinet of the threatening country and that country with insolent disdain with scorn with contempt with illfounded confidence and a degree of arrogance which nothing but ignorance could produce has rejected all those overtures of peace and negociation i am terribly afraid we shall be compelled in spite of national vanity in spite of national prejudice to justify the party that would have negociated even though that party should be contending against ourselves i have said citizens that war on one side or the other must be murder—but the epithet is feeble there is no term in language that can describe the crime with justice and energy—murder which stands so prominent in the catalogue of moral vices bears but a trifling proportion to the political    guilt of those who plunge two nations nay not content with that who plunge almost the whole habitable globe in scenes of slaughter and desolation to gratify their caprice or exalt their ambition perhaps the murderer whom we so justly execrate might find many circumstances to plead in alleviation of his guilt which it would be difficult to apply to the other want misery the persecuting insolence of monopolizing power the hard griping hand of famine may drive a miserable individual to acts of depredation which afterwards from a mistaken sense of personal security or in the moment of unexpected contest may provoke him to plunge into guilt he never meditated hasty revenge intemperate rage the boiling passion of the moment may have inflicted the fatal blow but the political murderer proceeds by system he plans he deliberates he meditates in the calm recesses of the closet those scenes of fury and desolation which his hired assassins are to perpetrate as soon as his cold blooded ambition shall have formed by mathematical lines and calculations the plans upon which they are to act he also strikes not at the life of an individual he strikes at thousands he murders by wholesale and exults over the catalogue of his atrocities he kills in safety also—shuns the danger but perpetrates the guilt he breathes the pestilential mandate and myriads perish but bathed in the true thieves vinegar of office he strips the dead without partaking the infection how much more atrocious this than the crimes which excite so much indignation in our hearts and which because they are rare because they come before us in individual instances and present the real picture to the mind we contemplate with indignation while we remain indifferent to the other citizens then let us consider how important it is since every individual is some how or other concerned in what are called the acts of the nation that every individual should seriously investigate the justice or the injustice of the wars in which he may be plunged because though the principle of self preservation may justify the individual who draws his sword upon the defensive side the soldiers who march into the field in support of an unjust cause are only the hired assassins however unconscious they may be of the guilt of the persons who planned the war    no war just but a war of self defence from the same citizens a war of absolute defence is the only war that can be justified what criminality then must attach to those who are engaged in a war of a directly opposite nature if the life of one man is not to be taken away but on a principle of self defence or on the previous conviction of his guilt by a calm and sober appeal to reason how much more does it become us scrupulously to weigh in the balance of the sanctuary the causes for which we embark in a complicated war in which the kindred blood of thousands of our fellow creatures is poured out like water by the unfeeling arm of a mercenary soldier—gerrald citizens—i do not mean to confine my animadversions to the war in which we are at present engaged principles and not men should be the objects of attention—the general system not the individual instance it matters little that you should put a period to the present war if you are not convinced of the madness and turpitude of war in general and determined to diffuse those benevolent and generous principles of peace and amity which may prevent fresh calamities of this description from falling again immediately upon your heads no war can be just that is not politic and by politic i mean promotive of the happiness of the people for how can that be good which does not secure the general happiness of mankind no war can be politic but that which is engaged in for the real and actual defence of the parent state because though it is good and right to exert all the energies with which we are endued for the preservation of the individual or the community all wars for frivolous pretences and i call all the ambitious schemes of courts and cabinets frivolous however successful or triumphant must cost more than they are worth and the sole glory and triumph that you obtain is to see so many mutilated beings stalking through your streets or filling your hospitals and reminding you of the thousands and tens of thousands of your fellow men who have been slain in battle but who might have been increasing the prosperity and real wealth of the state if they had been employed in producing the comforts of life instead of destroying each other in a ridiculous contest    consequences of our national glory and prosperity to the great body of the people—from the same let us look at the mass of mankind do we not find them still doomed to eternal drudgery still plunged in ignorance and servitude is it not their bitter lot even when they can obtain subsistence at this rate to go from the hard pallet to their different occupations from their occupations to the scanty meal from the scanty meal to labour and from labour again to repose as if the bulk of the human species existed for nothing were fit for nothing were capable of nothing but to drudge eternally for the luxuries of a few to eat to drink to propagate and rot however citizens those advantages even if they could be proved which are supposed to result from conquest and victory are advantages of which this country has for some time almost entirely lost sight—it is true at the commencement of the present war his royal highness took valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany and he ran away from dunkirk in the name of his royal father let the widows and orphans of those who were slaughtered in these glorious exploits tell me if they can which of them was the most advantageous to the country which of them afforded the largest proportion of comfort to themselves or alleviated best the wants and anguish of their expiring relatives extreme difference between the interests of ministers and the interests of the people with respect to peace and war from the same patronage but we must admit whatever may be the effect to the people at large as our governors are men of discernment men of considerable learning and intelligence that they are playing a game not quite so losing that they at least know what they are about the fact is they may have an interest while we have not the great source of the evil is here the people of europe in general have no more connection    with their respective governments except indeed as they are made the objects of plunder and taxation than they have with the governments of china and japan it may then be good for them to pursue a system which is destructive to us all war as it multiplies places and increases the receipts of government at least while the war endures extends of course the power and patronage of the minister though it loads the people with additional taxes as long as war lasts continues citizen gerrald government has immense sums to dispose of and as revenue has hitherto been the object of governments the hope of making conquests will induce them to carry on the system of war as long as the people will submit to it every addition of territory furnishes a new field for the collection of more taxes every conquered district is considered a new farm and the people who cultivate it being regarded as sheep are annually brought up to be shorn of their fleeces thus every minister while affairs are situated as they are has an interest in plunging the country into war because in consequence of that war a great variety of fresh places are created and great patronage thrown into his hands he has the power of appointing contractors colonels ensigns and officers of various descriptions which increases his power and patronage secures him in his situation and gratifies his avarice or his ambition these facts need but to be mentioned and every one will feel conviction immediately ministerial prerogative there is another circumstance of considerable importance why the interests of the people and of ministers should be considered in a very eminent degree diametrically opposite to each other with respect to war those persons who are at the helm during a time of war have a pretence for vesting themselves with discretionary powers for increasing their own arbitrary authority for trampling down the liberties of the people and putting them under restrictions which in times of peace there could be no pretence for doing and consequently we find one of the blessed harvests of the present war to say nothing of the discretionary powers vested by the bill for manning the navy and other late acts of parliament in the privy council is the happy suspension of the jacobinical habeas corpus act it is an argument to which every driveller can appeal the country is in a state of external danger you must therefore    take care of turbulent spirits within by which phrase turbulent spirits is always meant every man who dares to speak against the mad and foolish projects of ministers the fences of authority are therefore doubled the personal protection of the individual members of the state suspended and annihilated where is the man who will pretend that in times of peace such acts could have been quietly thrust down the peoples throats as the alien act the traiterous correspondence bill so nobly disputed in the house of commons by those persons who according to the calculation of some are enemies to the laws and constitution of the country because they dared to shew that theministers were violating that constitution to these we may add the suspension of the habeas corpus act after he persons were taken into custody whom that suspension was meant to affect thus making the law a sort of trap to ensnare us with an appearance of security and when the harpies of power have drawn the victims into their toils the laws are suspended down goes the trap and britons when most in need of british privileges find they are britons no more no citizens in times of peace in times of national tranquillity such strides cannot be made and it is a fact standing upon the records of all histories of europe—it is a fact proved by thousands of instances that war after war has been produced nation after nation has been plunged in ruin and desolation and whole continents have been embroiled for no other purpose whatever than to give an opportunity to the ministers and cabinets of those countries to extend their own arbitrary power and lay prostrate at their feet the lives and liberties of their fellowcitizens it is then not from ministry that we are to expect a proper exposition of the system of war it is not from court expectants in opposition who however distinguished they may be by their talents or boasted principles of liberty still have their eyes fixed on a succession to places of soulcorrupting power and aggrandisement i say it is not from one or other of these classes of politicians that you ought to expect a thorough investigation of that system of war which for more than a century has continued to depopulate europe no every individual knows how powerfully selflove and interest operate upon the judgment like a thick film before the eye they obscure the lines and confuses the colours of the political landscape views of personal interest pervert the judgment and prevent us from seeing those evils from which at one time or  0 other we may expect advantage it is therefore from the virtuous energies of the public mind from the bold and manly spirit of general investigation—from the spirit and good sense of the people that we are to expect a thorough exposition of the horrors of war oh what but ambition what but the wild passions of interested individuals could so long have kept up that system of of delusion which has depopulated the ancient and continues to depopulate the modern world is it not strange does not imagination sicken does not reason stagger when we conjure up the picture fairly and justly before us what can be the reason that so many thousands of human beings rush into the field of battle with no provocation of malice no one real interest to direct them how astonishing is it that age after age generation after generation country after country should have beheld this phenomenon of man destroying man—intellectual beings rushing forward frequently to inevitable destruction with a mad and fierce enthusiasm courting the stroke of death as it were a blessing citizens—the picture is too astonishing to have been believed if we had nothing but records of history to attest it defender of the faith a meditation in the tower regal titles and decorations are seldom very readily parted with how much soever they may have lost their original meaning the roman emperors continued to be distinguished by the name and ensigns of pontifex maximus or high priest of jupiter long after their profession and the legal establishment of the christian religion and henry the fifth having by the assistance of the duke of burgundy made a kind of temporary conquest of france and his son having been crowned in his nurses arms at paris his successors have continued to the present day to bear about the mockery of gallic empire in their titles and their arms but a title of still more dignity and importance has long imparted lustre to the british crown the title of defender of the faith we all know that the first of our august sovereigns who wore this title was a very faithful being indeed he cut off the heads of half a dozen wives or so it is true and he changed his religion every six months that he might have the glory of roasting such of his subjects whose faith could not keep pace    with his be this as it will henry the eighth having written a book in defence of the pope the protestant kings of england still continue to be gratified with the titular reward of defender of the faith for mr pitt however was reserved the distinguished honour of restoring to his present majesty the substance of what for the eleven preceding reigns had been merely a shadow and his majesty george the third may now without boast or flattery be emphatically stiled defender of the faith for to say nothing of the present just and necessary war waged with so much holy obstinacy or as gibbon would have expressed it with such an exquisite rancour of theological hatred against the deluded republicans of france for the restoration among other things of the established i e popish religion of the country not only has the infallibility of his holiness the pope been protected by a guard of british soldiers but by the late confirmation in corsica of the right of the people to chuse their form of government their rulers and their religion his majesty is bound to protect and defend the holy roman catholic religion in that island nor have i any doubt but that when the allies have got to paris routed the convention and hanged all the jacobines the other hitherto empty title of our amiable sovereign will be realized and secured upon a foundation equally solid and permanent with that upon which we have here descanted j t anecdote of thomas paine it was observed in company to thomas paine that the british and irish were naturally inclined to monarchy so much so that in their convivial meetings they always had a toast master and that if six of them went to a tavern to drink a bottle of wine one would be put into the chair who would collect the bill and pay the waiter and the rest would benefit by his attention very true sir says paine but suppose your six men met every day to drink their bottle and that they had no more and the chairman always took a pint to himself they would soon contrive to drink without one that is if they were fond of wine and had common sense b    the impatient lover or a sigh

tribune no iv saturday  th april      exemplification of the humanity and benevolence of the eighteenth century—from the second lecture on the nature and consequences of the system of war within the last hundred years of our history says the author of the political progress britain has been five times at war with france and six times at war with spain during the same period she has been engaged in two rebellions at home besides an endless catalogue of massacres in asia and america in europe the common price which we advance for a war has extended from one to three hundred thousand lives and from sixty to an hundred and fifty millions sterling from africa we import annually between thirty and forty thousand slaves writers of considerable respectability have calculated the annual consumption as high as  0000 which rises in the course of a century to at least three millions of murthers in bengal only we destroyed or expelled within the short period of six years no less than five millions of industrious and harmless people and as we have been sovereigns in that country for above thirtyfive years it may be reasonably computed that we have strewed the plains of indostan with fifteen or twenty millions of carcases so that it is with too much justice that the same author observes in another place—in the east and west indies the conduct of britain may be fairly contrasted with the murder of atabaliba and will prove equally ruinous to the detested conquerors a severe censure which as far as it relates to west india policy and african commerce for so it is called has been sufficiently authorised by the facts which have come out in parliamentary discussion and which with respect to the east is supported by the following historical quotation the civil wars to which our violent desire of creating nabobs gave rise were attended with tragical events bengal    was depopulated by every species of public distress in the space of six years half the great cities of this opulent kingdom were rendered desolate the most fertile fields in the world lay waste and five millions of harmless and industrious people were either expelled or destroyed want of foresight became more fatal than innate barbarism and men found themselves wading through blood and ruin when their only object was spoil dows history of indostan vol iii p  0 these barbarous injuries have not been inflicted without some taste of correspondent calamities among ourselves though the day of serious retribution seems yet to come—perhaps is fast approaching already however if we combine the diversified ravages of famine pestilence and the sword it can hardly be supposed that in these transactions independent of the desolation produced by the present war less than fifteen hundred thousand of our countrymen have perisked a number equal to that of the whole inhabitants of britain who are at present able to bear arms in europe the havock of our antagonists has been at least not inferior to our own so that this quarter of the world alone has lost by our quarrels three millions of men in the flower of life whose descendants in the progress of domestic society would have swelled into multitudes beyond calculation the persons positively destroyed must in the whole have exceeded twenty millions or twothousand acts of homicide per annum these victims have been sacrificed to the balance of power and the balance of trade the honour of the british flag the universal supremacy of parliament and the security of the protestant succession if we are to proceed at this rate for another century we may which is natural to mankind admire ourselves and our atchievements but every other nation in the world must have a right to wish that an earthquake or a volcano may first bury both islands together in the centre of the globe that a single but decisive exertion of almighty vengeance may terminate the progress and the remembrance of our crimes pol prog p   will any individual believe that a system so mad and so profligate can tend to any thing less than the dissolution of all those governments by which it has been carried on why are we not warned by fatal experience why will we not be taught that evils so enormous cannot be perpetuated that if we continue in this mad career it requires no volcano to    destroy us no thunders to blast the depopulated and enfeebled country its own phrenzy must work its destruction shall we then or shall we not conceive it our duty to enquire into the means of checking this monstrous tyranny this horrid growth of war which has so long been exerting such destructive effects shall we suppose that it is our duty tamely and supinely to sit down without attempting by every possible exertion to apply a remedy to evils so enormous alas if we will not shortly apply the remedy the remedy will apply itself i know not what blindness i know not what infatuation has seized upon the men in power but either they are dreaming or the rest of the thinking part of mankind are lost in visionary phrenzy but it does appear to me that every department of the state every political phenomenon gives the most direct indication of the dissolution of that system which these men are endeavouring to perpetuate this system of ambition and war must fall see if you cannot discover the symptoms of the decay of that false strength that delusive appearance of power and grandeur which has so long deluded this country can you see no symptoms of approaching weaknesses if you cannot you certainly have not observed with accurate eye the page of history what were the symptoms of the fall of other states schemes of oppression and depression at home selfishness avarice monopoly individual accumulation and a total indifference to the miseries and calamities of mankind have not these been the forerunners of the destruction of all countries did not athens display the same phenomenon were not corruption voluptuousness and the desire of rapacious accumulation the great evils complained of by the philosophers and orators of that country previous to the desolation under which it fell never to rise again was not sparta a victim to the same corrupting vices did not rome a giant statue fall pushed from its base by artless hands from the same enervating causes can we not see the same spirit among ourselves can we not see that idolatry to opulence and to splendor under which the virtues the courage the energies of the people are daily sinking and sink they must for it is the necessary consequence of our present system luxury produces its diseases of one description penury has its diseases also and while the higher orders of society are enervated with the former the lower orders are depressed and beaten down by the latter citizens if we are wise we shall endeavour to extricate ourselves from the calamitous situation in which we are placed    by a timely and temperate reform we shall endeavour gradually to restore the one class of people to their simplicity and the other to their wonted comforts this and this only can preserve us this only can unite us in the day of trial and save us from the ruin that is gathering over our heads the blessed efforts of the system of colonization from the same colonial aggrandisement instead of an advantage is a curse for proof of this i will refer you to the budget of the minister which has been laid before the people i was going to say the insulted people during the present session and you will there find among the extraordinary expences that are charged and very extraordinary indeed many of them are a very considerable sum of money standing to the account of your colonies and foreign settlements for the support and protection of which you are taxed at home nay citizens canada itself at this very time is maintained at the enormous annual charge of six or seven hundred thousand pounds a year to be paid by taxes levied upon your industry by excise laws by window lights by taxes upon malt by taxes upon bread by wine licences by hair powder licences by little pittances pillaged from the tea cups of poor old women who have no comfort in the world beside six or seven hundred thousand pounds accumulated to the burthens which you must necessarily and inevitably bear—for what purpose for advantages expected from this distant colony no not one shilling of advantage was ever reaped ever will be reaped or ever was expected to be reaped from the important colony of canada and the minister knows he is paying this  00000l a year for no better purpose than shewing that this magnificent empire is extended to every quarter of the globe that you have a slave factory in africa a vast territory in asia a high mountain in the straits a barren rock in the mediterranean and a wretched colony in america magnificent idea how can britons repine at the want of bread when they are blest with such solid advantages but    there is a better piece of policy still behind these colonies promote patronage and strengthen the powerful hand of ministerial influence the minister and his creatures get the power of appointing all sorts of officers from the high and mighty governor who represents royalty in miniature to the little constable who parades the streets and who will also tell you that he in his turn represents the same sublime character yes citizens here is the real advantage the governors of your colonies must be dependant upon the minister the inferior officers must be dependant upon the governors and the understrappers upon them and thus you see the boasts of national grandeur and glory are nothing but steps to the back staircase of patronage built it is true at the expence of the people but subservient only to the purposes of their rulers who are enabled by this ingenious invention to climb beyond the reach of the swinish multitude and laugh at their grunting and complaints historical sketches motives of a king and his ministers in former times for making war for the purpose of overturning a republic it may not be amiss to remind those english readers who are in the habit of reflecting upon what they read that when charles the second and his cabal—clifford arlington buckingham ashley lauderdale—were determined to overthrow the liberties of the people and establish despotic power upon their ruins they thought it necessary as a preliminary measure to enter into a grand alliance with several continental despots for the overthrow of the republic of holland a war with that then and now once more free republic was accordingly entered upon under a variety of frivolous and ridiculous pretences almost as unimportant to the people of england as the navigation of the scheld with a view not only to counteract those poisonous principles which the good understanding between the dutch and english people was    supposed to disseminate and encourage but also to furnish charles and his ministers with a plausible reason for encreasing the military establishment which they believed when once properly set on foot under what pretence soever might be turned to any use they thought fit and rendered the instrument of enslaving those very people who had already been oppressed with taxes for their support that i may obviate the abusive answers of treasury scribblers and prove that this representation is not the mere invention of jacobinism i shall present the reader with the following extracts from rapin after this view of the state of the english court it is easy to conceive that those who had most credit and access to the king could hardly intend the benefit of the kingdom every one of his most intimate counsellors would have been glad to see the king absolute that he might have at his command the whole riches of england to lavish upon them—but on the other hand the king thought himself obliged to proceed circumspectly the example of his father not permitting him to engage in the same course before he had taken greater precautions this was the reason that for some years the court projects were executed gradually and with great dissimulation notwithstanding the warm temper of the duke of york and the eagerness of the papists—rap hist of eng vol   p     after delineating the characters of the cabal rapin thus pursues the subject if to these five members of the cabal are joined as in reason they ought the king and the duke of york it will be found that all the seven were for absolute and arbitrary government and that with regard to religion four were papists and three without any religion or at least they considered it only as an engine of state—the usual opinion of ministers rulers and potentates in all ages and countries of the world it would be difficult to know the transactions of the cabal if father oleans a roman catholic historian and advocate for despotism instructed by king james ii had not told us that a war with holland was there resolved in order to furnish the king with a pretence to keep on foot both land and sea forces for it is manifest that such a design could be accomplished but by force at sea the pretence for this war was to be taken from the dispute about the flag c but adds father orleans the true reason for making this war upon holland was the secret correspondence between the republicans of england    and the dutch who were incessantly exciting them to rebellion and to shake off the yoke of monarchy being ever ready to support those that should attack it this continues rapin seems to contradict what the same author advances a few lines before namely that the true ground of this war was to furnish the king with a pretence for raising an army it must be considered however that the design of the king and the cabal concerned two points which went hand in hand and formed properly but one design namely to introduce an arbitrary government and to extirpate the protestant religion as it could not then be expected that the english would tamely give up their religion and liberty without resistance it was natural to begin with depriving them of the only assistance they could hope for by attacking the dutch and disabling them to succour england those therefore who are called by father orleans the republicans of england were the persons who it was supposed would oppose the kings designs as well episcopalians and presbyterians as the republicans properly so called just as the advocates of ministerial usurpation in the present day confound under the general name of jacobines every man who has the courage and virtue to oppose the ruinous measures and alarming encroachments of the prevailing faction to this it may not be improper to add that the dutch republic aware of the designs of charles and his ministers endeavoured to avert the calamities of war by negociation but which was rendered abortive by the intrigues and insolence of the british cabinet they were determined upon war their projects at home were not to be carried on without it tax on hair powder from the lecture on the budget there is one tax proposed by our enlightened premiere that gives me great pleasure i mean the tax upon that luxury with which people choose to furnish the outside of their upper stores a fashion which originated we are told  0 with two dull and miserable mountebanks at a public fair in france and who having racked their stupid imaginations in vain to excite the laughter of their gaping auditors at last frizzled up their hair in a phantastic manner and plaistered it over with flour and grease the conceit pleased and fashion ever fond of absurdities carried the fooleries of a brace of low buffoons into the court of a great monarch there is a particular reason why i approve of this tax i think it is the most democratic thing that has been thought of for a long time so much so that it almost leads one to think there is some truth in the assertion that the measures of the present minister are in reality intended to promote that spirit of democracy which he pretends to be so anxious to suppress at any rate it is one of those taxes which i think every real friend to the happiness and welfare of mankind will reflect a little before he pays and i will tell you why much as i am attached to that manly simplicity which the worthies of the ancient world displayed superior as i think the roman or the grecian head superior as i think the simple habits of antiquity to the phantastical absurdities of modern dress simplicity is not the only object of consideration what is this superfluous ornament what is it produced from would not that which you suppose decorates but which i think most ridiculously disguises you contribute towards the support of those who find it so difficult to procure subsistence at this period are you not wasting at any rate in unnecessary ornament that which might feed the hungry and sustain the weary suppose for example every individual wearing this superfluous ornament instead of wearing it were to distribute its real value in bread to the hungry poor and put the superfluous price which he pays for the spoiling of this flour into his pocket let me ask if he might not find plenty of indigent individuals by relieving whom he could purchase for himself a more noble satisfaction than this paltry superfluity can afford then citizens there is another point of view in which it is to be considered every guinea paid for this tax goes to prolong the present war the less productive the taxes the sooner you must have peace for if the speculations with respect to finance fail the sinews of the war are gone well then will you pay your guineas towards the abolition of freedom in france—do not be frightened citizens i think i may venture to promise you that the ghost of french freedom    will never haunt your pillows you may try to do it if you will but if i have any portion of that divine inspiration which mr brothers possesses in such miraculous abundance i will venture to prophesy that so desirable a thing as the restoration of the old despotism in france never will be effected either by english arms or english gold the question therefore is not whether you will abolish the freedom of france but whether you will prolong the groans and sufferings of your own country if you believe that the prolongation of this war is only a prolongation of the calamities of britain then i think it is fair and honest for every man by every mean that has no connection with hostility no violence no turbulence to throw every impediment he can in the way of the prosecution of the war which he believes to be unjust cruel and destructive well then suppose i should tell you a way by which you may dispose of your guinea better and be four or five guineas a year richer in consequence of this tax the generality of those who have their hair dressed pay i believe about five or six guineas a year for dressing it i am putting the aristocrats out of the question who pay half a guinea a time i say nothing to them because i know they will not pay attention to my argument——well then citizens there are at this time languishing in cells and dungeons upon charges of high treason and such charges of high treason citizen john martin for he is still in confinement without any provision whatever where he has not even an apartment allowed him nor coals to keep him warm but what he procures by that charity which the tears of his wife may obtain from the casual humanity of strangers there is also poor smith i pretend not to prejudge whether he is guilty or innocent i tell you only the fact i have my opinion and always had from the first—but citizens there is this man also lying in an unwholesome dungeon in newgate where he is i believe at this time expiring of the disease he has there contracted and he has a numerous family without any means of support—his own support is taken from him in consequence of his confinement and the sale of a sew little penny and halfpenny pamphlets in a little shop the corner of portsmouthstreet is the only resource of his wife and family he has twice applied to men too great for me to name for medical assistance in his disease and has procured no answer—he has since been removed to an apartment less miserable and had medical advice    there is a citizen le maitre whose spirited and sensible examination appeared some months ago in the morning post locked up in a place by some called the bastille and as bastille means nothing but a place of solitary confinement i shall not quarrel with the name—there is also a citizen higgins in confinement upon the same sort of charge and there are other patriots in confinement under charges of sedition though neither the lawyers themselves nor the devil their great coadjutor could ever tell what sedition meant there they lie languishing without the necessaries of life now suppose every patriotic individual who intended to pay a guinea for dressing his hair was to leave off that superfluity and pay that guinea in some generous subscription not for their relief that would be something like high treason perhaps but for the relief of their wives and families you will then have done an act of benevolence which i believe your hearts would reflect upon with pleasure and be four or five guineas a year in pocket into the bargain the following speeches in the debate upon the powder tax contain information of so important a nature that every individual appears to be called upon to disseminate them as widely as possible unless indeed we admit the doctrine of the chancellor of the exchequer that the people ought to be kept in ignorance of their own situation as the speeches are copied from that violent ministerial paper the times there can be no room to suspect exaggeration in the statement mr dent said that instead of exempting the army from the powder tax he had hoped the honourable gentleman would have prohibited them the use of powder or rather flour for as powder was   d per pound and flour but  d they would consequently use flour the army of great britain at this time was   0000 men and allowing a pound a week each man made    00000 pounds annually the consumption of the best wheat also in starch from which powder is made amounted to    00 quarters if his information was correct a great quantity was consumed in the heads of servants as he believed most of their powder came from the drudger boxes in their masters kitchens at this time the country was not abundant in wheat the crops had failed and the prospect of the next    harvest was not very cheering from the late rains and bad weather much mischief was to be apprehended and at the same time we could not gain any stores from poland which heretofore had been used to supply us with wheat add to this that the french were our competitors in other markets and consequently lessened the import into this country he had also been informed probably the chancellor of the exchequer knew it also that there was not sufficient corn in this country to last beyond july at which time  0000 quarters were expected from canada the situation of the poor was at this time to be deplored they paid ninepence for a quartern loaf which a short time back cost only sixpence and this perhaps from wages of a shilling per day meat they never could get at its present price and even scarcely a sufficiency of bread alone with all these circumstances under his eyes he had hoped the honourable gentleman would have prohibited the use of flour in the dress of the army for at least a year mr pitt objected to the irregularity of this conversation he thought it dangerous in the extreme and would tend to excite commotions if those statements were to be disseminated he denied any knowledge of such a scarcity of corn prevailing the following little article copied from the telegraph as the calculations are more particular will place the propriety of wearing hair powder in a still clearer point of view and as the facts are unquestionable it is hoped that no friend to the oppressed and indigent orders of society will longer disguise himself with that ridiculous ornament the military force of great britain including foot horse militias fencibles c in england scotland ireland and elsewhere amounts to about   0000 men each of whom is supposed to waste upon his head a pound of flour per week   0000lbs a week make no less than   00 tons weight a year—a quantity of flour sufficient to make three millions fiftynine thousand three hundred and fiftythree quartern loaves and to supply  0000 people with bread for twelve months this calculation proves what a good effect the total abolition of the use of hair powder might have upon the price of bread but when you add to the above a calculation of the flour which will be used by persons privileged under the new    tax whose numbers cannot be fewer than  00000 it will then be found that there are   0000lbs of flour used per week for the hair which would make in a year    00 tons or nine millions four hundred and eighteen thousand and fiftynine quartern loaves a quantity of bread sufficient for the use of one hundred and fifty thousand men women and children from the above statement we are authorised to say that it would be more for the honour of our legislature and the benefit of the nation to prohibit the use of flour or powder for the hair altogether than to lay a partial tax upon those who use it for the purpose of prolonging a war which has been too long continued and the effects of which the people of this country so severely feel who after reading these facts can do otherwise than admire that honest and respectable member of the house of commons john martin who with every grain of powder combed out of his head stood up and after vindicating the dignified simplicity of the human form in opposition to the ridiculous foppery of fashion declared that though as a measure intended to support the war he reprobated the tax yet as a means of preventing the unnecessary consumption of flour at a time of such alarming scarcity it had his hearty concurrence and support there is another circumstance relative to this interesting subject which deserves some enquiry it is reported upon pretty good authority that an american merchant waited upon a certain great oeconomist and calculator and informed him that he could supply him with a large quantity of corn at a given price but he was answered with great hauteur that no corn was wanted in the country that rumours of scarcity had been artfully spread abroad for the purpose of enabling merchants to be extravagant in their demands but that the country was in reality very well supplied this however was nothing more than one of those commercial tricks very common between traders when they wish to beat one another down in their prices and which the calculator had learned from having been for the last twelve or thirteen years chief managing clerk in a very great countinghouse for shortly after he sent a message to the    merchant that he should be glad to have the corn on the terms proposed but   if you will not when you may   when you would you must have nay the corn was already disposed of to the agent of foreign country and in all probability may ultimately find its way into the ports of france no person surely will blame an agent for making as good a bargain as he can for his employers but while millions upon millions are lavishing away—while so large a portion of the public revenue is swallowed up by placemen and pensioners—and when the wicked and ridiculous project of starving the people of france has brought our own nation to the very brink of famine ought the subsistence of millions of people to be thus coquetted with that a selfopiniated arithmetician—an official adept in the rule of three—may have a chance of boasting that he can outwit the jews of change alley at a bargain narrative of the proceedings of the messenger c on the seizure of j thelwalls papers with his examination before the privy council treatment at the messengers c early in the morning of monday the   th of may last citizen hardy was apprehended and his papers seized by warrant from the principal secretary of state for the home department it is unnecessary to dwell upon the circumstances of his arrest they having been already published and disseminated at the same time daniel adams secretary of the constitutional society was also taken into custody together with his papers upon the same authority these circumstances of which i was informed three or four hours after they had taken place did not very much surprise me as i had received very positive information on the friday preceeding that eight warrants for high treason were made out and that the names of hardy richter lovett and myself were among those against whom they were directed after such a confirmation of the truth of my intelligence it was not easy to doubt of its correctness and i was seriously    advised to destroy my papers at least if not to conceal myself i had however some little knowledge of the law of treason and i was clear in my mind upon two points—first that i had never been engaged in any transaction that came within the pale of that offence and secondly that prerogative in england was admitted not to extend to the seizure of papers upon any charge of a less serious nature i took therefore the proper means for summoning an extraordinary meeting of the delegates of the london corresponding society for the ensuing evening and then without troubling my head about my papers spent the day with my family at home and went in the evening to the play on the day following i spent the morning as usual in study dined with a party of friends with whom i was previously engaged and returned home time enough to meet the committee at which the attendance was unusually thronged to this meeting i read and expounded to the best of my ability the law of treason as laid down in blackstones commentaries and compared this with the conduct and case so far as we could be acquainted with it of citizen hardy after which some resolutions were moved by me and after some little debate between richter baxter and myself were unanimously adopted—these resolutions were in substance as follows—  st that it appears to this committee that no person can be legally apprehended and his papers seized in this country but upon a specific charge of high treason  d that as far as this committee is acquainted with the conduct and deportment of citizen hardy there does not appear the slightest foundation for charging him with that crime  d that as far as the conduct of citizen hardy shall be found to be as this committee believes it entirely to have been legal and constitutional we will support him to the utmost of our ability  th that this committee proceed in the most solemn manner to such of the divisions of the london corresponding society as are now sitting to communicate to them the preceeding resolutions and conjure them not to be discouraged or alarmed by the violent proceedings of government but to pursue with unabated ardour the object of their institution in pursuance of this last resolution we rose in a body at a little after eleven oclock to visit such of the divisions as were    then sitting expecting the result of our deliberations the members of the committee c went out before me while i looked into the parlour to inform my family where i was going i was then following to join my comrades but before i got out of the buildings i was met near the door by walsh an itinerant spy and five or six other persons several of whom were wrapped up in great coats c wa mr thelwall i believe offering his hand th the same upon which the rest among whom were tims and schaw the messengers king secretary to dundas and carpmeal one of the bowstreet runners came up tims then sir you are my prisoner tapping me on the shoulder th very well sir you will permit me i suppose to go home and tell my wife and family where i am going and at the same time let me see your warrant tims o yes you may go home sir we accordingly turned back harry eaton let us in and burks one of the members of the committee and now secretary to the society entered with us aad was a very diligent observer of all that passed it was however with some difficulty that i could get permission to enter the parlour where mrs t my mother and a friend were sitting having got in i again demanded sight of the warrant which after much shuffling and delay was brought by schaw tims put it into my hand and i read it aloud observing that i never had the pleasure of seeing one of those pretty things before it purported to authorize the messengers taking with them a constable c to apprehend mr thelwall of beaufort buildings for treasonable practices c th mr blank thelwall—how do i know this is meant for me there is another mr thelwall the warrant ought to specify the name i might also have objected to the competency of the charge the law being explicit that the specific treason must be charged in the warrant tims you are mr thelwall of beaufort buildings i suppose—there is no other mr thelwall of beaufort buildings is there—now sir give me your keys for i must have all your papers t i have no keys—which was true tims then sir i must break open your drawers t you must execute your warrant but take care you    do not exceed it nor do any wanton injury to my furniture i tell you truly i have no keys—i make use of none they then rummaged all my pockets—tims took my pocketbook and carpmeal took my penknife about the indignity of this personal search i remonstrated but in vain upon my person nothing was found but a few memorandums of a private nature which tims put in his pocket he then began to rummage the drawers in the parlour where he found two or three printed lectures some lecture tickets and some impressions of the portrait of margarot which he put into his pocket they were then some of them going to other parts of the house t wherever you go i insist that i may go with you to see what you take and that you do not exceed your warrant with this they at first made a shew of compliance taking me all over the front house where nothing was found there being in reality nothing to find as they went up to the back house there was a great knocking they refusing to permit the door to be opened we supposed as was the case that it was the wife of the friend who happened to be in the house with my family and i desired that she might be informed from the window the reason why she could not be let in tims upon this immediately insisted that a coach should be called and that i should be carried away—a coach was called accordingly and tims carpmeal and walsh took me off tims having first informed my wife that she and the child might come and see me but not a soul besides h eaton shall i let citizen bonney know where you are t certainly the word citizen put the messenger in a rage and i was hurried into the coach the window was down and baxter and two or three more came up to the side of the coach baxter god bless you my dear fellow putting up his hand t and you my good fellow shaking hands do not be intimidated for i assure you i am not baxter where are you going t to tims the messengers in crownstreet westminster by this time the messenger c had got into the coach and with great ill humour and alarm pulled up the windows and ordered the coachman to drive off tims talked    about political occurrences and i requested him to drop the subject saying that situated as we were it was improper that we might find plenty of topics to amuse ourselves with and spend our time pleasantly together but politics i must beg leave to decline to the propriety of this he readily assented—i forget whether this was in the coach or at the secretary of states office five or six people positively not more running after the coach the messenger pretended to be afraid to go home so they took me to the secretary of states office in downingstreet where i was detained a couple of hours at least and given to understand that i should stay all night during this time a tall thinish man a little pockfretten i think and rather sallow in his complexion who was treated by all present with great submission and who i since understand to have been a very great man in the diplomatic world came into the back office where i was lord—— what he is here is he tims this is mr thelwall sir i was obliged to bring him here for there were so many people running after him that i did not dare to carry him to my own house lord—— aye aye this is a proper place for men who have a parcel of people at their heels t turning round and looking up at him without uncovering pray sir what is your name—may i ask lord—— my name is a matter of no consequence t certainly only i wish to know who i am indebted to for this very obliging remark lord—— i only mean to say that men who have a heap of people running after them are best in a place of security t it is a crime then to be popular his lordship stalked away and i turned on my heel repeating   the man resolved and firmly just   adheres unshaken to his trust   tho storms and tempests round him roll   unmovd will stand his dauntless soul   nor would the wreck his mind appall   should the whole world to swift destruction fall one of the attendauts aye aye that may be said in a great many different cases t true and happy is he who can apply it justly pray who was that gentleman  0 tims we cannot answer that question that is a person of very great consequence t so i perceive it was now between twelve and one oclock i had made no supper and began to be very hungry t pray am i to be kept here all night without any supper—if i had the secretary of state in my custody i would give him something to eat at least apologies were made for the delay and after waiting about an hour longer a proper guard having been provided to allay the fears of the messenger who seemed very uneasy at having such a wild beast as a jacobine to take care of i was at last conducted down stone staircases and along endless passages into crownstreet and immediately to the place of my temporary destination some of the persons present seem to have been very expeditious in giving an imperfect account of the conversation with the person of very great consequence for the next day it was reported in one of the papers that being taken before the secretary of state i treated him en cavalier and kept my hat on as denying his authority sect ii narrative of the procedings of the messenger and his attendants relative to the seizure of papers c tims having thus in spite of my remonstrance taken me away before my papers were seized the house was left to the dominion of schaw the other messenger king private secretary to dundas and some bowstreet runners their coadjutors here they remained till four or five oclock the next morning nor was ever a more indiscriminate pillage committed under colour of legal authority if legal it could be called than that to which my house was subjected they did not indeed absolutely take the furniture of my rooms the cumbrous old fashioned lumber which satisfies the wishes because it administers to the necessary accommodation of a democrat would hardly have rewarded them for the trouble of procuring waggons to carry it away but every manuscript was seized upon whatever subject—poems novels dramas literary and philosophical dissertations all the unpublished labours of ten years application—successful or abortive it matters not—they were the fruits—the creations of my own industry and therefore were more absolutely    my property than the estate of the landed gentleman or the stock in trade of the manufacturer whether they are worth sixpence or six thousand pounds is of no importance if such plunder is to be countenanced by the mandates of a secretary of state what intellect will be active what property can be secure it is difficult to conceive how the members of any government can have the assurance to talk about the protection of property and yet refuse to restore the plunder thus impudently seized by their own officers and under the colour of their authority but they did not stop at manuscripts some hundred copies of my publications were also seized—some of which were on subjects the most distant from politics and from no one of which did they think fit to quote a single passage in crimination of me and thus at a time when my family could receive no support whatever from my exertions were they deprived of the only resource that could any way supply the deficiency—the sale of my former labours but if the indiscriminate plunder of manuscripts and publications appear a wanton stretch of authority what shall we say to their seizing upon a considerable part of my library as even the catalogue of my books has been stolen by these executioners of the mandates of the privy council it is impossible for me to state the whole of my loss but among the books of considerable value which i have thus lost are godwins political justice and darwins elegant poem the botanic garden two books to replace which alone the reader will recollect will cost me near four pounds to this catalogue of robberies i must add a very large collection of copperplates—consisting of three volumes of book prints—portraits historical pictures and landscapes together with several loose prints of different value and a fine proof impression of sharpes folio portrait of thomas paine these effects were taken away in three or four coaches and that they might preserve them entire for their new proprietors they made free also with a trunk and several green cloths that covered my tables to pack them up in the pictures were in the study in my back house all but some portraits of margarot which were in my front parlour i had reason to know where the others were for i had on the very day of my arrest bought some new plates and added them to the collection the print of thomas paine was between the leaves of johnsons folio dictionary where also mr schaw or his coadjutors must have found the unsent    unfinished letter to allum of america which tims who was not present when it was found swore upon my trial that he found in the pocket of richter sect iii examination before the privy council c the next day i was brought before the pivy council and while i was waiting in the antichamber i saw tims take a parcel of loose papers out of his pocket from which he selected my pocket book and a few other articles with which he went into one of the adjoining offices and shortly returned with them tied up with a piece of tape or string i forget which and with a pen in his mouth—in the course of this narrative i shall relate some other circumstances of the careful and orderly conduct of this being upon whose oath it was thought fit that the lives of britons should depend when i first went into the privy council it appears that my conductor had not been cautious enough in waiting for his cue the actors indeed were all assembled but the machinery was not ready and after much bustle and confusion i was ordered to withdraw awhile in about a quarter of an hour i was called in again and beheld the whole dramatis personæ intrenched chin deep in lectures and manuscripts some mine and some not all scattered about in the utmost confusion the chancellor was sitting at the far end of the room dundas near the door and pitt was standing at the far side of the table behind the persons who were seated there as there was more stage effect than dialogue in this scene i shall endeavour to preserve the spirit of it by marking in italics the passions and gesticulations of the actors attorney general piano mr thelwall what is your christian name t somewhat sullenly john att gen piano still how do you spell your name with two ls at the end or with one t with two—but it does not signify—— att gen interrupting with two do you say t with two—but it does not signify carelessly but rather sullen or so you need not give yourself any trouble i do not mean to answer any questions pitt what does he say darting round very fiercely from the other side of the room and seating himself by the side of the chancellor    lord chancellor with silver softness almost melting to a whisper he does not mean to answer any questions pitt what is it—what is it—what fiercely att gen he says he does not mean to answer any questions pitt after a pause abruptly he had better consider of it—he had better take time and consider of it—give him a little time att gen mildly mr thelwall you had better consider t i have considered and i shall answer no questions you need not give yourselves any trouble i shall not answer att gen with great assumed politeness and humility it is no trouble mr thelwall it is my duty to ask you you live in beaufort buildings i think i made no answer but kept my eye upon the chancellor and pitt lord chancellor in a half whisper in the ear of pitt he wont answer pitt after a pause with a mixture of petulance and embarrassment he dont know whats again him—better let him see whats against him here reaching across the table here let him see this paper shew him this paper vide the second rep sec com h of commons debretts edit p    and   —now mr thelwall do you know you are apprehended for treasonable practices and that this paper was found upon you i made no answer it was a paper rejected by myself and all the committee to whom it was referred but i did not chuse to fix it upon the person it originated with att gen do you know any thing of that paper mr thelwall i made no answer pitt very petulantly read it to him let it be read it was read accordingly pitt keeping his eye upon me with great fierceness of deportment now mr thelwall it behoves you to account how that paper came to be in your possession i was not of the same opinion and therefore made no answer att gen mr thelwall can you tell how you came by that paper    t i am bold in the consciousness of innocence but i shall answer no questions pitt whats that—whats that to the chancellor chancellor half whispering in pitts ear he says he is bold in the consciousness of innocence but he will answer no questions pitt fidgetting about upon his seat his lip quivering and his whole countenance convulsed with rage a strange reason that for answering no questions mr thelwall—a strange reason being bold in conscious innocence—a strange reason for not answering th if i answer this you will expect me to answer other questions and it is no part of the law or constitution of this country to answer interrogatories to a privy council lord chancellor very gravely you do not come here to answer to the laws and constitution of your country mr thelwall i ought to have asked what a briton should answer to but the laws and constitution of his country but the fact is i was a little sulky and did not think of it pitt what was that—what was that lord chancellor with his usual softness he says it is no part of the law or constitution of this country to answer interrogatories—i tell him he does not come here to answer to the laws and constitution of his country att gen were you at chalk farm mr thelwall i made him no reply but shook my head and laid my finger on my lips att gen were you at the meeting at chalk farm i made no answer the question was put to me again and i turned round and began to contemplate a drawing in watercolours of a ship that hangs over the fire place att gen he wont answer lord chancellor as usual in pitts ear no its of no use he wont answer pitt dont ask him any more questions then—dont ask him any more its only putting him on his guard mr thelwall you may withdraw exit t cetera desunt the scene was now shifted again to the lobby—what passed therefore among the great actors behind the curtain i cannot exactly say a great deal however appeared to be transacting around me in dumb shew and among the rest i observed that king the secretary of dundas took my keeper    tims aside and appeared to give him some instructions with great emphasis of gesticulation from the deportment of the privy council towards me in which certainly i had observed very little that according to my judgment was consistent either with good manners or humanity and from the manner in which i had treated their questions which certainly was not very likely to conciliate them it immediately occurred to me that the dirty vexatious spirit of revenge by which little minds in great situations are generally directed had prompted them to order that my wife and infant should be permitted to visit me no more—this suspicion was shortly confirmed—mrs t brought my little babe to see me the next day but was turned from the door with the heartrending intelligence that neither of them could be permitted to enter the same day   th may henry eaton who had lived with me ever since i had been in beaufort buildings was taken before the privy council and examined the spirit and shrewdness of this boy were highly creditable both to his heart and understanding and i should be wanting in justice if i omitted this opportunity of acknowledging the fidelity of a youth whose unrewarded services during the whole time he lived with me had no other stimulus than zeal and disinterested attachment on the present occasion this zeal and attachment assisted by a courage and presence of mind uncommon at his years were particularly useful for in spite of philosophy the husband and the father still cling to my heart and to be debarred entirely the conversation of one with whom affection not the laws was the bond of union and to be forbidden the sight of the little innocent which almost from its birth had been regularly the first object to which i turned my waking eyes was far more painful than all the rigour of a jealous imprisonment an account of this boys examination as far as his memory could retain it was printed the next or succeeding day in the morning post a paper which from the first of our presecution to the last had the spirit and virtue to vindicate our cause in the most direct manner the reader may perhaps be pleased to see this specimen of youthful firmness preserved form that immediate oblivion which is the fate of newspaper compositions it is therefore here inserted some difficulty having interfered as to the procuring the paper in which the examination is contained it is unavoidably deferred till the next number    political maxims c—from merciers fragments of politics and history destructive vices—the internal vices which prey on a great state are the wasteful expenditure of the public money immoderate gifts and gratuities and a nonobservance of the laws on the part of the governors if the military body exhausts the treasury if the nobility are prodigal in their claims if the great have the address do obtain a peculiar justice for themselves then to these mischiefs become so many incurable wounds which impair the strength of a fine kingdom and destroy the admirable efforts of brilliant enthusiasm and heroical valour augustus maintained forty legions for twelve millions of livres half a million sterling a year his secret has been lost the worst kings are those who have dissipated the most because they have held in their hands the public money vol   page    reform—it is easy to perceive whether the government tends to despotism by appreciating the repugnance of the sovereign or his ministers to a reform of the civil laws it is impossible that these laws when improved should not favour that natural right the very name of which terrifies administrators of a despotic state page  0 stretches of authority—an ill guided authority undertakes more than it can execute this is the rock on which governments split when not knowing themselves or rather wilfully misunderstanding their boundaries they aim at the extension of the latter by a natural but dangerous propensity page    patriotism—the love of the country recommended as a moral virtue is a chimerical command provided the citizen is not attached to that country by the security ease and prosperity he finds in it it is a romantic sentiment when it hinges solely on the transitory glory of a monarch the love of the country and that of the laws of the country are two distinct objects the author might have added and the love of principle is different from both the fact that principles not spots of earth ought to be the objects of our attachment the spirit and virtue of the people not the dead letter of the law the love of the country may be injurious to the love of humanity in the same way that selflove may be detrimental to generosity page  0    the tribune no v saturday   th april      the british cabinet the first authors and supporters of the present war—from the second lecture on war citizens the magnitude of the subject upon which i have been treating the two previous evenings and which i am to consider in a more homefelt point of view on the present evening is such that i am well aware it would call for all the powers and faculties of the most intelligent mind to do it justice it will however sometimes happen that when we wish to exert ourselves most those accidents to which all human life is liable will render us less able to make use of those exertions and i should not be at all surprised if many have been disappointed in the manner in which the subject has been treated the fact is that domestic calamity weighs down the spirits of your lecturer during that long confinement which i have endured an aged and feeble parent racked with all the anxieties and anguish which a fond mother must inevitably feel under such circumstances received a considerable degree of injury in her health from which she has not yet recovered and i have been and still am in considerable danger of losing that great comfort of my life this is one additional instance of the omnipotency of that system or conspiracy of oppression spies perjury and inquisitorial persecution under which this devoted country groans however standing in this situation i know how far it is my duty and shall endeavour as much as i can to rise superior to individual feelings and devote myself to to the cause of the public in whose behalf i here stand up an humble advocate i shall therefore without further apology resume the subject of my lecture the particular object of the lecture this evening is to investigate the pretexts for entering into the present war and the pretences for refusing to negociate a treaty of peace    i shall in the first place citizens endeavour to shew you that it is peculiarly the duty of england to restore to europe that peace and tranquillity of which it is at present so universally deprived because in reality it was england or rather the ministry of england that plunged europe into the present war i shall endeavour to shew you this from a variety of facts and arguments which if they have the same influence upon your minds that they have upon mine will undoubtedly produce a complete conviction however i ought frequently to repeat that you are not to suppose yourselves convinced because the person you listen to shews his own conviction consider i pray you all that comes from this place and from any other place whatever as the materials only upon which your own understandings are to work and upon which your own judgments are to be formed for that country is very far removed from the capability of liberty or virtue which is in the habit of taking any thing for granted on account of the individual from whom it comes citizens there are particular circumstances that induce me to suspect that even at the treaty of pilnitz the cabinet of this country was by no means inactive it is not uncommon i believe when conventions of sovereigns or representatives of sovereigns assemble to hold and preserve in just equipoise the mysterious balance of power in europe that individuals who appear not at all concerned should be the prime actors standing behind the curtain and dictating to the diplomatic puppets who assemble under other pretences to do their work of darkness and if it should be found that after the treaty of pilnitz the language of the powers who formed that fatal alliance—an alliance they were ashamed of which they had neither the assurance nor the honesty to explain if the language i say of those very powers when engaged in war with france should be found to correspond with this suspicion and there should be other corroborating circumstances to support these appearances you will have some foundation at least to conceive with me that some of the persons who compose the cabniet of this country were not entirely ignorant of those infamous proceedings i allude in particular to a declaration or memorial which very shortly after the commencement of the war was published by the emperor of germany and in which he declares in the most peremptory terms that all the crowned heads of europe all the principal courts had determined and agreed to restore that system of regularity which jacobinism had overthrown in france    now citizens you may perhaps remember that in consequence of this declaration very severe animadversions were made by very respectable individuals in this country that appeal after appeal was made to the minister and even in the house of commons very strong and pressing questions were put to the administration relative to the truth or falshood of this assertion as far as it affected britain and if it shall be found after all that the minister being pressed in the most direct manner did not think fit to deny the charge that will be an additional reason to suppose there was some intercourse between great persons in this country and other great persons who were the ostensible actors in those infernal rites—that though the hags of austria and prussia and other continental despots alone were seen dancing round the cauldron in which the miseries of europe were brewed yet the prompting hecate—   the real mistress of their charms   the close contriver of all harms was to be found hurling her infernal spells and incantations through the air from a little distant solitary island and enjoying in supposed security the storm her arts were brewing here it was that the directing dæmon enveloped in fogs and darkness sat brooding over the incipient mischief and enjoying in supposed security the approaching convulsion citizens if we consider what has been the conduct of the british cabinet ever since the mask was thrown off and the hostile intentions of that cabinet publicly declared we shall be still further confirmed in the suspicion i have suggested—if we should find that not only all the powers of europe have shewn to the world that they considered england the principal mover of the war and if also it should be found that the conduct of the british cabinet has supported and confirmed this opinion—has done that which must have been its conduct if this were truly and really the case no rational doubt can remain whether the statement be true or not now citizens let us examine what are the interests and what has been the conduct of the respective powers some of whom are nominally and some of whom have been actually engaged in this royal federation against the liberties of france let us for example consider what interest russia could have to enter into any alliance relative to the opinions proceedings and conduct of the french nation every citizen at all acquainted with geography knows that russia is so considerably  00 remote from france that in this respect there was no very immediate danger of the eruption of french principles into the empire of russia we know also that such is the miserable state of ignorance and barbarity in which the inhabitants of russia are plunged that those hordes of martial savages are totally incapable of comprehending any thing that can be called principles in any nation or set of men whatever it cannot be forgotten that apprehensive of some struggles between the great boyars or nobles and the regular government of russia an attempt was made by the empress to emancipate the peasantry from that state of slavery under which at this time they live the boyars and great men domineering over them and treating them no better than west india slaves yet so far were the russians from being likely to be affected by the jacobinical principles of freedom that they were very nearly thrown into a state of insurrection their ignorance and the influence of their hereditary drivers leading them to suppose that freedom even in the smallest proportion was one of the most horrible calamities that could fall upon them therefore whatever pretensions she may have to religion however enamoured she may be with humanity—let the breathless corse of a strangled husband—let the massacres of ismael—let the horrid and depopulating cruelties lately acted at warsaw teach you with firm conviction how zealous she is to promote the real cause of human happiness—and with what pious detestation she views the excesses committed by the jacobins of france i say citizens that however attached to the principles of religion and humanity this good woman may be yet it is very evident she could have no terror of the irruption of french principles into her country she could have no fear that her savage hordes would be affected with the dangerous and anarchic principles that disseminated themselves in other countries and as interest is the known and avowed actuating principle of sovereigns in their alliances as this is to be considered the primum mobile of royal proceedings friendship and cooperation—we cannot be much inclined to suspect that the empress of russia ever had any great inclination to disturb the progress of the french and administer to the views of this country against whom she has by so many evident symptoms betrayed her animosity and whose officious and bullying interference so lately irritated her pride and impotently endeavoured to thwart her ambition  0  then citizens let us consider also the situation and connections of prussia and though perhaps in the capital of berlin the principles of philosophy may have been speculatively diffused in a considerable degree and the feelings of liberty may have been consequently a little disseminated we shall find that the military despotism of prussia had but little to fear from the irruption of french principles and considering the situation of the country nothing could have a greater tendency towards it than the act of engaging in hostilities with france but if we consider also the great interest the king of prussia must necessarily have felt instead of assisting to check the ambition of the emperor if we consider that every thing that tended to the diminution of the power of france must have had a considerable tendency to increase the power of the german empire and if we consider also that the history of the last half century proves that the favourite policy of prussia has been to pull down the pride of austria it cannot be very much supposed that prussia ever felt an original interest in this alliance of kings against french republicanism citizens with respect to austria i believe there is considerable reason to doubt also whether she would have felt so determined an interest as without the stimulus of british logic would have induced her to come forward in the present alliance for though it is true relative connection had attached the interests of the house of austria with those of the house of bourbon yet as certain situations have a tendency to elevate men above the vulgar prejudices of social affection we shall be inclined to think the sorrows of marie antoinette would not alone have induced the emperor to plunge into war with an enemy so powerful when his resources were already so considerably drained by those wars from which he was scarcely extricated—particularly his war against the turks but let us not only consider what have been speculatively the views but what has been the conduct of the powers in alliance it is very well known that russia agreed to assist the english with   000 men for an invasion of the french coast and to attempt thereby the restoration of that order and humanity to which her imperial majesty is so considerably attached but citizens though this engagement was nominally made by the empress we have not yet heard of the fulfilment of the promise she pious arbitress of the fate of  0  europe is too good a friend to the established system of regular government and the rules of diplomatic faith to withold her name from any instrument that might induce the powers of europe to plunge into scenes of hostility by which she might be eventually benefited but however willing she might be to assist the alliance with   000 men upon paper yet we find that she was not equally anxious to bring them into the field that was quite another thing nay citizens we find very shortly after by references to state papers and other authentic records we shall find a memorial presented by her to the british cabinet in which she treated with derision the idea that the minister could suppose her serious in her promise and giving him to understand that he could not expect her to fulfil such promise at a time when she was incompetent to fulfil even her engagements to the house of austria in short she gave our cabinet to understand pretty plainly that it would be impossible for her to bring a large army into the field without the assistance of a considerable subsidy it is true this proposal was never complied with it is true that the chevalier whitworth who was the agent in this instance was not successful in this negociation but yet the overture sufficiently shews you what the views of russia were and who the empress looked upon as the mainspring and engine in the alliance into which she had nominally entered but if subsidy was only talked of by russia with other nations it came to something more than words and though the assistance lent towards this project by the king of prussia has not been much more serious than that afforded by the empress yet the money we have been obliged to raise in fulfilment of our part of the engagement with that potentate compel us to look upon him as much more serious in the business yet he could not possibly send an army into the field without the assistance of who of the emperor of germany or any of the continental powers no it was to england he looked for the subsidy england guaranteed the payment or the whole and though holland was pledged to pay a small part whether the stadtholder has ever yet fulfilled the engagement we have not been told if not though the treasures of the stadtholder have been removed from the stadthouse to england i believe we shall find ourselves obliged to make the payments for which he was pledged indeed the portion was but small for which holland was nominally  0  pledged—and it was evidently nothing but a nominal pledge a little dust thrown into the eyes of john bull to prevent him from seeing the whole burden that was thrown upon his shoulders the other continental powers do not seem to have been deficient in the same faculty of discernment and therefore it is that the king of sardinia has thought fit not to defend his own dominions without receiving  00000l a year from the treasury of great britain which may stand in place of  00000 weighty arguments to prove who is the real provoker of the present war and who is to pay the piper in this dance of death now exhibiting on all the theatres of europe good examples are sometimes imitated by the higher from the lower orders and the eagle of austria having seen the sardinian and hessian crows so comfortably provided for from the fat paunch of john bull wetted his beak also and had a mind to see whether he could not pick a few of the brains out of the head of the passive brute austria began to consider herself as one of the auxiliaries of this federation she began to talk of treaties of peace to hold out threats of negociation to our cabinet and to pretend to withdraw from the alliance not that it is readily to be believed that the emperor had at that time any serious intention of deserting the alliance this was perhaps only one of those coquettish artifices so common in the negotiations of monarchs and prostitutes when either the former or the latter wish to increase the price of their favours this threat or insinuation led the way to those overtures which were at first distantly hinted by the great and magnanimous colonel mack and afterwards more directly proposed by other agents of the imperial court citizens we must know i conceive if we consider the general conduct of that power that the addition of bavaria to the hereditary dominions of the emperor has long been one of the grand objects in the contemplation of that high and mighty potentate i shall perhaps towards the close of the lecture shew you how he is likely to accomplish that object however it was now talked of that the low countries were to be abandoned and bavaria taken in exchange a measure which could not but be eminently offensive to the british cabinet whose minister in the open senate had most directly arrogated to himself the right and determination to arbitrate the fate of brabant and declared that it was equally hostile to his plan for the adjustment of the ballance of europe that those provinces should be added to the french republic  0  or formed into an independent state in other words that it was his determination that so long as he was minister of britain no country whatever should arrogate to itself the crown of corsica was not dreamt of then the right of chusing its own government in this manner the jealousy of the court of st jamess was awakened for though courts cannot love they can be jealous—an inducement was held out to our minister to purchase at any rate the cooperation of his dear and valuable ally and the plot succeeded promises of important assistance attended by weighty proofs of their sincerity were made to the emperor to induce him to defend his government in the low countries and resist for a while the jacobinical principles that had diffused themselves among the brabanters the conduct of spain and naples has not been less equivocal we have seen a great reluctance on the part of spain from the very first to this alliance and even to the very last that court has never entered with any sort of vigour into the prosecution of the war till the irresistable arms of the republic brought it home to their own doors naples we know kept aloof till it was compelled by the fleets of britain to join the confederacy even after it had pledged its faith—royal faith—the faith of a regular government to remain entirely neutral and acknowledge the french republic citizens we shall presently see that the conviction which appears to be so general among the nations of europe is not entirely absent from the minds of our ministers themselves and that the conduct of the english cabinet has in innumerable instances plainly demonstrated that they also consider themselves as the prime movers and principal in the present war let us for example consider the pressing remonstrances which have been repeatedly made on the part of the british minister to the different powers of europe either to join in the conspiracy or prosecute with more ardour the cause in which with so much lukewarm apathy they had engaged on this account we find remonstrance upon remonstrance accompanied as it were with a burning desire of the honour of subsidizing all europe we find that they have not only with great willingness complied with the desires of prussia and granted a very large subsidy to a monarch who shewed no great inclination to perform any part of the stipulations that of receiving the money alone excepted but that last summer so anxious were the ministers of this country to  0  perpetuate the war and increase the activity of the powers of europe that earl spencer was positively sent with a zeal warm and fresh from the hot bed of alarm and an avidity sharpened by the enthusiasm of recent apostacy to the court of vienna to intreat and solicit the emperor of germany to accept that subsidy for which he had before hinted some little inclination let us consider also the conduct of the british minister towards the neutral powers let us see the anxiety with which he endeavoured to plunge those powers into the war against france who had so determinately kept aloof i have already given you an instance in the kingdom of naples which was dragooned into a war in which it had pledged its honour not to engage i need not call to your minds the transactions at genoa they are fresh in every mans mind in spite of national vanity we cannot contemplate without some degree of contempt the figure great britain made upon that occasion when our bullying fleets blocked up the ports and harbours of that little independent republic and threatened them in vain with the extinction of their commerce if they refused to plunge into that mad havock and desolation in which the other parts of europe were engaged yes we bullied great and mighty britain—the soi disant sovereign of the ocean—the selfconstituted arbitress of europe—the terrestrial destiny who holds in her omnipotent hand the ballance of power and weighs out the fates of nations as she weighs out tea and tobacco in her warehouses—this great and mighty britain bullied the little republic of genoa with one hand offered her a war with france and with the other threatened her with annihilation but the little republic laughed at her big words and the fleets of great britain at length withdrew and confessed her insignificancy to the world denmark and sweden also partook of the threats if they did not partake of the fears which had agitated genoa and we find these two countries at last obliged to lay their subjects under contributions—not for the purpose of plunging them into wars which might be ultimately fatal to their own liberties but to protect them from the power i had like to have said the insolence of those who wished to plunge all other nations into the same calamitous situation into which they had plunged their own the threats of our cabinet were for a while more successful against tuscany it was in vain that fortune had blessed that country with a prince who had some regard for the happiness  0  of the people it was in vain that the reins of power were held by a minister desirous of perpetuating the blessings of peace that prince was to be controlled that minister disgraced nor would the cabinet of britain be satisfied till the minister who thwarted its wishes was dismissed from his office and tuscany plunged in war—a war which but for the generosity of the french republic might have been fatal to that country these are sufficient to prove that the cabinet of england has hitherto considered itself as the principal mover and head of that federation at least it appears to me that the facts are sufficient to build this conclusion upon you will weigh in your own minds how far they are so and give yourselves the trouble i hope to investigate how far the facts are impartially stated the pretences for entering into the present war—from the same citizens i shall next proceed to enquire what are the pretences on the one hand and the real objects on the other in the british cabinet for embarking so deeply in this undertaking and endeavour to shew how far they appear worth the expence the danger and the calamity with which they were to be pursued and purchased we know citizens that the first pretence for engaging in the present war was the protection of holland we were told that the trade of holland which flourished so happily under the auspices of the house of orange that the liberty of dutchmen so considerably confirmed by the honourable proceedings of the stadtholder backed as he was by the fleets of britain and the armies of prussia were in danger from french republicanism we were told that to protect this commerce and these liberties was an inviolable duty which the english ought never to depart from because the dutch were always so extremely anxious to fulfil their part of their treatises with this country—our minister certainly called to mind the very generous conduct of the stadtholder if not of the people of holland during the late american war and the battle off the dogger bank was not forgotten our minister undoubtedly considered that though there have been wars since the sacred and inviolable  0  treaty that was to be made use of as godmother—or grandmother for it was old enough for either to this holy crusade in which the good people of holland seeing that it would be a happy thing for this country that america should be emancipated had taken part against us yet that the treaties old and musty as they were were nevertheless not to be departed from upon our part and that if the scheldt should be opened and the brabanters permitted to navigate their own river that we should be called upon to enter into hostilities to close it up again yet citizens examine either upon the principles of policy or the principles of justice this pretence and see what foundation it will yield for supposing this to be a justifiable reason for plunging the nation into a war by which millions of its inhabitants were to be destroyed and hundreds of millions of its property lavished and expended with respect to policy i should be happy to be informed how it would be worse for this country that the navigation of the scheldt should be free than that it should be monopolized i am well aware that habits have a very considerable influence upon the judgments of mankind and that those persons who have long made the encouragement of monopoly at home a part of their system may wish the same habits to be encouraged abroad without investigating whether that monopoly would be to their advantage or not but citizens laying aside this habitual feeling which the audience are not so much in the habit of cultivating as the persons of whom i am speaking why were the dutch to prevent brabant from navigating her own rivers certainly i should think that all the facts of history tend to support this great truth that the more unrestrained the commerce of any country is the more advantageous it is not only to the inhabitants of that country but to all the inhabitants of all neighbouring nations and of the globe at large that which has been said by a poet of the tender passion is also true of a generous and liberal spirit of commerce—   that free as air at sight of human ties   it spreads its wings and from restriction flies the fact is that a considerable part of the benefits of commerce must necessarily be lost in any country that attempts to put restrictions upon the commercial transactions of its own subjects or the subjects of any other country with which it may keep up an intercourse  0  but according to the principles written in my heart and which i could wish disseminated among all mankind because i believe they are the principles of justice—according to these principles i should suppose it unnecessary to investigate what would have been the particular advantages to this country or what the disadvantages from the navigation of the scheldt because it appears to me that the eternal principles of justice are principles of the soundest policy and that every country wishing to promote its own happiness ought to be jealous of violating those principles which ought to guide and direct the conduct of the whole universe what justice should we then perceive in a similar transaction if any neighbouring power presumed to say the people of britain shall not navigate the river thames holland and austria are allied together and it was agreed between them half a century ago that the whole advantage of the navigation of the thames should be secured to the dutch—or suppose we make a statement nearer to the truth suppose it should be said holland has hitherto monopolized in a degree the fisheries of the british coasts the british coasts have hitherto furnished wealth and sustenance to the inhabitants of holland instead of the inhabitants of britain and the very produce of these coasts have been afterwards sold in scanty proportions at aggravated prices to the people of england and scotland which they ought to have had in abundance from the skill and industry of our own fishermen this suppose it should be said has hitherto resulted not from the blameable negligence and impolitic regulations of the british government but from foreign coercion austria and france we will say have guarranteed by a special treaty the monopoly of the fishery on the british coasts to the dutch nation what would britons should they happen to come to their senses and wish to recover a great part of the advantages of this fishery say to this treaty should we have felt that it was right for austria to declare war against this country to prevent us from recovering that advantage which our ill policy had hitherto neglected should we not spurn at this attempt of foreign nations to take from us those advantages which the common laws of nature seem to have presented to us citizens another pretence for the present war was the necessity of preserving the balance of europe by driving the french from brabant nor can we but remember the very curious language made use of by the minister upon that occasion  0  he told us he not only should not be satisfied that the french should relinquish brabant but he should consider it the duty of this country to go to war to prevent that country from becoming an independent republic so that it is not enough for us to say nations shall not navigate their own rivers it is not enough to say they shall not be at liberty to shake off their yoke and chuse their own government they shall not join themselves to this country or that because it would destroy the balance of power in europe but we must say also when the chances of war have emancipated them when their tyrants tired of oppression or incapable of defending them have left them to themselves we will plunge all europe into war to prevent them from forming a government of their own and compel them to return to their ancient state of dependance but citizens the grand pretence is yet behind if the minister had been sincere a crime of which i do not mean very frequently to accuse him—if he had been sincere in his professions relative to the above objects as soon as the french had been driven out of brabant certainly he would have shewn his disposition to restore peace to europe—the end being accomplished an end might certainly have been put to the war and undoubtedly there were considerable indications in the conduct of the french which shewed that they would have had no great aversion to enter into a treaty of peace upon fair and equitable principles had we been ready to grant as a preliminary that right which no law can take away no force can destroy—the right of every nation to manage its internal concerns to reform its own abuses and fix whatever government it pleases upon its own basis—what impediment could then have remained in the way of peace yes citizens we might then have had peace—it was offered and we refused it was found inexpedient from some views which the cabinet might understand though we cannot—we do not pretend to be competent to the understanding of all their reasons we are very few of us acquainted with their weight but for some reason which the cabinet understood they thought it necessary that peace should not be restored to europe and another pretence was to be hunted for or to speak the truth was found ready at hand but which it was not convenient to bring forward in the first instance it was now found to be—mark the swelling language and tell me whether are we to look for gasconades in the british cabinet   0 or the convention of france—it was found necessary that the omnipotent arm of great britain should be stretched forth to restore the disfigured mass of anarchy and jacobinism once more to the beauteous form of order and regularity which monarchic institution can alone preserve and to set up again those great divinities of ministerial adoration priestcraft and despotism to controul the atheistical ardour of twelve millions of enthusiasts o say they it is necessary most necessary that we should interfere for if we let these madmen go on thus we are ourselves in danger who they meant by we i cannot say for my own part i never believed myself to be one of those wes that were in danger from what had occurred in france i slept as soundly in my bed when the bastille was thrown down as when it was standing and to tell you the truth i do not believe that throwing down bastilles in any country would break my repose nor do i believe that the people in general found themselves in much danger that the walls of that old edifice while tumbling down in france should fly across the herring pond and knock their brains out in england we however you know is a word of very various application sometimes it may mean two people and sometimes two hundred million nay sometimes for great occasions supercede the necessity of grammar it may mean only an individual person now whether there were two or three wes in britain who found themselves in danger from that world of practical science which the early events of the french revolution opened to the mind of man i shall not attempt to investigate certain however it is that they endeavoured to show to this country the necessity of engaging in a war to restore order to france that they painted in fine metaphors this necessity till it was repeated from our very cottages and workshops that when your neighbours house is on fire you must endeavour to extinguish the flame to prevent its communicating to your own citizens citizens when statesmen standing up in grave assemblies—when judges solemnly from their benches and we have had judges lately who could appeal to such arguments find reason fail them and appeal to metaphor you must suspect them ever—strongly suspect either the sincerity of their hearts or the soundness of their understandings what fire could be kindled in france that the waters of the     ocean might not extinguish ere it could cross to us—unless indeed they meant that fire of political truth—the irresistable flame of reason which warms the injured and virtuous while it consumes their oppressors lord chief justice eyre himself confessed in his late curious charge to the grand jury and laid it down as a fundamental principle that all laws and all governments are only to be supported as they tend to the benefit of the whole mass of the people that for this alone even the royal authority in all its functions is to be exerted and operate and that it is only for the preservation and happiness of the people that the laws can be justified in throwing such strong fences as they have around the kings person now grant but these premises and what sort of danger could this or any country be in from the progress of any set of opinions in france if you had given a few years of peace and quietness to the new government and principles of that nation the eyes of mankind would have been impartially directed towards them and if they are really so dectructive to human happiness as they have been painted by those who shew their affection for peace and order by rushing into war and desolation and display their pious humanity and moderation by every aggravation of rancorous hatred and calumny the more they were seen the more they would have been detested if they were principles tending to the destruction of all peace and order in society the constitution of this country would have been the more firmly fixed in the affection of the people by regarding their excesses and all would have been eager to avoid the consequences of such destructive principles does it not appear then that the ministers who plunged us into war to prevent us from seeing the genuine consequences and effects of those principles had something like a lurking suspicion at their hearts i am speculating upon their sentiments you know not advancing my own that these principles had in reality a tendency to produce an effect diametrically opposite to what they pretended seeing then that it is right that every thing should be done for the best for the great body of the people although that which is best for them is frequently injurious to a few individuals who grasp the whole power wealth and patronage of a country does it not really seem as if we i mean they were in reality in danger and as if it was necessary to preserve themselves from the influence of this light of truth and reason so dangerous to the cause of corruption by conjuring up the clouds of war between the two countries whether these arguments were well or ill founded i am not     investigating i am examining their arguments and if their conduct furnishes arguments against their principles the fault is theirs not mine for we have a right to investigate the conduct and sentiments of our government and so long as i have breath i will endeavour to stimulate my fellowcitizens to a zealous exertion of that right citizens the conduct of the british cabinet has been supposed by many to have been actuated also by another motive the count de montgaillard in his very excellent though very prejudiced pamphlet the facts and reasonings of which will lead i believe every reflecting reader to conclusions directly opposite to those which he intended—has shewn though he has been induced by the spirit of flattery to cover his opinion and make it as palatable as he can—that he suspects that the leading object with great britain in particular and the other powers of europe in general was the dismemberment of france the desire of taking a part of france and giving it to one power and another part and giving it to another nay citizens in a very excellent pamphlet which a foreign citizen a native of one of the countries in alliance with britain was kind enough to bring me the other day and which though written in the french language the government of this country took the pains to surpress by purchasing up the whole edition—i say in that pamphlet which has furnished me with a great number of hints upon this important subject we find it supported by good reasoning and documents that even long before britain openly engaged in the present war the ambassador of great britain at madrid had made use of every artifice to persuade the cabinet of madrid to take possession of roussillon to begin the work of dividing france and thus break to pieces the empire which they pretended to be so anxious with generous haste to restore to the house of bourbon spain resisted this spain was averse to entering into any war she began to perceive that the depopulating system which in the course of a century and a half has thinned her population full onethird must shortly if pursued lead to inevitable dissolution the spanish court began to conceive that these mad projects were plunging it into irretrievable ruin and therefore desirous of checking the fiery steeds of war before phæaton like they were plunged from the chariot of empire into similar ruin and destruction with that which overwhelmed the french monarchy spain resisted but at last the scruples of the spanish sovereign     considerably got the better of—and indeed the french convention seems to have been well informed of the cabals artifices and intrigues that were going on at the court of madrid for very shortly after they declared war against england they declared war against the spanish monarchy also we have therefore a proof of the early desire of the english cabinet to produce the dismemberment of france and i am afraid notwithstanding the good opinion i have always entertained of the girondist party—of their virtues i mean for they had no energy i am afraid that france itself must have gone to wreck and ruin if the feeble hands of the brissotines had been suffered to continue to hold the reins of government many of them i reverence from the bottom of my soul though i believe that with respect to some of the members of that faction there has been a little english intrigue and a little english gold in the affair and that the object of federalism was intended as the previous step towards effecting that dismemberment which would have produced not only the ruin of france but the slavery of europe citizens there are other circumstances which are not so ambiguous when valenciennes was taken in whose name was it taken was it taken in the name of the dauphin the young king as they chose to call him of france no of the emperor of germany it was to be one of the bonuses by which he was to be drawn into this commercial negociation for human blood when condé was taken was it taken in the name of the french king no when dunkirk was besieged or threatened with siege—besieged it was i believe with gold though as it happened that the cannons and balls did not match as   pound guns were furnished with   pound balls a fact which the officers in the ordinance know to be well established and   pound balls not being able to go into the   pound guns it is true that nothing but gold ever did besiege that place but was it ever supposed that it was to be taken for the young king of france no—it is very well known that the retreat from dunkirk was made in the name of another sovereign here then are additional arguments for the supposition that the dismemberment of france was one of the real objects of the present war another argument may perhaps be drawn from the treatment of the exprinces of france for though i am convinced that they are men who ought not to receive the countenance of any country of any cabinet of any set of beings because i suspect that if they were common men not a profligate     is to be found who would not blush to sit down in their company yet i am much inclined to suspect that we must attribute to another cause the coldness with which they were received here that is the conviction of the ministers of this country that their objects were not the same as the objects of the exprinces i do not mean to say that they were unwilling to restore the same degree of power in france they have shewn themselves not very averse to despotic monarchies by the selection they have made of their alliances but it seems as if a mutual jealousy prevailed and hence a considerable part of the failures of the disgraces and defeats which the allies have experienced the nationality of france is well known perhaps there is as much nationality in britain but whether there is or not is not now the question the great degree of nationality in france is matter of public notoriety and therefore we find the people stung with detestation and abhorrence at that assistance which was to dismember their country even the royalists and banditti of la vendee were unwilling to cooperate with the allies in the reduction of a country whose government they did not like but at whose dismemberment they were too honest to connive but citizens an ostensible object held out in the present war was the restoration of monarchy in france the restoration of the house of bourbon to the throne of that country though it should seem by some of the speeches delivered in a very important assembly that they did not much care who the tyrant was so that a tyrant was but set up in france for i recollect a ministerial member of the upper house being reported in the newspaper to have said with exulting congratulation that france was making rapid strides towards royalty that robespierre was already all but king that his person was attended by guards through the streets of paris that he was grasping all the power and sovereignty of the country and that consequently the republicanism of france was almost in its last stage citizens so much for the generosity of the noble friends to the house of bourbon however we find their conclusions not very just they did not happen to know any more than robespierre what were the energies of a nation that had tasted freedom and that no robespierre with all his scenes of blood and cruelty could subdue the enlightened and philosophic spirit of a nation panting for freedom though they were sometimes     mistaken in the road the absurdity of this attempt is so evident from the facts of history that one cannot but wonder at the ignorance perhaps it would be more polite to say the blindness of those men who have attempted it in the present æra no attempt to force upon a great people a sovereign that they did not like ever yet was successful we know it is an honour to which this country has frequently aspired we have endeavoured to make kings of france we have endeavoured to make kings of spain i was going to say we have endeavoured to make kings of holland in short we have the rage of kingmaking we are a very generous people and very willing to participate to others those supreme blessings we enjoy ourselves a much greater man than any that exists in the present alliance endeavoured to force himself as a sovereign upon france—henry v this is one of the tales that has been misrepresented by the glossing pens of historians boasting that this little island was the frequent conqueror of france but when we attempted to subdue the french nation remember that all normandy picardy gascony all the richest and most flourishing parts of france belonged to us burgundy was in alliance with us and the different parts of the country were distracted with that federal despotism under which europe at that time groaned so that we led into the field the subjects of the very kings we attempted to dethrone yet citizens what was our real success edward iii claimed the crown of france but though england was depopulated though france was converted into one scene of slaughter and desolation what lasting triumphs did we obtain let the distractions which followed those and projects of ambition dictate to us a more wise and prudent conduct for the future instead of preventing civil discord all our attempts at conquest have produced that discord henry v had also at first the appearance of success he was crowned at paris and died time enough to avoid the infamy of loosing that which with so much blood and treasure he had gained at another time a more recent period we endeavoured to force upon the spaniards a king they did not like the spaniards however gained their point they cashiered the king we set up and were wise enough to set up another in his place we might therefore calculate from the facts of history the improbability of succeeding in such wild projects but there is a still greater absurdity in the present undertaking because it is not individual aversion we     have to combat against there is added also the aversion of system whether their system is right or wrong i do not discuss at present i do not wish to give opportunities to those wretches who insinuate themselves into every assembly to take advantage of the speculative opinions of men and turn them into treason or sedition i do not therefore determine whether their aversion to monarchy is right or wrong but certain it is if our eyes are open if we are capable of receiving impressions from facts there can be no doubt that an almost universal aborrence reigns through france against the very name of king and which even the tyrannies of robespierre could not obliterate thus then we are not only endeavouring to impose upon them a king they dislike but we are endeavouring to impose a system they dislike and to whose restraints they are too enlightened and philosophic to submit but citizens let us suppose for a minute for it is no harm for the sake of argument to suppose very great absurdities suppose for a minute we could succeed that the house of bourbon could be restored to the crown of france are you sure whether even then you would have reason to exult in the wisdom of your policy is it likely that after such transactions and such principles as we have displayed the house of bourbon if restored should have much affection for the people of great britain no they would remember the national insults which have been offered they would and must remember the attempts that have been made to dismember their country nay dismemberment being part of the system success would breed in their minds an hatred and aversion which would not be easily removed add to this the consideration of who must be the present rulers of that country if the monarchy were restored would monsieur who was refused entrance into the port of toulon by the english while they were in possession of that town in the name of louis the   th—would the duke dartois who has been driven from hull forgive the indignity they have met with insults not greater than they deserve for that is impossible but which it is equally impossible they should ever forgive and with such a regency a blessed harvest of amity we should be likely to have on the contrary as is well argued in the pamphlet i have before alluded to the personal civilities which the empress has been politic enough to extend towards these men would make russia the country with which they would be likely to enter into the closest alliance let england and let commercial men consider     what degree of interest they would reap from such an alliance citizens i perceive that i have yet a very considerable and important branch of the investigation to enter upon i have still to go through all the pretences for not negociating peace the examination of these pretences and the confutation of them i have to examine the resources which remain for carrying on the war and the advantages and disadvantages of the respective powers and i observe that my time is very nearly exhausted i am afraid i shall wear out your patience but i am unwilling to hurry over a subject of such importance i shall therefore take the liberty of resuming it on wednesday dismissing you for the present with one quotation relative to the state in which we at present stand with respect to our allies in the morning chronicle of this day a paper not prone to take up every idle report and affirm it with confidence we have this paragraph we have avoided to mention the report which has been freely circulated on the continent for some time but without any other evidence than its probability we mean the separate peace actually said to be concluded between the french and the king of prussia it is now reported upon authority that in our minds is decisive of the fact ministers do not deny it and even the terms have transpired now citizens see what are the terms of your faithful ally see by the good faith which monarchs display to one another the force of the argument that you can put no trust in republics nor expect them to keep faith and treaty with you a body of the prussian troops are perhaps at this moment on the march not to join the allied army but it is strongly suspected that hanover is to be made the theatre of action of the two powers the conquest and guarantee of which will be made to prussia by the french as the price of peace on the same authority we learn the equally important fact that the emperor persists in refusing the loan offered to him by this country since the extraordinary movements in his own neighbourhood make it incompatible with his own safety to proceed in the war the terms offered him by the french are too advantageous to be resisted and there is but little doubt but that he like prussia will accept of the boon that is held out to him namely the guarantee of that which has been the chief object of his ambition the guarantee of bavaria thus     then your faithful allies your despotic regular orderly established governmenes of the continent return your subsidies with insult with desertion in the hour of danger and leave you to the mercy of a prevailing and as the ministerial papers themselves confess an irresistible enemy whom your mad and frantic measures i mean the mad and frantic measures of your cabinet—for i believe that you detest them from your hearts whom the mad and frantic measures of your cabinet have irritated against you surely citizens this is an additional argument why you should repeatedly closely and anxiously investigate the situation of the country the pretences for continuing the war and the resources by which it can be continued sect iv the examination of harry eaton before the privy council see morning post    may      on wednesday evening about four oclock master eaton a boy about fourteen years of age who lives in the house of mr thelwall and who has attended at his political lectures was taken into custody by mr shaw one of the kings messengers and examined before the privy council his examination began at nine oclock and lasted till eleven—of which the following are brief particulars the clerk of the council was proceeding to swear the child when he declared he would undergo any torture rather than be sworn the attorney general with his usual gentlemanlike conduct observed that he was not brought there to be tortured and suffered him to be interrogated without being sworn the interrogatories were to the following effect q do you know your catechism a no q can you say the lords prayer a no q are you a christian a yes q do you know the hand writing of mr thelwall shewing him several manuscript papers are any of these his hand writing     a i cannot say i do they differ much and i am sure the words in capitals were not made by mr thelwall q were you at the meeting at chalk farm a yes q was not there a supper consisting of bread and cheese and porter after that meeting and were not you present a yes q did not mr thelwall take a pot of porter and cut off the froth or the head of it with a knife and did not the meeting afterwards drink the lampirons in parliament street a i was out of the room and therefore knew nothing of the matter q did you not take at the door the price of admission to thelwalls lectures a yes q did you not think it a mean situation and did you not expect to be noticed by the minister a i did not think it a mean situation i did not think i should be noticed by the minister for i did not want from him any favour here the child entered into a political harangue in which he used very harsh language against mr pitt upbraiding him with having taxed the people to an enormous extent which among ignorant people brought blame on his majesty when it in justice should belong he said to the mintster—pitt turned aside and smiled at the shrewdness of the boy while the members of the council seemed surprised at his confidence h eaton was next informed that he might return to the house of the messenger or go home if he pleased to which he replied that he would rather go home before he departed he addressed mr dundas he appealed to him and asked him if it was consistent with the humanity that should actuate the breast of man to deprive mrs thelwall of an opportunity of seeing her husband he then withdrew the consequence of this remonstrance was that the paltry malicious order respecting my wife and infant was recalled and they were permitted again to visit me not a word however was permitted to be said but what the messenger was to hear after the boy withdrew he was taken to the cumberland coffeehouse where he was treated with an excellent supper by the messengers but was not suffered to enter the house of   0 mr thelwall by the constables who were arranged at the front in consequence of which at a late hour he was thrown on the town to encounter the nocturnal vices of the metropolis from the danger of which he was however rescued by a gentleman who on hearing his tale humanely provided him him with a lodging i have every reason to believe that the account of this examination is far from being exaggerated indeed the messengers themselves told me it was quite the reverse and that it gave a very feeble picture of the boldness and shrewdness of the lad whose deportment astonished and i dare say they might have added confounded the whole council from the same quarter i understand that when speaking of the barbarous order for excluding mrs t he demanded in express terms of dundas whether he was not ashamed of himself to keep a wife from her husband and a husband from seeing his wife in such a situation to be continued political maxims c from merciers fragments of politics and history patriotism—how can a love for the country reside in a nation where the wretched inhabitants every where display poverty tatters and the hollow and sunken eye of misery p  0 knowledge—there can be no liberty where knowledge and science do not flourish the more these are diffused the more does the haughtiness of power lose its oppressing force p    despotism—courtiers establish despotism by extending immoderately the royal prerogative by perverting the laws to their private views by imposing ruinous taxes and by converting the soldiers of the country into the executioners of the citizens courtiers actuated by caprice or by a desire to protect the invaders of the rights of men have contrived to turn the military force against the social body to tear out the bowels of the state p         the tribune no vi saturday   th april      an examination of the arguments against negociating a peace with the french republic and of the causes of the disgrace of the allies—the fourth lecture on the causes and calamities of war i come before you citizens with such preparation as could be made by the bed side of an expiring parent to speak upon one of the most momentous subjects that ever was investigated by man i am sure that no powers or faculties i ever possessed however free my heart might be from that anguish which prevents the present exertion of my faculties ever were such as could do justice to the subject now before me i am aware that the situation of the country is momentous in the extreme and that i come from one scene of hopeless anxiety to the contemplation of another equally calamitous and hopeless i shall endeavour therefore to forget the melancholy feelings of private regret in such exertions as i am cacapable of making towards averting the miseries of my country the subject of war has taken up a very large portion of the investigation during the present course of lectures on the last evening i investigated as far as the nature of the lecture and the extent of time would permit the real sources and origin of the present war i endeavoured to convince you that this country was the prime agitator of that war that the cabinet of this country considered itself as the leading power in the alliance and that the allies themselves evidently by their conduct have proclaimed to the world that they are only the auxiliaries the hired assistants of the administration of great britain citizens i now come to investigate the pretences for continuing the war—a subject of more importance than the former because as my system precludes all possibility of revengeful feeling and attributes the misconduct of mankind not to intentional guilt but to mistakes and delusion no sort of     resentment attaches itself in my mind to that which is past whatever therefore the pretences for entering into the war may have been if we consider the situation of europe to be such as to call aloud for the healing hand of peace for the restoring power of tranquillity the important question is what are the pretences for withholding that peace and tranquillity and the means by which it can be restored not what have been the artifices and headlong absurdities by which the nation has been plunged into this almost irretrievable destruction citizens it is admitted on all hands that the resources of the french nation are immense it is admitted by the most rational of the speculative writers in favour of the system i oppose and even by the intelligent emigrants themselves that the resources of the french nation are at this time considerably more powerful than even at the period when the war began while at the same time it must be universally acknowledged that almost all the powers of europe are paralyzed that the martial arm falls listless by the side of the continental despots and that incapable of pursuing the trade of death any longer they almost avow the wish to save themselves from destruction by suffering it to fall unresisted upon this country to whom they have hitherto represented themselves as good and faithful allies citizens a writer in behalf of despotism—a man of very considerable power of mind and certainly of great intelligence montgaillard one of the emigrant nobility of france an avowed advocate for the most detestable tyranny has furnished a variety of statements which though he endeavours to urge on the war are enough to convince any thinking man of its impolicy and the total impossibility of success the same conclusion also is supported by a pamphlet purporting to be a speech intended to have been delivered in the house of commons this latter pamphlet it is true states that the population of france is but twentyfour millions while that of the allies amounts to one hundred and thirteen millions and an half so that the superiority on the part of the allies as to individual population is nearly five to one but he gives afterwards in this excellent pamphlet a variety of reasons why in estimating the superiority of power we are not to calculate upon that physical superiority of force and he substantiates his position by shewing the great degree of moral and political energy infused by the conventional government of france citizens the aristocrat montgaillard—i love to quote from the enemies of liberty when their facts are favourable to     the conclusions of its friends their arguments fall with tenfold weight as they cannot be suspected of partiality montgaillard has in two admirable pamphlets which now lie before me and from which i shall trouble you with a few quotations stated many facts worthy your serious attention after having ransacked the language in which he wrote for epithets of opprobrium and contempt he states in a variety of passages the boundless activity—the almost omnipotent energies of france every thing says he acts in concert with the committee of public safety laws are made roads are constructed and canals dug almost at the same instant the arts and sciences are called upon to consecrate their crimes work shops and military manufactories are every where founded to defend them the most abundant resources are lavished public schools instituted and the french language is carried to the foot of the pyrennes and amidst the heaths of the lower britany state fr page   he shews also by a great variety of facts how this general and universal energy which the convention and the committee of public safety have inspired throughout the country is directed to that point which must sooner or later if his statements are true bring destruction upon all those states who are mad enough to persevere in the present war he expressly says the committee of public safety have directed the attention the fears and agitation of paris to the affairs of europe to the war and the factions they have destroyed the splendor of equipage of dress and of servants but they have replaced them by an expence more suited to their new empire by an industry wholly military which employs their workmen whom the want of labour had rendered dangerous the restless activity of the people is turned to profit by their agitators two hundred thousand hands are night and day busied to forge the pikes of insurrections and the musquets of the army and a thousand or eleven hundred are daily finished in the workshops of this city one hundred pieces of cannon four and eight pounders are monthly cast and the exertions of the establishments of meulan or corbeil and of fontainbleau as well as those of each department is correspondent with this dreadful activity p    and    in another part he shews the astonishing power of their pecuniary resources and after investigating the advantages     and disadvantages under which they lay he prophecies that if order and tranquillity should be restored by the republican government of france if the system of terror should be laid aside that it would be no very unlikely thing that france should combat the powers of europe with the whole accumulated resources of those powers concentrated in its own government and exchequer while at the same time all the hostile governments are struggling on the verge of bankruptcy yet he tells you you are to go on with the dreadful game because if peace is made with france jacobinism must triumph and the wellregulated established virtuous governments of kings priests and aristocrats must be laid prostrate at the feet of the swinish multitude now as these emigrants consider cassius the last of all the romans as a jacobine and the brutuses as jacobins that brutus who being proof against all charm of benefits struck so brave a stroke into that cæsars heart who sought to enslave his country and that elder brutus who sacrificed his own sons for the security of the republic of rome—as these have been expressly stigmatized by these emigrants as jacobins and infamous assassins and as montgaillard himself stigmatizes with one intemperate execration all who have had any hand in any part of the revolution from the constitutionelles of the constituent assembly to the maratists and robespierrists of the convention the conclusion is that by jacobinism he means nothing more than the principles of liberty and that by the overthrow of regular government he means that reformation will take place and that consequently if the administrations of the different countries wish to keep their places they must at all events go on with the war though he lays down such facts as prove that the continuance of it must be inevitable destruction not only to their power but to their persons citizens in other parts of this pamphlet he shews you the impossibility of effecting the scheme of starving france and says when we consider the resources of that country we must banish famine from the catalogue of these calamities with which providence sometimes afflicts the nations of the earth page  0 and    he might have gone a little further he might have calculated the resources of the powers at war with france and have shewn that though france could not be in danger of famine yet those who are sending the stores out of their country for the foreign armies that were to effect this chimerical starvation were not secure     themselves from that calamity and that perhaps the famine with which they threatened twentyfour millions of gallant republicans might meet them at their own doors to the devastation of their fields and the depopulation of their towns and villages he has shewn you also how these assassins and villains—for these are the only names he ever gives them and after having called brutus and cassius assassins and villains no liberal mind will be very much hurt by the obloquy of this fry of bigotted and voluptuous emigrants—he tells you that these villains and assassins whose only talents are audacity and crimes have nevertheless concentrated all the military genius all the tactics all the knowledge all the science of all the great men that ever existed in france and having thus concentrated and improved those military talents that had displayed themselves under the monarchy that they were now most barbarously and ungratefully employing them for the destruction of that monarchy—hear his own words the military committee directed by carnot la fitte danissi and many other individuals whose only talents are crimes and wickedness draw the plans of attack and defence combine their operations and adapt their military tactics to the spirit of the revolution from the memoirs and from all the precious vestiges of the exploits the zeal and the intelligence of the great generals ministers and statesmen who adorned our monarchy those villains have extracted the means of its annihilation p   citizens when we calculate these resources when we consider that every one of those events have actually taken place which this author foretels if ever they should take place would give twofold energy to the repulican government of france what are we to say to this very man who comes forward again and publishes another pamphlet telling us that the war must be pursued and that peace cannot be contemplated by the governments of europe without the destruction of those governments and the total overthrow of privileges and religion citizens you will perhaps be curious to know what can be the occasion of this astonishing energy in the french people you will be surprised how these twentyfour millions of men should be able to cope with a population in alliance against them of five times that number but citizens the reasons for this are not unfathomable we shall find what the disabilities are that lie upon the combined powers we     shall find also if we consider a little seriously what are the sources of the almost supernatural abilities of the french republic in the first place every man in france feels a thorough conviction—whether this conviction is rational or whether it it is insanity is not for me to declare i do not pretend to guess whether they are mad or whether our governors are so—certainly the madness is on one side or the other and perhaps it would be best to call in dr willis to decide the question— citizens in the first place then we are to remember that every man in france—every peasant at the plough every common soldier in the field and every nameless inhabitant of that country believes that he is toiling for himself and family—that he is fighting for his own liberty and that in consequence of that liberty for the establishment of which they are struggling every individual down to the meanest peasant and manufacturer becomes in reality a much more noble exalted generous and respectable being than any sovereign or potentate that ever reigned—just as the private citizens of rome at the time when that triumphant republic was making such gigantic strides towards the empire of the universe i hope so mad a project does not inflate the brains of the republicans of a neighbouring country would have thought themselves disgraced by any marriage or alliance with any of the kings who at that period tyranized over the enslaved barbarians of the earth now citizens another circumstance of considerable importance is that every man considers the duty of fighting against the enemy as the common lot a small sum is not levied upon the rich in order that certain officers either of the parish or of the crimpinghouse may have a right to seize upon the persons of the poor no from the richest merchant from the most wealthy landholder to the poorest peasant every man takes his common share of the hazard and the glory of defending that country which is considered as the common property of all for the defence of which therefore one part of the people are not to be made beasts of burden to the other add to this that the citizen soldier finds that the situation of defending his country is not a service of barren honour on the contrary that there are real advantages and compensations affixed to it and that whatever may be the situation of the interior country the government has     laid down this as a maxim that the man who is fighting and bleeding to prevent the liberties of the republic from being destroyed should not in addition to the hardships and dangers of actual service be exposed to the aggravated calamities of famine and that long train of diseases which are the consequences of unwholesome food no says the detestable jacobinical government of france our armies shall be first supplied with the best of every thing the country produces nor shall the luxurious vintage of the country sparkle upon the board of the richest merchant or citizen while the soldier on the frontier is in want of that inspiring cordial citizens these circumstances and the large pay which is given to the french soldiers are really principal sources of that great that astonishing that unparalleled energy which the republicans of france have displayed they know—and it is a consoling knowledge—a comfort of whose cheering and supporting influence the man who is bleeding for his country ought never to be deprived that even though want and famine might chance to threaten them at home yet scarcity will not meet them in the camp nor the debilitating diseases of penury unnerve them in the field the only evil that threatens them is that which the enthusiasm of liberty can despise—is that of dying in the midst of victory pierced by honourable fears by which they think they have purchased immortality in the pantheon of their country and contributed to the freedom and happiness of mankind yes every individual there believes that his name will be transmitted to posterity though he should be the meanest soldier in the ranks if by any act of virtue transcendently superior to his fellow men he has proved the ennobling energies of his soul but alas what is the condition of those military machines who support the war on behalf of the despotic sovereigns on the continent do they receive for their brave efforts even the reward of merited applauses are they distinguished by the honourable mention of a grateful government are they rewarded according to their labours with popularity and preferments are they compensated for the sacrifices they have made and consoled for the wounds they have received no no no—gazettes proclaim the triumphs of the general gazettes proclaim the valour of particular officers gazettes lament the loss of men who stand in an elevated situation but the common soldiers by whose blood and toil the victory has been obtained perish by wholesale in forgetfulness no friendly hand to close their eyes—no     tongue to speak their merits—no pitying friend to snatch their orphan families from want the field of honour as it is called manured as it is with their blood furnishes not one poor sprig of laurel for their tomb nor so much as a melancholy cypress to shade the heads of those who are left destitute by their fall i have painted this as the fate of the common soldiers under the despotic governments of the continent—your imaginations will immediately point out to you how much of it is also applicable to those who bleed at the command of the mild and equitable government of england the fact however is that the system of equality in france which considers every mans life of equal value considers that no man is to be left to perish if help can be extended to him and that no man on account of the obscurity of his situation is to lose the glory or the reward of a generous and heroic action but alas in those countries where a monopolizing spirit prevails even the wounds of the mutilated soldier are but too frequently neglected better is it for the governors that the poor wretch should languish and die unpitied than come home maimed and disabled to claim the pension that has been promised to some great mans pimp or increase those heavy burthens which they are so unwilling upon such frivolous pretences to lay upon the shoulders of their subjects citizens this is not all these circumstances may account for the energy of the enemy but they do not account entirely for the parallelized impotency of the allies citizens we are to consider that though the population of france is only    millions and the population of the allies     millions and an half yet that out of this    million the french nation under its present government can send more soldiers into the field without exhausting and destroying itself than all the allies together and for this reason that the expence of supporting the respective governments is widely different though the pay of the french soldier is larger than the pay of any other soldier in europe yet can the resources of france be more readily extended to the support of that army than the resources of the allies to the support of those armies it has to contend with indeed there is another thing may be remarked—it is not the good fortune with every nation as with england to have such a number of staff officers men of rank and dignified situations to support in the army nor does it happen in all countries that if a regiment should     happen to be broke down to a hundred or a hundred and sixty men that still it must have the same number of officers duly filled up and kept in constant pay as if it had its full complement of a thousand men but citizens this is a partial circumstance applying in a great measure to great britain alone there are others equally applicable to all the allies they have all millstones enough hanging round their necks i shall not consider the advantages or disadvantages of privileged orders my veneration and respect for gentlemen of that description is very well known and i certainly shall not endeavour to inspire you with any factious or jacobinical aversion to men so useful so important and but for whom all things must fall into chaos—all the happiness of human society must be dissolved but citizens there is another set of men to whom i am not called upon to pay such implicit veneration some persons may venerate them more but as their numbers in this country are comparatively small i shall prove my loyalty by pointing out their uselessness and commending the wisdom and virtue of this country for reducing them to so small an establishment i spring forward therefore to the grateful duty of painting in proper colours their mischievous influence on the energies of society you are to remember then that besides the armies that are to fight the battles of their country the nations in alliance have also to use the language of a pamphlet i have already quoted a numerous army of religionists maintained by the combined powers to fight the devil and his angels citizens in portugal we find under various denominations   0000 of these most important soldiers in the king of sardinias dominions we find   0000—towards the support of whom perhaps part of our  00000l a year may be piously and charitably applied in naples and sicily there are    000 in the popedom from which they all sprung  00000 in spain  00000 in germany and in the austrian and prussian dominions more than  00000 in holland wise and frugal holland only  000 and in england scotland and ireland above  0000 now citizens when you consider that the powers in alliance have to support     000 soldiers whose whole warfare is carried on not against the enemies that assail our bodies in this world but against those which are to be drawn up in battle array against our poor souls in the world to come you must remember that there are   0     000 mostly ablebodied men cut off from the number of those who might be employed in the terrestrial work of grace—that is to say cutting the throats of the atheistical french then citizens remember this also that though a soldier who fights your enemies in this world must be content with  d or  d a day yet you are sometimes forced to give    or   000l a year to a soldier who is to fight your battle in the world to come some person here said a general true it is to a general however you will please to remember that in this army the generals are many the colonels and captains are provided for in the same extravagant proportion and that none of your soldiers who are to fight this after game will be content with the same portion of pay as the soldiers who are to fight in this world though one would think as their salaries are present and the service future some deduction ought to be made for prompt payment citizens whether it be right or wrong that europe should support this swarm of one million two hundred and fortysix thousand spiritual heroes i shall not now contend but the expence of supporting so many unproductive labourers must evidently be a great impediment to the carrying on those schemes of human policy in which the nations who have to support them are engaged citizens there is another disadvantage under which the allies have to struggle namely that they are not one and indivisible—that they are only allies remember the fable of the old man and his sons and the bundle of sticks if the sticks are bound firmly together it is impossible to break them but if you can take them separately you may snap them asunder as quick as you please now these sticks i am sorry to speak of those sublime personages by so wooden a metaphor these sticks are of such a nature that they cannot be bound together their interests are in many respects widely different and those interests are most different which act most powerfully upon them namely those nearest to their doors for if we grant that their ultimate interest is one and the same yet we are to remember that the mole hill when it presses hard upon the sight seems larger than the mountain at a distance so the interests which are daily and hourly pressing home upon them will influence them to act in direct opposition to the interests of each other because men will yield to that which is near though that which is at a greater distance is in     reality a much more serious and ought therefore to be a more powerful motive we find by experience also that this which theory might have pointed out has been eternally taking place in what alliance in europe did the different powers in alliance ever act cordially together has it not always been found that each while professing to play the general was playing his particular game and consequently was ready to sacrifice his closet ally such is the faith of treaties to that which his ambition or his avarice pointed out such is the case with respect to the present war has prussia faithfully cooperated or has she received the pay of britain and refused to do its work has russia cooperated has the emperor himself cooperated who by loan after loan has been drawing though not openly that assistance which he meant to apply to the security of his own individual power at home and not to the promotion of the object which the alliance had in contemplation but citizens whatever have been the disadvantages with which the allies have hitherto had to combat those disadvantages are now more than doubled montgaillard whose pamphlet i have before pointed out to you foresaw that the cruelty the ravages the something worse than anarchy that was inflicted by robespierre could not be of long duration in france in the beginning of last summer he said—the time is coming it is near at hand when the committee of public safety and the convention of france will give peace will give order security and internal tranquillity to the french nation and when it does powerful in the gratitude of the people for the victories it has obtained powerful in the resources which he has innumerated france will then be enabled to carry on the war with still greater energy and effect this was the prophecy of the man before the downfal of robespirre before many of the astonishing events of the last campaign and when they have so done they will be able to combat the allies with greater energy while those allies will lie prostrate at the victorious feet of the republic such were the prophecies of the man who still advises us to continue the war he tells us however that our system of carrying it on is totally wrong and in this respect i believe he spoke the perfect truth granting the war to be right his argument is just the system of carrying it on has been foolish and ridiculous to the last extreme and one would suppose that the     men who have carried it on had a design of producing the very effect they have produced namely that of securing the permanence of the republic of france on a basis more broad and solid than could otherwise perhaps have been expected you attempt says this partizan of the exprinces by one army to take possession of one place for the emperor of germany you attempt to take possession of other places by other armies for the king of england but if you go on thus to dismember—i do not mean says he with courtly hypocrisy to accuse you of intending the dismemberment of france but if you go on with this apparent dismemberment the bitterest enemies to republicanism will be also the bitterest enemies to you and your undertaking it is by french hands only that the french government can be altered—important axiom gleam of immortal truth shot from the night of prejudice itself how irresistably the maxims of justice frequently make their way to the intelligent mind even while struggling to maintain the cause of falsehood—yes it is only by the efforts of a nation—its own independent efforts that tranquillity that peace that happiness can be restored—that the government of any country can be changed or fixed upon any permanent formation and they who seek for the blossoms of peace from a soil manured by the hands of foreign interference will mourn in foreign chains their blasted hopes and bewail too soon their folly and absurdity citizens i do not mean to feed the prejudices of nationality as far as i know my own heart i detest it i believe i do not love an englishman merely for being an englishman one degree better than i love a frenchman for being a frenchman or an african for being an african i wish to be and i wish you to be citizens of the world to consider all human nature as one family to be tender of the blood of every human creature whatever his country his complexion or his opinions i wish to see the cultivation of human happiness promoted by the united efforts of the whole human species knit together in the indissoluble bands of fraternity i would have the only struggle between mankind how to give his happiness the widest diffusion this is the object i wish you to pursue and when you find that this plan can be carried into effect it matters not what powers you employ provided they are the best calculated to the end the happiness of the human species is the only object virtue has in contemplation and patriotism which has made so much boast in the world and assumed the garb of virtue is reality only a little expansion     of that contemptible and illiberal principle which makes the ignorant rustic suppose that the inhabitant of the next village the foreigner of the adjoining hamlet ought not to come and get his bread in the village where he resides and which makes those sacred guardians of porochial rights the churchwardens and overseers of the poor remove the diseased and wretched pauper from district to district in a cart till he expires for fear he should become burthensome to a parish in which he was not born—but though this diffusive principle is the genuine source of virtuous action we are to remember that all effects cannot be produced by all means you must take human society as it is you must take nation separate and distinct from nation as at this time you find them remember the rulers of nations under whatever denomination have generally one object the enlargement of dominion the increase of power the extention of patronage and so long as that shall continue to be an active principle of the leaders of nations it is impossible for one nation to give freedom and happiness to another virtue freedom and happiness can only be expected to be secured to a nation by its individual efforts because none but its own inhabitants can have an opportunity of understanding what is proper for themselves or have a common interest in doing that which is best for the general happiness and prosperity—if a nation as was lately the case with holland has the misfortune to be pressed by foreign interference on both sides it must chuse between two evils and nothing but tyranny and absurdity can deny its right of judging for itself which of the two evils is least but the situation of france is different and the reasoning of montgaillard is just citizens this montgaillard in the passage which led me into this digression has declared that nothing but french arms can restore tranquillity to france he believes which i do not believe that there is an aversion to republicanism still existing in the hearts of frenchmen i believe on the contrary that if there is in the universe one passion more powerful more energetic at this time than ever burned in the breast of man before it is the love of republicanism—the detestation of monarchy at this time existing in the hearts of frenchmen he admits however that if there is a great desire for the restoration of royalty in france yet that royalty can never be restored but by the arms of frenchmen alone and therefore if you mean fairly says he—if you wish for a counterrevolution in france you must employ french commanders     acknowledge the regency of monsieur and put the invading troops under the command of the duke dartois this reasoning is consistent enough to be sure in a man an avowed advocate of the house of bourbon who is an open champion of the divine right of kings—and a stickler for the unqualified restoration of the old despotism—the man who implicates every individual however moderate who has ever articulated the words reform and liberty in the same indiscriminate censure who considers the constitutionelles themselves the first glorious and philosophic leaders of the constituent assembly as the authors of all the subsequent calamities of france as the beings whose guilty machinations produced the carnage of the  0th of august and the massacres of september he who says these are the wretches whose guilty hearts ought to be searched and probed as the authors of the desolation of france and of europe may indeed consistently bow down to the golden calf of hereditary despotism and uphold the sacred right of the detested monsieur to the regency and the profligate dartois to the command of the armies of the alliance and he may also think that beings so despised and hated are the best instruments to reconcile the people to the restoration of royalty but the powers of europe can see the real characters of these men and they have other views it is true they wish to continue the war but they will not trust men of such abominable characters with the command of their armies and the dissipation of their funds and resources citizens you see then their own counsellors—for the emigrant priests and nobility of france had too large a share i fear in the councils of this country—their very counsellors tell them upon your present system you cannot succeed france though it hates the convention will rally round the standard of that convention to resist and ruin you while you thus proceed but the minister will listen to every part of their council but this i tell you says the minister—and i tell the confiding house of commons of england which will believe whatever i say if you will not—i tell you and i tell them the resources of the convention are near exhausted we are only living upon the interest they upon the capital—they have nearly exhausted their capital but it is only the interest we are expending precious sophister he does not tell you however where our capital exists he does not tell you that our capital is mere moonshine the mere airy bauble of paper credit the     ignis fatuus of public confidence—a funded vacuum which has no existence but its name our capital says he remains untouched we are only spending the interest they are spending their capital and therefore must soon be exhausted what cannot this man whose sole pretensions for being the minister of a great nation are founded upon his profound knowledge of cockers arithmetic—upon being the greatest adept in the rule of three that was ever flogged through a school—cannot he or will he not see that if they are spending their capital they are only doing what we have done already why did we borrow and borrow and sink year after year the capital thus borrowed till our credit is so near to bankruptcy that the jew usurers upon change—circumcised and uncircumcised for there are jews of all nations and descriptions will lend us but sixty pounds for an hundred why i say do we thus continue to borrow capital that we may be able to pay the interest if the fact was not that before we appealed to that method we had already got to the end of our real capital our national domains were already expended our national capital as it may be called vested in the hands of government was already gone—mortgaged and sold to support the profligate ambition of our edwards and our henries our tudors and our stuarts and then it was found necessary by our whig calculators to appeal to the dutch fashion of borrowing and depending upon the interest of a nominal capital that our dutch king might be enabled to pursue the same ambitious game so that the plain and simple fact is supposing pitts calculations true supposing that they were rapidly exhausting their capital and that none of that capital was returning back to them which is by no means so to the extent he would persuade us yet the french after expending their whole capital will have that game to begin which we are now almost at the end of and therefore this exhausting of resources is true only as to us and his calculations make not against the government of france but against the government of this country but citizens there must be pretences and there must be real objects for the continuance of this war among the pretences which are obliquely held out is the necessity of humbling the marine of france and breaking that huge mass of growing power which has so long been the envy and dread of europe the necessity also of producing the commercial destruction of that neighbouring and rival nation now citizens let us consider in the first place if we were     able to do all this what advantage would it be does a man to come to familiar instances attend less actively to his business and his shop because there happens to be another shop of the same description in the same town or village where he lives on the contrary is it not found that in proportion as emulation is diffused among mankind in proportion as the spirit of rivalship subsists and the spirit of rivalship cannot subsist without an object upon which to operate in the same proportion the energies the exertions the resources of mankind are doubled and consequently no greater calamity can happen to an individual or to a nation than to have no person no object to whet that emulation from which all exertions are to proceed this is not mere theory the facts of history support the conclusion was it happy for rome that carthage was laid in ruins on the contrary did not the destructive influences of corruption and luxurious indolence take root in the republic of rome from the overthrow of the rival city whose destruction they were so anxious to procure did athens flourish the more for the destruction of sicily on the contrary the wealth the resources of athens however apparently increased were destroyed and ruined by the expeditions against that island and the pompous fleets which with banners of silk and prows overlaid with gold set off from the shores of attica for the subjection of syracuse did in reality take with them the liberty and energy of the athenian republic never to return again athens secured the downfall of sicily but it left itself thereby an easy prey to the arms of lacedemon lacedemon was not more wise in the destruction of the rival city of athens the fate of the conqueror was sealed by the fall of the vanquished nor was the period distant when other arms were to triumph over the country whose virtue had been enfeebled by the malignant fury with which it had pursued its rival citizens the whole history of the universe is replete with this important truth that no country was ever yet ultimately benefited by the destruction of the powers or energies of another country with which it had stood in competition but citizens let us consider how far is it probable that these effects should be produced what are the symptoms which lead us to suppose that the marine of this country can destroy the marine of france it is true a glorious victory was obtained the first of june last over the french fleet and i remember contemplating at my leisure from the windows     of the tower the whole thames exhibiting one scene of glory from the illuminations fixed upon the lofty masts of ships i remember seeing the blaze of bonfires i remember hearing the crackers and seeing the rockets flying about and i remember also that within these walls a hired banditti assailed the aged parent now languishing in the pangs of death and the wife the child whose guardian and protector had been dragged away to dungeons by the stern hand of power i remember that insults and indignities were offered to an unprotected but a virtuous woman whose firmness of mind gave pain to the enemies of liberty because it was a proof of the unconquerable spirit which the principles of liberty inspire i remember also that the same ruffian band besieged the house of hardy i remember that the wife then pregnant of that virtuous patriot—that pattern of spartan fortitude and disinterestedness was driven by the fury of this mob from her own apartment and compelled to slide upon a penthouse from window to window to seek protection in an adjoining mansion i remember too that the consequence of the bruises and the injuries she received on that occasion was the death of that virtuous woman and of the infant then struggling in her womb but citizens though these glorious triumphs are to be recorded amongst the effects of that victory at home what were the effects of that victory abroad was the object for which the marine of france risqued the battle disappointed or not into whose ports did those numerous fleets arrive which were protected by the maternal wing of the whole french navy for the wild anarchic government of france does not leave its merchantmen unprotected a prey to arms it pretends to despise but at whose energy in reality it trembles no citizens the whole naval power of france was spread like the wing of the parent bird to shelter the commerce of the country and conduct its stores safe and secure into the ports of an expecting nation though at the hazard of some injury to that vain parade and glory which makes nations so proud though it never bestowed upon them any real comfort or advantage the victory of the first of june then was of no other advantage but to give a moments popularity to the ministers who contributed nothing towards its attainment mobs shouted their names through the streets of london brickbats and stones were thrown through the windows of those who dared to suppose ministers were not omnipotent and     omniscient the theatre nationale as it was called exhibited pompous displays of naval armaments and lords and ladies poets and poetasters wits and witlings clubbed their brains together to obtain the applauses of the upper gallery with four lines of nothingness tagged with four gingling syllables but france secured her object yes france triumphed in defeat and england was disappointed in victory for the real motive of the engagement on both sides was that numerous convoy which was hastening to the ports of france and we might boast of our victories as we would but the hearts of our ministers were aching with the humane anxiety that their project for starving    millions of people must fail well boastings and gasconades were made use of on both sides we published in our gazette a catalogue of ships sunk and destroyed which are now riding in brest water and they also pretended that they had gained a glorious victory as indeed upon the first days engagement upon which we thought fit to be silent they did but they buried at first the event of the second day we have never recanted but they came afterwards forward with an honest tale even that saint juste whose head has paid the forfeit of his inhuman crimes acknowledged that the french marine had not the energy of the english they had courage he said but the english were superior to them in skill he was not ashamed before a people struggling to be free to confess the defects and errors of his nation and the consequence of that confession will be that the energy of the republic of france will be directed to supply that deficiency and now that they have little to attend to except the great atchievement of stripping the crown of england of its hanoverian jewel—now i say are all their astonishing powers to lie palsied and dead or are we to conclude that they will be directed towards their marine consider the immense extent of france its variety of production and then ask yourselves this question if it once comes to be a mere naval war and the energies of the french should be directed to that and that alone whose is the probable prospect of shattered fleets a destroyed marine a crippled commerce—an annihilated navy citizens i believe we shall have crackers and bonfires again i have no doubt that the hearts of our administration will be inflated by fresh victories during the ensuing naval campaign but let it be remembered that the resources of the two countries are essentially different and that we shall     be much more enfeebled by the most glorious victories than the republic of france by the most disastrous defeats because with respect to naval operations it is with them a learning trade and because as pitt has himself acknowledged there is eventually no resisting the reiterated efforts of a nation in arms but if once we have the misfortune to be beaten if once so great a calamity fall upon this nation that its naval power should fall before the naval power of france as we have not the same means of repairing our losses that they have what will become of that sole prop and stay shall we not have occasion to realize in more mournful strains what has been so ludicrously described by captain morris   if eer on french decks shouts of victory roar   the crowns a red nightcap and britains no more why play for a stake so desperate why not seek for peace in time the game is unequal our naval war must be defensive—theirs offensive our naval force is our existence as melancholy experience has taught us that by land we are nothing they are already omnipotent by land and their navy is but an auxiliary the utmost we can get by victory is only to leave us just where we are—but defeat is inevitable destruction while at the same time to france one victory is decisive and the most dreadful defeat can only leave her in the same situation in which it found her citizens it would require some labour perhaps to make every individual of you feel the full force of this statement but i think i can venture to promise that if you give yourselves the trouble to investigate for ten minutes in your closets the facts i have laid before you you will see that the conclusion is just that the greatest victory can add nothing to the security of this country more than we might this moment have by negociating peace while on the contrary one defeat will be destruction while a defeat of the french at sea omnipotent as they are by land will make no immediate difference with respect to the internal security and the success of their government but we are told we must persevere we are told we must have indemnity o it is a proud word—indemnity what does it mean what is the object of the minister when he talks of indemnity will indemnity restore to life the soldiers that have fallen in the conquest will indemnity give back to the wife and the orphan the parent and the husband that is slain   0 indemnity in the old despotism of poland—that despotism which we have contributed—every one who hears me has contributed part of his income part of the product of his labour to restore indemnity in the old despotism of poland i comprehend because one of the constitutional maxims in the orderly regular established government of that country is that if a nobleman or if one of the equestrian order kills a peasant belonging to another nobleman or member of the equestrian order he shall replace that peasant by another of equal value now if by indemnity it is meant by the sage ministers of this country that as many englishmen as have been lost in this conflict shall be replaced by so many sansculottes then i am greatly inclined to think he will fight a long while before he will persuade so many french sanscullottes to live under his administration if indemnity means any thing else what is it but insult to talk of indemnity to that country which has lost so many thousands of its most invaluable inhabitants what is it but worse than robesperian ferocity to go on to spill the blood of as many thousands more for the contemptible aud ridiculous idea of pecuniary indemnity—even if it were possible to be obtained—pecuniary indemnity for human life let the thought be weighed one moment in your minds and you will turn with horror and indignation from the being whose faculties could be so clouded that he could utter the expression—o what are we come to when all our calculations are employed upon pounds shillings and pence and the lives of men sland for no more than so many cyphers before the numerals but we must not now talk of indemnity the tables are turned it is the conquering power that talks of indemnity not the power whose utmost exertions are applied to steal away by night a few sick and wounded troops the relicks of a ruined army so that if we are to continue the war till we get indemnity we must continue till the tide of affairs is entirely turned we must battle till the one half of the productive labour of the country which was formerly paid in taxes and which is already grown to two thirds since the commencement of the present war is extended to threefourths—to four fifths—to the whole—till the spunge has been applied to the national debt and we have commenced once more that career of national credit to the end of which we are so near citizens there is another circumstance which is argued as a reason why we should not treat for peace we are told that     they have no settled government in france citizens what do they mean by a settled government did we not treat with america at the time it had no settled government was not the whole constitution of that country afterwards changed yet america preserved her faith though witness the banks of the miami great britain whose government still continues the same violated hers i say though america has changed its government it has left no part of the treaty unfulfilled but it is matter of notoriety that great britain has not fulfilled the whole of her part of the stipulated treaty but citizens since we suppose republicans can have no faith though i never understood before that republicanism and faithlessness were convertible terms what sort of government are the french to have before we can treat with them certainly the old despotism of france was not very singular for the faithful observance of treaties certainly the system of slavery on one part and despotism on the other in russia has not made that government very much signalized for good faith and certainly the military despotism of prussia is not the best fort of government to treat with prussia entered into an alliance with the poles one day and entered the next into another alliance to quarter the poles prussia entered into an alliance with this country and borrowed money of this country under pretence i do not say that the minister who lent it did not know that it was only a pretence of making common cause with us and fighting against france and prussia employed that money to destroy the liberties of poland hence behold the horrid scenes of warsaw see the cruel massacres of ismael repeated again within the walls of that desolated city so that if you will affirm that you are not to treat with any power till you are sure it will never break its treaty i am very sure you are at once determined to treat with no power at all and if you can find a way to restore peace to europe without treaties it will be a very happy thing for mankind if no such thing as a treaty should ever be heard of again the very government prints acknowledge that your good and faithful ally prussia is at this time negociating a peace they tell you in the times the ministers own paper that convinced of the inexhaustible resources of that country convinced of the irresistible energies of the french republic that shuffling king of threads and patches that royal pedlar or jugling pedlar it is difficult to find a name descriptive     of him has determined to withdraw himself from the alliance one day they tell you that the death of the count de goltz has certainly retarded the negociation between the king of prussia and the french republic what the nature of it is we believe few men in this country can accurately ascertain but certainly it has always been regarded with suspicion indeed such has been the crooked policy of the court of berlin through the whole course of the war that no reliance can be placed on its assurances from one week to another we therefore shall not be surpised at any thing we hear of its operations the next day they tell you that his place is supplied that another minister is appointed and the negociation is carried on yet we can treat with the king of prussia and send our money to him but we cannot treat with france for the repose of europe well then where will you seek for governments that you can treat with if you will not treat with republics whose faith you have never tried you have tried the faith of governments of every other description you have tried the faith of the aristocracy of holland and that would not do you have tried the faith of the military tyranny of prussia that would not do you have tried the faith of the federal despotism of germany that would not do you have tried the faith of the trading tyranny of spain that would not do you have tried the faith of that very government which you want to set up again in france that would not do so that according to this system of making no peace with governments you cannot confide in and determining not to confide in a pure republic because you do not like any thing that is either pure or republican we are to be making war to all eternity there is no end to it for a pure representative republic the only government we have not tried in europe we are resolved never to try and all the rest we have proof we never can trust but citizens there is another reason assigned by a very curious author upon whom i shall make some few animadversions why you should not negociate a peace with france the blood of marie antoinette of lorraine and austria has not been sufficiently revenged and you are told in a passage which for sublimity is unparalleled and which on account of its curiosity i take the liberty of reading that till you have thoroughly drenched the grave of that princess it is an insult to humanity the humanity of desolating the universe for the pride of two or three oppressive rulers to attempt to restore     peace to europe one professor wilde they call him in scotland professor parenthesis on account of the long digressions into which he is apt to run tells you i lament the king of france who would not lament him he was an innocent man foully murdered—he was a goodnatured man cruelly betrayed he had many virtues though none that belonged to a king and so    millions of people were to be resigned to the absolute dominion of a man who confessedly had no one virtue which qualified him for his situation but that is not his crime his last days were pious almost noble but he should never have been the husband of marie antoinette of lorraine and austria he deserved her less than he deserved france this was the cruel crime the monstrous guilt which lay upon the head of the poor unfortunate louis and which according to this curious author almost justified the fate he met with fatal marriage cruel union the noblest lady in all europe came in all the gaiety of innocence and youth she came in all the gaiety of innocence how long she retained that innocence he does not say but the noblest lady in all europe came in all the gaiety of innocence and youth to be the queen of the oldest european kingdom she came to her early grave the marriage sheets that covered her lovely limbs were cursed by the demons of hell for her winding sheets the nuptial couch that yielded to the soft pressure of her body was doomed in their incantations to be her bier the unhallowed voices of the abyss rose up in execrations and their impure feet trod around her their dance of death that head formed at once for love and for command was to fall under the axe and be polluted by the gripe of the common executioner the scaffold of democracy was to be sprinkled with that blood— citizens it is no laughable thing that the blood of any human being should fall upon the scaffold but mark what is the reason why this humane professor of laws thinks it ought to be lamented the scaffold of democracy was to be sprinkled with that blood which full of all the royalty and nobility that ever existed barbaric and civilized he confesses that nobility may sometimes be connected with barbarity which full of all the royalty and nobility that had ever existed barbaric and civilized run in her veins from the united sources of the julian family and attilla the hun     what hereditary virtues she could derive from the julian family whose shameless prostitutions disgraced the roman empire or from attila the hun that great tyrant who spread desolation from pole to pole i leave to be determined by those who consider antiquity and truth to be one and nobility and virtue synonimous i never will forgive the king of france continues this wilde professor—for what for violating his faith with the nation for declaring himself to be perjured for acknowledging he had signed and ratified engagements which he meant to seize the first opportunity of violating for concealing persons banished by the nation within the walls of the thuilleries and who were killed on the fatal  0th of august before their counterrevolutionary plots were ripe—no these were venial crimes—but i will never forgive the king of france for the destruction of this queen forgive him listen humanity i would sooner forgive him the ruin of his nation and the devastation of all europe restrain your indignation citizens you have not yet got to the height of sublimity to which this genius is doomed to soar he should have seen all his people die like rotten sheep before she could be brought to such hazard this spirit would have made him her his people europe the world happy so—the royal spirit for this is the spirit he thinks ought to inhabit a royal bosom the royal spirit of suffering the inhabitants of the whole united nations of europe to die like rotten sheep rather than sacrifice the most lewd and impure of women that ever converted a court into a brothel—this was the spirit which was to make the people of france europe the world happy blessed happiness over whom was this tyrannic felicity to reign over what deserts was she to extend her empire the whole human race were to die like rotten sheep and happiness seated like another deity i suppose in heaven was to snuff up the incense of so sublime a sacrifice offered to her tyrannic nostrils but her mind did not rule he says and the french monarchy fell and she fell and they all fell together to be continued the political songs so pompously proved upon the late trials for high treason to have been published by the lecturer but which the prosecutors nevertheless insidiously refused to read will be republished in the ensuing numbers of this work     the tribune no vii saturday   th april      an examination of the arguments against negociating a peace with the french republic—the fourth lecture on the causes and calamities of war continued from our last but her mind did not rule continues the apostate professor and the french monarchy fell and she fell she is not to be lamented who dares to lament her they threw her lovely body into a malefactors grave and raked dirt upon it they calcined it into powder and the queen of france was in a few hours only dust what of it they carried her to execution on a cart they had laid before on straw in a dark dungeon what of it all are womens tears to be shed for this no these are not the obsequies of marie antoinette of lorraine and austria her knell is to be rung over the carcases of the dead and in the groans of the dying the alarm of war and the shout of battle is hers indignation that makes vengeance and vengeance that is death these are her obsequies—is it a man or some fiend broke through from the infernal regions that dares to propagate this doctrine of cruelty without bounds of havock without remorse the camp and the field are the places of her mourners and honour and revenge support the pall her funeral honours thus performed will be the performance also of the will of heaven that is when all the people in the world have died like rotten sheep the will of heaven according to this curious professor will be fulfilled when it is completed in the destruction of evil we may then grieve with sober dignity over a queen of france the source of tears may then be opened and we may solace our nature by their flow good heavens citizens do we live in a civilized country are prosecutions i do not commend them whatever doctrines they may be directed     against but are prosecutions instituted against the mild principles of benevolence are you told by the solicitor general that it is a moral turpitude to wish to establish universal peace and sraternity amongst mankind and are such doctrines as those sent into the world by authority is the chair of the professor to be publicly prostituted by such maxims as hell itself if there were a hell would be shocked to hear are we to be thus publicly called upon to make the world a desert to gratify the pride of fallen ambition and the revenge of a few individuals educated in the enormous faith of millions made for one citizens such are the pretences for continuing this curious war ambition would dismember france pride would have indemnity for the injuries itself has offered aristocratic adulation would depopulate the world that the carcases of the dying might form an eternal monument of the fall of a woman who would have been universally despised and detested but for her elevated situation—i pity her misfortunes i pity the misfortunes of all human beings it is not i that have excited the smile of ridicule at her fall it is her foolish advocate i would have spoken of her in other strains i would not wound the feelings of the living by insulting over the manes of the dead i would not exult in the groans and anguish of the dying i hope the heart that dictates to this tongue can feel the throb and touch of nature not only for that calamity which calls for it at home but for the woes of the universe but citizens let us not be deluded let not our humanity light the torch of vengeance and destruction it is not humanity that would pour forth the blood of thousands upon the grave of a fallen being whatever grandeur and dignity might have concealed her vices from the world humanity delights in the happiness of the human race and leaves to enthusiasts aristocrats and usurpers the insolent barbarity of exulting in scenes of blood the subject of war has occupied the space of four lectures extracts from the first and second and the whole of the third and fourth have been inserted in the preceding numbers of the tribune there is yet a very important branch of the subject to be considered which was intended to have formed the subject of a fifth lecture and which for the sake     of connection ought to have followed immediately that which is here concluded but a catastrophe of another kind deranged my plan the parent whose approaching dissolution i alluded to in the preceding lecture expired in less than six and thirty hours after its delivery and the mind struggling between the duty of fortitude and the pangs of affection was naturally distracted from the regular pursuit of previously digested plans on the friday evening my place was supplied by a friend and on the wednesday following when i resumed my situation in the rostrum i was instinctively led to the consideration of a subject in some degree connected with the event that had taken place and the state of my private feelings nor was it till i came to correct the preceeding pages for the press that i recollected that my course of lectures relative to the present unfortunate hostilities was not completed the subject however demands the most serious and persevering investigation it will therefore be resumed in the course of the present season in the mean time it will not perhaps be disagreeable to the reader to have the theme diversified and i proceed accordingly with the lectures in the succession in which they were delivered lecture—on the moral and political influence of the prospective principle of virtue citizens neither the forms of the world nor my own feelings permitted me to address you on the last friday evening and i would if i could have devised any effectual means have prevented on that evening any assembly in this place but as i found that impracticable or rather as my mind was not in a state to seek for expedients i thought the best way to prevent any disturbance which might have arisen from a multitude of persons assembling who could not gain admittance was to get a friend to take this situation for me i did accordinly procure a citizen of whose understanding and excellent principles i have the highest opinion and who i am sure is well qualified to utter those truths to which it is worth the while of any individual to listen citizens the subject of this evenings lecture is the prospective principle of virtue or in other words that     all virtues consist in so directing our exertions and regulating our passions that we may be constantly promoting the future good of mankind this is a principle citizens in itself so consistent with reason that it almost at the very first blush presents itself to us as unanswerable and selfevident and yet citizens when we come seriously to investigate this principle when we come to follow it through all the mazes of practice into which it will lead us perhaps there are few of us who have not some prejudices some habits of mind which will be shocked some dispositions and principles long imbibed which will be found to be very deeply and materially wounded by this principle it is our duty however in the first instance seriously and maturely to deliberate upon the principles of human action and when we have brought them to the test of reason and argument and are thoroughly convinced of their truth and authenticity we must not be terrified at any particular conclusions that may result particular conclusions are only the branches of the tree frequently only the leaves at the extremities of those branches if the root therefore is good for principles are the root—the stamina of all moral excellence we must not take it into our heads that we are at liberty to root them up—to fell them to the earth because there are particular conclusions resulting from them which are hostile to our passions or inconsistent with our habitual mode of thinking i am however aware that liberal as the auditory i have so frequently the honour of meeting here has generally been notwithstanding their habits of free enquiry that yet i may perhaps in the progress of this investigation advance some doctrines so new and unexpected that their minds may in the first instance revolt from them let it be remembered however citizens that novelty is of itself no proof of falsehood that the opinions of six moments and of six thousand years if such an opinion should be found stands precisely upon the same basis the basis of reason and argument and therefore must be brought to the same test of experimental investigation or else must be permitted to fall at once and be abandoned as unworthy our adoption citizens though i shall speak my opinions with that firmness which results from the conviction of my own mind yet i warn you again—i have warned you frequently but i cannot too often that i do not deliver opinions from this place for you to adopt them without examination i advance them for your     serious investigation and i warn you again and again to beware of that prejudice which from having formed attachments to individuals leads us to take for granted all they say i most seriously recommend you to be as averse to a pope in beaufort buildings as to a pope at rome citizens giving you this warning i shall proceed without remorse or fear to cut up wide and deep rooted prejudices with all the power and energy i am master of those things which appear to be prejudices to me may perhaps upon better examination appear to others well founded truths my opinions though the results i believe of very dispossionate and i am sure of very anxious enquiry may also upon more mature deliberation appear even to myself to have been taken up too hastily and i shall never be ashamed publicly to change my opinions as often as i am convinced they are wrong we live to improve if we are wise and if we are virtuous we live not only to improve ourselves but to improve our fellow beings by encourageing free and liberal enquiry and submitting with candour and sincerity to their investigation the sentiments which we believe important to their felicity and virtue and if we treat with detestation the wretch who hoards his gilded counters in a box with how much more contempt ought we to look upon that individual who locks up in secrecy the more invaluable treasures of the human mind the discoveries be they small or be they great which he has either made or supposes he has made in the progress of his enquiries the widows mite we are told was an acceptable offering the mite of science is an acceptable offering also and be it remembered that with knowledge as with coin we must divide it into small parts before we can diffuse it through the general circle of society and fit it for the accommodations and uses of common life if citizens virtue consists in promoting the happiness of mankind—if virtue in reality means neither more nor less than intentionally doing that which is best for general happiness and welfare it results i conceive as an inevitable consequence that all virtue must be of an active not of a passive nature and therefore that it is the duty of every individual to keep his eye steadily fixed upon that which is before him and to lose none of the powers and energies of intellect in unavailing glances upon what is past and never can return citizens this argument will lead us to many conclusions hostile to the general sentiments of mankind superstition with her hood and cowl presents herself before us at every step with   0 her doctrines of repentance contrition retaliation and retributive justice and points us back again to the dark and gloomy paths of error which we and which others may have passed and bids us in sackcloth and ashes consume our faculties in unavailing lamentations which can never undo the acts that are past but which have but too powerful an influence to unfit us for what is to come we shall find also that many of the institutions and habits of society are equally unfriendly to a steady and consistent perseverance in this prospective principle and hence the general disposition of mankind to brood over the past to hatch in sullen silence the gloomy passions of despondency and revenge—hence also the sullen traits of misanthropy which deform the human character and reduce it almost to the brute nay strange to say the wisdom of ages has conspired to assist this malignant retrospective principle and the administration of civil justice almost every where recals to our minds the evils which because they are irremediable ought to be forgotten and plunges us thereby but too frequently in others that might have been avoided you have been told it is true in this country that punishments such is the cant and theory of law are inflicted not because particular acts of criminality have been done but because they should not be repeated but look at the general practice of mankind mark the arguments with which they maintain their systems and then tell me whether another principle the sullen principle of revenge is not the legitimate offspring of the system and frequently and evidently the prompting motive even with the legislature itself citizens the retrospective system the system of brooding over the past instead of looking forward to the future has also another tendency of a most fatal description it frequently sinks the first and greatest characters into despondency and lethargy we have found by a gloomy interference of superstition man unnerved of the energies of his nature we have seen characters whose powers of mind might have darted like lightning from one extremity of the universe to another sunk by this enfeebling principle into sullen misanthropic monks and devoting their lives to melancholy sighs and unavailing regrets for the errors superstitious or real into which in the vigour of intemperate youth they had been betrayed and monarchs and great commanders have shut themselves in their closets to beat their breasts and rend their souls in repentance for past transgressions while the cruel but less infatuated invader routed their armies and desolated their country     citizens whatever may have been our errors let us recollect that there is a nobler path for man to tread whatever wrongs he may have committed whatever errors he may have fallen into while energy remains there may be reparation to society virtue and beneficence are still attainable and the same energies which under the delusions of error made him criminal guided by the light of truth might produce such qualities and such effects as would make full compensation to the world charles vi after desolating whole nations and plunging into all the crimes which conquerors and none but conquerors and would be conquerors can perpetrate retired within the walls of a monastry to whitewash his soul with prayers and repentance and brood over the remembrance of his inhuman guilt but if instead of this he had exercised those powers and faculties of mind which he possessed and used in a proper manner the advantages of his elevated situation he might have rendered the latter period of his life as beneficial to the cause of truth and virtue as the former part had been inimical to the happiness of the human race citizens i do not mean to condemn that retrospective glance which surveys the vices and errors of the past with a view to enable us to avoid them for the future or which contemplates the virtues of former times to increase the useful energies of mind certainly not if the page of history ought to be explored it is still more important that the history of our own private conduct should be searched with critical severity but for what purpose that we may afterwards lose our time in repentance—that we may exclude ourselves from the society of those fellow beings who have a just claim upon our exertions in the promotion of the general happiness no these are not the objects we are to have in view and if we are to study with real views of wisdom and benevolence the history of the human mind we shall find that every moment of our existence has its duties that every power and energy has its correspondent obligations and that therefore not one moment not one thought can virtuously be cast away in any other employment but that of seeking to promote the present and future happiness of mankind with whose happiness our own is incorporated and without the promotion of which no generous mind can itself receive the smallest particle of consolation but citizens the contrary conduct so frequently preached and enforced by all the artifices which could be invented has     its charms for a particular class of people and we cannot be surprized that there have been men who found it their interest to encourage the desponding listless melancholy misanthropy of the retrospective principle yes citizens there is a particular class of jugglers in the world to whom truth is by no means acceptable who cannot digest—though in some respects they seem to have the digestion of an ostrich and no stone is too big no iron too hard or too rusty for their stomachs notwithstanding this they are not capable of digesting so plain simple wholesome and ailimentary a maxim as that the only thing a man can do in this world that entitles him to respect and veneration is prompting the happiness and welfare of his fellow citizens—fellow citizens of the world i mean not citizens of a town or district these men therefore finding it their interest to support a different sentiment have chosen to oppose a system so beneficial to the human race and to teach those who have the misfortune to fall under their tuition that melancholy and repentance are the proper feelings with which the lamp of life should be consumed because they know very well that such dispositions unnerving the energies of the human mind filling the soul with images of terror and apprehension though the most unfriendly to human happiness and virtue are very well calculated to make the poor slave of their ridiculous artifices obedient to their exactions and subservient to their ambition if they can make terror in this manner the order of the day they know very well that in consequence of the bugbears which the melancholy imagination is too apt to realize they can make the poor victims come to them with their laps full of those good things which might according to my opinion be better distributed among the industrious orders of the community but they right wisely no doubt think otherwise their inspiration teaches them—and who shall contend with the inspirations of the spirit that these good things are more fit for the luxurious accommodation of their tables than to be thrown to a poor despicable grunting swinish multitude who as they have no fleece to be shorn certainly cannot expect to be considered as part of their flock thus then citizens this retrospective system which has such a tendency to unnerve the character of man to annihilate those active virtues by which only the human race can be benefited and to reduce him to the sole dominion of melancholy     terror and dejection are principles which we must expect will continue to be propagated so long as one class of mankind are paid for deluding the rest is it not evident then citizens that the only energy of character likely to be produced by this retrospective principle is the feeling of revenge a passion indeed active enough in its operation and productive of many and many a tale over which the eye will pour with anxious avidity but which no friend to human happiness will wish to see encouraged this has hitherto been the common principle of action between nation and nation hence is the page of history deformed with continued tales of slaughter and devastation hence imaginary insults which the flag or the flagstaff of one country for i see no difference between the gaudy rags and toys of national vanity and the sticks that carry them may receive from the flag or flagstaff of another hence the slightest injury offered to courts and princes has plunged the world in scenes of horror and desolation hence it stands recorded on the page of history that the favourite of one great man bidding against the favourite of another great man for a ring at a common auction plunged the roman empire that is to say almost the whole of the then known world into a destructive civil war which ended in the tyrannous usurpation of augustus cæsar and the total overthrow of the profligate mark anthony citizens whether this last anecdote is accurately true or not is not worth our investigation we have witnessed of late a quarrel almost as ridiculous we have seen two great nations on the eve of being plunged into a chaos of mutual slaughter and desolation for a few cat skins it is very true the agitation of this question might have been encouraged by a birds eye prospect of a better ground of quarrel and the two nations that pretended to be about to clapperdeclaw one another about the insult offered to these said cat skins might perhaps have had their eyes upon a sweeter piece of vengeance and while they were pretending to quarrel were perhaps agreeing to divide the robe of which they thought to strip the insolent jacobinical nation of france which had dared to provoke the just revenge of all regular governments by talking of rights and liberties not only between nation and nation has this spirit of revenge the first fruit of the system of retrospective virtue as it is called been plunged in war and desolation but party has whetted the dagger against party and faction uplifted the     axe against the head of faction from the same detestable cause thus we find in almost all the histories of the universe that one party seldom prevails over another but the scaffold streams with the blood of the vanquished and scenes of horror present themselves on every hand from the contention of principles and struggles of intellect which might have been productive but for these revengeful principles of the greatest portion of happiness and instruction to mankind see citizens from this principle of revenge what dreadful consequences have taken place in france the most noble the most virtuous the most magnificent principles that ever were broached by man have produced effects which tyranny itself can hardly surpass we have seen from the seeds of freedom a harvest of desolation we have seen party struggling with party stimulated at first perhaps by the private feelings of ambition or the more destructive though at the same time in some degree more excuseable principle of universal suspicion but embittered by opposition rising to a horrid enthusiasm of revenge which the soul of benevolence trembles to contemplate the profligacy of manners and the inflexible rage of vengeance which the cruelty of the court and the superstition of the church had conspired to engender in that country bursting forth in the serment of the revolution laid for awhile in the dust the bleeding limbs of that freedom which the revolution was effected to promote though happily for mankind physicians have been found to stanch the wounds and restore her again to the universe citizens i had hopes that the excesses and cruelties of the system of revenge in that country were entirely at an end i did believe that the benign principles of benevolence and liberty had completely triumphed that the scaffolds were to stream with the victims of vengeance no more but that peace and universal philanthropy were to twine their myrtles together with that laurel which triumphant energy has reaped in the fields of victory but alas i cannot read without regret one part of the present transactions in that country perhaps while i am speaking four individuals who whatever may be their vices certainly shine conspicuous in the ranks of intellectual energy have fallen by the guillotine of vengeance victims to the party that now prevails in france citizens this is not the howl of apostacy this is not the lamentation of a man who wishes for a pretence to desert his principles i adore—i care not what danger there may be in the declaration i will not exist longer than i can speak the     truths that i believe to be useful to my fellow citizens—i will proclaim my principles because i am sure if mankind would but act candidly and fairly and avow the genuine feelings of their hearts that system of terror and tyranny which has so long subjugated the nations of europe must fade and shrink away without a struggle—without an individual victim—i glory in the principles of the french revolution i exult in the triumphs of reason i am an advocate for the rights of man nor will i desert my principles without a better reason than the example that other men have acted inconsistently with theirs but daggers and guillotines are not principles the disordered imagination of a burke the metaphysical phrenzy of a windham or the artful and studied harrangues of that great arithmetician pitt may confound things together as opposite as darkness to light or as their darling measures to the interests of humanity and justice but we will not be so deceived daggers and guillotines are not principles massacres and executions are not arguments the principles of truth still continue to be true though those men who have them most frequently on their lips should happen in some instances to have them least frequently in their hearts it is not the men of france that i glory in it is not the execution of the king—i am an enemy to all executions it is not the fall of the bastille for a bastille a luxemburg or a newgate are to me indifferent it is not for names it is for principles that i am anxious—it is to principles not to unprincipled actions that i am wedded and the wanton and revengeful cruelties of robespierre and his party can no more prove the principles of the french revolution to be wrong than the sanguinary attempts of a faction in this country who with all their vices without any of their virtues should attempt to establish the same system of terror without the energy to support it would prove that the new fangled inquisitorial system of spies and informers which has supplanted the constitution of britain is right that which i glory in in the revolution of france is this that it has been upheld and propagated as a principle of that revolution that ancient abuses are not by their antiquity converted into virtues that it has been affirmed and established that man has rights which no statutes or usages can take away that intellectual beings are entitled to the use of their intellects that the object of society is the promotion of the general happiness of mankind that thought ought     to be free and that the propagation of thought is the duty of every individual that one order of society has no right how many years soever they have been guilty of the pillage to plunder and oppress the other parts of the community whose persons are entitled to equal respect and whose exertions have been much more beneficial to mankind these are the principles that i admire and that cause me notwithstanding all its excesses to exult in the french revolution but i do not believe that violence and cruelty i do not believe that scenes of carnage and execution can either be the promoters or the consequences of principles like these no the excesses and violences in france have not been the consequences of the new doctrines of the revolution but of the old leaven of revenge corruption and suspicion which was generated by the systematic cruelties of the old despotism citizens i am still the unaltered friend of liberty but if liberty has not a tendency to promote the feelings of benevolence to promote the happiness of mankind and to make us better members of society and more happy in our individual capacity take your liberty for i will have none of it i am convinced however that liberty has all these tendencies i am convinced also notwithstanding the excesses which have taken place in france that the struggle in that country will be eventually beneficial not only to that country but to the human race i believe it was good that such a despotism as existed in france should not perpetuate itself from generation to generation and all that i lament is that a few turbulent and ambitious spirits should have stained with their excesses the annals of the most glorious era in the history of man let us however be just to this great nation they have received obloquy and abuse enough they have received threats and injuries enough let us not dwell only on the gloomy side of the picture let us not be fond of recapitulating their vices and their errors only let us speak also of those more amiable traits of character which they have discovered and which even at this time are gaining so considerable an ascendency let us not forget the magnanimity with which they have spurned in some very striking instances this gloomy retrospective principle of revenge which i am so anxious to see exterminated from the human character see how they have treated their prostrate enemies let us remember that they present the first picture ever exhibited in the world of a conquering army imparting freedom and felicity to the people over whom they had triumphed think of     holland—exalted by being vanquished think of the generosity with which they spurned the idea of insulting the weakness of the little prostrate state of tuscany think of the generous maxims which in the midst of all the exultation of unparalleled victory they have laid down as principles with respect to hostile and half vanquished nations let us remember also that in their present conduct with respect to interior policy there are strong symptoms of the final overthrow of the system of terror and revenge they have it is true and i am sorry they have hung over the heads of barrere of billaud varennes collot dherbois and vadiere the sword of the law—o that i could once see law and justice without a sword with scales in one hand and the olive of peace in the other—the weapon of destruction buried deep in the bowels of the earth i do not mean to vindicate the conduct of these individuals i am convinced that if it had not been for the tyranny of robespierre and the assistance lent to that tyranny by these men the cause of liberty throughout europe would have been in a very different situation at this moment i am sure that if the practice of france had been as good as the theory of france the irresistible light of reason the torrent of benevolent humanity that would have swelled the hearts of englishmen—of all mankind would have left us by this time no abuses to redress for it is not forms it is not particular fabrics that are worth contending for—you may be happy in a cottage you may be happy in a palace you may be happy in the corinthian dome you may be happy though your mansion should be ornamented only with the simple republican doric pillar nay you may be happy though you should happen to reside under a venerable pile of gothic architecture provided you have but good security that the disjointed stones are not ready to fall about your ears it is not then the external structure of government that i find fault with—i may like the simple doric best perhaps—but we will not quarrel about the external shell it is the furniture the accommodations the security and convenience that i am anxious about—it is in short the principle that actuates the government and if this is sufficiently pure to secure the happiness of the people perish the wretch who would breed contention for forms shew me the principles of peace benevolence and universal affection of equal rights and equal laws i will hail and venerate that country as my own and rejoice in the establishment of such principles whatever may be     the exterior incumbrances with which accident or choice may happen to have surrounded it citizens i cannot quit this subject without wishing that the party now triumphant in france and every party who in the political struggles that convulse the universe may happen to triumph could but feel how ungenerous it is first to draw the sting and then to bruise the head of the serpent—o for a great lesson to the world that they would argue thus—this animal has a glossy many coloured skin whose beauties if we had never felt its venom would have delighted our imaginations well—why should we not forget—we have drawn away the sting—the venomed tooth is gone it can bite no more why should we still retain our horror and remembering the evil that is past prevent the good that yet might come revenge—where is the benefit of thy backward glance magnanimity—how great are the advantages of thy prospective virtues—could they but apply this to the various energies of genius that adorn the minds of these men and of barrere in particular we have felt your tyranny they might say we know that you have brought an odium on our good and holy cause in the eyes of europe but france is enlightened and you can repeat your crimes no more go we have drawn out your sting we know there are graces and energies of genius in you which can be useful and beneficial to mankind having disarmed you of your power to wrong us go where you will you can no longer be citizens of france because the sight of you might awaken indignation and be assistant to the revival of that system of terror of which you were once the supporters and might be too soon the victims but go where you will the republic of france has too much magnanimity to punish a prostrate enemy it has magnanimously forgiven holland it has magnanimously forgiven the injuries assisted by the weak arm of tuscany it has still the same warm benevolence for its own children go it has drawn a veil over the rebellions of la vandee and it will forget in its old committee of public safety every thing but its victories and its energy employ for the future those talents to the benefit of society which have too often been applied to the destruction of the human race o could i see this benevolent and magnanimous feeling thus triumphant i should be sure that the sun of liberty had risen indeed and i should know that my own cottage sooner     or later must be illuminated by its cheering light the clouds of prejudice would then disperse the fears the terrors of mankind would vanish before the strong ray of truth and reason and the night of ignorance would no longer be invoked to shelter the errors of ambition and the interested projects of a few individuals who call themselves the nation though they are the nations scourge citizens the retrospective principle which has hitherto excited the gloomy passions and resentful dispositions of mankind is i am afraid but too prevalent in this country also we have light but i am afraid our light is not entirely of the right description the common people feel that they are aggrieved they feel that the hand of famine is fastening upon them they begin to perceive that all this mischief proceeds from this mad ridiculous crusade for restoring the fallen despotism of france and from the errors and oppressions of government but i cannot persuade myself that hitherto the best mode has been adopted for enlightening them as to the proper means of redress we have taught them the sources of their grievances and we have talked of denunciations and impeachments of retribution and revenge but i am afraid we have not yet been anxious to trace the principles of liberty to their real sources let us then unite our energies to diffuse the genuine principles of freedom among mankind let us teach them to seek redress indeed but to seek it by the means least injurious to public tranquillity and individual happiness let us tell them—you are full of commotion—you talk of the prices of the necessaries of life you talk of the monopoly among the dealers in these commodities silly men restrain your indignation the objects of your rage are innocent are injured like yourselves a few rotten principles have found their way into the general system of government under which you live corruption has reared its head on high let us oppose that corruption let us say to our governors we ask you not for power we ask you not for slaughter we ask you not for the banners of conquered enemies even if you had banners of conquered enemies to give we ask not for the french west india islands by conquering which you will inevitably lose your own we ask not a beadroll of appendages and colonies in this part of the world and that part of the world and in the other we ask you for that generous that just that peaceful administration which will restore to us the opportunity of earning a comfortable subsistence by moderate labour this is according to our   0 opinions the only useful object of government we will not contend with you for forms if you will grant us this but this we must have—this we will we are enlightened—we shall soon be unanimous for we are determined to speak our minds and such plain truths as we utter must make their way to every heart and when this unanimity takes place if you do not give us our rights now while you have power to give you must sink without a struggle sink into nothingness and justice must triumph by such spirit by such reason by a proper detestation of violence stilling the fears which have been so artfully excited peaceful redress might be obtained and no one can say that temperate redress and progressive improvement are not better than violence and confusion citizens i wish you to remember that revenge is always vice—that violence is never to be appealed to but in selfdefence it is true every individual has a right to defend himself every community has a right to defend itself also and i will give you the best authority in a case of this kind the authority of judge foster upon the subject you shall hear that he lays it down as a constitutional principle that the people have a right toresist oppression i am not at present concerned says he speaking of the deposition of one of our kings to enquire whether the charge brought against edward ii was or was not well founded but admitting that it was the parliament proceeded upon a principle which in the case of individuals is perfectly understood and universally assented to i mean the right of selfdefence in cases of great and urgent necessity and where no other remedy is at hand a right which the law of nature giveth and no law of society hath taken away and he might have added which no law of society can take away if this be true in the case of individuals it will be equally so in the case of nations under the like circumstances of necessity for all the rights and powers for defence and preservation belonging to society are nothing more than the natural rights and powers of individuals transferred to and concentering in the body for the preservation of the whole and from the law of selfpreservation resulteth the wellknown maxim salus populi suprema lex citizens will you not hear with astonishment that this very maxim laid down by judge foster in his crown law was one of the maxims for reprinting which we were accused of high treason kept seven months in close confinement     which you are told was no punishment at all and afterwards tried for our lives at the bar of the old bailey i think continues judge foster the principles here laid down must be admitted unless any one will chuse to say that individuals in a community are in certain cases under the protection of the primitive law of selfpreservation but communities composed of the same individuals are in the like cases excluded or that when the enemy is at the gate every single soldier may and ought to stand to his arms but the garrison must surrender at discretion such are the sentiments of this learned judge that the people in cases of the last dire necessity have a right upon principles of selfdefence to preserve themselves from ruin and destruction i do not wish to root out from your hearts the conviction of this truth but i wish to plant by the side of it another truth that the redress obtained by headlong violence never can be as effectual as that which is obtained by benevolent means thus we see the republic of france after having rushed through violence after violence and finding only change of tyranny is at last obliged to resort to the principles of benevolence and humanity and before her work can be completed she must call into action a still larger proportion of these generous principles citizens it is necessary that we consider a little what are the limits of selfdefence we lay it down as a principle but before we act upon any principle we ought to understand it the very term defence supposes it to be the only means you have of redress if an assassin meets me at the corner of the street and aims a poniard at my breast if i have no other means of preservation i have a right to poniard him but if i have the power to arrest his hand and take from him the weapon of destruction it would be murder in me to prefer the use of the poniard if the same assassin struggling in my gripe resisting my benevolent intention to preserve his life falls prostrate at my feet however provoked i may have been in the quarrel whatever stripes or injuries whatever wounds i may have received if i strike my prostrate enemy to the heart the principle of prospective principle of virtue is abandoned the retrospective passion of revenge triumphs—he is the injured man and i become myself the assassin let us consider then that nothing but the last extremity can justify an appeal to violence let us not listen to that sanguinary enthusiasm which breathes revenge—which talks of force and violence there is no force like truth there is     no omnipotency but reason let this force this omnipotency be the objects of your constant attention and do not fear citizens but that the condition of mankind will be ameliorated all amelioration must be gradual no society ever rushed at once from absolute tyranny to perfect freedom no person ever rose from raging disease to florid health in an instant we may change one sort of misery for another but change is not always redress citizens this prospective system which is to lead by steps to political amelioration ought to actuate you not only in your public but in your private feelings never forget that virtue is a uniform principle that the same principle that makes a man virtuous in public life would if applied to private affairs make him virtuous there also there is but one principle of virtue—the principle of benevolence and the only way to promote this benevolence is to keep our attention fixed upon the circumstances that surround us and to be constantly considering how we can ameliorate or improve the condition of mankind to this all our faculties ought to be directed nor let it be forgotten that in whatever notions or prejudices we have been brought up we are practically vicious whenever we consume the energies of our minds by fixing our eyes upon that which is past and irretrievable and resigning ourselves to the retrospective emotions of revenge repentance or regret citizens in this respect i come before you such as it is with my example as well as my precept i have recently passed through one of the severest struggles which human nature can experience i have lost since i saw you last a parent by whose aged side year after year i have toiled through many a scene of trial and calamity with her i have met unappalled the grim countenance of disaster—almost of want and i have beheld in her age the same fortitude the same undrooping resolution that buoyed up myself this aged partner has been torn from my side i will not dwell upon her virtues for what are the virtues of an obscure individual to mankind i will tell you however that she fell a victim to the public spirit of her son already bowed down with years and infirmities the blast of ministerial oppression aimed against this head though powerless to bend the young oak against which it was directed struck in its passage the aged plant whose sap could no longer resist its influence she broke—i beheld when i came from the jaws of my miserable dungeon the characters of death upon her countenance     i saw that she was not long for this world my conviction was too prophetic she is gone i have soothed her last moments i have caught her expiring breath and these hands have sealed her eyes what can i more society lives and it is to the living and to them alone that benefit can be imparted be gone ye idle melancholy sensations ye feelings that can produce no fruit—i call upon roman energy—i call upon spartan fortitude which characterised the pure and virtuous republicans of the ancient world—upon these i call to steel my heart with firmness let me so long as i exist impart such as it is my advice my little knowledge my best assistance to my fellow citizens and let me not by unavailing regrets and retrospective views consume the energies to which i have no exclusive right—which are yours—which are the property of my country—of all mankind for i am not a solitary individual i stand not upon a world where i behold no inhabitant but myself i am but a part—a little little member of the great animal of human society—a palpilliary nerve upon one of the extremities and i must do that duty to the whole for which by my structure and organization i am adapted tories—or rapparees the banditti of ireland now known by the name of whiteboys or rapparees were originally called tories and gave their name to that notorious faction the following account of them therefore from sir john dalrymple may be entertaining especially as the reflecting reader will trace in their manners a striking resemblance with those of the chouans and royalists of lavendeé whom that raving aristocrat montgaillard with consistent infatuation calls the virtuous and simple peasants of poithou the rapparee was the lowest of the low people he lived in the country upon potatoes alone in his clothing he was half naked his house consisted of a mudwall and a few branches of trees covered with grass or bushes the one end of the branch being stuck in the ground and the other     laid upon the wall a fabric which could be erected in an hour he was a part rather of the spot on which he grew than of the community to which he belonged or when he entered into society he did it with all the selfishness and ferocity of uncivilized nature each party the adherents of james and william hunted out these people against the other though the instrument of vengeance often recoiled upon themselves for the rapparees knew little difference between friend and foe receiving no mercy they gave none and not regarding their own lives they were always masters of those of other men they rendezvoused during the night coming to some solitary station from an hundred places at once by paths which none else knew there in darkness and desarts they planned their mischievous expeditions their way of conducting them was sometimes to make incursions from a distance in small bodies which as they advanced being joined at appointed places by others greater and greater every hour and as they made their incursions at times when the moon was quite dark it became impossible to trace their steps except by the cries of those whom they were murdering or the flames of the houses barnyards and villages which they burnt as they went along at other times they hung about the cantonments of the troops under pretence of asking written protections or of complaining that they had been driven from their country by the other army it was difficult to detect or to guard against them till too late seeing they went unarmed and more with the appearance of being overcome with fears themselves than of giving them to others but they carried the locks of their muskets in their pockets or hid them in dry holes of old walls and laid the muskets themselves charged and closely corked up at the muzzle and touchhole in ditches with which they were acquainted so that bodies of regular troops often found themselves defeated in an instant they knew not how or from whence their retreat was equally swift and safe because they ran off into bogs by passages with which others were unacquainted and hiding themselves in the unequal surfaces formed by the boggrass or laying themselves all along in muddy water with nothing but the mouth and nostrils above it became more easy to find game than the fugitives these people gave an unusual horror to the appearance of war because they mangled the bodies of those whom they slew partly from rage and partly to strike terror and they tore corses from their graves for the sake of their shrouds     political songs the world is by this time pretty well acquainted with some of the juggling theatrical tricks which were played off with such unavailing effrontery during the late trials few of these perhaps were more disgracful to the managers of the prosecution than that which related to the following bagatelles three songs printed upon one sheet of paper were produced in court with great solemnity by the counsel for the prosecution upon hardys trial which were proved to have been written and published by me and sung at the london corresponding society neither of these songs were however read although mr erskine humorously pressed the prosecutors to amuse the court with them as they might enliven them after the dull business they had been obliged to toil through but in the course of the examinations frequent allusions were made to and verses quoted not from these but from songs of a sanguinary and censurable description and thus the court was left to suppose and many persons both in and out of court did suppose that those bloodthirsty stanzas were the production of my pen the fact is that no sentiment of that description ever was sent into the world from me unless indeed the ludicrous story of the game cock a narrative founded in fact and repeated in the warmth of debate to shew the difference between muscular and voluntary motion can be considered as an exception the same artifice was again played off in part upon my trial the songs were again produced with their former solemnity and proved to have been sold at my lecture room but immediately laid by in silence notwithstanding the admonition of my counsel what the songs are not to be read the sanguinary quotations were not however repeated it appearing perhaps better to trust to the general impression already spread abroad than to hazard the unravelling of the plot by necessitating me to demand that my songs should be read i shall make no comment on this proceeding it requires none but considering the opinion that has been sent abroad it is perhaps an act of justice to myself and to society to reprint these songs that the public may

examination as printed in the morning post i have received from himself a correct and authentic copy of that very interesting document which shall be inserted in the next number and which will be found much more satisfactory than the one before published the fact i understand is that as soon as he returned from the privy council he wrote out in the most accurate manner he could recollect the whole examination a copy of which he took to the office of the morning post this copy was unfortunately lost by the person to whom it was intrusted but not till after he had read it over with considerable attention and from the recollection of this perusal the report printed in that paper was made i am happy however to have an opportunity of laying before the public a much more ample account of that very curious examination the authenticity of which the youth is ready to attest asterisks the two following numbers will contain the whole of the lectures on the distinction between party spirit and public principle with strictures on the letters of lord lauderdale to the peers of scotland and lord fitzwilliam on the affairs of ireland     the tribune no viii saturday  d may      historical strictures on whigs and tories—from the first lecture on the distinction between party spirit and public principle among the innumerable evils which have been entailed upon mankind by party names there is one which deserves particular attention namely that they have a tendency to perpetuate divisions between one body of individuals and another long after all the principles which were in agitation between them have died away and thus by creating the appearance of distinction where in reality it does not exist delude the public mind lead it from the investigation of general principles to the contests of individuals and make them instead of virtue the objects of adoration i do not mean citizens to contend with you that while governments continue to be constituted as most governments at this time are that society can be expected to exist without such distinctions i am very well aware that while corruption shall domineer and tyranny overwhelm there will necessarily be lines of distinction between the great body of the people and their rulers one part of the nation will be advocates for the rights of the people and the other sycophants to the power that can reward their adulation i am sure that while this system lasts we must always have some who will idolize authority and be advocates for the prerogatives of rulers while others i hope we shall always have who will stand forward as champions for the imprescriptible rights of man and maintain with firmness and ardour the duty of government to promote the general happiness and welfare of the human race there is no city says machiavel but is divided into two factions because the nobles always seek to command and oppress the people and the people to save themselves from obedience and oppression and the most revered of the ancient historians by shewing us that the same character prevailed in the aristocracy of ancient rome as machiavel ascribes to that of modern italy lead us to conclude that the   0 vice is in the institution and not in the particular individuals avarice and insolence says tacitus are the common vices of the great pride and arrogance says patercullus are natural to nobility and montesquieu though himself a member of the aristocracy finishes the picture by describing ignorance indolence and contempt of civil government as the natural characteristics of the nobles it is evident therefore that while society is so organized parties in one sense that is to say contentions of opposing interests must continue while such systems exist it is in vain to look for that unanimity which proceeds from languor and indifference on the one hand or from a universal spirit of liberty on the other it is only when governments are so constituted either that nothing but despotism and doctrines of despotism can be promulgated or that the interests of the governors and governed are united together that such unanimity can prevail i will not pretend to say under what particular forms of government the latter may be expected for the future best to flourish but certain it is that if we regard the history of mankind we shall find that those which have been farthest removed from the government of an individual and have tended most to the republican system have been those in which this virtuous concord has most prevailed and in which the most glorious effects have consequently been produced to mankind it is not my duty however to point out modes and forms of government it will be more instructive perhaps to keep the eye fixed upon that state of society which in theory we ought to enjoy in this country to compare how far this theory and the practice agree together and what are the pernicious excrescences which have grown out of the government to the detriment of this theory as long as this country has been distinguished by any spirit of enquiry or liberty it has been divided regularly and uniformly into two parties at first we had no other division than that which resulted from one party supporting the individual authority of the sovereign and the other maintaining the power and the equal prerogatives of the aristocracy the contentions of the aristocrats of former periods who were the only persons who had power or light enough to contend have been marked with great approbation in the pages of history in some instances perhaps with more than they deserve compared with the present state of political illumination     but certainly not more than they merited considering the state of society in which those exertions were made i refer you particularly to those contentions which took place during the reigns of john and henry iii—contentions which though really in support of aristocratical privileges with very few exceptions produced what has been considered as the foundation or ground work of the british constitution i shall not enter into the merits of magna charta it is a melancholy task to investigate the merits of departed friends i shall not therefore enter into the merits or defects of that great instrument as it is called of our liberties it is enough to observe that it formed a barrier between two great parties in the nation one of which was sometimes prevalent and sometimes the other we find however that they agreed uniformly in one principle namely to keep no faith while they had the power in their hands to break it sovereigns and nobles vied with each other in the arts of treachery and perjury and all the powers of the priesthood assembled to give countenance to their proceedings they stood with lighted tapers in their hands and swore to observe the provisions of the great charter and the charta de foresta they threw down their candles and with solemn imprecations wished that the souls of those who should violate them might so expire and stink in hell such was the elegant language of the times as the tapers stunk and expired upon the earth but no sooner was the sword hid in the scabbard no sooner was the armour hung in idle trophies in the halls of the respective barons than the charters were violated the provisions of liberty such as they were repealed and the sovereigns once again such is the infatuated thirst of power which particular officers create aimed at arbitrary dominion and attempted to support it by mercenary troops and alliances with foreign despots like themselves the barons not more nice when they had got the king entirely in their power as sometimes happened continued to rule in his name it is true—for ministers you know can make use of the name of the sovereign when they have usurped all the power to themselves—they continued to make use of the name of the sovereign but grasped to themselves the power and oppressed at once both the prerogatives of the crown and the rights and liberties of the people these parties differed in some degree from the factions of the present day it was not a mere struggle who should be in place and who should be out one party contended to support an absolute despotism over the whole and the other     struggled for the emancipation of a class they had one thing however in common with modern parties they had no first principles no great lights of truth and virtue to guide and direct them and they were therefore totally indifferent about the interests of the great mass of the people any further than as it was necessary to hold out to them some shew of favour and advantage to persuade them to be subservient to their views in later periods other struggles have arisen the accession of the family of the stuarts happened at a period when mankind were considerably enlghtened enquiry had gone abroad and there were some persons who could read and write aye and understand what they read into the bargain who were neither priests nor nobles enquiry getting thus abroad the mass of the people began to feel a disposition to attain a degree of liberty for themselves and we soon had the appearance of parties formed upon something more like principle than any thing evident in the former parts of our annals i shall not dwell upon passages of history so well known it will be necessary only to call your attention to the names the description and the nature of the parties which existed at that period we shall find that in the distinctions of whig and tory whatever may now be the case there was originally an actuating motive in one different from that which prompted the other and that they were not in the first instance merely nicknames fortwo factions mutually struggling for the attainment of the same object citizens we shall find that whig and tory originally meant in this country precisely the same as aristocrat and sans culotte now mean in france i know very well citizens that i have been tried for high treason for calling myself a sans culotte and that some who are called whigs are not very well pleased at the term to such whigs i may be expected to make some apology before i endeavour to prove that if they mean any thing when they talk of whiggism they have no right to find fault with those who boast of their sans culottism but apology is not the language of the advocates of truth and if i can convince them that the thing is as i state it is not for me to enquire whether they will be pleased or displeased with the conviction bishop burnet informs us that the origin of this title of whig is to be traced to scotland he tells us that the south west counties of scotland not containing a sufficient quantity of corn for the consumption of the inhabitants and     the northern portions of the country producing a larger quantity than was necessary for their consumption a great fair was held at leith to which the inhabitants of the northern part used to convey their grain where the whiggamors of the south that is to say the drivers of whiggams or waggons used to come to purchase the corn wanted in their respective towns and villages now it happened that some how or other these whiggamors coming to leith happened to pick up something besides the grain which they came to buy they happened to pick up some degree of intelligence relative to the oppression of their country feeling enough of it themselves and the causes of that oppression and to contract thereby a desire for redress after the defeat of the duke of hamiltons army the ministers i mean the preachers of that part of the country animated the people to seek a redress of their grievances and they accordingly went to the amount of  0000 to edinburgh where they were headed by the marquis of argyle this was afterwards called the whiggamores insurrection and by way of abreviation the insurrection of the whigs and the aristocrats by way of fixing an odium upon the advocates of liberty called them all in terms of contempt whigs or persons so poor and wretched that they were obliged to drive their own teams to market thus the title at first fixed upon the common people of scotland became afterwards to be applied to all persons of whatever rank or condition who were advocates for those people from scotland it travelled in time to england and eventually supplanted the name of roundheads by which the partizans of the parliament were at first distinguished thus then by whigs is meant nothing more than the common people or advocates for the common people now let us see what is the meaning of sans cullotte the wretchedness of the common people of france under the old despotic government is well known it was very common in the streets of paris to see numbers of poor half naked beings shivering in want and wretchedness hence they came to be called sans cullottes that is to say people so wretched as not to possess a pair of inexpressibles to conceal their nakedness precisely in this sense was the term sans cullottes made use of at the beginning of the present revolution the enlightened friends of mankind however soon began to reflect that there was no great crime in being poor and therefore thought     it no shame to be considered sans cullottes themselves warmed with generous feelings they disdained to see these poor beings trampled on earth and then treated with ignominy and insult because they were so trampled they felt a common interest with their oppressed fellow citizens and claimed fellowship with them we are sans cullottes also said they we uphold the principle that the multitude was not made for one or two individuals but that government was instituted for the benefit of the multitude and that therefore the sans cullottes ought to be so provided for and protected by the constitution of their country that distinctions so odious and contemptible might be wiped away thus terms of reproach became converted into expressions of public virtue and principle and men were found in all ranks and departments of society who were not ashamed to acknowledge that the human being shivering in want and nakedness was still one of his brethren and that it was his duty to labour for his emancipation from such misery citizens another definition of the term whig which some historians have insisted upon is somewhat different it will bring you however to the same point and shew you that the principle of defending the rights of the lower orders of society was all that was meant by this name there was a particular sort of butter milk in scotland the general food of the lower orders of society which was called whig whence whigeaters and whigs—a name equally descriptive of the lower orders of society who were guilty of the abominable crime of being only able to obtain sour buttermilk for their food and sustenance now citizens having shewn that by whig or sans cullottes or swinish multitude nothing more is meant than the common that is the great mass of the people let us see what is the origin of the word tory we shall find i believe that it resembles pretty much the idea that most people at this day begin to entertain of aristocrats—i do not mean by aristocrats those men who from never having considered the subject and not understanding in reality what the principles of either party are have been led by the visionary ravings of burke and wyndham to suppose that sans cullotism means cutting throats and that aristocracy means preserving property such infatuated dupes deserve our pity but are not entitled to our reproach tories then was a name given in the time of the stewarts to the party at first distinguished by the title of cavaliers—supporters     of royal prerogative supporters of the absolute dominion of a few over the great multitude the word tory was a name originally belonging to an irish banditti a set of robbers who infested the mountains of that country and committed all sorts of depredation upon the property of those who happened to fall within their power that is to say whenever they could get an opportunity they levied taxes upon the people without waiting for their consent or that of their representatives these aristocrats of the woods and caves becoming so powerful as to foment an insurrection and rebellion in ireland and the king and his court being suspected of conniving at that insurrection and being by his agents the cavalier party the prime mover of it the name of tory by way of retaliation for the name of whig was given to all the supporters of arbitrary authority who believed they had a right to take the money out of the peoples pockets without the sanction of genuine representation thus whig originally meant a poor man or an advocate for the rights of the poor tory meant a plunderer a robber one who thought that a few have a right to commit indiscriminate spoil upon the great mass of mankind thus citizens these names are in reality as ancient as the first struggles between the people and their governors upon principles of liberty in this country and you may see that they did originally convey some sort of meaning for a considerable time however the old distinctions of cavalier and roundhead continued to be more familiar in england the time when the names of whig and tory were pretty universally admitted on this side the tweed is supposed by rapin to be at the period of the unfortunate restoration of charles the second i say unfortunate restoration it has frequently been called the happy restoration and the glorious restoration but let us not be abused by terms and epithets unhappy indeed must it be for any country which after a long and unavailing struggle for liberty has a monarch restored to absolute despotism uncurbed by any of those restrictions which the friends of virtue and humanity would wish to prescribe the intrigues of hyde afterward lord chancellor and monk earl of albermarle whose name has been so sounded and idolized together with a few partizans occasioned     charles ii to be restored without compact or conditions so that after so many years of struggle and commotion the country was tricked and cheated by a few individuals into the relinquishment of every advantage which those struggles and commotions ought to have secured what the consequence was we know full well the country had afterwards that to do again which it had done better before and after struggling year after year with the imperious despotism of charles was obliged to drive james ii and his posterity out of the country for ever at the time when the party names i have been speaking of were generally and universally adopted i am afraid a very considerable difference had taken place relative to the real meaning of the distinction the tories it is true still continued to resemble those great and worthy characters of ireland from whom they had taken their name they still continued to plunder the people in so remorseless and shameless a manner that were it not for the recollection of recent examples we should not be able to persuade ourselves that ministers could be found with profligate impudence enough to attempt or people who were so tame as to endure it i am afraid however that those who continued to call themselves whigs did not preserve their principles in the same vigour i cannot say that during the struggles with charles and james there does to my eye appear much of that disinterested virtue which had bloomed forth in the character of hampden who sealed his principles with his blood or those great and immortal colleagues whose struggle in the holy cause of liberty will command the admiration of mankind so long as history shall remain and curiosity explore its page after the fall of sidney at least the names of whig and tory began to be little more than distinctions of two parties who were mutually struggling for the attainment of the same objects—places of emolument and distinction the characters of these two parties have been so ably sketched by the pen of rapin that i shall take the liberty of quoting his own words were you to rely on what is said by both nothing is more just more equitable than the motives by which they are actuated namely the glory of god the honour of the king the public good and the welfare of the nation for my part if i may speak my mind it is my belief that as they are all men interest is the main spring of all their actions since the two parties were formed each has earnestly laboured to gain the superiority over the other     because this superiority is attended with posts honours and dignities which are conferred on their own members by the prevailing in exclusion of the contrary party this made king william say—for the dutchman had some penetration he understood pretty well that as it was better to have a crown than a stadtholderate so also it was better to have a place under that crown than to have no place at all this made king william say that if he had places enough to bestow he could soon reconcile the two parties indeed citizens when we consider the very constitution and organization if i may so express myself of parties it is impossible such distinctions can have any permanent meaning connected with principle for mark their language tory families whig families as if principles as well as estates could be entailed by a piece of parchment or man could take the inheritance of virtue as he takes a family name how can it be supposed that any house as it is called generation after generation century after century should be more inclined to favour the rights and liberties of mankind merely because the ancestors of that house maintained those principles of old—as if virtue were only an exhalation of putrid effluvia from dead mens bones and dust of rotten ancestry citizens men of penetration have long seen through this mask of faction they have long seen that whiggism and toryism were in reality nothing but stalking horses of aristocratical ambition whig and tory had become so notoriously mere words of empty import so early as the year      that dean swift though himself an adherent in some sense to the tory faction observes by this time all disputes about those principles which used originally to divide whig and tory were wholly dropped and those fantastical words ought in justice to have been so too provided we could have found out more convenient names whereby to distinguish lovers of peace from lovers of war i shall not pretend to support in this place the insinuation of swift that the tories are friends to peace and whigs to war but i will say that if we are to have party distinctions i could wish for such as have some meaning lovers of peace and lovers of war are certainly of this description i hope however if this rational distinction does take place it will be founded upon principle and not upon family compact i hope also as the eyes of the people seem to be opening that we shall soon find none in the party of the friends of war     but the ministerial cabal their commissaries and contractors who are fattened by the general ruin and desolation but citizens it cannot be concealed that all parties have supported the system of general carnage nor can it be otherwise so long as things are constituted as at present so long as war can create a wide and extensive patronage and one man by means of corruption perverting that which is called a house of representatives into a mere expensive chamber for registering the edicts of a minister can grasp that patronage in his individual hand so long will every man who shall be firmly fixed in the seat of power wish to plunge nations and continents into war that he may reap the harvest of wealth and power which war creates accordingly we find that the whigs had no sooner placed their idol william iii upon the throne than this nation was plunged into a crusade almost as mad as the one in which we are now engaged two partition treaties were signed between this royal republican this stadtholder metamorphosed into a king by the summer sun of britain like a grub into a butterfly in the month of may—two partition treaties were signed by this dutch saviour of britain and other sovereigns of europe to divide the kingdom of spain to fix the succession of a country to which they had no right and to force kings and constitutions down the throats of the people of that country this ambitious project sowed the seeds of incessant war and the swords of the contracting parties were alternately turned against each others bosoms as seems likely to be the case among the still more frantic crusaders of the present day in the reign of queen ann too we find our famous whigs our lovers of the rights and liberties of the people obstinately persevering in the war of the grand alliance till the exhausted treasures and miseries of the country roused a general indignation against the very name of whiggism and rendered popular for awhile the monstrous doctrines of toryism—hence the wretch sacheverell became popular by blaspheming common sense and publicly upholding divine right and passive obedience and when doomed to punishment by the sentence of the law for this is an argument which whigs can use as well as tories—they also can answer by prosecution and refute by punishment we find this very sacheverel by doctrines so preposterous swelled into dangerous importance and made the idol of the giddy populace but the triumph of toryism was     of short duration the whigs returned to power and maintained a general ascendancy till the present sovereign happily came to the throne it must be admitted citizens that the whigs certainly had done important services to the house of brunswick that it was by means of these whigs that the settlement in their favour was made and the present illustrious family were seated on the throne it has however happened from wife and benevolent motives i make no doubt that during the present reign the whigs have enjoyed but little power or confidence the whigs have therefore been enemies to the system of war which procured them no places no pensions and no patronage but citizens it is evident that the pacific principle does not really belong to a particular set of men i have never found any first principles or elementary doctrines laid down by one party in direct contradiction to the doctrines of the other i have found them opposing particular measures and contending with all the warmth of interested zeal that the party in power abuses the administration and government of the country in a way in which they would not abuse it if they had the happiness to be in the same situation but to what principle have they pledged themselves what object have you seen them stedfastly pursue has not party after party amused you with hopes of reform and when they came into power have they not totally abandoned every project upon which they had built their popularity party enthusiasm however has continued to be nourished and many individuals even of considerable intelligence have mistaken this party enthusiasm for attachment to liberty hence the names of wilkes and liberty and fox and liberty have been echoed from mouth to mouth as if the men were the chief objects of our veneration and liberty nothing but the domestic waiting in their train the conduct however of persons formerly members of what is called the whig party has i believe in a considerable degree opened the eyes of the nation we have seen burke so indignant against the wicked attempt to curb the spirit of american liberty the first to raise the warwhoop of faction and enforce the necessity of plunging all europe into war to destroy the same virtuous principles in france yes we have seen this individual once so loud in behalf of liberty and the rights of man brandishing his dagger in political phrenzy and out ranting the maddest hero that ever strutted   0 in a barn in execration of the very name of freedom while wyndham elliot portland spencer joined in the chorus of apostacy and applauded his ravings what principle did whiggism ever uphold which the leaders of whiggism have not abandoned and reprobated consult the furious declamations of this burke consult the metaphysical phrenzies of wyndham and the childish longings of portland for a bit of ribbon consult if you please the conduct of fitzwilliam—popular as a particular circumstance may have made him in the fister kingdom—see this temporary idol of an infatuated nation coalesce for the short lived dignity of mock royalty with a man whom he held in the utmost indignation and at the very time when the conduct of that man was more suspicious than ever and then lament if you can that the dreams of his ambition should end so soon in degradation and insult from a being who seems to have entered into a conspiracy to degrade the aristocratic character below even what the advocates of democracy would represent it citizens if you could have any doubt that places emoluments and distinctions are the only objects for which those parties have been contending this must convince you—as soon as all hope of getting into power by other means has vanished what do they do why at the very time when these men whose strides to arbitrary power they have so frequently denounced are taking a stride more gigantic than ever entered the imagination of any minister for above a century you find them making compacts and agreements with these men and accepting the very scraps and fragments of places—the very offal from the full banquet of ministerial insolence grasping at any thing they can get and on any terms and consenting to seal the compact of their copartnership in the blood of patriots and reformers in short—what has been the conduct of all parties have they not uniformly succeeded one to the other and pursued the same measures when in place which they reprobated when out has any administration for half a century back nay for a century granted any one advantage to the people but what has been extorted by hard and determined struggles and usurped back again as soon as the public mind is quieted leave them then and their unintelligible squabbles to themselves and fix your eyes upon nobler objects principles alone and not particular measures ought to occupy your attention there can be no good practice which does not spring out of good principle for principles are the stamina of society and individual actions are only the smaller ramifications produced from their commanding energy     whig administrations—from the same what then are the great advantages which this whig party ever since it was so denominated has bestowed upon this country they placed it is true william iii upon the throne or rather the whigs and tories coalesced together because they found that not only the people but the aristocracy were to be sacrificed to the sullen and gloomy tyranny of james the second because they saw that priests and superstition were to have the sole dominion of the country and that the power neither of one party nor the other could be supported without a change they placed william the third upon throne but what restrictions did they make to secure the happiness of the people—did they reform the abuses in the representation of the commons house of parliament did they restore to the people their right of annual parlaments and universal suffrage no—did they repeal the law of henry vii by which universal suffrage was abolished and the present system of borough jobbing introduced no they could get no accession to power they could get no influence or emolument by such alterations and therefore left them as they found them or rather they ratified by their triennial bill that which never had been ratified before they gave the colour of law to that which before was usurpation and sanctified the oppression they ought to have overthrown but mark what they did besides—they plunged the country into continental wars they laid the foundation of that national debt which has been ever since increasing year after year till its enormous burden is ready to crush the nation into ruin they connived at the horrible massacres of glenco massacres more deliberate and more wicked than those that have taken place in france during the revolution let us trace them a little further—what did they do in the reign of queen anne they procured it is true the bill for the succession of the house of hanover we no doubt feel as we ought the gratitude due to the whigs on that account but they still pursued the same conduct of plunging into continental wars which swelled the national debt of which before they had laid the foundation and increased the burdens and calamities of the country these same whigs having seated the house of hanover upon the throne the first parliament of george i met upon the   th of march      and one of their first acts was to confirm the system of maintaining a     standing army in time of peace in the country they had already assented to it in the reign of william iii they now confirmed it—another of their acts was the riot act under which a poor being who shewed an honest indignation against crimps and kidnappers lately expired by the felon hand of the executioner another of the measures of this whig administration was the suspension of the habeas corpus act the whigs speak loudly against its suspension in the present instance and they do rightly but this will shew you that whigs and tories when in power can use the same instruments i do not mean to say that the pretences for the suspension in      were quite so weak and frivolous as those under which it is now suspended but they set the example to those at present in power another of the acts which passed under the administration of these whigs was the famous septennial act they had already abridged the right of election from annual to once in three years and now they reduced it to once in seven they might as justly have passed another act to make the parliement perpetual and the seats descendible like other property from father to son and descendible from father to son in reality they are for it is not the individual who sits there it is the person who appoints the member that is the real legislator and if mr rose the immaculate the modest mr rose possesses as i understand a freehold estate in as much plank and green baize in st stephens chapel as six members can cover with their representative bums it follows as a consequence that mr rose and his descendants to all generations are in possession of an hereditary right to six voices in that virtuous assembly so much for the representation of the people which the soi disant friends of the people would not now distract the public mind by seeking to reform on the frequent instances of tyranny and corruption among english judges from the preface to state trials   a judge is the creature of the crown it has not always been the good fortune of england to have the bench adorned with such persons as behaved impartially without bearing hard upon the innocent or shewing unallowable favour to the guilty the reader will light upon     certain periods wherein the judges who ought by the duty of their place to be the great barrier and to act impartially between prince and people have notwithstanding given opinions in direct contradiction to the known fundamental laws of the nation and as far as in them lay sacrificed the constitution and liberties of the kingdom to the pride and ambition of an arbitrary monarch this generally ended in the downfall of such judges and the ministers whose tools they were the politics of those times not having arrived at that height to know how to influence the representative body of the nation for what need could ministers have to corrupt the interpreters of the law if the makers of it were entirely at their devotion this reflection is in part very just it may however sometimes be worth the while of the proprietor of a dependant majority in the house of commons to corrupt the judges because on account of the superstitious attachment of the people to the idea of being governed by their ancient laws it is safer sophistically to violate the laws by means of agents who can no longer be made responsible for their misinterpretations than openly to repeal and alter them as fast as a minister might find occasion besides such interpreters are necessary engines to destroy ex post facto interpretations such virtuous men as may be bold enough to combat and expose the incroachments of the despot others there have been as the reader will have too frequent occasion to remark who regardless of right and wrong and all the solemn oaths they had sworn have under colour of law but yet in open defiance of natural justice made no scruple to murder the innocent and by foul unwarrantable practices to acquit the guilty just as they received their directions from or thought it would be best pleasing to those above them to such a monstrous pitch of barefaced iniquity were they arrived that they stuck not to determine the same point different ways at different times making the law a mere nose of wax but always turning it to the destruction of the person tried before them fatal effects of the dependance and consequent pliability and corruption of judges this judge says mr pierpoint speaking of sir robert berkley in the time of charles i did advise such a     government as future kings here might exercise the highest tyranny and the subjects want the benefit of restraints known to the most slavish eastern nations where if their prince do unjustly he hath hatred for it and the dangers that follow that there is no such bondage as when the laws of freedom are misrepresented by judges to make men slaves for a judge to be unjust more hurts the public than any other he is not suspected what a judge doth is looked on as a thing that ought to be done the most pernicious great man that by cunning hath got to himself the heart and tongue of his prince his ill acts have died with him if not taken up by others and then they walk in darkness no man will justify what he doth by saying such a favourite did it but the unjust judgments of this judge were given in noonday were done in the face of the whole kingdom in the hearing of such as might carry the news to all parts of the realm and was therefore done his unjust judgments were our records we have seen wicked great men most craftily politic they hated our laws yet not meeting with active judges moulded to their purposes they and their acts have died the realm flourished but of late others less politic meeting with most unjust judges every way as ill as they coul wish them to be then did the kingdom faint under the load of its misery did long struggle—if the designs of some would not have such a man to be at liberty a warrant from some of the lords of the council would soon have laid him in prison and given no cause had he moved this judge to be discharged or bailed he could have obtained neither if their ways would not have endured that man to live a judge reviling the prisoner and the counsel that moved for his discharge or bail joined with the hate of some great man might soon have moved a gaoler for unwholesome rooms and lodging and ill diet for his prisoner and they may soon take life away offenders in prisons are looked after to be safe only such as are brought in by power against law are abused st t vol i p     a reflection from voltaire human nature has not arrived at such perfection as to admit that any prince shall have a sufficient quantity of moderation to be content with all the power it is possible for him to have wisdom enough to know his own happiness and goodness sufficient to support the happiness of others when instrumental to his own     examination of harry eaton before the privy council copied from the memorandums written by himself immediately upon his return the original in his own handwriting is in the possession of j t and can be produced if ever it should be necessary on the   th of may last mr schaw the messenger with two assistants came to the house of j thelwall commanding me to appear before the privy council and to go with them now and on going before the privy council they asked me the following questions— q what is your name a harry eaton q do you live with mr thelwall a yes i did q how long have you lived with him a about four or five months here one of the privy council asked if i was sworn and upon being answered in the negative he desired an officer present to swear me upon which i told them that i would not answer any questions unless mr thelwall was present as i was not of myself a competent judge what questions i ought or ought not to answer the attorney general then said that i was not brought there on any charge of any crime and therefore i must answer such questions as were put to me upon which i said that i would not answer any questions unless i could have the opinion of a council or an attorney what questions i ought or ought not to answer the attorney general then said that what i alluded to could not be granted and desired a person to swear me upon which i told the privy council that i would suffer any torture which the human mind can inflict rather than be on my oath here again the attorney general rose and told me that i was not brought there to be tortured and then suffered me to be examined without being sworn they then asked me the following questions q do you know your catechism—a no q can you say the lords prayer—a no q do you know the belief—a no     q are you a christian—a yes they then shewed me a lecture on the system of law and its abuses q is this mr thelwalls handwriting a i cannot say whether it is or is not so many people write so much alike that i cannot be positive q do you think it is mr thelwalls handwriting a i cannot say q do you believe it is his handwriting a yes i believe it is his writing but cannot be certain q was you at chalk farm on the day the meeting was there a yes i was q who was there present a a great concourse of people q was not richter there a yes i believe he was q did he not take an active part there a i cannot tell q was not lovet there a yes i think he was they then shewed me some resolutions in manuscript q do you know whose handwriting those resolutions are in a no i cannot tell here one of the privy council said that they knew whose writing one of them was that it was margarots upon which i made the following remarks ah there is an instance of ministerial tyranny a man who for being an advocate of the same cause as mr pitt and the duke of richmond themselves professed before they had places and pensions and if mr margarot deserved to be transported i am sure that mr pitt and the duke of richmond deserved equally to be transported too they then shewed me a lecture on fasts and superstitious observances q do you know who wrote this—a yes i do q did mr thelwall write it—a no q who did write it then—a part i wrote myself q who told you to write it a i cannot tell i wrote it from gibbons rise and fall of the roman empire q did you write it all—a no i did not     q did mr thelwall write it a i do not think it is mr thelwalls writing it is too good a hand writing for his q do you know these resolutions a no i do not they have since been proved by evans to be martins one of the privy council look at them take time a no i cannot tell whose writings they are q did you ever see them before a never to my knowledge q are you sure of that—a yes i am i here observed mr pitt to be speaking to a person whom i took to be a member of the privy council in a whispering manner when they told me that if i would tell all i knew or speak the truth the minister would take me into favour at this moment i felt myself so much hurt that i could not help interrupting and expressing my indignation at such atrocious proceedings in a place where i should have thought nothing but virtue and justice ought to have presided i therefore said— i never have yet sullied my eyes by the sight of the minister nor never wish—for he is a traitor to his king and country here one of the privy council asked me how he was a traitor i replied by increasing the national debt by causing unnecessary wars and taxing the people to an enormous amount and if he did not retract he would make the poor people hate the king as much as ever they loved him when in justice they ought to blame the minister who alone deserves the indignation of the people q does any body then hate the king a no not as i know but they soon may q i think you said you was at chalk farm the day the meeting was held there a yes i was q was you at the supper likewise not answering directly they told me that i was not very well that night and that i only eat some bread and cheese a yes i was there and was very ill q we know that—did you not see green shew some knives of a peculiar construction a i do not recollect any such thing obs a knife with a spring a i dont know     q did you ever see any of that description at mr thelwalls a yes here they paid great attention and desired the person to be very particular in taking my answers they then began as follows q when did you see it a i cannot tell exactly q who was it that had them there a i do not know—but when it was shewn to mr thelwall he severely reprobated any such things being in the london corresponding society as it might furnish the enemies of reform with a pretence for arbitrary proceedings and then entered into an abuse of the excesses of the french revolution and of the horrid massacres of paris and hoped never to see any such proceedings in this country and remarked that this taking up a pen should be the only weapon which the society ought to use q did not mr thelwall take up a pot of porter and cut off the froth with a knife and did not the meeting afterwards drink the lamp posts a i was out of the room and therefore knew nothing about the matter q did you not take at the door the price of admission to thelwalls lectures—a yes q did you not think it a mean situation a no i thought it an honour q do you know where richter lives a no i do not they then told me after consulting among themselves for about ten minutes that i was at liberty to go home provided i promised to come tomorrow i replied— i cannot promise any such thing but if you should want me again but i dont think you will mr schaw knows where to find me they then advised me to go home to the messengers where i should have a good supper and bed as it was too late to go home i then again told them that i would rather go home as mrs thelwall would be uneasy at my stay they then said i might go if i pleased but before i went away i addressed the privy council as gentlemen and asked them if it was consistent with the humanity which ought to actuate the breast of man to deprive mrs thelwall and her     child of an opportunity of seeing her husband which was the case by an order from mr dundas or from them here one of the members asked how old the child was when i answered about ten months here again another said that no such order went from them but i said i hoped they would take this application into their consideration as i assured them that it was truth and that i was sorry to say by the inhuman order of mr dundas they then promised to take it into their consideration and the day following mr schaw came and told mr thelwall that she might then see her husband when i came from the privy council i went home and and on going to mr thelwalls house i was refused admittance by the constables and on going away i perceived a messenger who i since have been informed came just before me with an order to the constable who was then attending not to admit any person to the house and upon which order i was refused admittance although i told them again and again i lived there and was just come from the privy council signed henry eaton ☞ it is worthy of remark that scarcely one fact came out upon the trials in favour of the prisoners but what had been again and again attested during the examinations before the privy council whatever injustice therefore there may have been in the prosecutions government certainly acted with their eyes open it will be remembered that a similar circumstance to that which is here attested relative to my taking up a pen and declaring it to be the only weapon c an action and sentiment which had been exceedingly common with me was given in evidence by one of the witnesses for the crown upon my trial and indeed it was impossible for any person to have witnessed my conduct in the society without obseving innumerable instances that marked my abhorrence of blood and violence yet the newspapers in the service of administration during the whole time of our confinement continued to paint me and my associates as a gang of bloodthirsty assassins and on the very eve of our trials that infamous vehicle of diurnal slander the times occupied a whole page with the most profligate attempt to prejudicate us in the public mind that even the assassinlike imagination of b—— or a—— could have devised they represented the purposed convention as having assembled painted   0 the prisoners then about to be tried in the perpetration of every enormity and placed me by the name of telwell in the chair issuing orders for rapes and assassinations pillaging houses and burning towns and villages this ingenious performance was called the the new times and was published in the paper

ireland     the tribune no ix saturday  th may      strictures on the letters of lord lauderdale to the peers of scotland and of earl fitzwilliam on the affairs of ireland——the second lecture on the distinction between the spirit of party and the principle of liberty citizens it is my purpose on the present evening to resume the investigation of the distinction between the spirit of party and the genuine principle of liberty in the course of the former lecture i dwelt pretty largely upon the general history of parties in this country from the origin of the struggles between the crown and the aristocracy to the situation of parties at the present period i believe you will agree with me that from that history one conclusion at least is to be drawn namely that in the first instance parties originated from a real difference of interest between respective bodies of the community that in reality party distinctions at first arose from the opposing interests of the great barons or large landed proprietors and the crown it will also i dare say occur to your minds as another deduction from this view of the subject that in process of time the grounds and foundation of party were in a considerable degree altered that in proportion as the mercantile interest and the landed gentry increased in their influence and power a certain portion of respect attached to them in consequence of which instead of the barons standing forward as single champions against the rights and prerogatives of the crown those merchants and gentry took the lead in all the struggles which opposed the arbitrary assumption of prerogative about the time of james the second a wider diffusion of knowledge a more liberal spirit of enquiry had awakened the gentry and trading parts of the community from the torpor of slavery in which they had so long lain they began to investigate questions of a general and abstract nature and particularly to consider the frame and structure of the government under which they lived the interests they had in that government     and the larger portions of interest to which they thought themselves entitled this spirit of enquiry kept rapidly increasing for it is not very easy when such a disposition has once made its appearance among any order of men for stretches of power or prerogative to prevent it ultimately from enlightening the whole mass in the time of charles the first therefore we find that the spirit of enquiry had extended much wider and if we consult the history of that period we shall find that the most intelligent the most active as well as the most virtuous leaders of the opposition against the arbitrary prerogatives and usurpations of the house of stuart were found not among the hereditary nobility but among the gentry and traders who had assumed their seats in that branch of the legislature then called and still by some considered as a house of commons then it was that the distinctions of whig and tory as i before observed first grew into use and if we reflect with any degree of accuracy upon the early history of those parties we shall be compelled to acknowledge that they were terms in the first instance descriptive of the struggle between the aristocracy and the sansculottism of the country i think the facts submitted to your consideration in the former lecture are sufficient to prove that the whig interest was originally precisely the same thing as has since been called the sansculottism in france that it was in reality an interest struggling to maintain the rights liberties and happiness of the distressed and despised orders of the community in opposition to that tyrannical court and usurping aristocracy which endeavoured to grasp in their own hands every power rational faculty and human enjoyment and treated the great body of the people as slaves and beasts of burthen upon whom they assumed a right to heap oppression after oppression till their shoulders were broken beneath the enormous load the misery of the lower orders at that time it is not necessary for me to dwell upon it is sufficient to say that the common people were at that time almost half as miserable as at this day those parties therefore having much to contend for the rights and liberties of the people on one hand and the whole plunder of the people on the other became the objects of perpetual struggle and investigation and as it is in the nature of names to be more permanent than principles we find that the distinctions of whig and tory were perpetuated when the sources of the distinction were forgotten the plain and     simple fact is that two branches of the tory interest—two factions of the aristocratical branch of the constitution imagined they perceived in those distinctions the means of carrying on their own ambitious projects under a more specious mask one association therefore of noble families that is to say of aristocrats or privileged banditti assumed the denomination of whig and another association of noble families the denomination of tory and with those different names long continued to abuse the understandings of mankind and indeed it is but lately that we have discovered that they are nothing more than two aristocratic factions with no sort of difference of principle and whose uniform object is to usurp all the power opulence and patronage of the country this circumstance however has been lately confessed in a very direct manner by the earl fitzwilliam it has been acknowledged i think as completely though not as openly by lord lauderdale in his letters to the peers of scotland he tells you page    —for i shall be particular in my quotations from this book as i am anxious that you may not suppose i abuse by false representations a character for which in some respects as i shall shew you i have considerable esteem he who gives himself up to the pursuit of honours and dignities says he—p     who loves the splendour of a court attaches himself to the cause of monarchy and soon sees in the increased power of the monarch the source of additional weight and splendour to those who surround the throne and of increasing value to the favours which the sovereign can confer he who possesses an ardent mind conscious of its own rectitude animated with a desire of building reputation upon a more solid foundation naturally looks with anxious desire to acquire the approbation and applause of hie fellow citizens and discovers with equal alacrity in the extent of power which they may possess or retain the value of that he wishe to obtain so that the possession of power is at last fairly acknowledged to be the grand object of pursuit both with the one and with the other but according to the exposition we are to consider the ambition of the whigs as of a more liberal nature—that is to say they wish to build their fame their glory their reputation and by the means of these their power upon a more solid foundation than royal favour and as they suppose their power reputation c will be more solid when built upon the favour of the people they therefore think it necessary to court that popularity from whence that security may be derived thus then     stripping away a few glossing epithets taking away some of those favourable shades with which the most honest mind cannot always avoid incumbering the form of truth when touching upon a subject in which the painter is personally interested—taking those glossing circumstances away we find the upshot of the distinction neither more nor less than this that one party endeavours to gratify its ambition by flattering the monarch and the other expects a more solid gratification by cajoling the people citizens while such principles or to speak more accurately such motives stimulate men who stand forward as the leaders of the people what are we to expect the great principle of general virtue is not even alluded to in this illustration of whiggism—the benignant principle that every action ought to be directed towards procuring the greatest quantity of advantage and felicity to the great body of the people and that personal considerations either of vanity ambition or avarice ought to be entirely out of the question these great leading principles do not appear from the preceding quotation ever to have been dreamt of by the strenuous advocate of party you have ambition on the one hand and the avarice of power on the other to distinguish between—if distinguish you can—this being the case what could result but that which has resulted endless commotion about what nobody ever comprehended or pretended to explain scenes of riot and confusion by which a few interested leaders are advanced from popularity to power and the shifting and shuffling of places from hand to hand without advantage to the people or prospect of any benefit or advantage whatever the consequence is that the minds of the people have been perpetually fluctuating between whiggism and toryism at one time no doctrines could be swallowed but passive obedience and divine right—at another nothing but the omnipotence of parliament could go down we shall now perhaps be inclined to enquire whether while parliaments continue to be organized as they are there is in reality with respect to the interests of the people any difference between the two doctrines we may perhaps be inclined to think that if divinity and omnipotence are to be assumed by earthly powers it is not a question of much consequence whether we talk of the divine right of a monarch or the omnipotent power of a few monopolizing boroughmongers though i for my own part should prefer the tyranny of the former     these fluctuations of opinion from party to party and the consequent contentions rancour and animosity that have ensued are effects that could not fail of being looked for by every intelligent mind when the nature of the principle was considered the fact is that the only way to effect reformations that can in any degree influence the happiness and welfare of the multitude is to appeal to one grand principle namely that the people are the fountain of all power honour trust and distinction—that they have the absolute right of choosing the representatives that are to make their laws and of cashiering not only those representatives whenever they have forfeited their confidence but all such officers and magistrates also as by their arbitrary proceedings or corrupt practices impede the due execution of those laws a principle like this if followed through all its conclusions must shortly annihilate all party it is not possible if you admit so broad a principle for any combination of families however great or powerful or with how many thousand pompous and unmeaning titles soever they may have incumbered their insignificant names—it is impossible for any factious combination of his house and your house and tothers house and—the devil take your houses as mercutio says what have we to do with your houses—it is impossible i say for any combination of all their houses together if this broad principle were admitted to grasp and monopolize all power in their own hands as they now do the object would be lost for which family combinations are now made and the jargon of faction would stun our ears no more but the uniform practice of parties has shewn us that they are aware of this truth and therefore they have never thought fit to appeal to principles they have found fault indeed with particular measures and the outs have always shewn a most generous anxiety to displace the ins—to rout a minister that might be in power to day that they might get into the same degree of power tomorrow but however anxious they were that the reins of government should be shifted from hand to hand they have all displayed an equal unwillingness to infringing materially upon the power of the administration because say they though it is a very good thing to turn men out of their places into which we may by and bye turn ourselves it is for that very reason a very bad thing indeed to take the emoluments and patronage from those places and diminish their weight and consequence in the constitution     it must however be admitted that there are many liberal minds—men who in their hearts as far as they understand the subject are friends to liberty who entertain very different ideas of party from those i am now delivering the same lord lauderdale whom i have already quoted in his    th page expresses himself apparently with great strength of conviction upon the subject he says long convinced that the welfare of the country depends upon the existence of a body connected on those principles the whig party has been understood to possess that the nature of its government creates it that its preservation demands it i am by principle a party man i own citizens i have considerable respect for the man who thus commits himself freely and fully to the public a man who without any sort of disguise tells you what he really is and what are the principles he means to maintain gives you strong reason to suppose at least that he is sincere that he does in reality believe what he is supporting and that if there is any thing wrong in the opinion he advances it is an error of judgment not of a venal and corrupt disposition hypocrites generally disguise the principles or opinions they wish to maintain and insinuate with plausible inferences rather than enforce their doctrines by direct and open avowal to the credit of the author of this book no such artifice has been used we can examine his arguments fairly and openly he has put himself at issue with the public which i conclude he would not have done had he not felt a conviction that the opinion he was maintaining was right my opinion however is directly opposite to that which he entertains i believe also that the opinion he endeavours to uphold is going very much out of fashion i believe the people are rapidly making advances towards the discovery that instead of the salvation of the country depending upon party that it is party alone that has so long cajoled the people that the squabbles and contention of faction have too long drawn off the public attention from those real interests to the serious investigation of which they would otherwise have applied i hope to convince you however says lord lauderdale in the     page that though the calamities of war the involving us in which was the sacrifice mr pitt made to the duke of portland and his friends—i hope to convince you that the calamities of war i repeat it to you for it is a curious fact the involving us in which was the sacrifice mr pitt made to the duke of portland the duke you find     is here laid down to be the author of the present war and that the judgement of mr pitt was sacrificed a blessed upright character must he be indeed who so sacrificed his judgement in a question involving the lives of millions in order to cajole as in former cases he had so successfully cajoled the people but continues my author the calamities of war though they are more immediately felt their ultimate consequences cannot prove more seriously deplorable than the breaking up of the whig party the sacrifice—o mark how grateful these men are how they sacrifice alternately to each other the idol of today tomorrow is the worshipper and the worshipper of today is tomorrow the idol—and thus the sweet incense of their mutual sacrifices is offered up again and again while the rights of the people are burnt like so many faggots upon the altar to cook the precious banquet of places pensions honours and emoluments upon which they are to regale themselves thus then we are told that though pitt the tory as a sacrifice to the divine honours of the duke of portland plunged us into a calamitous war and though the whig duke of portland sacrificing his principles to the tory pitt gave support and energy to that war yet that the breaking up of the whig party was of more serious consequence than the war which has depopulated the country brought the nation to the eve of bankruptcy spread a general famine throughout europe and brought starvation to the very doors of our peasants and manufacturers all these circumstances are trifling and insignificant compared to the breaking in pieces that sublime idol the whig party to which the prayers of the people have been so often offered in vain without their ever once discovering that the deity of their adoration was peradventure sleeping or gone a long journey or which is nearer the truth had in reality yielded up the ghost but what have the whigs done for us ever since they became an aristocratic party i can tell you indeed what they did—and glorious things they were before they were debauched by aristocracy but since whiggism was an aristocratic party what have the whigs done look to their history from the period of the revolution to the present day reflect how much they might have done if they had been men of principle and integrity reflect how much they have left undone because principle and integrity were never prevalent in their hearts did they not lay the foundation of the national debt whose interest has now accumulated to so enormous a degree that more than twice as much is paid in annual taxes out of the labours of the  00 poor for the payment of the interest and of the ordinary expences they ought to be called extraordinary expences of government as is paid for all the labours of all the industrious poor from one extremity of the country to another did they not also give their sanction to the existence of a standing army an attempt to introduce which had been fatal to the house of stuart did they not knowing full well that the people of this country had a right—an indubitable till that time a legally unquestioned right to annual parliaments—did they not in the first instance pass that triennial bill which took away two thirds of the franchises of the people did they not afterwards from three years proceed to seven and having converted by their own votes and authority an annual senate into a triennial and a triennial senate into a septennial senate did they not thus establish a principle which if the enlightened spirit of the people did not at this time oppose might enable them to render the seats in the house of commons tenaments for life nay descendable property so that the portions of twelve square inches of plank in st stephens chapel might descend from father to son from generation to generation just as the tax upon coals descends from one duke of richmond to another till no one can find out the reason for which it was conferred or the benefit derived for it to the people did not these whigs countenance the passing of that riot act so exquisitely fitted for maintaining the purposes of regular and orderly government that a jury at birmingham properly picked and packed may require that the fact of absolutely pulling down and destroying houses be proved by good evidence and the rioters after all may be acquitted while a poor wretch for huzzaing at the downfall of a crimping house is condemned to the pains of death and suffers at the fatal tree without one tear dropped from the eye of patriotism one generous remonstrance from the people to stop the vindictive arm of courtly vengeance have they not as one of the means of fixing their fame and reputation upon a more solid foundation plunged the country into perpetual continental wars without its being possible for any rational man to discover any other reason for those wars than the desire of increasing their patronage and enriching the contractors and other bloodsuckers that might be dependant upon them so that as i have observed in the former lecture so early as in the reign of queen ann swift discovered that the men who called themselves whigs ought to have been denominated lovers of war and we find from the quotation of lord lauderdale himself  0  that whiggism has not lost its ancient desire for those exploits which spread the fame of an administration at the expence of the blood and treasure of the people so much then for the advantages which we have gained so much for the real benefits which have been conferred upon us by the whigs now let us consider what they have not done and when we put them together perhaps we may say in the language of a very sacred composition ye have done those things which ye ought not to have done and left undone those things which ye ought to have done and there is no help in ye have they ever extended the rights and immunities of the people have they abolished or attempted to abolish the vexatious destructive annihilating contribution of tithes those unjust and dreadful clogs upon agricultural improvement have they remedied the abuses of the law have they curtailed its delays have they diminished its expences have they removed its scandalous uncertainties no whig administration after whig administration has been formed but i wish any advocate for this most excellent and glorious party could point out to me any one act of this description which they have ever brought forward have they consented to the abolition of unjust privileges have they endeavoured to persuade the legislature of the country with the controul over which they have frequently been entrusted to take away from opulence and grandeur the priviledge of ruining the poor tradesmen who had credulity to trust them because forsooth their sacred persons were not to be amenable to the laws which for similar conduct would have doomed any of their fellow citizens to the horrors of a goal have they made any extensive advances towards the abolition of unjust and unmerited pensions have they retrenched the expences of office have they brought within rational and proper limits those enormous salaries which are paid out of the labour of the lowest the most despised but the most useful orders of society have they endeavoured by any regular or consistent plan to take care that a proper average should be kept up between the prices of labour and the prices of the necessary articles of provision far from it no regulations of this kind have ever been adopted and act after act has been made and sanctioned by all parties to punish the poor journeymen who associate together for the increase of wages while the rich manufacturers the contractors the monopolists of every description may associate as they please and in their conventions fix at their arbitrary will the prices of the commodities in which they deal hence a rapid advance in the price of every article of necessity while the wages of the labourers who produce these articles are left  0  to the caprice of those who have an interest in depressing them have they established seminaries for the annihilation of ignorance for the diffusion of intelligence among the great body of the people have they as the convention in france has done—let them look across the water and learn to blush at the virtue they are so forward to calumniate—have they disseminated their schools for the instruction of all ranks of people from one end of the country to the other so that the spot should no longer be found where ignorance could fix her residence and that virtue knowledge and benevolence should be found growing up thick as the wild flowers that surround the peasants mansion have they ever declared as a principle and endeavoured to confirm by any act of the legislature the unlimited freedom of the press a freedom without which liberty may be talked of but never can be enjoyed because it cannot be understood to conclude the whole where will you point me out the whig administration that has made any strides towards that great that momentous that all including object parliamentary reform nay so far have they been from advancing these principles while in power that even when they are out of power and endeavouring to get into power—when they are doing all they can to delude the people to make them the instruments of their exaltation even now they refuse to pledge themselves to this principle parliamentary reform forsooth we are told by whig associations is a subject that must not be agitated at this time the attention of the public must not be divided the calamitous situation which for want of parliamentary reform for they acknowledge that it is from the want of parliamentary reform that we have been plunged in to the present calamitous situation—these calamities are so great they tell us that we ought only to think of curing the present evil but not to think at all of eradicating the cause that is we are slightly to patch up the constitution—just to skin over the sore but leave the disease untouched it is true by and by it will break out again but then you know we shall be in place we shall have the advantages of nursing the sickly body politic and consequently of managing the possessions of the poor valetudinarian such is the plain english of the argument at this time held out to the people by the friends of the people or as some of the members of that club call them the friends to themselves citizens do you wish for a further proof that whigism and toryism is only a bite would you have any further conviction are not the whigs holding at this very minute the very language which the tory pitt upheld before he got into power  0  did he not join clubs and associations for the attainment of parliamentary reform nay though he found it difficult to remember you i dare say have not forgot that he met an assembly of delegates in convention for the purpose of obtaining this parliamentary reform and that he then upheld the doctrines of universal suffrage and annual parliaments which now assisted by the logic of the learned attorney general the still more learned sir john mitford sollcitor general and the superlative learned serjeant adair he undertakes to demonstrate to be the highest of all high treason yes pitt did associate the thatched house tavern has been conscious to his persuasive eloquence the demonstrations of the necessity of reform have flowed from his lips and have been echoed by every pannel of wainscoat throughout that great building and the duke of richmond has reverberated the invigorating sounds which were to amuse the people and get them into place yes these mighty alchymists once pretended to be indefatigable in search of the philosophers stone of political virtue but when the moment of projection arrived when the base metal of their professions was to be transmuted into the golden realities of places and pensions then what language did they hold out what was then their plan of parliamentary reform leave that entirely to me depend upon it i will sooner part with my existence than abandon the principles i have professed but leave to me the manner of the accomplishment we must not at this time investigate the particular manner in which it is to be brought about nor must we publicly pledge ourselves to the people to bring it about at all we are plunged into a calamitous war with america dont let us distract the attention of the people but let us keep to that one object fixing our minds upon that and that alone thus say they aloud to the people we shall be able to get a redress of your grievances but to their own party they say in a side whisper thus we shall get into place and when fortified there the swinish mulritude maygrunt it is only making a few new laws for the protection of placemen pensioners and boroughjobbers or getting a few ingenious lawyers to make the laws bear a meaning which no one ever supposed them to bear before and we will keep the rabble down make no doubt of it but can we suppose a minister of this country so stupid as to give up that most gainful part of his trade the management of the house of commons which he must give up if he pretends to violate the sacred property of boroughmongers and take from them their right once in seven years to sell the franchises of the people at the public market—called a general election  0  if such were the sentiments and conduct of pitt when out of place and such the pretences with which he deluded the people when he was upon the eve of getting in and if such is the language of that society which calls itself the friends of the people i should be happy to know if there is any difference between whig and tory which is the whig and which is tory for i profess i cannot discover but citizens they may delude themselves as much as they please they may flatter themselves with the examples of former times but their day of faction is past the people of this country will not be so cajoled again we hear them perpetually exclaiming there is no public—what can we do there is no public but there is a public—an enlightened glorious public in this country but not for them it is a public for principle not a public for party it is a public that seeks the happiness of the public and cares not one pin about the downfall of mr pitt or the elevation of mr fox or mr grey—in short there is a growing conviction among the people that party is all absurdity there is a growing conviction among the people that the only effect of party is the creation of tumults in which the people may be sacrificed but from which none but a few intriguers and hypocrites can reap advantage they are aware of the destructive tendency of all party they are aware also that the parties happily for mankind are working their own destruction as fast as they can that in a little time they must all fall together under the weight of their own profligacy and folly and it is therefore that the public stand patiently by and behold the feeble struggle without interest or exertion knowing that it is their duty only to be at their posts prepared to take advantage of the madness and weakness of those by whom they have been so long deluded and to restore to themselves at the proper season their long ravished rights such appears to me to be the state of politics and of the public mind and i exult in a prospect according to my calculation so replete with hopes of the most advantageous kind to the interests of humanity and liberty lord lauderdale however in the    d page of his work delivers an opinion in direct opposition to this he says a very little reflection must enable any one to detect the fallacy of the idea of the mischievous tendency of party and teach him to reject the opinion with respect to this country however generally it may be received party says he in reality will be found to be attended with advantage just in proportion to the degree the government under which it exists admits of its being founded  0  on principles in the simple forms of government there is no possible difference in principle which can give rise to combination and therefore party under them must always be productive of temporary often of permanent evil in a monarchy or a republic there can be no parties arising from a difference in principle but such as give birth to confusion they afford no subjects on which to combine but such as from their nature must tend to generate immediate convulsion in the one a difference of opinion with regard to the right to the crown or a desire totally to overturn the government upon account of real or ideal oppression both possessing the seeds of instant conflict are the only topics for which our imaginations enable us to conceive men can wish to combine or that the annals of times past shew us they have united there are under such a government no jarring principles upon which you can maintain different opinions the possession of power depends solely on the favour of the sovereign and favour is always more easily secured by individual address than by combined effort in the other the object which parties must naturally have and which history points out as their main pursuit is merely to support the pretensions of different individuals to public favour and whilst we recollect the evils of the disturbances attending such contests we cannot but remember how often they have ended solely in being the means of advancing the man of brilliant talents in preference to him whose more sound pretensions were founded upon the purity of his intentions—how often the crafty has been able to make party the engine of his elevation at the expence of the able the virtuous and discerning statesman so you see cisizens that with respect to a monarchical and also a republican form of government lord lauderdale can see the inconvenience of party you will see also by what he says of aristocracy for it is necessary to read this part of his work without mutilation that i may treat his arguments fairly that when he considers forms of government diffimilar to that of england he is accurate in his arguments and just in his conclusions but when he shows you why party is good in this country i think i shall show you that the delusions of habit fasten upon him in aristocracy says he the object of parties has been to support the pretensions of different families to power and though we have always seen them produce immediate calamity it is in vain we look for any permanent benefit to the society to compensate for the momentary evil the struggle is here alone for who shall have the privilege of oppression and the conduct of all men in power if not  0  well watched has but too great a resemblance to make us think that such a contest can produce any lasting good now citizens i admit the justice of this argument i admit also the accuracy of the painting relative to the nature of factions under aristocracies but i appeal to every man who hears me whether it is not a correct a concise and perfect picture of all the parties that have existed in this country for the last     years i call to your recollection whether you have not regularly found that the object of all parties has been to support the pretensions of different families to power i call to your recollection whether we have not seen them produce immediate calamity and whether we have not also found it in vain to look to them for any permanent benefit to the society at large i call upon you to consider seriously and minutely whether the struggle has not been alone for who shall have the privilege of oppressing and whether the conduct of men in power has not been so uniform as to convince us if experience can convince that here in england we can have no expectation whatever of any advantage any benefit from these contentions of faction but the aggrandisement and emolument of a few particular families combined together under the nick names whigs and tories—the guelphs and gibbeollines of the british empire if then citizens this argument is true as i believe it is if the statement is as accurate as to me it appears what is the conclusion why that whatever may be the form and exterior appearance of our government we are in reality living under a virtual aristocracy we may talk of our mixed constitution of our kings lords and commons but in reality it is the spirit of aristocracy that keeps the ascendency and all the difference that has existed between whigs and tories from the unfortunate restoration to the present time has been nothing more than a struggle which of the combinations of aristocratical families should grasp the government of the country into their own hands and monopolize to themselves the exclusive advantages and aggrandizement produced from the labours of seven millions and an half of people what party i have asked you the question before and i repeat it what party has ever conferred any lasting any real benefit upon the people which of them has ever eased the weight of taxes which of them has ever assented to the sacrifice of a portion of their enormous salaries towards paying that national debt which in the struggle of factions and the projects of their ambition has been accumulated upon the shoulders of those who are doomed to pay the interest though they never reaped any benefit from the expenditure of the principle they may blame when out of office this  0  measure or that but which of the parties when they got into power has refused to take advantage of the very measures which they had blamed the whigs for we had a whig administration a little while even during the present reign—the whigs no great while ago you remember imposed a receipt tax upon the people and the great leader of that whig or coalition administration told you a receipt was a luxury—perhaps because those in connection with them seldom wanted a receipt the other party abused the tax yet when they came in did they abolish it no the receipt tax still continues to be paid by all those who have not the honesty and confidence to trust to each others memorandums rather than contribute when they can avoid it to the support of this infamous war this coalition administration also framed an india bill by which they meant to have grasped into their own hands a large portion of the patronage of india pitt declaimed against it all the outs declaimed against the ins and at last the outs became the ins and the ins got out yet what did the victors do why they effected in a jesuitical manner every thing which the other administration openly attempted they first brought in one india bill which did half the business that the bill of mr fox professed and then they brought in another to interpret and explain the former by which they did the other half of the business rather in a more snug and silent manner it is true but full as effectually as their opponents intended and thus by the management of that sublime juggler signior pittachio passes the wealth power and patronage of india hey presto into the possession of the obsequious dundas instead of being grasped by the itching fingers of messrs fox  co during the american war the whigs were vehement against the tory administration of lord north no language was sufficiently acrimonious no opposition sufficiently intemperate to shew their abhorrence of that war and its abettors gibbets halters and axes danced through their speeches in all the mazes of metaphorical frenzy nay they went so far as to tell you that if they were to trust themselves in a room with the man who had plunged the country into that unfortunate war they should deserve and might expect assassination but mark their consistency by and by the denunciator and the denounced shake hands like lovers that have quarrelled become so much the fonder in proportion to the bitterness with which they formerly abused each other and john bull is amused and astonished to behold the fierce and mighty carlo chan and his fair spouse en cordon blue make their triumphal entry into st jamess palace  0  such have been the recent consistencies of those virtuous advocates those great pillars of party in this country and we find the same fort of conduct still pursued during that american war to which i have before alluded burke was a most flaming whig—faith he had good reason so to be the marquis of rockingham the leader of the whigs lent him £ 0000 to purchase a qualification that he might sit in the house of commons and bark whiggism for him he took a bond for this £ 0000 but never called for any interest and when the marquis died he cancelled the obligation by his will and thus made this burke a present of the £ 0000 and of the interest also this was certainly no bad bargain for the sublime and beautiful driver of the swinish multitude it was carrying his pigs to a fine market but the marquis had not long been dead—the £ 0000 had not been long secure—the bonds had not long been burnt before burke found out that being a whig was a very bad trade the party appeared to have shut up shop in a state of bankruptcy and he was afraid he should never be able to sell any more of his oratorical commodity to them at so good a rate what then does this famous champion of party do he bellows forth mad as one of the heroes in lees mad tragedies with a dagger in one hand and a crucifix in the other and swears he can never sleep in his bed again till original toryism reigns triumphant over the world and liberty is exterminated from the face of the earth he tells you that daggers are principles that philosophy is assassination and with all the bitterness and virulence which billingsgate itself could afford strangely mixed up with all the sublimity of parnassus pours forth the most lavish abuse upon every man who dared to maintain the sacred principles of the rights of man what would a philosopher be without scholars and what would scholars be good for if they did not follow the examples of their philosophic teachers wyndham who had been educated in the school of burkism trod in the same path surpassed him in metaphysical rant and out did him in all his extravagancies in no great space of time forsooth spencer cut off the tail from his foxs coat and became a tory also—portland followed—to give a new front of solid stone i suppose to the tottering edifice of the constitution which the men he coalesced with had brought so near to ruin under the same banner of apostocy marched over the great and mighty earl fitzwilliam who in the hour of spleen and the intemperate rage of disappointment lamenting the loss of the patronage of ireland has done what party men very seldom did before spoken the  0  truth the whole truth and i believe nothing but the truth as fully and as explicitly nay more fully and more explicitly unless he had a better memory than pitt than he would have done in evidence upon his oath at the old bailey how futile how ridiculous after these examples will appear the following arguments of lord lauderdale page     he says in our constitution however having shown you that party is a bad thing in an aristocracy in our constitution however of which in theory—he modestly says in theory we are taught to admire the beauties as proceeding from a due mixture of all the different forms of government there must arise naturally a difference of opinion on principle in other words the component parts of which our constitution is framed according to lord lauderdale heaven forbid i should utter such a treasonable opinion as my own are of such jarring and discordant natures so incapable of harmonious union that nothing can keep them intire nothing can preserve the texture and form of our government but the wranglings of party and faction by which the people are distracted from one end of the country to the other without knowing in reality what are the causes of contention a bitter satire this if it is true upon the boasted constitution of this country a bitter satire indeed upon that which we are called upon to respect for what is any form of government good for if it cannot be preserved by tranquillity and unanimity by the harmony of the people at large but lord lauderdale tells you that in such a constitution as this if that unanimity if that harmony existed the constitution must perish it must tumble it can only be supported by the three parties one pulling one way and another pulling another while the people like butchers boys patting their dogs on the backs are to keep up their mettle in the contest and finally be snarled at and torn to pieces themselves as the signal of the reconciliation of the combatants such a difference of opinion continues he in the next page cannot long subsist without the existence of party founded on principle the friends of monarchy have in the person of the monarch a common bond of union they derive from his councils a source of unity of action poor and feeble would be the resistance which the isolated efforts of the disunited advocates of freedom could make against such an attack there is nothing in their pursuit which naturally connects them but they must soon see the necessity of uniting to preserve the value of that   0 for which they all contend—that is to say for places power and patronage—against the efforts of those who from their situation naturally present themselves in phalanx but citizens if the legislative power the controuling authority of the country were built upon the fair principles of universal right if power were confessedly derived from the people and responsible to the people how could there possibly be any such phalanx existing in the country if the house of commons were as it pretends to be the real representative of the people it could never be managed and controuled by a minister appointed by any party of faction whatever and therefore there would want no other check than the intelligence and virtue of the people which the system of universal representation has so grand a tendency to awaken and preserve the folly of resisting the attack of an invading enemy continues lord lauderdale by individual exertion is too great too apparent not soon to generate under such a government as ours the appearance of popular party to counteract the efforts of court intrigue and as in the form of our constitution we perceive a natural tendency to produce a party of this description so the benefits that must arise from it are too obvious not to strike any man who suffers his mind to consider the subject under the simple forms of government party can alone tend to overturn the existing constitution or to create temporary disturbances without affording the hopes of permanent benefit under our mixed form of government party on principles has a direct propensity effectually to preserve a due balance between the various branches of the government and by the powerful check which through this means the supporters of freedom are enabled to give to the gradual encroachments of the crown it has a tendency to prevent that ultimate disturbance mark citizens how speciously this part of the argument is worded it has a tendency to prevent that ultimate disturbance—to prevent disturbance is certainly a good thing at all times but mark what is hid under this sort of reasoning—that ultimate disturbance which the imperceptible extension of influence is sure to create when it has made such advances that the hoary head of inveterate abuse can no longer draw reverence or obtain protection from the multitude—in other words when the hoary head of inveterate abuse can no longer draw reverence or obtain protection from the multitude party by     drawing the attention of the people from the real and main subject of enquiry is the only thing which can disappoint them in the attainment of a real and radical reform when ministerial oppression has arrived at this height the power of reason will operate in conjunction with the feelings of the people and then if no deluding pretender no tool of party distracts their attention from that which ought to be the subject of their consideration reform will take place the hoary head of inveterate abuse will be laid low in the dust this is the consequence that must ensue if party forsooth does not step forward rearing again the fallen idol and throwing the veil of plausible pretension over the defects whose naked deformity had become too glaring to the public eye to be endured without the assistance of such artifice but citizens whatever may be the opinion of this advocate for whiggism with respect to the speculative or theoretical constitution of this country he is of opinion that the advantages of party are still more eminently displayed by considering what the practice of the constitution is for every one has found out that the practice is one thing and theory another in this respect considering what the practice of the constitution is continues he p     party then appears more than ever necessary the benefits arising from it are still more conspicuous for if party constituted on sound principle when we consider the constitution as theory represents it seemed to form its best nourishment—when cramped and crippled by its habitual disorder corruption—the habitual disorder of this constitution he admits is corruption lord mornington and mr pitt contend that it is one of the component parts a sort of vital habit that grew with its growth and strengthened with its strength and without which it could not subsist see last debate on greys motion for parliamentary reform—when cramped and crippled by its habitual disorder corruption—it is the best medicine that the wisdom of the politician can prescribe in proportion as corruption increases it becomes necessary and now when in a manner it has universally pervaded the frame of government without such a combination we can hardly look with hopes of safety to its existence citizens i shall not absolutly deny the truth of this part of the argument of lord lauderdale but i will draw this conclusion that if it is really true as he here asserts that the frame of this constitution is such and the corruption of     this constitution such that nothing but faction nothing but party can maintain even the exterior form of its existence carthage must fall—it wants no army of sans culottes to overthrow it it wants no insurrection or turbulence from within—no pressure of hostile force from without if what he says be true if nothing but party can support it the props are rotten as the foundations and it is tumbling already about the ears of those whose cabals and intolerable corruption have sapped and undermined it for party in one sense of the word is now no more whiggism and toryism have been laid in the peaceful grave dundas has dug deep and low the grave into which they have been tumbled burke has said mass over them and pitt fox and north portland and fitzwilliam moira elliot and windham have joined in concert to sing the eternal requium and so farewell—a long farewell to all the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious whiggism and toryism for they are gone for ever—have sunk like the stars that fall to rise no more parties themselves have sealed the destruction of parties the people are at issue with them all principles are the objects they are intent upon and i shall not so far satyrize the constitution of my country whatever lord lauderdale may do as to suppose that as soon as the rotten pretences of party are removed and the real investigation of principles commences its glories must end and its very fabric tumble into ruins but citizens there is another thing to be considered namely that the whole of this defence rests upon the supposition that party is to be formed upon principle now a little investigation will show us that these are terms totally contradictory to each other it is a figure of rhetoric borrowed from the meritorious imagination of the poet claudian where the epithet is at constant war with the substantive party and principle stand in direct opposition to each other like nocturnal day and meridian night party is a compact and association of individuals an agreement that whatever way you vote i will vote the same my family interest shall combine with your family interest my borough with your borough when you are in place i will be in place also and we will divide the good things between us when you are out i will be out also and we will bark together as loud as we can against whoever may come in and whatever they may do principle says we will investigate what is true consider what are the elements of government     what the purposes for which it was instituted and according to the conviction of our individual minds each individual will vote each individual will promote those measures for the happiness of mankind which principle dictates to him there is one thing upon which we shall eternally and invariably agree and perhaps but one—namely that the government of the whole ought to be government for the whole—for the common and equal benefit of all how this common and equal benefit may be best secured there may be a variety of opinions and the majority of voices must decide this is the dictate of principle and we might as well talk of darkness produced by noon daylight as principles produced by party but let us refer to practice let us review the conduct of the most virtuous leaders of the opposition at this time let us turn to the demosthenes of that party in parliament i respect the private virtues of the man i lament only that he has mistaken a particular feeling for virtue which i believe to be vice and that thereby he has suffered connections to draw him from the principles his heart would otherwise have dictated why should this great man with all his intelligence of mind have stood up in the house of commons to warn the people against referring to elementary principles and abstract propositions what—a party upon principle afraid to investigate principles what can be so absurd what reason can there be for those who act upon principle being afraid that principles should be enquired into—the question needs no answer but is it not principle alone that is annihilated by party it obscures also the lustre of genius behold its palsying influence on the greatest minds alas i cannot but conclude that the great talents of fox—the splendour of mind which characterizes sheridan—in many respects the upright and generous sheridan could never have been so obscured and lost during a period so favourable for rouzing all the vigour of intellect as the present but for this party spirit oppressing and annihilating that energy which an appeal to first principles and nothing but an appeal to first principles calls so effectually forth could otherwise the debates in our parliament during this important crisis have been so dull so insipid so spiritless that no energetic mind can read them without falling to sleep could this have been the case but that this damning soporific principle—or rather no principle of party renders all who taste insensible to the happiness and rights of mankind and     absorbs every faculty in consideration of the interests of a few individuals with whom they happen to be connected yes citizens this false moderation has i believe restrained the powers and energies of these great men moderation—moderation—a compromise between right and wrong—i detest it but when i speak against moderation let me be understood there is a sense in which i reprobate moderation as the most contemptible of vices there is a sense also in which i venerate it as the first of virtues in our passions in our actions in our intercourse with mankind let moderation be our guiding principle for without moderation cruelty will rage where liberty and benelence ought to smile without moderation revenge will transform the human character to the likeness of the fiend and all the godlike principles of science justice and truth will fall into oblivion but moderation of principle let us abhor for what is moderation of principle but a compromise between right and wrong an attempt to find out some path of expediency without going to the first principles of justice such attempts must always be delusive to the individual and fatal to mankind if there is any thing sacred it is principle let every man investigate seriously and solemnly the truth and propriety of the principles he adopts but having adopted let him pursue them into practice let him tread in the path which they dictate and virtue will be his reward nothing but delusion and hypocrisy can dread the investigation of principle that which is delusive will be detected by that investigation it is therefore party that trembles at principle but truth delights in it the rights the happiness the welfare of mankind depend upon the thorough investigation of principles but the security of party the monopoly of particular privileges and advantages the delusive ridiculous supposition that one family is by virtue of its origin more virtuous or more to beconfided in than another will indeed be overthrown the instant that principles are generally investigated and therefore party and principle will for ever be at war there is one principle however to which party has no great objection the principle of selfinterest and this i believe we shall find to be the principle of them all at least in the extraordinary letter of earl fitzwilliam to the earl of carlisle it is publicly avowed to be the principle of the seceding whigs he says when the duke of portland and and his friends were to be enticed into a coalition with mr     pitts administration it was necessary to hold out such lures as would make the coalition palatable—where is now the pretence of rallying round the constitution—where is now the boasted virtue of forgetting all indignities in the public danger—the security of the public peace was indeed a plausible pretence—plots and conspiracies were necessary stalking horses—but something very different was crouching behind and lures were necessary to make the coalition palatable and what were these lures—no trifles i assure you baubles and blue ribbons had their charm it is true but these were only the whip syllabubs of the banquet and the seceders tired with the long lent of whiggism expected to regale their palates with more solid food if the general management and superintendance of ireland had not been offered to his grace the coalition could never have taken place accordingly it was offered from the beginning of the negociation as was also the home department of secretary of state that is to say his lordships principles—for whigs you are told you know are a party upon principle—were rated at too high a price to be purchased by any thing less than a secretaryship of state and the patronage attached to it with the management and direction power and patronage of ireland see citizens how very fairly and how very liberally upon what a thorough commercial system these pure and immaculate rulers—these hereditary proprietors of the swinish herd can carry on this barter of places and principles ask the duke of portland you will see also there is a little swindling in the trade of state as well as other branches of commerce—halhead tells us you know he sold his soul upon credit and now he is obliged to appeal to divine inspiration to get the pledge back again for as to the money it has never been paid and he tells you in direct terms he is much inclined to suppose not one shilling of it ever will in this peculiar wholesale market of souls credit has got to a considerable height and swindling is refined into a science—so that those who have taken promises in payment will find they have sold their souls in vain i dont know whether the duke had sold his soul i cannot say whether it may not be the case with dukes as mahometans say of the fair sex that they have no souls at all—certainly he had some thing to sell and mark how it was bargained for ask the duke of portland when he engaged to accept if he doubted that the office offered to him was to be entire and such as     his predecessors held it ask him if he was forewarned by mr pitt that it was to be divested of half its duties half its importance and all its character ask him if he was apprised that another secretary of state was to be made out of the department and that he was to be left but a joint possessor with an inmate ask him when he accepted the management of ireland—he the management of ireland—so then the duke of portland was to be king de facto of the irish nation—and earl fitzwilliam was to have been his viceroy but no—so material a part of the performance was not to be left in such unskilful hands the shew was to have another manager and the wires of the respective puppets were to be kept in motion by the chief proprietor—ask him when he accepted the management of ireland if he did it under any restrictions whatever ask him if he pressed it upon me under any and if he did not propose and recommend to me to lay myself out—one man sells his soul another his character and another lays himself out out it is all in hopes of good interest he would not so much as lend his name by way of accommodation to a factious bill without he thought there would be good interest ask him if he did not propose and recommend to me to lay myself out immediately for making such arrangements in the government as would enable me to restore peace tranquillity and order in the country and as would reconcile the general mass of the people but my dear carlisle the instant we had proclaimed our acceptance the scene began to open—why how comes it that this great man one of the heads of the aristocracy that is to say of course one of the wisest of the wisest of the people could not take a peep behind the curtain before the farce began other persons it seems had been present at the rehearsal for during my pleasant residence last summer in the mansions of the tower i remember to have read in the morning chronicle the post and the courier the very secret and mystery of the plot which his lordship was obliged to sit the whole play to discover the writers for these papers unravelled the whole plot in the prologue but he at the end of the fifth act comes forward and in the epilogue after the manner of the old drama to untwist the riddle the scene began to open then it was first discovered that the object of all this mighty work was not to strengthen administration by an accession of character but to debase degrade and disgrace that character to be concluded in our next     the tribune no x saturday   th may      strictures on the letters of lord lauderdale to the peers of scotland and of earl fitzwilliam on the affairs of ireland——the second lecture on the distinction between the spirit of party and the principle of liberty continued from the last number the instant we had proclaimed our acceptance the scene began to open then it was first discovered that the object of all this mighty work was not to strengthen administration by an accession of character but to debase degrade and disgrace that character when the junction was irrevocably avowed and declared then the pretensions of mr dundas to the continued management of the war were immediately brought forward and a new office was to be cabbaged out of the duke of portlands i am very glad to find that our great peers begin to adopt the language of the swinish multitude it is a prophetic dawn of their sanscullotism—a happy omen of the approach of liberty and equality which i have no doubt will soon arrive—a new office was to be cabbaged out of the duke of portlands and an obvious diminution of his credit and authority was proclaimed in other words the duke of portland was to be made clerk or rather servant to dundas and his livery was to be a piece of blue ribbon no sooner had i declared my acceptance of the lieutenancy of ireland than delay interposed and soon doubts and difficulties arose and now citizens i think we have one of the prettiest pieces of stockjobbing duplicity that could ever have been learned among the jews in change alley it is a matter of public notoriety in this country but the noble lord has but just been able to discover it that mr pitt assured lord westmorland as early as august that he should not     be removed and i know that i could bring evidence to prove that in the course of the autumn he pointed out my actual successor as the person to succeed my predecessor citizens among those jilts whom we call courtezans i understand it is a maxim that it is a good thing to have two strings to the bow but a state jilt finds it better to have three that he may first twang the one and then twang the other and then twang the third and send forth the dart from that which is likely to go furthest towards the goal of his own interest knowing the importance we gave to the system then pursuing relative to france—oh dismal system whigs and tories united together for the annihilation of the liberties of europe knowing the importance we gave to the system then pursuing relative to france—a precious system that could receive importance from such individuals such principles and such intellects he snatched at the opportunity and made that the means of disgracing our characters in other words he had found out that they had no characters at all and was determined that the public should be made as wife as himself and thus did he succeed in rendering us fit for no other service but to be his vile tools and instruments he thought that object perfected and complete then he cared not how soon he turned us adrift to all the disgrace and contempt it was his expectation and wish should attach upon our characters spirit of blindness and infatuation—can the oracles of party step forward and publish such truths as these and not perceive that they are sealing the instrument of their own eternal infamy and insuring the irrevocable inheritance of contempt yes fitzwilliam is kicked away by and by portland will be kicked away in the same manner—the minister however has taken care if he should fall into a fit of despair in consequence of his disappointment that he shall not be in want of a garter to put an end to his miserable existence yet after all this acknowledged infamy mark the high tone of aristocracy—i have says earl fitzwilliam the glory of being objectionable to mr pitt he now finds out that it is a glory to be objectionable to that man with whom for sake of the emoluments and patronage of ireland he coalesced a few months ago and with whom he would have continued to have cooperated to this very day if he would have suffered him to have any share of the loaves and fishes which the minister is accumulating to himself     the glory of being objectionable to mr pitt no fitzwilliam no glory and you have shook hands and parted and reputation and esteem have followed her i will tell you how you might have had the glory of being objectionable to this man you might have been honest you might have been upright in your principles you might have persevered in the cause of liberty and virtue and with undaunted fortitude pursued the general happiness of the people—then you would have been sure of the glory of being obnoxious to pitt and a glory indeed it would have been in the eyes of the universe and of all succeeding ages but to talk of the glory of being obnoxious to a man who has made you his tool and instrument to swindle ireland of her men and money and then throws you away with neglect and contempt is language too ridiculous i assure you to gull the swinish multitude however it may succeed with the narrow intellects of courts and factions and to say afterwards that he has not rendered your character subservient to his views is talking that at which children themselves would laugh the very drivellers in the street would point their fingers at the man who could make use of such logic as this i have bargained for the wages of iniquity and was refused my reward i therefore stand up before the people and talk of my character and glory in being made obnoxious to the being by whom i am thus disappointed citizens such is the letter and such are the facts which earl fitzwilliam has submitted to the public what is the conclusion we are to draw from it i believe it is simply this—that no man is to be trusted who has ever had any connection with any party whatever i know there are men who consider themselves as whigs who will say this is judging harshly these men have coalesced we grant but we have held out yes citizen whigs—if citizens you will be called but i fancy you would be much offended if you heard me call you so—yes ye scanty relics of the tattered banner of party you have held out remember the language of william iii i have not places enough for them all or else i should soon be able to reconcile the differences of contending parties—two stars keep not together the same course nor can the cabinet brook the double reign of billy chatham and of c j fox but give them what credit we will for their motives what have they done what consistency have they displayed mark what has been their conduct during the present struggle the first session that the mania of alarm burst out among us when proclamations were posted in every street when the   0 militia were called out and parliament assembled in a hurry fox comes down to the house of commons reprobates the meditated war speaks in the most direct and open manner so that i really thought he had at last determined to act as the consistent friend of the people—condemns the alarm treats it as a juggle and a ministerial trick and brands the associations with merited infamy what does he do the next day why he goes with his aristocratic friends to the parish meeting of st georges hanoversquare and puts his name to one of these very associations the alarming introduction of which he had so recently reprobated mark the next step of these whigs they condemn the war yet what do they do vote supplies for the vigorous prosecution of that war they affirm that it is a war levelled at the liberties of europe yet calling themselves the friends of liberty—they say if you do go to war we are determined to support you is not this like the coqueting of a young lady who slaps her lovers face with her fan and calls him a naughty devil and yet gives him to understand that if he is determined to kiss her she must per force submit either the liberties of europe are or are not at stake in this war if they feel an honest conviction that these liberties are struck at how can they vote for prosecuting it with energy if they are convinced that it is not a war hostile to the liberties of europe but a just and necessary war why oppose it principle would have pointed out a straight line party always leads into serpentines and mazes till you know not where you are going nor where you set out from mark their proceedings respecting the justiciary court of scotland they make a motion in behalf of muir and palmer but they disdain to mention the sanscullotish names of skirving margarot and gerrald men suffering in the same cause—men suffering under the same cruel arbitrary and unjust sentences call it high treason if you will to arraign the proceedings of the courts of scotland but while i have breath i will call them as they themselves have called them arbitrary sentences but muir and palmer because supposed to be a little less connected with sanscullotish principles because they were not members of the convention were to be named in the house of commons but the name of margarot to whose upright integrity the greatest aristocrat cannot refuse his admiration and the virtuous skirving already gone to the inhospitable shores of new holland were not to be mentioned—nor     gerald now languishing under the miseries of disease and persecution lying upon a vile hammock unfit for a common felon—this man whose faculties and powers of mind surpass in gigantic energy almost every individual existing in the country—this man whom doctor parr the tutor of mackintosh the tutor of sheridan and the tutor of gerald also has declared to be by far the cleverest man he ever had under his tuition—this man is to languish unpitied and unnamed—this glorious energy of intellect is to lie neglected and not a party man has virtue to reverberate his name or publish his virtues and the injustice of his persecutors an annuity of  000 a year could the props and pillars of party collect by subscription for a man who has been toiling all his life time to be chancellor of the exchequer or first lord of the treasury and been disappointed in that virtuous and useful pursuit three thousand a year has been given to him to console him for the disappointment but poor gerald attached to no party whom nothing but virtue and principle can bias—poor gerald is left unsupported and unprotected to receive his daily bread from the scanty pittances which the honest shoemakers and mechanics of the town can save from the hard earnings of the week for the support of virtue and the alleviation of unmerited suffering what talk you of parties upon principle while men whose only crime is principle are languishing in want and neglect if there is is such a thing as principle in the human breast this must be one of the first results of reason that for principle whether mistaken or not no man shall languish without that generous assistance which those in affluent circumstances might so easily afford citizens the plain and simple fact is this let me impress it upon your minds if you wish for the fruits of virtue if you wish for the fruits of liberty truth and justice seek them not from the rotten blasted bough of party they grow not there these fruits are only to be expected to borrow a beautiful illustration from doctor parr from the solid trunk of virtuous habit growing out of the deep root of virtuous principle     the second lecture on the moral and political influence of the prospective principle of virtue for the first see tribune no vii citizens the subject of this evenings lecture is the prospective principle of virtue it will be remembered that some evenings ago the first time i had the pleasure of meeting you after a melancholy circumstance had taken place in my family i delivered a lecture upon this subject a subject to the choice of which i was led in a considerable degree by the state of my feelings i was conscious of the duty of struggling with those sentiments of regret which we cannot wholly avoid when deprived of those who are dear to us and i recollect that one of the most pleasing and efficacious methods of rivetting instruction in our own minds is to endeavour to impart it to others and i therefore upon that evening undertook to prove that virtue is a prospective not a retrospective principle that it regards always those things we are to look forward upon not those to which we may look back citizens i had no sooner determined to treat upon this subject than i found the extreme importance of considering it with accuracy and giving it an extensive investigation it will not however be surprising to you that i should feel myself under such circumstances incompetent to give that methodical and orderly arrangement to which the subject is entitled for notwithstanding all our boasts fortitude itself is a struggle and when we are struggling against powerful passions our thoughts may occasionally flow perhaps with considerable energy but they will generally be uttered in a loose and unconnected woy i found accordingly after i had concluded that i had very imperfectly performed the task i had undertaken that many important topics had not been touched at all and particularly one important branch of my subject which perhaps i was called upon to investigate with some degree of boldness and accuracy because i had shocked in a considerable degree the prejudices of some of my hearers by having promised to attempt to prove that gratitude is in reality no virtue i have been induced therefore to consider the subject again and to bring before you those parts of the argument into which i did not sufficiently enter and though this subject may in the first view appear considerably metaphysical and though many     persons may expect that the investigation will not be sufficiently political i believe this suspicion will be found only to originate from not having sufficiently considered the nature of the subject the fact is that the great question whether virtue is or is not always a prospective principle is one of those which takes in an almost boundless range of investigation perhaps no question in morals or politics can possibly be started which has not some degree of reference to it and i hope i shall be able to prove that the proper understanding of the subject is of equal importance to practical utility as to the accurate arrangement of ideas comprehended in the investigation i think i shall be able to shew that the prospective principle of virtue that is to say that principle which looks forward always to the advantages and benefits that are to be attained—which thinks of nothing but promoting the present and future happiness of society is a principle the most magnificent extensive and generous in its influence upon the human character of any that can be devised citizens if we could but persuade ourselves not only in theory but in practice to keep our eyes thus constantly before us i have no doubt but we should be able to produce a harvest of felicity of which mankind as yet entertain no conception that we should be stimulated to a degree of energy that would expand the human intellect enlarge the political powers of man and produce a universal triumph of happiness throughout the universe—that we should convert all the passions powers and energies of man now so frequently wasted in profligacy revenge or apathy into powerful engines to promote the general happiness and to enlarge the capacities of our species citizens this proposition might in a considerable degree be illustrated from what all of us must have observed in the intercourses of private life if we regard the human character such as we find it we cannot but reflect upon the considerable degree of force and activity which the youthful character displays in proportion as it is inspired by the energies of hope in preference to that tendency to regret and melancholy which frequently distinguishes the later period of life for what is this hope but an enthusiastic ardour of the mind that keeps the eye constantly fixed on things that are before hence not only the human intellect unfolds to a degree which could not otherwise be accomplished but we     also find the youthful character struggling with and frequently surmounting dangers and difficulties which but for this prospective principle would sink them listless to the earth and consign them to hopeless desperation we find them also frequently springing forward to the full attainment of objects which to the cold eye of censure appear unattainable and which occasion the soidisant moralists of the day to ridicule and censure their daring enthusiasm citizens could we carry this principle into the political world—could we persuade mankind to consider the universe as in reality it is one continuous system of animated being and could we persuade the individual to think himself only a part a portion of that great and as far as we can perceive immortal existence think how those energies would be prolonged and reflect what must be the beneficent consequences for why does age droop into despondency why is the vigour the ardour of the youthful character suppressed by the chilling hand of experience is it because we have found that hope and exertion are of no avail no—it cannot be let any individual who has once felt this enthusiastic ardor consider what he has attained by its means and it is impossible that he should conclude that ardor and enthusiasm are fruitless what is the reason then that the energies of the human character are of such short duration citizens the reason is this man when considerably advanced in life thinks he has but little to look forward to and therefore slides imperceptibly into the retrospective dwells upon that which is past seeks his pleasures and his gratifications from the remembrance of what is no more and thence drops too often into regret repining melancholy and dissatisfaction from reflecting upon those parts of his past history which he cannot approve or which if he does approve are accompanied with the melancholy conviction that they can return no more these are the consequences of the selfish system that man who considers himself as an isolated individual who believes that all his exertions ought to be made for his individual benefit soon has reason to relax in his exertions he finds that he is approaching towards the catastrophe he wishes to avoid that there is little for him to hope for little for him to wish his anxiety for the future is only a gloomy consideration of his approaching dissolution and he therefore resigns that energetic character which in youth had been the     source of his delight and prosperity and sinks into that disposition to regret and melancholy which is equally barren to himself and injurious or at least unproductive to society but if we extend our view a little further if we consider that man lives not for himself alone but that every existing being each individual that participates the feelings and sensations of which he himself is conscious—all that have the same common faculties with himself are entitled to the same enjoyments and the same rights that year after year generation after generation ages after ages and myriads of ages after myriads may pass away and still society exist to reap the benefit of our exertions then our energy becomes as it were immortal and the desire the hope the anxiety to labor for human happiness can only terminate with existence because there only can terminate that satisfaction which the virtuous mind conceives from the consciousness of laboring to promote the general felicity from the conviction that unborn ages may taste the harvest which his virtue is cultivating citizens such i conceive with respect to the energies of the human character are the effects that must result from considering virtue as a prospective principle it creates to man a sort of eternal interest in the advancement of virtue and happiness it enlarges every day in proportion as his knowledge enlarges the sphere of his activity and consequently it is likely to be productive of effects to society which nothing but such a principle can possibly produce but it may be said what avails to me the felicity that is to be enjoyed by unborn ages why should i exert myself for happiness that is to be tasted an hundred thousand years to come citizens this way of arguing may look like philosophy but it partakes very little of benevolence and still less of a thorough knowledge of the sources of human happiness it is true we may not live to realize a very large portion of the happiness we are laboring to produce some of it certainly we must behold because if our labours in the cause of general happiness are continual the harvest will be springing up day after day but this proportion you say is small—true this proportion if you consider this only may be small but is this all that man enjoys those atoms which compose the individuals that surround me some few years hence may perhaps be winnowed in the gale in the eternal     revolutions of matter they may be transmuted into various forms flow in the wave mount with the element of fire or mingle with their parent dust but have we therefore no interests in the enjoyments of posterity—yes we have incontemplation we enjoy them in the noble and sublime satisfaction which springs from the consciousness of laboring from the most disinterested principles in the promotion of the grandest cause in which the faculties of man can be employed and though you may not live to see the whole of those benefits you are toiling to produce if you cannot anticipate them and enjoy them in prospect while you are toiling i pity the coldness and sordidness of your imaginations the principle of retrospective virtue if such a contradiction may be permitted is however of a very different description the passions it engenders are almost uniformly the very reverse of benevolence instead of imparting energy it begets listlessness instead of permanent happiness it produces a sensual disposition to the gratification of the moment and instead of ardent labor to promote the welfare of mankind it generates the gloom of hatred the rancour revenge and the eternal brooding of malignant passions that disturb the universe and deform the character of man the most conspicuous of the pretended virtues of this system—for there is hardly any passion however vile or base which has not in some country or some age been dignified with the name of virtue the most conspicuous of the pretended virtues of this retrospective system may be classed under a very few heads the first i shall hold out to your observation is nationality a certain ingenious set of romance writers called english historians having time after time told you very pompous stories of frenchmen cut into fritters by english valour of mountains of spaniards looked to death by the terrors of the british eye you are taught by these fine stories to contract an affection and veneration for the exploits of these glorious proficients in the science of human butchery and hence you are taught to consider of course that as the persons who tell all these great exploits bore the name of englishmen you ought to love the character of englishmen better than any other and to hold all other beings in contempt without enquiring whether they do not possess the same powers of mind nay whether the romance writers of other countries that is to say their historians have not in return made those spaniards     and frenchmen cut myriads of english dogs into fritters in the same miraculous manner in short you are to love englishmen because they are descended from those englishmen who as you are told murdered the natives of france in inconceivable numbers and you are to hate all frenchmen run away emigrants now excepted because they are descended from the frenchmen so murdered hence citizens that perpetual animosity between nation and nation what—am i who am descended from britons who have so frequently scourged those dogs of france—am i to suffer a frenchman to consider himself my equal shall i who pretend to be so proud of liberty suffer a frenchman to think of liberty for himself—no it is an insult to the sacred records of british story and remembering the cutthroat virtues of my ancestors i must be sure to carry on the same trade of cutting throats in my time also another species of this kind of partiality is the spirit of party proceeding also from the retrospective notion of virtues derived from ancestors—i have known gout stone and gravel to be derived from ancestors but no one ever yet found the power of transmuting virtue intellect or learning from father to child but in remembrance of virtuous acts forsooth which the heroes of particular houses have accomplished we are to bow down in veneration to those particular houses we are to love the whigs because some of their ancestors stole the name from the scotch sans cullottes who stood about   0 years ago so boldly and conspicuously forward in vindication of the rights of man we are to revere sects in politics and religion also because our ancestors were brought up in those political and religious notions and as we have looked back for the example it follows of course that the example must be right and it would be almost atheism itself to think we could make any sort of improvement another of the virtues which spring from the retrospective principle is the system of proscription that is to say if any man at any former period of his life happens to have been guilty of any imprudence or to have fallen into any vice we are to take a resolute determination that he shall never have an opportunity of being virtuous again we are never to think what the man is the capacities and energies of his mind may be of the most useful nature his virtues private and public may be most eminently conspicuous we may look forward also to the prospect of his being beneficial to society     all this is very good till you happen to hear some how or other that at some former period of his life he had committed some faux pas or was accused of something of that kind and then forsooth all your veneration and respect is to terminate and you are to push him back into the paths of vice from which his enlightened intellect had rescued him citizens can any thing be more opposite to the great interests of mankind to the desirable object of promoting universal happiness diffusing felicity to those who are at present around us and cultivating those virtues that may tend to the felicity of posterity than this retrospective principle of proscription which so ridiculously and inhumanly says to the unfortunate man struggling to regain his place in society you may make what efforts you will and struggle to be virtuous to the last degree but if we can prove that you have once been vicious we will forget your present exertions we will shut the doors of future virtue against you and drive you back whether you will or not to that situation from which the energies of your intellect had redeemed you two other of the virtues which the retrospective principle cultivates are sorrow and regret—weaknesses which it is no further necessary for me to dwell upon than as they have frequently not only been cherished but hypocritically assumed that the individual might challenge the praise of sensibility sensibility what is it sensibility means nothing more than acuteness of feeling and if there is any particular honor in having a more acute sense of pain than other people the sickest valetudinarian has more virtue to boast than robust health and vigorous and useful activity can ever aspire to in the same degree the feeble sickly mind in which there is not energy or virtue enough to do one virtuous action frequently bears off the palm which ought to be conferred only upon the man glowing with a generous and extensive love of his fellow creatures but which is in general conferred upon that debility into which persons sink from contemplating nothing but their own sensations and supposing that to those sensations the world and its happiness ought to be rendered subservient another of the virtues of the retrospective system is repentance this is one of the virtues i shall touch upon very delicately because i would not wish to offend the fine sensations of those reverend gentlemen who may perhaps be anxious not to lofe that hold which it gives them of the consciences and consequently the purses of their followers     but the most conspicuous and energetic of all the virtues resulting from the retrospective principle is revenge a passion that has done more towards deforming the face of human society and plunging nation after nation and generation after generation into all the horrors the mind can conceive than all the other vices in the catalogue of human errors of this principle i shall not enter particularly into the investigation at this time having spoken of it at length in my former lecture i shall therefore proceed to the consideration of a more plausible part of the retrospective system i mean the supposed virtue of gratitude these two passions i shall compare together and endeavour to shew that however different in appearance they both proceed from the same selfish principle citizens as this passion or sentiment of gratitude is the only one generated by the retrospective system which has any plausible pretence to virtue and as it has been long revered by the most amiable characters as the germ of every virtue i am well aware that i have a delicate task to perform few perhaps who hear me ever questioned that gratitude was a virtue of the first description a chain of serious reasoning has induced me to consider it as a vice it will be necessary therefore for me to state the question to you with great precision so that i may be thoroughly understood and you may perceive the foundations upon which my conclusion is built it is a doctrine i believe which no one has been hardy enough to broach in this country till it was advanced by a celebrated author of the present day godwin in his enquiry concerning political justice and the odium it has drawn upon his head is little calculated to induce others to tread the same path i am not afraid however of popularising those ideas which i believe to be true because the persons who first propagated them have encountered reproach if gratitude is a virtue—if it has a tendency to expand the heart and promote the line of conduct most conducive to general happiness let it be proved and i shall be happy to retract if gratitude on the contrary has a tendency to draw the human mind from the consideration of the whole and to fix it from a principle of self love upon a few individuals then i shall be obliged to conclude that gratitude is no virtue but that on the contrary it is an enemy to that great fountain of all virtue—justice—which commands us without favor or regard to personal feelings to cultivate felicity in every bosom capable of receiving its impression and remove sorrow and affliction   0 from every sentient being wherever the opportunity is presented citizens let us enquire in the first instance what is the principle of gratitude and what is justice if justice consists in nothing more according to the ideas of lombardstreet than merely paying your debts that you may neither injure your credit nor be sent to prison why then justice is not the sole foundation of all virtue but if justice consists as i suppose in doing in all possible cases all the good we possibly can for our fellow beings then i must conclude that every thing that is not just is criminal that nothing that militates against this justice can be a virtue well then what do you mean by gratitude either it means something or it means nothing if it means something it must mean either something more or something less than justice or else justice and gratitude are convertible terms—a position that will never be allowed if justice then is a supreme virtue if justice embraces the whole universe if it is the elementary principle of justice that you should do all the good to all human beings that you have the power of doing and never neglect any opportunity of doing good to any individual unless by doing that good you are likely to do more injury to other individuals or to society at large—if these are the principles of justice and if gratitude means something more or something less than this it must be injustice and consequently is no virtue it is mistaking a part for the whole and confining our exertions to a few particular individuals merely because they have done more for us than we were entitled to and thereby neglecting that great scale of justice which would lead us to do all the good in our power to all existing beings gratitude is generally understood to be a return of benefits now let us consider what are the benefits which ought to be returned you must never lose sight in this enquiry of the first principle namely that justice includes doing all the good you can for all human beings now then what is returning favors the obligation as it is called either was a favour which the individual did or did not deserve if not deserved then it was an act of injustice for no man has power to do more than he ought to an individual without doing less than his duty to the whole the fact being that he owes to the whole every power and faculty he possesses and is bound to lay out those powers and faculties to the general advantage     if therefore he does more to any individual than that individual deserves he is reduced to the necessity of doing less to other individuals than they deserve consequently he has done injustice he has done an ill act if injustice then has been done in your favour ought you to do a kindness to another because you have received the benefit of his injustice certainly not grant on the other hand that what your benefactor did was no more than just and due that it was beneficial to the human race that the kindness should be done would you not be bound in the same manner to respect and reverence that human being whose virtue had led him to do the best for his fellow beings just the same whether that benefit was conferred upon another individual or yourself if not what makes the difference but your own selflove thus then it resolves itself into the principle of justice but if you lay it down as a principle of gratitude that if you do me a kindness i am to do you a kindness again what is it but a barter what is it but a traffic a compact between parties—do more for me to day than i deserve and i will do more for you to morrow than you deserve—or in other words you having done injustice to mankind that you might heap unmerited favours upon my head i will do injustice to mankind for ever after that i may heap favors upon your head of which you are not worthy citizens it is not often that i enter upon any subject in this dry and abstract manner but i wish you to see as it is a part of that great system i wish to impress upon your minds that the conclusion i draw from this is not a conclusion unfriendly to doing kind and beneficent actions it is not an argument against doing as many generous actions as you would otherwise do on the contrary it is a stimulus to do more for the conclusion is that all the good you can do to all existing beings you ought to do and that the only standard by which you ought to regulate the proportions of good you are to administer is the standard of the effective right of the individual that is to say the capacity and the inclination of that individual to do good in his turn to other human beings whom it may be in his power afterwards to serve and the only reason why you ought to give him that preference is that by so doing you throw your seed into a soil where it will be sure to be cultivated and bring forth a more abundant produce—not for your particular advantage the paltry gratification of your contracted senses no but for the general diffusion     of happiness and virtue through the whole of that great family of human beings every one of which whatever be his name his colour or his country is the brother of all the rest and ought to enjoy with them a community of rights and happiness it matters not whether the individual has done me a kindness or an injury a virtuous individual supposing me to be vicious may have done me wrong this virtuous individual has the power and inclination to do benefit to all mankind now suppose this individual who has thus injured me unintentionally—or suppose he had intentionally wronged me being then a vicious tho now a virtuous man—this man who has wronged me languishes in want those powers those faculties those virtues by which nations and generations might be blessed are perishing before me on the other hand lies some worthless individual whom nature may have made my relation who may have heaped in profligacy and idle intoxication perhaps unmerited favours upon my head i have the power of serving but one who does gratitude call upon me to serve the worthless being by whose exertions society will never be benefited or him whose relief confers an essential benefit upon mankind gratitude says relieve the worthless and let the important sufferer perish but who does justice who does virtue who does the love of my fellow men call upon me to serve the man whose conduct perhaps was once a scorpion to my breast who if i relieve his necessities if i triumph over the selfish narrow principles corroding my heart may become a blessing to the universe and diffuse felicity through a wide sphere of human population citizens it may appear paradoxical but i shall endeavour to prove how nearly gratitude and revenge are allied i might argue this point by dogmatism and inference from fact i might appeal to observation and remind you that grateful men are generally revengeful and that revengeful men are generally grateful and even hence perhaps it would be no great presumption to conclude that the revengeful and grateful man act from the same selfish spring of motion that is to say the recollection of the benefits or injuries heaped upon himself and the hatred or love he feels towards the individuals i shall not however take advantage of this general association but shall proceed to examine the question upon the open ground of argument for this purpose citizens i will refer to a recent circumstance because it will give me an opportunity of meeting the arguments of my opponents on their strongest ground     you all of you know that together with other citizens i have lately been in circumstances of a very extraordinary nature that the iron hand of oppression was stretched over me to crush me to atoms that every species of persecution was made use of to destroy at once my person and my character well how came i through this perilous storm citizens twelve good mariners and three excellent pilots conducted my vessel in safety into the harbour of peace twelve honest jurors disdained the sophistry of an host of crown lawyers—erskine with an imagination all on fire with a soul full of that energy which nothing but virtuous feelings could inspire erskine stepped forward with manly eloquence and asserted the cause of truth and justice to the very teeth of that judge who in his charge to the grand jury propagated doctrines to which i will not give a descriptive epithet—posterity will do them justice erskine stood up in the face of power he vindicated the rights and liberties of englishmen and as he already stood unrivalled for forensic talents determined to prove that the qualities of his head were not superior to those of his heart—gibbs whose soul unbiassed by party never yet was plunged in political disputes felt a correspondent ardour burning with honest conviction elevated with a noble fortitude conscious that the men who pretended to reverence the law and constitution were trampling law and constitution under foot and endeavouring to mark every footstep of their tyrannic career with british blood—gibbs not curious perhaps of those abstract and speculative truths which form the basis of the character of the philosophical politician but fired with that constitutional enthusiasm that zeal for the faithful interpretation of the laws which has occasionally though not frequently adorned the english bar—gibbs stood by his side like the younger ajax by the side of telemon seconded his strokes and enforced his advantages nor must we forget the labours of foulkes who in a situation less conspicuous but equally arduous united the diligence of the solicitor with the disinterestedness of the philanthropist and the ardour of the patriot such were our champions they fought they conquered and britain escaped the chains that were forging for it well citizens i feel—i know all this i acknowledge i avow i proclaim for justice calls upon me so to do that but for these honest jurors these honest advocates and this honest solicitor i had not been here i am not a man to deny the good offices i have received that is no part of the system i     am upholding the good actions of mankind ought to be publicly proclaimed nor ought the light of benevolence to be hid under a bushel but can i suppose or if i were so infatuated could any body else believe that the merit of these men is any way increased because i was the individual who was snatched by their exertions from the jaws of oppression and restored to my sphere of public and private usefulness can i unless egotism has usurped the seat of justice in my mind believe that more affection is due to these men more esteem for snatching me from the meditated destruction than for snatching the veteran tooke for example from the same fate or hardy that gallant and disinterested leader of the van of liberty certainly not the principle and the utility of the action are the real foundations of the esteem we owe the actors and not the individual object they would be equally entitled to respect and veneration had they exercised the same energies of mind in behalf of any other individuals equally innocent and equally useful to mankind nay citizens i will go a step further i say that the respect and veneration which we owe and which society owes to these men does not arise from the circumstance of past exertions no those exertions ought only to be considered as proofs of energetic virtues calculated to produce the happiness of mankind as land marks if i may so express myself on the shore of morals pointing out to mankind whenever their happiness and felicity shall need such a shelter of intellect and legal knowledge where they may seek that shelter with confidence in short citizens it is not this or that good action which individuals have done but their general usefulness their power and inclination to benefit society that ought to stamp their estimation with the thinking part of mankind now citizens i will contrast this by another circumstance it is not likely that in mentioning the seprosecutions i should forget the sanguinary ambition of a pitt the aristocratic enthusiasm of a burke the metaphysical frenzy of a wyndham or the apostacy of your portlands your spencers and the wouldbe viceroy fitzwilliam yet citizens because we recollect the vices of those men are our souls to fester with revenge are we like harpies and furies with lips quivering with rage and indignation such lips as i beheld in the privy council when i was examined—are we i say as if we were ready to lap the blood of these men because their principles and conduct are offensive to us to brood over the     gloomy feeling of resentment and revenge no perish the wretch the fire of whose patriotism must be fed by the destroying fires of vengeance perish the wretch who remembering only his own petty wrongs forgets the great interests of humanity however contemptible their conduct may have been or however conspicuous their sanguinary hatred and disposition to oppress those individuals certainly are no worse members of society than they would have been if they had never persecuted me if their persecution had fell upon other heads ought i not to have the same abhorrence for their principles and practices which is justifiable now certainly this makes no difference in the great scale if i am merely an isolated individual if i am to be acting merely for myself if i am to consider that i am all and society nothing then of course i must hate these men in proportion to the injury they have done me but admitting the benevolent principle can any individual have a right to stake the happiness and prosperity of society the welfare the peace the tranquillity of a whole generation that he may satisfy his particular feelings of rage of hatred of resentment no such a right reason humanity justice all disclaim i know this is not the popular sentiment i know how strong a tendency there is in the human character to egotism and resentment and i therefore warn you when you yourselves are wronged think twice—always think seriously before you suffer yourselves to feel indignation against any individual but when yourselves are wronged think twice—think how common a thing it is to overrate ourselves and consequently to overrate the injuries we have received—and learn that the principles of virtue are principles of general utility not of particular feeling but citizens there is one circumstance more relative to this gratitude to which i shall allude namely the mischievous consequences it frequently produces in the most noble and capacious minds fettering them to individuals when they were born for the universe and extinguishing the great principles of general justice in their hearts how is it that the demosthenes of our senate fox a man whose soul is occupied by magnificent virtues—how comes it that this man shrinks as he does from the path of public duty at this period what is the reason that he should affirm in the senate that elementary principles are not to be talked of that you must not discuss general abstract rules—you must only consider the particular motives and objects of the present day—in other     words you may make as many disputes as you please to get yourselves into power but never discuss what are the rights of the people the duties of ministers or the objects of government no this would lead you to enquiry equally destructive to all parties and the outs have as much to tremble for during the investigation as the ins but can we believe that this great character is blind to the importance of first principles can we believe that his mind cannot see beyond the narrow line of conduct now chalked out—it is impossible to think so meanly of his mind but the harpy gratitude has taken possession of him recollecting that much of the felicity much of the ease the splendor the consequence of his life has been derived from a few aristocratic families from a great combination of whigs as they call themselves he therefore supposes that he is bound in gratitude never to desert this party though one after another they have shewn little remorse in deserting him thus is this great this powerful in many respects this virtuous and energetic mind trammelled by the fetters of aristocracy and society is robbed of those glorious advantages which might be reaped from the free and generous exertions of capacities so gigantic and immeasurable impromptu on seeing the word liberty half erazed from a wall on which it had been written   poor dastard no triumph thy malice imparts   what you razed from our walls is engraved on our hearts   and tho pitt and his crew may the legend efface   the emblem for ever the mind shall embrace   its firmness—its ardour shall ever endure   engravd on our bosoms unshaken and pure   existence and freedom together well twine   and the one with the other well only resign   juvenis   asterisks an additional quartersheet will be given with a future number     the tribune no xi saturday   d may      on the humanity and benevolence of the dutch revolution and the causes of the excesses in france the third lecture on the moral and political influence of the prospective principle of virtue with a parallel between the character of pitt and robespierre citizens it will frequently happen from the extempore manner in which these lectures are delivered that i shall be considerably mistaken in my calculations as to the extent of matter to be embraced by a single lecture on the last evening i intended to have closed the subject of the prospective principle of virtue and to have entered largely into the political considerations that depend upon it particularly that branch of the subject which relates to the revolutions of nations i found however when the evening was considerably advanced that it would be impossible to accomplish this or indeed to enter at any considerable length into that which forms the most important branch of the subject namely the application to the leading characters and events of this important æra without considerably trespassing upon my usual limits and as the state of my health was precarious i thought it not right either to expose myself to hazard or you to inconvenience by protracting that lecture to an unusual length i am glad i made use of this precaution because when i came to review my subject again i found a vast variety of important matter entirely untouched i recollected also that while i had the honor of residing in the tower i had perused with a considerable degree of attention the works of an author sometimes very much praised and sometimes more abused   now haild with joy as true to virtues side   now viewd with horror as the assassins guide— i mean machiavel who appeared in a considerable degree to furnish a clue to the events which have recently taken place     in europe and from whom many important reflections might be adduced an author whatever might be his object—whether to instruct the tyrant or expose the tyranny whose work is replete with political erudition and therefore worthy of the most serious attention i found in a review of the present subject that many of his reflections would apply to that branch i am now going to enter upon and i shall occasionally therefore make some quotations from him it may be necessary however to premise that this author is perpetually speaking of princes and of tyrants whereas i shall have to apply his reflections to leaders of revolutions by which princes and tyrannies have been overthrown you will see however that the reasoning applies just the same and that in one instance in particular the only irrelevant circumstance is the use of the word prince a title to which the individual animadverted upon never attained nor ever perhaps aspired having premised thus much i shall proceed to remind you that in two former lectures i have dilated very considerably upon that principle of virtue which looks forward to benefits to be procured in opposition to that which looks backward upon injuries already done you will remember that i dwelt upon the tendency of the passion of revenge to disappoint the aims of those who use that engine to promote the principle of liberty the very essence of which is philanthropic virtue i attempted also to shew you that the deviations from the great principles of political virtue which according to my conceptions are observable in that illustrious character the demosthenes of the british senate are to be traced also from the delusive principle of gratitude a branch as i endeavoured to shew you of the retrospective system i come now to the most important branch of my subject namely the influence of the two principles in the grand revolutions which frequently convulse sometimes destroy and sometimes improve great communities and here citizens i shall dwell in the first instance not upon the gloomy but upon the benignant picture i am sure no man who has a heart can have read the proceedings of the revolution in holland without feeling that heart dilated and finding himself a better member of society from the grand sentiments of justice and benevolence upon which that revolution has been conducted remember particularly the doctrines they lay down how they discard the principle of vengeance and all those effusions of retrospective fury which have produced such miserable consequences in the world think of that proclamation     in which they declare their independence and avow their determination of forming a government upon the broad basis of liberty and equality having been required with more zeal than discretion to satiate vengeance upon some of their late oppressive rulers the provisional representatives the leaders of the revolution publish a proclamation equally admirable for its energy of sentiment its wisdom and its humanity the dutch say they from the very moment when they first broke their chains gave to astonished europe too grand an example of generosity and humanity to let us believe that they would fully that glory in the moments of tranquillity by avenging themselves on a set of humbled despots deprived of all strength this magnanimity will appear very conspicuous when you consider what has been the conduct of the man who was once the chief magistrate of that country when you reflect that during the american war while holland was at war with england there are strong reasons to suspect that he sold the fleet of his own country to the cabinet of st jamess i mean at the battle of the dogger bank—when you reflect also upon his conduct to the people of whose constitution be it remembered the stadtholderate was never an integral part—it was only a provisional office set up by the temporary will of the nation and liable to be put down again whenever the nation so willed the stadtholderate i say and the history of the country bears me out in the assertion was no integral part of the constitution of the batavian states yet you will remember that when the batavian people thought it their duty—and who shall venture to dispute the right of a people when they do so think to ameliorate the government under which they live—you will remember that when they thought it their duty to ameliorate their government they were prevented by the stadtholder from so doing how by a larger portion of the people declaring against the patriots no but by the menacing of a british fleet that threatened their ports and by troops of prussians poured into the nation to thrust the stadtholderate down peoples throats with an increase of power and additional prerogatives but they forgot all this—generously and gloriously forgot it and remembered the true principles of virtue and policy as you will hear he deserves not to triumph continue these philosophic patriots who basely abuses his victory he alone can promise himself the constant and happy fruits of victory who makes his vanquished foes blush by his justice and generosity   0 and convinces them that they are the persons who have chosen the worst cause to defend citizens generosity and justice carry with them irresistible force nothing can save our country but a constant adherence to those virtues the exercise of revenge may afford a transitory pleasure in the moments of passion and delirium but its consequences are commonly sad and fatal while the exercise of equity and generosity leaves nothing but agreeable sensations they then go on to declare that their great end is to establish a government upon the foundation of the genuine principles of freedom and equality perceiving as all men will sooner or later perceive that all governments that are not founded upon this basis that is to say upon the basis of equal rights equal laws and equal means of obtaining justice are in reality nothing but usurpations how many hundred or how many thousand years soever they may happen to have been established but continues the proclamation how to attain this end no method more likely than to shew on the one hand grandeur and generosity with respect to the past on the other to be severe and inexorable to all attempts against freedom and the supremacy of the people citizens i am not sure whether to be severe and inexorable is ever right you are always to exercise justice—you are to preserve liberty but take care that while you pretend to make distinctions you do not ultimately fall into an undistinguishing system of terror and revenge however citizens there can be no doubt that in the agitation of passions that must prevail in such a revolution as that in france and that in holland there must be a considerable degree of ferment—a necessity for a considerable degree of energetic exertion which at other periods cannot be justified in a moment of crisis all the terrors in the regular course of things being on one side it is necessary perhaps to create a salutary and counteracting terror that persons who have no side no sentiment no principle but that of selfsecurity a description which always includes a large proportion of every people may not suppose that they have every thing to fear from the triumph of one party and nothing from the other if therefore there is any excuse for this language it is from that consideration selfpreservation is a right of nature which belongs as much to the friends of liberty as to courts and ministers     citizens i mark this discrimination the more particularly that i may shew you that there is no more foundation for the calumny which describes me on the one hand as a friend to passive obedience and nonresistance than the calumny which represents me on the other as an agitator of violence and massacre i love humanity i love my fellowbeings to whatever party they may belong and i would no sooner wound or afflict my bitterest enemy than my dearest friend either the one or the other i would resist if i met him in the prosecution of schemes destructive of the rights and interests of man but i would resist him which ever it might be in the mildest and most benevolent manner from which i could have any prospect of success this is my landmark—my boundary between quakerism and violence and here i think every man ought to stand to his post and when attacked defend himself and his principles and if ever the dire necessity should arrive which i hope never will i trust i shall be as willing to shed my blood as spend my breath in defence of the rights and liberties of man but not one blow for vengeance no that which is past is past i would prevent the future evil i would remove the present but when instead of prevention we talk of punishment we may disguise it to ourselves in what pompous language we will but we have departed from the genuine principles of liberty and justice and plunged into the cruel system by which all the tyrannies of the ancient and modern world have been supported unhappily citizens this great political truth has not been understood in all the stages of the french revolution unhappily we do but too frequently observe instead of the prospective principle of amelioration the retrospective glances and passions of revenge in the struggles of parties which one after the other have succeeded in that great that glorious though in some respects unhappy country citizens perhaps in the first instance every one of the factions which have alternately prevailed in that country acted from virtuous principles i cannot i own call back to my mind the glorious sentiments the godlike reasonings the generous eloquence which has so frequently resounded within the walls of the french assemblies without being convinced that in many of those leaders who have at last fallen victims to their own ambition there were pure and enlightened principles of liberty and truth which perhaps never shone before with equal lustre in the world but citizens one of     the first misfortunes of france was that the leading characters of that country formed themselves into factions into parties as they are called here compacts and associations which have an inevitable tendency to produce a selfishness of character a sort of esprit du corps and to banish from the mind those broad and generous principles without a resolute adherence to which nothing like genuine liberty ever can be produced these parties soon became inflamed by suspicions and aggravated by threats of vengeance yes i say by threats of vengeance for i believe the threats held out by the feeble brissotines were the first cause of the sanguinary proceedings which the mountain afterwards adopted when suspicions are generated when denunciations are springing from every quarter there is but too necessary a tendency in such proceedings to stir up the gloomy spirit of revenge opposition becomes inflamed by mutual hatred and mutual fear till nothing but the destruction of one party can satisfy the frantic ravings of those who began in delusion but end in rancorous animosity let it be remembered however citizens that i do not attribute the whole of the mischiefs that have taken place in france to the revengeful dispositions of the particular leaders of the revolution the time is near at hand when it will no longer be virtue to slander france the time is near at hand when it will be no longer high treason to do justice to the real character and virtues of that nation prussia has already from a professing friend become a threatening enemy to this country prussia already from the foe of france has become her ally and with very few grains of penetration i think we may discover that part of the alliance yet behind the curtain is that the arms of prussia and france shall combine to drive the british forces from germany spain and sardinia there is good reason to believe have submitted already or are upon the eve of submission the king of prussia is nominated as it were patron of a large portion of germany and in all probability under his wing peace will be procured from the french republic for those distracted and halfruined states yet still we sleep supine we lift not the manly voice for change of men and measures though the period i believe is not very distant when we must either discard our ministers to make a peace or submit to a conquering foe whose revenge we have stimulated by injustice and opprobrium and whose generosity we have treated with ingratitude and contempt i believe therefore     in such a posture of affairs that it is not improper to prepare the public mind for amity by removing a part of that odium unjustly thrown upon the french character and i believe if we consider the whole history of the revolution we shall find that the excesses of that revolution have not in general proceeded principally from the character of the individual leaders but still less from the principles which that revolution has promulgated the revengeful character the depravity of morals which stained some stages of the revolution resulted from the old despotism while every species of cruelty and licentiousness practiced by the court during whose tyranny no poor miserable sans cullotte could walk the bridges at night without expecting that some great mans lackey might chuck him into the river conscious that he would never be enquired after while the monstrous cruelties practiced by the nobility and gentry as they called themselves against the industrious order of people while these things were fresh in the memory of the people it is a circumstance to be lamented but not to be wondered at that a profligate spirit of revenge should have stimulated a part of the revolutionists also consider likewise the corruption introduced into that country by the court nothing but splendor and power was treated with respect and therefore splendor and power has but too frequently been grasped at by vices so detestable that no being would have had the audacity to perpetrate them if he had not known that titles and gold would hide the deformity from the public eye and his character be smoothed and polished over by the gold leaf of privilege and distinction to this i am sorry to add—that i believe we must also attribute a considerable part of the intrigues and excesses in france to the cabals and artifices of the british cabinet do i say i believe they have stood up in the houses of parliament and avowed it they have said that they sent the money of britain into france to create internal commotions there interruption the citizen groans but he will groan a little more when he remembers that lord stanhope made a motion in reprobation of that avowal the motion was scouted and the sentiment remained unretracted to the disgrace of humanity which could not but rise in indignation at the idea that any set of men could stand forward and say we are employing the property of this country taken from the hard earnings of industry to spread treachery and crimes through the country of that enemy whom we wish to destroy though we have not the energy to conquer     citizens you will consider also the situation in which france was plunged at that period you will consider the barbarous manifesto of the duke of brunswick i mention not his name to give any wound to an unhappy female who is torn from every connection to reside such are the cruel mandates of state policy at the mercy for mercy under such circumstances it must be of strangers whom perhaps she may love but to whom perhaps she never can reconcile herself i have heard and i am much disposed to believe—for i am much inclined to think the duke of brunswick one among the sovereigns of europe who possesses a larger share of intellect than belongs to most of them our own blessed sovereign excepted reiterated applauses— i am very happy to hear citizens that you are so loyal and that you will not suffer a just compliment to be passed upon our benign sovereign without taking the notice of it that it merits i say this piece of bobadil bravado has been reported not to be the composition of the duke of brunswick it was smuggled into the world however under his name and i am sorry it should so frequently be the misfortune of princes that their names should give the sanction of authority to measures of which they are totally ignorant till the mischief has been disseminated through the world however certain it is that this barbarous manifesto whoever penned it was one of the causes of the violences in france pressed with intrigues within which were fomented and supported by cabals without pressed by armies of invading despots menaced on every side provoked by every insult injustice and indignity their enthusiasm and apprehensions arose to frenzy and they did acts which i shall not attempt to justify—which i should wish could be blotted for ever from the page of history if i were not sure that it is good for the future happiness of mankind that every historical truth should be fairly and publicly handed down citizens we are to remember also that at the time when the country was driven to the last extremity when arms could not be procured fast enough to be put into the hands of those brave defenders of liberty who were rushing forward to meet the foreign foe at that time in the prisons crammed with suspected persons counterrevolutionists who had never been committed were found to be concealed in every part of paris and arms were found concealed in those places evidently for purposes of the most detestable treachery     when we consider these circumstances we must attribute to an unfortunate concurrence of events those excesses which have been so frequently related with aggravation upon aggravation as stains upon the character of the french people we have also to consider that the situation in which they were placed rendered measures of considerable energy requisite i am sorry they mistook the real character of energy but the fears of a populace trembling for their newborn liberty and driven to despair by such a combination of disastrous circumstances can never be brought forward as a stain upon the general character of a nation but by persons whose own understandings are either perverted or who are determined to pervert the understandings of others if however we should admit that there are some excuses for the excesses that took place in that country we must also admit that there were men whose gloomy dispositions perpetuated those excesses when there could be no excuse for them whatever for as machiavel has well observed cruelty if ever it can be palliated can only be so when it is commited but once out of necessity and for selfpreservation and never repeated afterwards but converted as much as possible to the benefit of the subject i know that in the vague manner in which this is worded it might be made use of to justify the horrible massacres of st bartholemews or even the still more horrible and atrocious massacre committed by that french aristocrat m de memmay and which all aristocrats are so willing to bury in oblivion but i quote not the authors words because i mean to admit their full latitude but because they give me an opportunity of shewing that even the advocates for cruelty and tyranny do not justify that reiterated fury and vengeance into which it is but too common for men to plunge in the fury of political contention cruelty is ill applied continues he when it is but little at first and is afterwards rather increased than abated—those whose cruelty lingers and comes on by degrees cannot possibly subsist long the event has shewn how truly this author was acquainted with the springs and influences of political action it must however be admitted that few characters in the world ever had energy enough to do those things which were requisite in such a situation as france was plunged into without at the same time indulging some disposition for revenge and cruelty all new governments says this same machiavel are exposed to so many dangers that it is impossible for a new     prince and such it cannot be dissembled at the latter part of his life was robespierre though i believe at the beginning he was actuated by the true and genuine principles of republicanism it is impossible he says for a new prince that is an usurper to avoid the scandal of being cruel citizens as i believe the characters of great actors in the political world furnish the most important of the facts upon which the human mind expatiates i shall next enter into some consideration of the character of robespierre by which i shall be able to shew you that he had not a constitution calculated to form an exception from this general rule i admit and i think i shall by and by prove that there were in the character of robespierre many as great qualities as magnificent virtues as ever adorned a human being unfortunately however none of those great qualities and virtues were of that description that led to moderation he had no philosophy he had no social affections he had none of those tender sympathies which soften the rugged character of the politician and reconcile the great and sublime powers of the human mind to the gentle endearments of humanity—that affection and general attachment to his species which are necessary to constitute the truly excellent character and without which no character however splendid can either command or deserve the general admiration of mankind his virtues were of the severe and gloomy cast his vices were those most favourable to cruelty and revenge he was tainted nay he was saturated if i may so express myself with the monstrous vice of suspicion a narrow selfish fiend which when it enters into the human character debauches all the great qualities of the soul and perverts the energies which might otherwise have been ornamental and beneficial to the human race he was also unfortunately a slave to personal cowardice he had it is true political intrepidity but the history of his proceedings show that like marat though not to so great a degree he had a heart that trembled for his personal security and that therefore was disposed to raise sences and protections round him which he thought it necessary to cement with blood he had also a political impetuosity that could brook no restraint that must dash forward at once to its object that could not go step by step to the attainment of that political amelioration at which at first he aimed and which therefore hurried him from the path of patriotism to that of individual ambition he had also a fanaticism gloomy and inveterate and that fanaticism     whetted the axe of the guillotine against the man who had long been his firmest and most useful friend because forsooth such was the popular pretence at least this man denied some doctrines of which he thought fit to make himself the champion i wish not to contend on this occasion whether the atheism of danton were a vice or not but i am convinced of this that if it were a vice it was of that description that man had nothing to do with and the individual who once supposes he has a right to shed the blood of his fellow citizens for differences in speculative opinion knows not where he may stop he may cut this mans head off today for being an atheist he may cut off the next day another mans head for being a deist and the next send flocks of people to the guillotine because they receive the sacrament standing when he takes it kneeling in short unless you suffer a man to enjoy the utmost freedom of opinion unless you lay it down that speculative notions are not objects of punishment and that punishment if justifiable at all is only useful when used to prevent destructive exertions of the powers and faculties of man for the annihilation of life or the overthrow of happiness—unless you admit these maxims whatever your religious opinions may be you are a fanatic whether you go to mass with robespierre at one period or at another bow down with this highpriest to his newfangled allegorical religion whether you go to the conventicle to the church the chapel or the plain meeting of the quakers it matters not unless you uphold that every man has a right to his opinion you cannot be a friend to genuine liberty and justice you are hostile to human intellect for though you think you are right the man in direct opposition thinks he is right also and if you want no other judgment than your own opinion to justify coercion universal massacre must ensue society must be unhinged chaos return and darkness be the burier of the dead the generality of these qualities it is true fitted robespierre for the times he had to act in and we may indeed observe a tendency in all times and postures of society to create those characters which are necessary for them it is certain that the brissotines were incompetent to the task of the salvation of france they had virtue—they had philosophy but they had no energy and we may observe from this the reason why in great revolutions the first movers seldom steer through the whole it is ridiculous therefore to suppose that any man acquainted with the history     of the universe is anxious to produce revolutions revolutions are always produced by the folly and wickedness of the rulers not by the projects of individuals whoever puts the first hand to the work in all human probability will be one of the first that loses his head in the progress of it for the fact is that the character of man only fits him for acting in that particular sphere where he finds a similar character in the posture of society hence what is called fortune we say that this man is fortunate and that man is unfortunate for both have pursued their way with equal wisdom and one has succeeded and the other fallen but it is not fortune but the times and the victory of the one and the fall of the other must result from one of these causes either the individual who falls was not keensighted enough to see what the real state of society was and what the proper mode of acting in that state of society or else seeing what it was the habits of his character did not permit him to act in the particular way required thus we find the brissotines at one period of the revolution were characters best calculated to help it on their deliberate progressive cautious movements led forward the people and the country to a particular state to which it perhaps never would have arrived but for those moderate exertions but then came the dæmon of foreign power then came calamities then came a posture of society for which their deliberate measures were no longer fitted they could not assume the energy requisite for the moment and the reins of power sell from their feeble hands they were seized by the energetic gripe of the leaders of the mountain men born to live among the storms of nature and rule them at their wildest the different dispositions requisite at different periods are excellently animadverted upon by the author whom i have quoted to you before he whose manner of proceeding agrees with the times is happy and he unhappy who cannot accommodate his conduct to them hence it is not rare to see a leader happy and flourishing one day and ruined the next without observing the least change in his disposition or conduct the fact is the cause of his ruin is that he is incapable of that change for men to arrive at the end which they propose take very different courses and if these different courses were accommodated to the characters and dispositions of the times all might succeed one acts with moderation another with impetuosity one with violence another with art one with patience another with fury     and yet they may all arrive at the same end we see likewise that of two persons equally moderate one succeeds the other miscarries and that two persons of different turns one moderate the other impetuous are equally successful this proceeds from nothing but the nature of the times which either suits or disagrees with their manner of proceeding—upon this also depends the vicissitudes of good for when a man acts always with moderation and patience if the times and affairs turn so favorably as to suit his conduct he prospers but if the face of affairs and the times change he is undone because he does not change likewise the whole of this reasoning which machiavel continues to a considerable extent and which is certainly very just is applied by him to princes but it is equally applicable to the leaders of revolutions as i have in some degree shown you from what i have observed relative to the brissotines the moment the crisis came they were incompetent to the task and another faction of more power and energy stept forward and seized the helm otherwise i believe though france was too far enlightened eventually to have fallen she would have experienced much greater calamities and difficulties and been for the present perhaps disappointed of her object a portion of her country would have perhaps been lost and the real object of the allies namely a partition and perhaps to a considerable degree might have taken place but however necessary the exertions of the mountain for the moment might have been cruel and unjustifiable beyond description was the manner in which the triumph was enjoyed did they maintain such language as i have read to you from the proclamation of the friends of liberty in holland did they with magnanimity turn round forget the past and enjoy the triumph without sullying it with vengeance no the retrospective principle had sunk too deep in their minds the remembrance of the examples of cruelty so frequently set by the despotism from which they had so recently been emancipated had contaminated their hearts and the crimes of the french monarch survived while the monarchy itself was broken in fragments thus citizens europe was witness to the murder of the deputies after that to the murder of the friends of those deputies who were sent to the scaffold for fear they should revenge their blood these were followed by their friends and those by theirs and robespierre like macbeth soon found   0 himself so far gone in blood that he thought it harder to turn back than to go oer thus from suspicion and revenge he was driven to cruelty and from cruelty to the necessity of ambitious usurpation and this usurpation was to be fortified again by blood danton was to be sacrificed—camille desmolines—hebert—all accused of counterrevolutionary crimes though the real crimes i believe of some of them were that they were dangerous rivals to the ambitious dictator and the crimes of others that they wished to restore to france that free representation which was in some degree usurped by the plausible pretences under which the convention contrived to procrastinate their power but whatever were the causes of the cruelty the practice continued when the temper of the times could no longer endure it and we find that not only justice was trampled upon but discretion also—for though it may perhaps sometimes be true as my italian author has observed that it is of the two better to be impetuous than cautious because fortune is a woman with whom it is impossible to succeed without some degree of violence and that it appears by experience that she more easily submits to those who are fierce and boisterous than to such as are cool and deliberate—though this may be true yet certain it is that such violent measures never can be of long duration fortunately for the universe such crimes and such atrocities have a tendency to their own cure accordingly we find that robespierre fell by the machinations of his own violence because he no more than the party he had displaced was capable of changing his character with the necessities of the times but continued to act with violence when moderation and philosophy were requisite to heal the wounds which the struggle had given to the bosom of his country this circumstance i own appeared to me so inevitable from the perusal of the author i have so frequently quoted that when i read the following passage i could not but consider it as a prophecy of the fall of robespierre though at the time i read it he appeared to be in the zenith of his power—pope julius ii for catholic popes as well as allegorical popes can be sometimes destroyers of the human race pope julius ii says machiavel in all his enterprizes acted with passion and vehemence and the times and circumstances of affairs were so suitable to his manner of proceeding that he always came off with success and by his violent and impetuous measures succeeded in an enterprize     which no other pope with all the wisdom of man and he might have said with all the infallibility of holiness could ever have effected—but the shortness of his reign saved him from any reverse of fortune for had he lived to see such times as made it necessary to proceed with caution and moderation he would have certainly been ruined because he could never have departed from his natural impetuosity i conclude therefore that as fortune is changeable he who always persists in the same measures succeeds as long as the times fall in with them but is sure to miscarry when the times alter citizens it must also be observed from the first entrance of robespiere upon the stage of the french revolution we have strong traits of the ferocity of his disposition he was the first man who lifted up his voice in justification of the wanton excesses of the people so early as the   th july      when a proclamation was proposed by m lally de tollendall to restrain the excesses and violences of the people he says what has happened after all from this revolt of paris the public liberty—so far he says true the public liberty did arise from the revolt of paris and if paris had not revolted as it did broglio would have been upon their backs with his train of mercenary assassins to destroy every friend of liberty in the country but mark how he goes on—what has happened after all from this revolt of paris the public liberty very little bloodshed a few heads struck off says he no doubt—but guilty heads this is the way in which that man in the senate of his country sported with the disastrous circumstance of the populace having taken vengeance into their own hands and polluted the streets of paris with streams of blood shed in the spirit of wantonness and revenge—very little bloodshed a few heads struck off no doubt but guilty heads—ah sir it is to this commotion that the nation owes its liberty—that we are now sitting in this place citizens it is worth while to remark this passage because it shows you how from step to step when a man begins a vindictive system he goes to the utmost atrocity this was the first justification in the assembly of the excesses of the people after the  0th of august      the cry of vengeance was heard again some call the events of that day a massacre i consider them as a glorious victory the royalists were conspiring to overthrow the constitution and restore despotism the     jacobins were endeavouring to overthrow the constitution and set up republicanism this is the bare statement of the fact they met at the double crisis each unconscious how near the plot of the other was to maturity they met and the battle was fought out bravely—he who shall call that a massacre must suffer me to pity the perversion of his understanding if afterwards he calls any battle by any other name it was not a mere battle of mercenaries contending for they knew not what at the nod of a court or a cabinet it was two parties of men feeling conviction that their principles were their country each knew each felt that without the downfall of the other they could have no security and they struggled in a situation where it was impossible for them longer to live in peace by one decisive effort which should be the conqueror the republican or the despot the conflict began by treachery gross unpardonable abominable treachery on the part of the royalists who upon seeing their king safe within the walls of the assembly fired upon the populace having previously told them that they were all friends and would all hold together in the same cause but though they began in treachery they fought with courage and if the conquerors had been truly generous they would have drawn a veil over the transaction they would have said we have conquered—we are satisfied but no the man of blood went to the bar of the assembly at the head of the sections of paris and called for punishment upon the heads of the royalists—punishment for what for having been beaten for having been overthrown—revenge punishment retribution—what was it not enough to triumph over a party and can you not then with generous magnanimity even applaud the courage of a vanquished foe but must you yelp for vengeance pardon me i cannot restrain my indignation though i love the principles upon which the french revolution is founded i cannot but lament that men conspicuous for their talents powers and virtues should sully so good and holy a cause by the wolfish and hellish yell of vengeance and slaughter this deputation went to the bar of the assembly on the   th of august      i shall draw a veil over the massacres that took place on the  d and  d of september they have been dwelt upon frequently enough already and the aggravated colours in which they have been painted and the care that has been taken to conceal all the palliating circumstances with     which they were attended prove that the aristocrats of this country rather exult in them than deplore them i shall mention however another massacre which took place at an earlier stage of the revolution and which the aristocrats have not been so fond of dwelling upon or pretended to regard with so much horror it will shew however that the doctrines of robespierre were in some degree countenanced by the transactions of some of the aristocracy at that time and that if the populace of paris have plunged into cruel excesses of vengeance against their oppressors they have only practised upon those tyrants a part of that inhumanity which the practices of those tyrants had learned them during the beginning of the struggle in france some time about the beginning of august or latter end of july      one m de memmay who had always sided with the aristocracy pretended to his tenants and other inhabitants around his chatteau that he was in reality attached to the cause of liberty and invited every person attached to that cause to come and join in a civic feast and exult in the overthrow of despotim they came poor unsuspecting individuals from every part of the surrounding country with hearts filled with gratitude and affection they flocked to his castle resounding the praises of the man who was thus about to sacrifice his oppressive privileges to the general happiness and welfare of his country they were entertained with every semblance of hospitality music feast and dance went chearfully and alternately round and all was joy and unsuspecting felicity but what was the catastrophe the whole company thus assembled was led to a particular spot by this infernal aristocrat to vary their diversions and he departed under pretence that he would not damp their mirth by any restraint which his presence might put upon them but no sooner was he withdrawn to a secure distance than a match was applied to the fatal train a mine was sprung and in one instant the whole assembled multitude men women and children were scattered through the air and their mangled carcasses were found by their patriotic friends weltering in blood—a spectacle of horror which no tongue can describe nor heart can scarce conceive citizens we are told of the massacres of the  d and  d of september the conflict of the  0th of august is called a massacre that it may throw reproach and odium upon the friends of liberty but which of our senators though this appeared in all the papers at the time repeats the tale of this     horrid massacre of aristocratic tyranny this abandoned treachery which taught the people to be cruel by convincing them they had nothing but cruelty nothing but tyranny to expect if those privileged assassins who had so long been trampling out human existence in the desolated realm of france were restored to their irrational and soulcorrupting power citizens i shall now proceed to the last part of the lecture of this evening namely a comparison between the character of robespierre and the immaculate minister of this country i know well citizens what dangerous ground i tread upon i know very well that though treason once meant compassing and imagining the death of the king it now means telling truth to the shame and confusion of ministers i know also  twere better pluck the master by the beard than hurt the favorites heel i have no doubt either that there are persons here of various opinions some of them perhaps good pious men who when they say their prayers forget the name of god and whisper pitt let such however perform the bidding of their purblind deity i invite them—i wish them to note every word i say let them call upon me to repeat any part they think good ground of prosecution i will repeat it for i can support by historical facts the opinion that i give and if the country is so lost in degeneracy that a jury can be bought to deprive an englishman of his liberty for saying the truth this is no longer britain and i am desirous of being no longer in it send me with my beloved compatriot gerrald—with him let me try the inhospitable climate of new holland herd among felons or escape to the abodes of savages let us compare then the usurper robespierre with the boasted minister of this country—a minister who has been constantly imitating for a long time the worst parts of every oppressive measure of the french dictator and his faction at the very moment while he was calumniating and abusing those measures that minister who without the energy of robespierre has all his dictatorial ambition who without the provocations which robespierre and his faction experienced has endeavoured vainly endeavoured to carry into execution the same system of massacre for opinion of sanguinary prosecution for proclaiming truth of making argument high treason and destroying every individual who dared to expose his conduct or oppose his ambitious views does this appear too strong a censure it is only so because the sanguinary     malice of the english minister has been as impotent as it was malignant—because he and his faction had not energy enough and british juries had too much honesty to crown his malice with success but if you want proofs of the views and objects of the man peruse the facts relative to the late prosecutions and particularly the trials and the documents upon which those trials were founded—if you find from beginning to end one single attempt one single act that leans towards what the law of this country calls treason—if you find any one act of violence or attempt at violence proved against any of the persons tried—if you do not find that the witnesses for the crown i should say for the minister for it is he i must believe and not the crown that stained the annals of the country with these prosecutions—if it is not proved even by the witnesses for the prosecution that several of the men prosecuted for high treason were most determinately hostile to all systems of violence that they had opposed regularly and consiently every thing that looked like violence that they had always contended that truth and reason were to be their only weapons—if you do not find these things as i now state them brand me in the forehead let me be marked with contempt and odium let me what can be worse let me be baptized a william and nicknamed a pitt if it should be proved and i have the documents to prove—that is to say i have lodged them where those who have an interest in suppressing the truth shall not be able to seize them till they are printed and then they may get the printed copies—if it should be proved also that those men had all this in evidence before them in the privy council from the witnesses they examined what will you say but that terror was to have been the order of the day here also that all argument was to be treason and opinion felony and that men for the future were to be afraid to open their lips to a friend at the table or encore a speech at the playhouse for fear of being hanged drawn and quartered for high treason—i think when you consider these facts you can have no doubt what the disposition of this man was what the inclination however deficient he might be in energy to imitate the tyranny of robespierre—if you recollect also as it is pretty well agreed that  00 warrants for high treason were signed and sealed ready to be executed upon the conviction of hardy of which they entertained no doubt not recollecting that english juries are not scotch juries nor always ready to obey the nod of a minister you     will start with horror at the recollection of the precipice from which you have escaped but let us pursue the parallel both of them have proved themselves to be men equally destitute of philosophy and of those social affections and tender sympathies that smooth the rugged temper of the politician and make gentleness and energy go hand in hand they have both also shewn themselves to be sanguinary and revengeful prone to suspicion and exhibiting a strange mixture of personal cowardice and political impetuosity robespierre and his faction ravaged france it is true for the destruction of royalty pitt and his faction have depopulated europe and spread a general famine through this quarter of the universe for the annihilation of liberty robespierre adopted a fair and impartial requisition for the defence of the liberties of his country i say a fair and impartial requisition for what so just and so impartial if you are to have war as to compel every man whatever be his fortune to partake of the hardships and perils of that war to suffer no man by procuring a substitute to put the life of a human being who happens to be in a different state of society in competition with his paltry pittance of property however it may be acquired pitt on the contrary has adopted a partial requisition by which the poor are submitted to the absolute controul without appeal of any justice of the peace who chooses to pronounce that they have no visible means of subsistence and in which the lowe orders of society are to be compelled exclusively to bleed for the promotion and aggrandizement of the great both have had their parties and their partialities robespierre unjustly oppressed the rich that he might support his popularity among the poor pitt has neglected and by his wars and consequent taxes oppressed the poor to secure his popclarity among the rich robespierre in order to preserve a plentiful circulation of the necessaries of life punished combinations cruelly and unjustly punished them—for severity and cruelty are always unjust among the merchants and monopolists that he might shew his partiality for the laborious part of the community under the administration of pitt punishments still continue to be awarded against the labourers who combine to increase their wages while monopoly is connived at and encouraged among the wealthy upon whom alone administration chuse to rest their confidence     both have made use of extraordinary means for filling the ranks of their armies and manning their fleets pitt has tolerated crimps kidnappers and pressgangs robespierre took care that whatever might be the condition of the other members of society the army and navy should be well clothed well fed and well paid robespiere set up a free constitution and tyrannized in direct opposition to it pitt praises another free constitution and tramples all its provisions under foot one effected his purpose by a dependent committee of public safety the other by a packed majority of boroughmongers and white slavemerchants for such we must consider them if the assertion of mr alderman newnham is true that the common people of this country of whom they dispose are in the condition of westindia slaves both pretended to reverence trial by jury and both endeavoured to undermine it as fast as they could robespierre by erecting a revolutionary tribunal which had a perpetual jury of his own appointment and pitt by fabricating innumerable acts which vest the trial of englishmen especially the poor dependent classes of englishmen in the arbitrary discretion of justices of the peace robespierre is accused of keeping a set of witnesses to swear whatever he chose and of calling them his lambs i dont know whether pitt may be called the good shepherd but he also has as fine a flock as ever grazed on the bounty of his rival he has his grovess his taylors his walshes his alexanders his lynams his uptons and a long list of gentlemen equally respectable equally valuable i dont say with himself but with each other and whom we will dignify if you please with the title of knights of the honorable order of confidants or retainers of gentlemen high in office pitt has however escaped the odium of part of this parellel for robespierre has been accused of actually sacrificing by these means a monstrous number of people—a much greater number he has been charged with destroying than in reality have fallen for i remember having read of one mans being guillotined six times who was afterwards killed in a massacre which never took place and after that had the honors of the sitting in the convention and to add to the pathos he was a man  0 years old and had nine children—santerre was guillotined twice and had afterwards the honors of the sitting in the convention general miranda was guillotined several times also and kellerman who has now     the command of one of the armies undoubtedly however he did under the pretence of law commit a monstrous train of massacres—but i will ask you what might have been the situation of this country if the late prosecutions had succeeded consider that there were many thousand members of the london corresponding society—and that a part of the doctrine was that every member whether present at their objectionable deliberations or not was answerable for the whole acts of the society and for every political act of every individual connected with it but suppose they meant to go no farther than the destruction of those whom they had marked as their first victims—though i am credibly informed that a noble lord was heard to say that he believed they must hang a third part of the constitutional society and perhaps that might be enough now as it was admitted that the constitutional society was not so bad as the london corresponding society we may conclude that one half of the members of the latter were to be hanged also and that might have been enough for them but who knows when you once begin a system of massacre and especially legal massacre for opinion where you can stop i do not believe that robespierre meditated in the first instance those scenes of carnage into which he at last was plunged but fear of revenge and the brooding malice of suspicion hurried him from act to act of accumulating horror till nothing but his own destruction could retrieve the country and i have strong suspicions in my mind that if they had touched the life of an individual who stood at the bar of the old bailey the gaols of london and we all know we have abundance would have been as crammed as ever the prisons of paris were even in the very dogdays of the tyranny of robespierre both these men also have a happy knack of sacrificing their friends whenever they find it convenient to get rid of them thus we find if a danton and a hebert have been cut off by robespierre as soon as they had answered his purpose pitt has also abandoned a jackson a fitzwilliam and a robert watt but here citizens the parallel ends for though pitt has the dictatorial ambition he can never be accused of the energy or virtues of robespierre pitt is the tool of an oligarchic faction over whom he appears to tyrannize but who can make him when they please their slave robespierre made every thing subservient to his own views and the greatness of his own mind     the one was firm steady and constant the first in the original assembly of france who declared himself hostile to royalty and he never departed from his text—whether that text was right or wrong i am not now enquiring the other on the contrary throughout his whole conduct has been shuffling treacherous and evasive the most anxious advocate for parliamentary reform associated with the first modern projectors of the plan of universal suffrage and annual parliaments he has since been the bitterest enemy to reformation and has even thirsted for the blood of every individual who would not be as great an apostate as himself he has indeed pretended to be consistent with respect to the slave trade but it was only i am afraid consistent hypocricy he can command a majority for places and pensions but he cannot command a vote for the interests of humanity robespierre had a soul capacious an imagination various a judgement commanding penetrating severe fertile of resources he foresaw created and turned to his advantage all the events that could possibly tend to the accomplishment of his designs the mind of pitt is barren and inflated his projects are crude and his views short sighted one was always politically intrepid and unmoved his means always adequate to the end and always persevered in with steadiness and consistency the other indecisive fluctuating and capricious adopts a project today and abandons it tomorrow issues an order from the privy council in the morning and countermands it at night his calculations which do not depend upon the rule of three have always been erroneous and deceitful and his consequent bluders have been such as nothing but his smoothe verbosity could cover one possessed the key of the passions and understood how to estimate their influences and command the various operations of the human mind the whole knowledge of the other is confined to his numeration table figures he can command but in events he has always been so mistaken that he has attempted no one thing without effecting the very contrary—anxious to suppress jacobinism in france he adopted the very measures best calculated to make the banner of jacobinism triumph without a struggle the projector of the seizure of the french west india islands the means he has employed have been so inadequate to the object that the event in all probability must be after being flattered with a transient gleam of success the total loss of all our own possessions in that part of the world   0 the one though dreaded was respected he was revered while he was abhorred the energy of his mind commanded success victory attended upon the arms he directed partly it is true from the energy of the country but partly from the energy also of his directing mind which planned which formed which pervaded the whole system saw all the parts and knew to which in particular it was necessary for him to direct his powers every one of his plans were conducted to its accomplishment except the last he undertook and in which he was disappointed because france was too much enlightened after having shaken off the chains of one tyrant to yield to those of another we find attendant upon the heels of his rival—on the contrary—not victory and triumph but disgrace and defeat disgraces so innumerable that nothing but the muddy imaginations of the inventors could possibly have occasioned them all defeats so continued that scorn instead of lamentation followed at their heels add to this that robespierre had a mind too great to be debauched by any thing but ambition he grasped at no accumulation of places and emoluments he neither enriched himself nor his family he indulged in no voluptuous pleasures he was incorruptible severe in simplicity to the last and we cannot do greater justice to his memory than by closing this lecture by a quotation from the works of one of his bitterest enemies montgaillard—he possesses a character of incorruptibility says he which hath preserved his influence against all the attacks of the brissotines and of the commune of paris solely confined in appearance to his functions of member of the committee of public safety and of jacobin robespierre shews every appearance of the most unaffected man this modesty of triumph this œconomy of person and the obscurity of his private life have so long secured him the popular favour he lives as he did in    0 neither altering his manners nor his taste and always changeless having reviewed these facts it is impossible to doubt which of these characters we must prefer     the tribune no xii saturday  0th may      lecture on the system of terror and persecution adopted by the present ministry with animadversions on the treatment of joseph gerrald citizens every person who has made use of the least reflection must admit that there is in the human mind a considerable tendency to progressive improvement that the individual always commences feeble and ignorant and gathers strength of mind as well as limbs in proportion to his exercise and experience it is true that after a given period even the mind much earlier with respect to the body is observed to go backwards again towards decay old age and debility creep first over the limbs and then invade the intellect and bring us in the last stage of our lives to a second degree of childhood this is not however the case with society the aggregate of human existence has no decay no old age and the tendency of the human mind considered in the aggregate is to perpetual improvement we may observe that human institutions indeed are subject to decay because human institutions growing at the time when they are first founded out of the necessities of society cease to be necessary when the state of society is different and when the progress of human intellect has made considerable advances just as the gocart is necessary for the child but no person would think of compelling the fullgrown man to follow the gocart all the days of his life there is another reason why these human institutions are liable to decay the improved intellect of society is some times though not always shared in common by the rulers and by the governed when this happens to be the case all is well but when the agents of the institutions become wiser than the institutions themselves and the body of the people are kept in ignorance these agents find out means of making that which was originally intended for the public good a mere matter of advantage to themselves and thus preserving an exterior semblance when they have destroyed all the virtual excellence of those institutions they bring on the     absolute necessity of overthrow if timely reform does not remove that dire necessity but though these circumstances affect human institutions the human mind as you will see is not under the same predicament there is an eternal renovation of youth of ardour of activity and consequently there is a universal tendency towards perpetual improvement i grant that the whole of this reasoning does not appear practically to apply if we observe superficially the events of history we shall find that though in theory the human mind is heir to the improvements of the former generation and though every advancement in the state of society though it was the mountain to which former ages travelled forms the level plain from which the succeeding generation is to start to attain a higher goal of intellectual improvement yet we cannot deny that history presents us with many instances of a retrogade motion in the political and intellectual revolutions of nations this however will be found to arise principally if not always from some one of the following causes—either first from eruptions of barbarians overthrowing the establishments of civilized societies or secondly from those disasters to which the general system of nature at times is subject such as plagues famines inundations and convulsions of the physical elements or thirdly from the usurpations of tyranny—this last is by much the most frequent cause of the retrogade motions of society and is sometimes effected by individuals grasping at thrones and dominions to which they had no pretence of legal right but much more frequently by those who are upon those thrones grasping at a power and authority to which those thrones are not by the proper institutions of society entitled these are as i have observed the usurpations that are by far more common than the former and in the preface to a work written by the late king of prussia who was certainly in these respects a very tolerable judge i mean the antimachiavel we find some very pertinent reflections upon this head which as i have royal authority for the publication i suppose it can be no treason to quote as the temptations says he to which a king is liable are very powerful it requires a more than ordinary degree of virtue to resist them and he very well observes that inundations which ravage countries thunder and lightning that reduce cities to ashes the pestilence which lays whole provinces     waste are less fatal to the world than the vicious morals and unbridled passions of princes the plagues of heaven continue but for a time they only ravage some countries and these losses however grievous are nevertheless repaired whereas the crimes of kings entail a lasting misery upon whole nations—how deplorable continues the royal author whose conduct was afterwards so excellent a comment upon his text—how deplorable says he is the condition of that people who have every thing to fear from the abuse of majesty whose properties are a prey to the avarice of their prince their liberty to his caprice their repose to his ambition their safety to his perfidiousness and their lives to his cruelty with respect to the perfidiousness he left the comment upon that to be written by his successor such then are the causes of the retrogade movements of society but barring these we must be blind indeed if we do not see a perpetual tendency to progressive improvement in the intellect and i believe in the virtues of mankind every new discovery every fresh event is a source of extensive improvement slow indeed in its operation at first but afterwards rapid and important the institutions of society thus by the improvement of intellect will every now and then be growing unfit for the state and condition to which the mind of man has arrived in the first instance we find as i have observed before that those institutions grow out of the necessities of society but nothing can be more pernicious to the happiness and welfare both of the individuals who attempt it and mankind at large than to endeavour to perpetuate those institutions when on account of the altered condition of man they become instead of necessary injurious thus it is that the enlightened part of the community are always looking forward to an amelioration of their political circumstances and if the enlightened intellect of man were left to its free progress—if calumny and persecution did not attempt to arrest its steps peaceful and happy would be the advances which men would make and each succeeding generation would look back with admiration upon the liberality of that which preceeded it while it felt an honest exultation at having towered to greater heighths of virtue and perfection benevolence and wisdom would not only yield to this improvement but would stretch forth the hand of government to help it forward but selfinterest and rapacity stimulate too often those who happen to be vested with power to a     directly opposite conduct an inclination to tyrannize a disposition to monopolize the advantages of corruption too frequently leads the statesman instead of enlarging the boundaries of freedom in proportion to the improved intellect of man to resist that improvement by contracting them within narrower spaces thus the stream of popular sentiment and improvement the strong current of increasing liberty in proportion as the waves are swollen is dammed up with fresh restrictions and embanked within a narrower channel till at last impatient of restraint it bursts its boundaries and spreading like an inundation sweeps before it at once the tyrannous restrictions that have been erected and the deluded beings who erected them perfectly consonant with this observation is the experience which is to be derived from all the former facts of history persecution is no new invention it has been tried again and again and has often been fatal indeed to the virtuous reformers who first propped the persecuted cause but has never failed ultimately to secure the triumph of the principles thus ridiculously opposed and has frequently brought down a terrible vengeance upon the heads of those who have wielded the intolerant sword let us look back upon all that history unfolds what was the first reception of christianity in the world and if we look to the page which records the merits of that institution whatever particular opinions individuals may have they are always to do justice to the cause of which they are speaking—if we look back to that institution we certainly must admit it to be one of those that had to a considerable degree the happiness and welfare of mankind at heart the amelioration of the general condition of man and particularly the uplifting of the trampled plebeian from the dust and restoring him to that independence which belongs to the genuine system of liberty and equality in vain therefore did the cruelties and calumnies of the imperial despots of rome and their servile coadjutors persecute the dawning spirit of christianity it had too much political truth in it not to make impressions upon the hearts of mankind and these impressions instead of being effaced were rendered infinitely more powerful in their operation in consequence of the persecutions directed against it many an excellent and worthy creature struggling for the advancement of what he believed to be truth fell a victim to tyranny and persecution and though lying monks have since disgraced     their tales by fabling allegories and by ridiculous visions i cannot but think that i discover in the fall of many of these martyrs strong symptoms of that virtuous spirit which prompts the present exertions of the advocates for the principles of liberty and the freedom of human intellect they fell but christianity triumphed i shall not trace the abuses that soon crept into an institution which virtuous in poverty became corrupted by being taken under the wing of power that would be a digression but i shall observe that the same instructive lesson is to be drawn from after records as from those early ones to which i have now referred look back to the progress of the reformation when human liberty first burst forth from that torpor in which it had lain so long the first struggles were against priestly tyranny by which every faculty of mind and body was enslaved priestly tyranny had its pretended liberties and properties to defend and the sword of persecution was wielded by the fleshly arm of those who ought to have been all spirit purity and tolerance and to have remembered that they were paid for fighting battles in the other world and not for wetting the daggers of assassination in this thirty years of war deluged the continent of europe in this struggle between rousing intellect and the depressing tyranny of priestcrast in proportion however to the persecution the energy of the advocates for reformation increased and the blood of the martyrs was again the seed of the church as it is called but i shall say the seed of human liberty priestly tyranny fell nor could it be propped nor could the course of free enquiry be restrained in this country by the persecuting fury of a bonner or by the perpetual flames of smithfield any more than by an age of tyrannous warfare among the despots on the continent thus then we see that with respect to what is considered as connected with religious questions persecution was never capable of ultimately disappointing those views into which liberal and energetic minds had entered if we look to the civil history of mankind we shall find the same moral written i shall not travel for these examples beyond the boundaries of my own country it cannot be new to any person who listens to me and therefore it need not be particularly animadverted upon that once in this country the absurd doctrines of the divine right of kings passive obedience and nonresistance were fulminated from the pulpit and thundered     from the cabinet of the country in order to support those doctrines against the innovating fury of those who began to discover that man had rights and that government was instituted not for the benefit of an individual but for the benefit of society at large persecution again drew the sword from the scabbard where political and religious institutions have seldom suffered it to sleep for any considerable time and we find fictitious treasons pretended plots and conspiracies courts of star chamber and every species of persecution and illegal inquisition was adopted to crush the daring spirit of truth and annihilate the growing reason of britons what was the effect the struggle was long the struggle in many respects was melancholy sometimes one party prevailed at other times another but the persecuted party never lost its energy by persecution on the contrary the energy increased charles the first fell charles the second was restored it is true and the doctrines of divine right were attempted to be extended to a still greater degree than ever till this time the usual language with philosophers lawyers and historians wont to be the commonwealth of england it is the constant language of all our old constitutional writers who considered the king as no other than a president with regal powers the first magistrate of the republic of england this language was now however thrown aside and judges were found for if you refer to the state trials you will find that there have been some judges in this country who could make most curious speeches and lay down most curious doctrines whenever it would suit the purposes of the court who employed them—i say judges were found—chief justices of the common pleas and chief barons of the exchequer to broach new fangled doctrines about the imperial crown of britain and the unquestionable authority of the king not say they that we mean to set up an absolute despotism the king is to govern according to the laws though he is not amenable to them nobody has a right to find fault with him he is to govern according to law but if he chooses to violate that law nobody has a right to call him to account a doctrine by the way which these judges had not the merit of inventing for it was invented by james the first who said that every good king was bound of conscience to administer justice according to the laws of the land but at the same time it was nothing less than blasphemy in a subject to question his omnipotent power for he had no     bond no restriction but the conscience that inhabited his royal bosom the doctrines of divine right were revived enforced and aggravated at the close of the reign of charles the second and during the reign of james the second attempts were made to subjugate this country entirely and as they had not then learned the secret of buying parliaments they attempted to do without them yet in defiance of their court of perverted law in defiance of their iniquisitions in defiance of the pillory the halter and the gibbet the friends of man persevered and conquered russel fell and sidney fell and many a glorious patriot fell besides but the cause for which they bled triumphed at last passive obedience and nonresistance and the divine right of kings were laid together in the grave nor do i believe that all the howlings of burke the metaphysical ravings of windham no nor the plausible verbosity of pitt will ever arise them from their graves again or obtain them to be acknowledged once more in this country but to tell the truth no wish is entertained at this time to revive these exploded doctrines there is another doctrine new and curious indeed in its nature which ministers think more to their interest and advantage and consequently more to the glory and happiness of the nation to maintain by fire and sword and desolation namely the infallibility of ministers the divine right of     oligarchic proprietors of the rights and suffrage of the nation these are the sovereigns of the day and to speak one word against the rotten boroughs of east grinstead and old sarum is the highest of high treasons and is to be punished with fines imprisonment transportation and death but citizens the usurpations and despotism of ministers will no more triumph than the despotism of the church of rome triumphed than the prosecuting spirit of the roman emperors triumphed or than the doctrines of divine right and passive obedience triumphed in the wise and virtuous times of the lamented stuarts ministers indeed may bring forward as they please their new inquisitions but the enlightened spirit of the people will not be suppressed the improved intellect of man calls for an improvement not for an increased corruption of the systems of government men who are wiser must be governed by more wisdom and moderation not pressed and trampled down with an increase of burdens and usurpations     almost the whole country begins to perceive that the boasted check which the commons house of parliament was intended to have upon the other branches of the constitution is done away they know very well that it is a farce to talk of the representation of the commons house of parliament when     rich landholders nobles and others can return a decided majority in that house which calls itself the representatives of the people and it is therefore that for thirty years back considerable agitation has occasionally taken place in the public mind upon the subject of parliamentary reform this however has uniformly been resisted by the ministers who happened to be in place the party out of place has now and then lent it some little assistance while they found there were no other means of acquiring popularity but as soon as they either got into place or were likely to get into place they have always abandoned it and the wishes of the people never have been complied with but what has been the consequence why an increase in the demands of the people not a diminution and whereas in former times a small reform would have been accepted as sufficient i have no doubt that almost every individual begins to look forward for a reform upon a larger scale they begin to look forward to annual parliaments to universal suffrage because continued discussion has convinced them that every man has rights to defend and therefore ought to have the means of defence that pure representation is the only defence these rights can depend upon and that a representation for the whole ought to be a representation of the whole they discover also that according to the theory of our constitution they have an absolute right to those annual parliaments and to that universal suffrage the former of which they actually did enjoy in ancient times a fact which has been particularly proved as to the reign of edward iii as you will see in my vindication of the natural and constitutional rights of britons they elected their members for every session of parliament and if two sessions of parliament were held in one year then they elected their representatives twice during that year and sent them with their instructions in their pockets dictating to them how they should vote in other words they were guilty of the high treason of over awing their own servants and representatives but citizens the present administration have not been satisfied with merely resisting the wishes of the people they have adopted persecution against those individuals who have had the     boldness to speak for their rights and mark the steps by which they have advanced first they began with prosecuting for libel and sedition though both of them are things which no law has defined of which no act has fixed the limits which are not to be found in the best constitutional authorities libel in reality means nothing more than little book and why a man should be prosecuted for publishing a little book any more than a large book i can find but one reason namely that large books give but little information and that little books frequently give a great deal as to sedition the lawyers themselves are not agreed even upon the definition of it they freely confess they do not know the meaning of the word and one of the judges of scotland—oh excellent and virtuous judges of the court of justiciary how shall i mention you without pouring forth in gratitude your praises but however my esteem for your virtues is not greater than my admiration for your wisdom and indeed i think such virtues and such wisdom ought always to go hand in hand—one of these judges then being asked by one of the seditious panels at the bar what was the meaning of sedition replied why my lords does not the panel know that sedition is a very great crime in all the countries of the world—it is a monstrous crime—it includes all other crimes my lords it is—it is—it is—it is—in short it is sedition citizens upon the strength of this very eloquent illustration we know that they proceeded to transportation for seven and for fourteen years against characters upon whose conduct public or private not one imputation of scandal can be laid men whose talents were an ornament to their country whose virtue whose independence and disinterestedness were even still more conspicuous than their talents but this was not enough transportation for fourteen years did not suppress the rising spirit of enquiry men have discovered that they have rights and feeling a deep conviction of this they feel also that without the enjoyment of those rights neither their country nor their lives are worth their care the next step therefore was to prosecute several individuals for high treason for opposing the projects of ministers and disputing the divine right of the holders of rotten boroughs an attack upon these rotten boroughs was called an attack upon property just as if human intellect could be property as if the suffrages of mankind could be property as if any individual can possibly have a right of voting for millions without at the same time possessing the power of crushing   0 and destroying those millions—loading them with what burdens oppressive taxations and impositions he thinks fit and in fact treating them in every other respect like beasts of burden by these prosecutions however though they have been too successful in their attempts with respect to sedition they were able to effect nothing more than to destroy their own spies—perhaps some of these poor deluded gentlemen those confidants of gentlemen high in office may be here at this time but let them take warning by the fate of watt and jackson and remember how perilous a thing it is to enjoy the confidence of the present administration citizens in a ministerial paper which gives an account of the trial of jackson there is a paragraph which justifies this classification the reporter says that on the trial of jackson mr cockayne—if there are any gentlemen of the law here they know that man pretty well i dare say i was once in the profession myself and i remember what sort of reputation he then bore however that is neither here nor there you know when we want facts we must take them from the best authority we can get and when ministers want high treason and can get no respectable evidence of its existence they must hang up their men upon such testimony as they can procure—mr cockayne an attorney of london deposed that he had been for a series of years the law agent and intimate friend of mr jackson who a few years since went to france as the witness understood to tranfact some private business for mr pitt where he resided for a considerable time soon after his return mr cockayne said he called on him and told him in confidence that he had formed a design of going to ireland to sound the people for the purpose of procuring a supply of provisions c from them for the french and requested him the witness to accompany him having accepted the invitation he immediately waited on mr pitt and discovered to him the whole of mr jacksons plans the minister thanked him for the information and hinted that as the matter was to become a subject of legal investigation it would be necessary for him to substantiate the allegations but this mr cockayne wished to decline on the principle—you find principle is here made use of in the true ministerial sense—with whom principle and interest are controvertible terms—on the principle that if the prisoner should be convicted of high treason he should lose by it £ 00—he should lose     £ 00—why you know citizens it would not have been very modest to say mr pitt you must give me  00l or i will not hang this man perhaps neither mr pitt nor mr cockayne had the brass to stand the brunt of such a proposal he should lose by it  00l in which sum he was then indebted to him this objection was soon removed by mr pitt agreeing to pay him the money provided he would prosecute to conviction and the witness accompanied mr jackson to ireland for the purpose of making himself acquainted with his proceedings citizens i tremble for myself—i tremble for you what security is there for the life of any man if a villainous spy chuses thus to fix a price upon his head and say to a minister such a man owes me  00l pay me that sum and i will hang him for high treason—who knows how soon you or i may be in debt to mr cockayne at this rate i dwell upon this subject a little copiously to oblige the ministerial scribblers who wish to be furnished with a few hints as it appears for in another very respectable paper of this day called the times i am invited not to pass over the affair in silence and as i have a high respect for the writers of that print who have earned their bread for years by diurnal slander and assassination i will not fail to indulge their wishes but i should do them injustice if i were not to quote the words of their invitation—some of our modern lecturers say the editors of this respectable print might make some atonement for their past political lectures if they would give the public an oration on the causes of parson jacksons suicide and point out the bad effects of insidious attempts to subvert the constitution they might also make a few comments on the treasonable conduct of hamilton rowan and the republican sentiments of the united irishmen shewing to what purposes their views tended and if they gave a sketch of the character of napper tandy another seditionist who fled to america it would serve to strengthen the family piece and warn the public of the danger of following the principles of such men this challenge i accept as far as relates to the person tried every man who professes the least respect for the laws of his country might have the decency to be silent as to the others against whom there is no legal evidence whatever with respect to jackson i admit in the first instance that if the charge standing at present upon the individual testimony of a man     who says he is not bribed but that he was to secure to himself the payment of £ 00 by the conviction of the culprit be true that it called for the severest animadversion of the law he who introduces a foreign foe into the country destroys the liberty and independence he pretends to promote and damns the good cause in which he pretends to be embarked i shall not animadvert particularly upon the character of the witness i shall only observe that it is the general fate of those who boast of the confidence of gentlemen high in office that no person who is not high in office would condescend to be seen in their company i shall add however that i have always thought that in ireland as well as in england the life of an individual was held so sacred that it was not a single oath that would take it away however respectable the deponent might be surely existence is but a frail tenure indeed in an age of spies and informers like the present if one mans life is not worth two mens oaths however pure in moral character however free from the taint of suspicion but as these famous times writers or timeservers or whatever you please to call them talk about suicide would it not be worth while to enquire first of all whether it was a suicide or not did jackson poison himself let reason speak for we have no facts or documents would not a man who meant to destroy himself have waited first the issue of the motion that was making upon such strong grounds to arrest the judgment and reverse the verdict would the man who after all stood under the recommendation of the jury for mercy a recommendation not very often neglected would such a man for they say he was a man of considerable intellect have laid the destroying hand upon himself till he had seen the certainty that there was no other means of escaping an ignominious execution but there are persons in these countries who have studied machiavel with other views than to confute him there are persons whose whole conduct shows us that they have treasured the wicked system in their hearts and one of the things recommended by machiavel is to put a man privately out of the way whom it might be dangerous to expose to public execution i charge no particular individuals i know not who has had access to or who the care of jackson i know not by what accidents particular catastrophes may sometimes take place but this i know that in the decline of the roman     empire when spies and informers were publicly patronized poisoning and assassination were also exceedingly common dead men tell no tales but some men have been found who in their last moments have revealed fatal secrets and considering what multifarious transactions jackson has been concerned in—considering that he has sometimes been editor of a newspaper and sometimes a writer of scandalous and scurrilous controversy—considering that he was a very useful servant to a great dutchess—considering that he was engaged in a variety of services some of which were not very honourable there might have been some of his employers unwilling that he should tell all he knew at least it would have become the writers of the times to have ascertained facts before they had dared to broach the insinuations which have appeared in different papers under that name but the wretch who pending the preparation for the trial of twelve men—trials in which perhaps the lives of thousands were involved could publish in his newspaper that scandalous and profligate libel called the new times in which the individuals to be tried were represented perpetrating in convention the most detestable transactions—in which the individual now speaking to you was represented as giving orders for rapes and massacres for burning villages and plundering towns and thus attempt to poison the minds of the juries that were to decide upon their lives—the wretched prostituted editor of such a paper must be capable of any thing nor can we ever be surprised at any thing he does or says or ever expect him to blush   ——unless in spreading vices snares   he blunders on some virtue unawares but i will suppose that jackson did destroy himself and that he was really guilty of all he was charged with what then is the conclusion to be drawn in the first place we are to conclude that there is a wide difference between the firm and manly conduct of a man suffering for principle and the wretch who takes bribes from both parties and conducts himself according to the expediences of the moment as he supposes most favourable to his individual interest it would teach us also that the being who has once prostituted himself so much to be a spy and agent of pitt has no alternative no hope no dilemma but either either to be hanged like watt or swallow poison like the unfortunate jackson     the halter and suicide are the only resources of these poor spies and yet such is the miserable condition into which the burdens of the country and the luxury of the times have brought us that heaps of poor beings with this dreadful alternative before them march upon this forlorn hope under the command of the great general reeves and with so excellent a pay master as the present chancellor of the exchequer but though spies and informers have met the shaft of death freedom and virtue have had their scars on the manly breast of patriotism the wound is still rankling and the tear of humanity is called not only for the poor wretch who falls a victim to the crimes into which poverty and ignorance have led him but for virtue genius and transcendant talents and a fortitude of independence of which few instances are to be found in the annals of the human race the mild the meek the humane and benevolent palmer has been followed into exile by the eloquent the manly the enlightened muir the simplicity of skirving and his untainted honesty could not preserve him and margarot whose mind firm as our rocks and upright as our masts—daring in virtue and vigorous in intellect opposed the growing corruption of the times—is gone to the inhospitable shores of new holland amidst felons and caitiffs of the worst description to lose in worse than solitude those talents which might have enlightened thousands and benefited successive generations but this is not all the cup is not vet drained to the dregs more of bitterness must be tasted gerrald too whose transcendent mind and virtues equal to his intellect challenge the love and admiration of all who know him he whose vast stores of genius and science command reverence from the first sages of the time—who is revered by all who know what merit and learning are and esteemed by all who have a nerve for exalted friendship——gerrald whose unblemished life—unblemished i say for what are the little extravagancies of a young man of genius born not for the narrow circle of a family but for the universe—and who dissipating only what was his own lays no burthens on society to replace it——gerrald this great this enlightened character who in the   th year of his age has attained a degree of mental excellence that very few even of those who stand recorded for their talents have attained at the maturest periods—gerrald also is sent not to botany bay to enjoy the converse of those godlike patriots sent before him—this     were something like humanity—no but to that solitary speck of earth norfolk island where his only companions must be wretches cast out from society for the meanest and most despicable of crimes or savages whose untutored minds and ferocious manners exclude all the comforts and alleviations of human intercourse citizens it is difficult to do justice to such a character as gerralds when we speak of superior excellence our minds toil with anxiety to reach its merits and frequently swell into bombast for want of remembering that we cannot do complete justice to the talents of another unless our own are of equal magnitude i shall not therefore attempt to toil through the paths of panegyric but shall read to you a faint and feeble yet in some degree a just sketch of the talents of this martyr printed this day in the morning chronicle his mind says the writer grasped various branches of science and digested them all the best scholars the profoundest metaphysicians and the ablest professors of politics and the law of nations will be the first to confess the soundness of his classical knowledge the acuteness and extent of his reasonings and the accuracy of his information his eloquence had equally the power to charm and astonish and the brilliancy of his imagination was not inferior to the terrors of his invective with all this his temper is not less entitled to our praise he was placable and generous to an extreme the magnanimity of his spirit and the purity of his sense of honour could only be completely understood by those who had made them the subject of personal observation his defence delivered before the court of justiciary at edinburgh—which citizens i recommend you all to read with the greatest attention it will shew you the difference between the intellects of this champion of liberty and of those who sat in judgment upon him it will enlarge your minds with the fruits of profound research into the genuine principles of that liberty which glows in his breast and which i am sure will for ever continue to glow there though it must glow where not a breast can receive benefit from its warmth nor an eye be cheered with its light his defence delivered before the court of justiciary at edinburgh is a masterpiece in acuteness of reasoning purity of composition and dignity of sentiment i am aware that the various excellence i ascribe to him would seem like a romance if gerrald had been a man unknown to the world but almost every eminent scholar     and statesman in britain knew his merits and know that i say less than the truth because i do not know how to tell the truth in its full extent having finished his education and his travels he came to england the country which seemed best adapted to the display of his talents alas those talents are crushed perhaps for ever by the flagitious act of men who were incapable of understanding them or understood only to hate them such is the man who is now sent to ignominious exile but it was not hatred only that stimulated the men who sent him they were goaded also by fear alas what is the condition of a country in which talents united with intrepid virtue a power of discovering truth and a determination to abide by its decisions can be dreaded by those who grasp the helm of power but citizens this man is not only transported like a felon he has been treated with aggravated cruelty why for thirteen or fourteen long months was such a man to be kept stretched on the feverish rack of apprehension why if the door of mercy as it is called—i should call it justice—was for ever to have been shut against him why was he not sent together with those companions who were not gone from the coast of britain when his sentence was pronounced why was he to be moved from dungeon to dungeon from the tolbooth to newgate and from newgate to the new compter why was he for ever to be racked and tortured with hopes and expectations and partly with promises that his sentence was never to be carried into execution did they expect that the proud virtue of gerrald could have been shaken had they hopes that he would disgrace the cause of liberty by mean concessions if such were their hopes i glory in his transportation for rather would i see—much as i love much as i esteem him greatly as i adore his virtues and intellects much rather would i see him thus sent to inhospitable regions than have seen him exposed to the still more cruel ignominy of submitting to crouch beneath the footstool of a pitt or a dundas and accept of mercy upon dishonorable conditions from the hands of men who are not worthy to unlose the latchet of his shoes but it has been said that there was another motive it has been said that if the prosecutors in the late trials for high treason had been successful they were to have tried him over again in england that they thought transportation     not enough and that he was to have been one of the innumerable victims that were to have made the streets of this city flow with blood to complete the parallel between pitt and robespierre whatever might be the reasons for which he was kept so long the manner of his removal at last deserves some notice it is not many weeks since i went to visit him in consequence of hearing it whispered about that he was to be sent off immediately i found him unconscious of such rumour but apparently almost in the last stage of a disease that if not relieved in time must have swept him off in a few days i found this great man this light of the universe unattended uncomforted unsuccoured no hand to administer to his disease but the person employed by government to attend the prison i do not even know the name of that gentleman and therefore can mean no disrespect to him but i would not leave such a man in the power of any person employed by the present ministry i procured him other assistance and i had the pleasure in some degree to see him out of the jaws of absolute danger but in that state of health which made his friends think proper to apply to mr dundas to know whether he was to go or not that proper preparations might be made for his accommodation it was on the  th of april last i understand that this precaution was taken and the answer of mr dundas was they state the fact in the chronicle of today which agrees partly with the account i had from gerrald himself that there was no intention of sending him at present and if it depended upon him he would not be sent at all yet so short a time after comes the mandate of authority gerrald goes down upon the summons and is immediately doubleironed like the vilest felon and dragged away without even permission to go back again to his room and kiss the little lips of his sweet babe that kept him company in prison he was scarcely permitted to speak through the grate to a fellow prisoner and give him some directions as to the things he left behind him away he was hurried and the first notice his friends had of it was from its being announced on the monday in the public newspapers such is the man whom the humane the virtuous the pious—for they talk of religion as men generally do when they are disposed to do such actions—such is the man whom these virtuous ministers have treated in this ignominious     manner for what for opposing the sovereign on the throne for disturbing the peace of society and exciting rebellions and insurrections for committing depredations upon public virtue and justice no but for doing that which no law forbids no statute proscribes no previously adjudged case if adjudged cases were in reality any authority had warned him to shun and for doing it with an eloquence which his persecutors could not rival and with a power

on prosecutions for pretended treason delivered on wednesday the   th of may      the anniversary of the arrest of the patriots citizens this being the anniversary of the arrest of the patriots who some time since were implicated in a factitious and ridiculous charge of high treason it appeared to me that some sort of notice should be taken of the return of a day so important in the event to the progress of liberty but once so threatening to the existence even of the very shadow of british freedom i therefore chose for the subject of this evening prosecutions for pretended treason it was my intention to have gone pretty largely into the history of these prosecutions in this country particularly during the reigns of the stuarts reigns which some persons dignified with official situations in this country seem to have studied with minute attention drawing as it were all their precedents from those reigns and the ill counsels given by the ministers of that unfortunate family i meant to have laid before you a great variety of interesting and entertaining particulars as the subject is indeed of a very curious nature and well worth our serious attention and as during my confinement in the tower i was naturally led to the consideration of facts of this description while i was in that confinement therefore i made very copious notes and extracts from history and from the state trials that they might furnish me with matter for a course of lectures in this place upon this branch of our political history but to those notes i have had no time to refer eminent as my duties are in this situation i have been called upon by a duty of a superior nature to the discharge of which neither my conscience nor my feelings would permit me to be inattentive you will remember that on the last lecturenight i took the liberty of proposing to you a subscription for our beloved and persecuted fellowcitizen joseph gerrald i did not then think fit to announce my intention of setting off the next morning to see that virtuous and persecuted patriot whose amiable manners have won the hearts of his fellowcitizens as his talents have commanded the admiration of mankind i   0 did think proper to mention it at that time because i did not know what jealousies might continue to haunt him and therefore went as private as possible left i should be deprived of the solitary satisfaction which was left me of seeing once more that beloved and respected patriot who is going to distant and inhospitable regions for exerting those virtues and talents which illumine his heart for the benefit of mankind and because he would not prostitute his understanding to aristocratic usurpation and ministerial corruption i have the pleasure to inform you that that collection with which i set off without delay amounted to    guineas the receipt for which i now have in my hand and which is ready for the inspection of any citizen who wishes to be satisfied upon that point i had another reason also for my journey i wished that some memorial of that great man should be left behind him for the instruction of his country i wished to procure the means of decorating these walls with the bust of that revered patriot that fixing my eye frequently upon the image of his countenance i might be inspired with similar virtues and endeavor to imitate those talents which he so transcendantly possesses for these reasons i have been to portsmouth from whence i am but this instant returned i have but just had time to wipe the dust from my weary brow that i might take my place in this situation and submit my thoughts to you upon this important subject with such arrangements as could be made during my journey but there is one circumstance relative to this visit which i shall not do justice to you and to society if i pass over in entire silence though it is something like digression of the deportment of citizen gerrald i shall give you some idea at the conclusion of my lecture but when i am speaking of my journey i ought to observe that i have been deceived and am now agreeably undeceived relative to the state of the public mind in that part of the country i have visited in order that no barrier might be thrown in my way to prevent my seeing the citizen i have hinted that i thought it necessary at first to keep my journey as private as possible i found however that these precautions were not as necessary as i supposed i found that in portsmouth there are upright enlightened and virtuous magistrates who will not suffer the peace to be disturbed by any factious set of beings who may choose to bawl out church and king for the purposes of     inflammation and tumult and to destroy the peace and property of those who happen to differ from them in political or religious opinion i found also that the seeds of liberty are not only sown but have spread to a considerable degree in that aristocratic town the centre as it is of so considerable a portion of patronage and consequently of dependence instead of meeting in every house jealousy and animosity i found a great number of persons anxious for an opportunity of shewing their affection and attachment to those principles which have been lately so much persecuted and for that cause in particular which occasioned my visit to that place so that while many strangers found it difficult to obtain accommodations at any price my friend and myself on account of our principles and the object of our embassy were cheared and welcomed by persons of all descriptions from those of the learned professions down to the simple mechanic and labourer and were received and entertained with a hospitality that bore more resemblance to the welcome of old and intimate friends than the greetings and civilities of strangers i do not mean to represent these as the unanimous sentiments of the place but they are sufficiently so to procure protection to any individual whose good intentions may carry him to that part of the country and i own it gave me great pleasure to perceive that the gall of animosity in the opposite party is either transmuted into the milk of human kindness or else is kept in awe by the shame which never fails to result when malice is checked in her career and sanguinary cruelty is disappointed and unmasked such having been the manner in which i have been employed since i last met you i hope to experience your candour for any deficiences in the lecture of this evening as the only preparation i have had was made by quitting the coach at a time when others were taking their refreshment and indulging myself in a solitary walk that i might collect a few of the ideas that floated in my imagination to proceed then to my subject prosecutions for high treason as is well observed by the author of the preface to state trials have in all ages been the fatal engines so often employed by corrupt and wicked ministers against the noblest and bravest patriots it is a little important therefore in order that none of us may be made the tools of such nefarious designs that we consider a little the meaning of the word treason     many of you may in the different periods of your lives have to decide upon the existence of your fellow citizens perhaps upon the liberty and salvation of the country let me therefore invoke you seriously to consider the proper meaning that ought to be attached to those terms that sound so dreadfully in our ears that you may not be in danger of being abused by mere words when it is the spirit the soul the motives and the consequences of action upon which the juror ought to decide treason then citizens as the derivation points out is the act of betraying this is it is true a very general definition and perhaps in the first instance it is best to begin with general definitions and afterwards proceed to the particular treason then is the act of betraying and accordingly we talk in private conversation of traitor to his friend traitor to his trust treachery to a mistress—a benefactor—an employer in short in all the situations in life in which confidence can be reposed we talk of treason and treachery this definition however it is my present duty to apply to the system of politics and then we shall find that treason politically speaking means betraying the trust reposed in the individual by the country or betraying that country to the injury and destrustion from which it is the duty of the individual to preserve it now when you consider this definition which i believe must universally be admitted to be just one reflection must present itself to your minds namely that generally speaking the traitors are to be found in that class of men who are themselves the prosecutors for treason they are the men in whom trust and confidence is placed they are the men who have the power of betraying ruining and destroying the country they are the men who if you consult the history of every country in the world have been continually and perpetually undermining and destroying those constitutions and those countries which with hypocritical plausibility they pretended to uphold and to revere this is treachery indeed it is betraying a trust it is deceiving the minds of the public it is in fact inflicting the basest the deepest and the most detestable wound that the arm of the assassin can possibly aim the petty murderer who meets his merited reward at the gibbet has destroyed an individual has overthrown the peace of one family but the minister who for his selfish ambition to gratify the rapacity     of his dependants and relations and to monopolize all places power and trusts into his own hands betrays the interest and happiness of his country murders by wholesale and the millions that strew the plains of foreign countries with whose concerns he had no right to interfere constitute the smallest part of the guilt that stains his polluted conscience citizens this crime which in england is called treason has been variously denominated and described by different countries in the world it is not necessary for me to make an ostentatious display of that sort of learning which any man may acquire by half an hours consultation with his dictionary and therefore i shall not run through a list of these various names but i shall just simply instance the descriptive and energetic name which has been given of it by the french republic observing at the same time that among the many advantages resulting from some of the transactions and proceedings of the french revolution for i never gave an unqualified approbation of the whole we may particularly notice a renewed energy of soul and expression by which that country has shewn us the power which liberty gives not only to the arms but to the language of people enabling the one to mow down ranks of those who have less interest in the struggle and the other to compress the meanings of volumes into a single word they have called this crime of treason patricide—or murdering the country now citizens this is i believe giving in one word a description more copious and more energetic than will be found in all our treatises of the law of treason put together it is striking at the vital existence and happiness of the country not that which ministers call the existence of the country—the continuance of power in the hands of a few individuals who have erected themselves into an arbitrary oligarchy no but the continuance of freedom happiness and the possibility of maintaining the great body of the people in equal rights equal laws and the distribution of equal justice this is the existence which the real traitor aims to destroy and what treason what crime can be so monstrous as the crime of that individual who meditates so detestable an assassination that this was the original meaning of the word treason in this country might be proved by a variety of documents if i had time to refer to them i shall notice however only the first in the collection of state trials and which took place in the reign of richard the second when     tresillian and other ministers and judges were tried for high treason for monopolizing to themselves the wealth and power of the country employing it to the maintenance of mercenary forces to coerce the people and dissipating those revenues which ought to have provided for the security happiness and abundance of the nation citizens i know of few things more important than that we accurately define to ourselves the limits and bounds of the terms we make use of and the train of reasoning into which i have fallen seems to make it necessary that i should chalk out to you a distinction very important though hitherto not very particularly attended to i mean the distinction between treason and rebellion a distinction which exists in nature and which is of the most important kind for treason can only be practised against the happiness safety and security of the country but rebellion may be practised against an usurper who is destroying that country but who as he grasps the power may consider himself as having the right to destroy those who would restrain the arbitrary exercise of his authority the rebel is not of necessity a traitor nor of necessity is the traitor a rebel they are frequently united together but i think a recurrence to a few historical facts will shew you a very material difference when harmodius and aristoghiton slew the tyrant pisistratus did the athenians consider those heroes as traitors to their country because they were rebels to the usurper who called himself their prince on the contrary we find that their fame was celebrated in odes and poems and mr pye the present poet laureat has thought fit to translate one of the odes which was written upon that occasion by the grecian poet symonides and he does it he tells you for this express reason that such compositions ought not to be lost as they keep alive the spirit and love of liberty the writing and signing of that ode having caused the athenians afterwards to follow up the example and get rid of other usurping tyrants in the same manner citizens if i recollect rightly for it is some years since i read the poems of mr pye that poem begins and ends with the following stanza   eternal honors deathless meed   shall lovd harmodius crown thy deed   and brave aristoghetons sword—   because the tyrants breast ye gord to be concluded in our next     the tribune no xiii saturday  th june      the lecture on prosecutions for pretended treason delivered on wednesday the   th of may      the anniversary of the arrest of the patriots concluded from our last number thus we find then that neither the athenians of old nor mr pye our most loyal poet laureat considered it any act of treason to destroy the traitor who usurped authority to which he was not entitled though certainly it was rebellion according to every construction which can possibly be given to the word when the thirty tyrants usurped dominion over athens was it treason to remove those tyrants and restore the purity of the athenian constitution it was rebellion indeed for to rise in arms against the ruling power must always be rebellion i shall show you by and by that ministers in the present day think it is rebellion and treason too to rise not in arms but in words against them or any of their measures if from greece we travel to rome we shall find other examples not less important as to the distinction which i am laying down—i shall take care by and by not to be misunderstood relative to the object and meaning of these arguments—citizens when tarquin the limited sovereign of rome became the ravisher of the virtuous lucretia when he usurped prerogatives that did not belong to him and when oppression and tyranny ravaged the country it was rebellion indeed in brutus when he stirred up the people to resist the tyranny and drove the tarquins from the gates of rome but was it treason to restore the country from the gulph of tyranny and perdition into which it was fallen there is not a man who has one spark of british ardour left in his     bosom who will pronounce such blasphemy against reason and liberty it was rebellion to resist the usurping decemvirs—that oligarchy that trampled on the rights of rome—but instead of being treason it was virtue and when cæsar lorded it over the senate and with a venal pack of senators who ought to have stood up for the liberties of the people but who were his creatures his tools his hirelings and dependants—when by their assistance he laid the liberties of rome prostrate at his feet did the second brutus did cassius that last of romans who rose in rebellion against the usurper cæsar act the part of traitors or of virtuous citizens i believe we shall admit that they were not traitors who restored or attempted to restore the purity of roman liberty but that in reality the men destroyed in this and all the other instances i have mentioned were themselves the traitors that tyrants and usurpers are the worst of traitors and that if it is virtue to obey virtuous rulers if it is just and right to obey legal and constitutional mandates then must it be always virtue right and justice to resist and oppose those tyrants and usurpers whose sanguinary violence depopulates the country or whose projects of selfish ambition deprive the nation of its support and freedom akenside in his poem on the pleasures of imagination supposes falsely i believe that the most sublime image that can possibly be presented to the mind is that brutus rising from the stroke that laid the tyrant prostrate at his feet   look then abroad through nature to the range   of planets suns and adamantine spheres   wheeling unshaken through the void immense   and speak o man does this capacious scene   with half that kindling majesty dilate   thy strong conception as when brutus rose   refulgent from the stroke of cæsars fate   amid the crowd of patriots and his arm   aloft extending like eternal jove   when guilt brings down the thunder calld aloud   on tullys name and shook his crimson steel   and bad the father of his country hail   for lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust   and rome again is free citizens i do not approve though the laureat pye and the whig akenside have done so passages that have such a tendency to excite a sanguinary disposition i would have     the powers of genius and reason employed to increase the kindness not the bitterness of the heart—to allay the furious passions and resentments of mankind not to stimulate to violence and slaughter i have not therefore quoted either the translation of pye or the poem of akenside because they meet with my entire approbation but because they shew you that it never has yet been thought by men who think at all that those two terms so frequently confounded together were one and the same but on the contrary that they have regarded resistance of oppression as a virtue of the first class and thought that every thing ought to be encouraged and disseminated that would dispose mankind to such resistance i also maintain that resistance of oppression is the first of virtues but i would resist it not by the dagger but by reason i would go slowly to work from circle to circle i would disseminate the light of truth and benevolence and i am sure that when mankind can be persuaded to lay aside their artfully excited terrors and to enter calmly into investigation liberty will want no poignard to enforce her doctrines nor no buckler to guard her bosom against those furious foes who at present detest her only because the artifices of a few individuals have prevented them from contemplating her features i think myself however entitled from the observations i have just brought forward to conclude that as the men who were destroyed were usurpers and tyrants the rebellion of those who destroyed them was not treason but citizens i will tell you for that is the more important part of my subject how i suppose a man may be guilty of treason without falling into rebellion a thing which is much more common and here permit me to observe that my object in marking this distinction is to dissuade mankind from commiting treason not to persuade them to commit rebellion for rebellion though another crime is generally speaking a crime of monstrous magnitude because it involves the peace and tranquillity of society and gives a few upstart leaders whose minds are inflated with a desire of power too frequent an opportunity of making tools and instruments of those whose situation in society renders them the stepping stones and ladders of the ambition of deluding hypocrites i do not therefore wish to persuade you to commit rebellion but i wish to persuade other persons to cease to commit the greater crime of treason i will tell you then and i will illustrate as i go on by historical instances how i conceive that men if ministers and     courtiers may be considered as men may commit the crime of treason without being rebels—i consider when cæsar grasped to himself a power to which he was not entitled and thus attempted to enslave his country that he though not guilty of rebell on was guilty of treason of the highest kind i mean to say also that when agrippa mæcenas and others advised augustus to seize the sovereign power and thereby to annihilate entirely all hopes of roman freedom that these advisers though they did not rise in rebellion were guilty of high treason also and that their treason was not a wit the less detestable because they advised him to preserve all the forms of the roman constitution while he destroyed the whole of its spirit and excellency i mean also to say proceeding to events of a more recent date that in france for example the destruction of the bastile was certainly an act of rebellion that the opposition made by the people to the interference of foreign mercenaries employed by the then existing government for their destruction was also an act of rebellion and that the resolution of the parisians to defend the national constituent assembly was another act of rebellion but i mean to say at the same time that neither the one nor the other of these was an act of treason but on the contrary considering the situation of france at that time that they were acts of salvation to which france owes what she yet possesses of liberty and the means which are at this time almost completely in her hand of obtaining a degree of liberty more happy and glorious than any thing that has yet been conceived or thought of broglio with his mercenary troops at the beck of that power which was then undoubtedly possessed of the supreme authority was marching to paris to crush the friends of liberty and annihilate the statesgeneral the parisians heard of it and were frantic with apprehensions for their dawning liberty they ran to the arsenal to provide themselves with arms never thinking at first of taking the bastille or suspecting that they were capable of so doing but the cruel behaviour and treachery of the governor urged their fury even beyond its first intention and happily for the universe the bastille was laid a smoaking ruin upon the earth if i were standing up as an advocate for these men defending them by legal quibbles against the charge of rebellion i know i must be tonguetied—i should have nothing to say but if i were pleading for them upon the charge of treason     i should say bring as many such traitors as you will before a just tribunal charged with such actions under such circumstances and instead of fetters for their legs they must be furnished with crowns of laurel they were the saviours not the betrayers of their country and if a foreign mercenary force can ever be permitted at the nod and beck of any minister or any monarch to be brought into any capital to enforce the commands of despotism farewell to every thing like liberty—farewell to every thing like humanity—farewell to civilization—this world is a wilderness where one great elephant may stalk from place to place and with his huge proboscis mow down every thing that might administer to the comfort and felicity of mankind but if this was rebellion without being treason let us see in the next instance what was treason in france though not rebellion—it was treason in those detestable sycophants who stood behind the curtain and there is but too frequently some whispering fiend behind the curtain disturbing the repose of nations and poisoning the ears of princes—when they advised the king to give a hypocritical sanction to decrees which they meant afterwards to advise him to violate when they advised the king after having most solemnly sworn to support those decrees to add perjury to treachery and shameless effrontery to both and declare himself destitute of every principle of faith and honesty—those men were traitors both to their country and their king and calamities enough they have brought upon both which sophists may endeavour to lay upon other shoulders but which are chargeable in the first instance to them and them alone those men however and that woman who advised the flight of the unfortunate louis xvi were not guilty of rebellion but they were traitors of the worst description and if it were possible for me in any situation to applaud the severity with which crimes are sometimes pursued i should be almost inclined to say—that they deserved the fate which they eventually met—a hiss i am much obliged to the citizen who has thus interrupted me but as i am sure the sentiment is unexceptionable i perceive that i must have made some mistake in the expression i will repeat therefore the idea i meant to convey—i mean to say that those evil counsellors of louis xvi who advised him to ratify decrees which he did not mean to fulfil who advised him to swear to the constitution which he meant to violate who advised him afterwards to violate that constitution   0 and leave the paper upon his table in which he declared himself to be a hypocrite and a perjurer who advised him to fly to foreign nations in hopes of leading foreign armies against his country—that these counsellors these vipers let me call them though they were not rebels were traitors of the worst description—this is my meaning this is what i meant to express before this i believe i have expressed tolerably accurately now and if any scribes of the treasury think they can make any thing of it i will endeavour as nearly as possible to repeat it again to those—i was going to say citizen spies but—gentlemen spies i mean far be it from me citizens to inflame your minds against any individual but as i know that every night there are gentlemen of that description i wish to tell them fairly and openly that if any persons whatever wish to take down any part of my words if they will signify their design either in the manner just now signified or any other way i will repeat the idea to them and i will do more i will shew them the difference between the honor of a plain common man the simple descendant of a london tradesman and the daughter of a poor country farmer and the tinsel honor which belongs to persons who wear trumpery titles and trumpery decorations i will shew them that instead of hiring like a person of the last description  0 bludgeonmen to knock out the brains of a man hostile to my sentiments i will protect even his rude intemperate and ungentlemanlike conduct from the indignation which some might think it merits no man however improper his conduct shall meet with an improper return of it here his person shall be protected the freedom of his sentiments shall be protected if he is a deluded individual i will endeavour to remove his delusion by candour if a designing individual i will shew him how superior the smallest of the friends of liberty is to the malice of such designs citizens i shall now proceed in my task of making these distinctions and shewing you that there may be treason without rebellion and that this treason is most frequently committed by those individuals who are so ready to charge others with being traitors i shall proceed to illustrate this by facts from the history of our own country you will remember that charles the first not being wise enough to know how to buy parliaments and the parliament under charles the first being disposed to support the rights of the people there consequently arose what is called a rebellion in this country remember i am not going to     justify the last act of the rebels as they are called i do not justify sanguinary punishments in any instance whatever but in consequence of the disposition on the part of the ill advisors of charles the first to usurp arbitrary power and the disposition on the part of the parliament to support the liberties of the people what is called a rebellion took place in this country now in this instance i think we shall find that the treason did not lie in the people and parliament of england though they are called rebels for defending themselves against the armed force which charles by the advice of his ministers assembled in order to make himself absolute but that the treason was in the ministers who advised him to abdicate his rightful crown by attempting to usurp a tyranny and authority to which he had no claim i say that the principle traitor was the apostate wentworth who while he was in opposition pretended to be a flaming patriot a friend to the liberties of the people and an advocate for a reformation of corruptions and abuses but who as soon as he became minister became one of the most violent persecutors of every thing that looked like liberty and though i do not commend nor excuse the trial of lord strafford the title with which his prostitution was purchased yet i contend that those who advise a king to exercise a power which the laws of the land do not vest in him are traitors to the king and to the country and do thereby advise him to abdicate the throne on which the constitution has placed him—do actually advise him to unking himself and renounce those privileges and prerogatives which but for his unjust usurpation he might still have continued to enjoy i mean to say also that the advisers of charles the second and james the second who as they were also ignorant of the art of effectually buying parliaments took it into their heads to persuade them to do without any parliaments at all which is pretty nearly the same thing you know though they did not rise in rebellion against the royal authority were also traitors to their country and to those two unfortunate monarchs—i say two unfortunate monarchs for though the first of them as some say died a natural death yet his reign was one continued source of vexation and misfortune and might hold up a striking lesson to all monarchs—that when they attempt to grasp more power than they are entiled to they grasp at thorns whose sharp and unpoisoned mail will rankle in the hand that attempts to grasp them     i shall now just observe in a brief manner that these natural distinctions have been too frequently confounded by the arts of courtiers and sycophants in the first place it has been common by the assistance of metaphor and flattery to represent the person of an individual and the happiness and existence of a whole country to be one and the same thing i admit i affirm that the safety the security and tranquillity of the individual or individuals who constitute the chief magistracy of a country are incorporated with the happiness of society and that he who invades the life of such magistrate or magistrates whatever be the form of the constitution commits an offence of a very heinous description against the peace and happiness of society i think it necessary to make this observation that my intentions may not be misrepresented i wish you to understand accurately the nature of crimes and offences i do not mean to persuade you that any thing that is criminal is virtuous or which is frequently attempted in another place that things really virtuous and just are criminal but i mean to say that though it is a high crime to assail the magistracy of a country yet that the magistrate and the country are not one and the same thing and that no one life ever yet was or ever can be as estimable as the life of twentyfour millions or seventeen millions or seven millions of individuals of which the population of any particular country may consist this is a sort of flattery paid by sycophant writers to increase their own importance in the eyes of those they flatter but this is not all did the encroachment and metaphor stop here i would not have troubled you with so many animadversions upon the subject but having in the first instance identified by a figure of speech the whole nation in the person of the prince they next confound the minister of the prince with the prince himself and then call it high treason to oppose the measures designs nay the contemplations of that courtier who by arts the most hypocritical may happen to have seized upon the helm of power mr gibbon in his decline and fall of the roman empire—a work which though perhaps not entitled to so unqualified an approbation as has sometimes been given must be admitted to be full of profound research and useful reflection particularly alludes to this last species of treason—an attempt to identify the person of the minister or favourite with the person of the prince and to punish the opposition made     so such minister as an offence against the sovereign and very justly considers it as the last stage of despotism—you will remember citizens that at the time mr gibbon wrote this reflection the late accusations for high treason had not been brought forward—nor had it ever been whispered in britain that a disposition to oppose measures that had been hinted by a minister could be considered as treason in this country you will please to observe that in this country this last species of treason has been very jealously guarded against and it was for this reason that the   th edward iii was made for so many things had been charged to be treason that bore no resemblance to that crime that an act was thought necessary in that parliament to define the two principal species of treason to be compassing and imagining the death of the king and actually levying war against the king having laid down this in so clear and distinct a manner our ancestors weakly thought that they had done sufficient but it was not long before attempts were successfully made to extend the limits of the law of treason those limits the good sense of the people has occasioned them to refer to again and again and the same limits have been again and again declared to be the boundaries of the crime of treason and again and again whenever artful hypocritical and alarming ministers got possession of the seat of power under frivolous pretences have been extended to a most exorbitant degree queen mary on account of her religion and intolerance has been spoken of with a degree of severity which is certainly as much as she is entitled to she had one merit however which ought not to be forgotten she expressed by public act her detestation of making words treason repealed all the encroaching statutes that had been made and again fixed the limits of treason by the   th edward iii those limits however since that time have been occasionally extended and again restored and we have at this time to lament two statutes fabrications of the present minister the alien act and the traiterous correspondence act by which those sacred boundaries are once more violated but this is not all it is to be observed that since the revolution ministers not thinking fit to alter the law of treason as often as they wished to extend the limits have induced their judges to appeal to fictions and evasions by which they have effectually done that which they did not openly dare to avow accordingly we find that though the   th edw iii expressly says that to compass and imagine the death of the     king shall be high treason and that to levy war against the king shall also be high treason making them thereby two distinct species of treason and clearly evincing thereby that merely conspiring or imagining to levy war was no treason yet they have procured many judges to declare and to pass sentences upon that declaration that though to attempt to levy war is not treason under the head of levying war yet that it is still treason under another distinct species namely that of compassing the death of the king—just as if our frugal ancestors whose acts were seldom longer than this bit of paper would have spent their time and words in declaring that to levy war should be high treason if they had meant and understood that even the very idea of such a thing would be an act of high treason of the description which they had already previously declared namely the compassing and imagining the death of the king—but let us now return to the times of charles the second by whom it is notorious that an attempt was made to establish an absolute despotism if we wanted proof of this we need only appeal to the alliances formed by the cabal and other ministers of charles ii their constant hostility to every country that attempted to gain or to preserve its freedom and their connections with the despot of france and every other despot on the continent who would oppose the principles they wished to eradicate now citizens there is a curious circumstance relative to the history of charles ii namely that every six or twelve months produced a conspiracy which being begotten in the imagination of ministers was propagated in parliament while there was any parliament and afterwards in the privy council when privy councils became every thing and parliaments nothing was afterwards disseminated through the country by inflammatory handbills and proclamations in consequence of these imaginary traitors never hearing of such plots and conspiracies till they were indicted and brought to the bar to be tried for them were time after time dragged at the peril of their lives before judges who knew them to be innocent to hear the scandalous harangues of serjeants and attorneygenerals who knew that the men they were arraigning were innocent and virtuous and that they themselves and their employers were the persons who ought to have stood at the bar and been tried if any one doubts whether i have given a faithful account of these plots and conspiracies let him turn over the pages of rapins history these facts which stand recorded upon     unquestionable authority otherwise they could not have been believed by those who live under the present administration mark beyond the possibility of mistake the designs and objects of the ministers by which these plots and fictitious conspiracies were fabricated and woe to the nation that shall witness their repetition yes citizens in this reign of charles ii in which these false conspiracies were hatched there were also many real conspiracies but they were conspiracies among those persons that were endeavouring to destroy the pretended conspirators false plots and false conspiracies are necessary things for those who have real plots and conspiracies of their own to conceal i would not wish to press the subject too closely but have we not also had false plots and conspiracies in the present day has not the present immaculate minister disseminated his alarms like electric shocks from one end of the country to another to every individual who imagined he had a stake in the country—as if every man that has life and exertion had not a stake or ought not to have a stake in the country—has not the present minister by those excellent conductors warrants for high treason proclamations and reports of secret committees conveyed his electric shocks of alarm through the country till the whole deluded mass of the people shook with convulsions before him much to the amusement no doubt of the manager of the machine though little to the health and benefit of those upon whom he operated nay it is said that there have been individuals who have had the audacity to attempt to keep up the reputation of their quackery by charging the juries of this country with being conspirators also against the laws and constitution they were called to defend because they would not hang the men whom they thought fit to accuse yes if we are not strangely abused indeed—if our credulity is not most terribly tricked by those retailers of intelligence the reporters for the diurnal prints persons have stood up in public assemblies and declared that the acquittal of the felons as they call them was a proof of the extent to which the conspiracy had spread these words are detailed to us as the words of men whose professions of attachment to the constitution ought to have prevented them from insulting that part of the constitution which i make no scruple of saying is worth ten thousand times more than all the rest of the constitution put together i mean the great and invaluable right of trial by jury     but citizens in the midst of these false plots we have also had real plots and conspiracies i remember a few evenings ago having the pleasure or imagining that i had the pleasure of seeing in this room the high and mighty inquisitor mr reeves—the sight of this being inspired me with some inclination to let him know that his inquisitorial presence did not daunt the friends of liberty i therefore took the liberty of announcing at that time that i should on a future occasion lay before this audience an exposition of the plots and conspiracies of mr reeves and his associators and if ever i should see a tall gawky shuffling fellow who has been idolized very much in this country and whose principal claim to that idolatry seems to be his talent of shuffling and apostacy—if i should have ever the happiness to be in company where that right honourable maypole happens to stalk in i will greet him with the promise of an equally just dissection at present it is my duty to proceed with my exposition of the plots and conspiracies of reeves—i speak his name without disguise that his followers and retainers may be at no loss in their report i shall not dwell particularly upon the character of the honourable institution of which he is the founder nor the baseness when it was first opened of signing the name of a person as secretary who never had been within the walls of the meeting i will mention however a little anecdote to which this circumstance gave birth the gentleman went to complain to reeves of the insult put upon his name by introducing it into such company and found the whole society consisting of four or five actual members assembled they immediately apologised and said as they were very much in in want of a secretary they would be very much obliged to him to recommend them one to which he is reported to have answered immediately why here is mr reeves who is a bustling active man he will do very well i should think for a secretary and then perhaps you may chance to get a respectable man in the chair but soft i ought to speak of mr reeves with fear and trembling for he is chief magistrate of the district and i have not yet forgot the maxim of homer   —though we deem the shortlivd fury past   tis sure the mighty will revenge at last this chief magistrate the man who was to be the judge about thirteen months ago when i first began to lecture here went from house to house begging of persons to come and     complain to him of my house as a nuisance having so done reeves with fifteen or sixteen persons attended at his courtleet—some to complain of nuisance and others to declare it was no nuisance at all mr high steward reeves took his chair authoritatively and swore in the witnesses to be examined against me when seeing that these and the jury had withdrawn together i put the following question pray mr chairman reeves am i not to be at liberty to call witnesses also no sir you cannot—who are you sir my name is thelwall i am the person complained against no sir i shall take care that justice is done but you cannot call any witnesses pray sir am i to be permitted to be heard in my own defence not by counsel sir after the verdict you may say what you please to me yourself but i shall not hear you at any very considerable length so you see the man who is to sit as judge first of all goes and begs people to come and accuse after having got persons to accuse he tells the accused he shall not be at liberty to call any witnesses in his defence that he shall not be at liberty to say any thing in his defence till after the verdict and then he may be permitted humbly to beg and pray in mitigation of fine but not to speak at any considerable length lest i suppose his defence should happen to become sedition i should think this enough to convince you of the situation of the magistracy of this country but this is not all mr reeves charged every individual of the officers under him to take me into custody when i came into court to commit me without any warrant whatever to the roundhouse after which perhaps i was to be sent on board a ship—being an ablebodied man for a sailor—or sent off to some of the solitary isles of scotland as many persons have been—as lady grange for instance was all this had the first step succeeded might have taken place with ease for if he had power to take the first step he might have had power to take the rest and who should have said him nay what then preserved me—why there was not a beadle or parish constable throughout the district who had the hardiness to execute such an order and they told mr reeves that they would not execute it these are the men who associate to protect liberty and     property and who under such pretences enter into conspiracies to seize the person of an individual without legal authority though under the mask of magistracy—for magistracy is one thing law another if this is protecting property may i never have property to be protected if this protecting liberty make me a galleyslave at once if this is protecting order and civilized society strip me naked and turn me into the wilderness with savages for i am sick of such order and civilization citizens when this would not do within less than ten days a charge of high treason was trumped up i was dragged from my house my premises were plundered not only my manuscripts the whole labours of my life but my books my collections of prints and the very cloths from my tables were seized to pack the pillage up in application after application has been made to the privy council evasive answer after evasive answer has been given and my effects are not returned this is protecting liberty and property at last i am referred to mr joseph white the honourable solicitor of the honourable treasury and mr joseph white says you may tell mr thelwall i have nothing of his and nothing shall he have of me this is protecting property my books my manuscripts of all descriptions in prose and in verse—whether there is a syllable of politics in them or not—many of them the labours of years all are to be seized and witheld because i have dared to question the wisdom and integrity of the most perfidious apostate that ever existed yet these are the individuals who have the impudence to tell you they associate for the protection of liberty and property they ought to tell you that they associate to pillage and plunder i meant to have gone further and read some documents relative to these facts but i dare not keep documents in my house i may be taken up for high treason again perhaps and my papers may again be taken as they were before lest they should enable me to prove my own innocence or the guilt of my accusers for mark the consequences of this seizure of papers it does not only furnish the materials of accusation but it takes from the person accused the means of proving the falshood of the charges however basely forged thus on the late occasion the privy council knew the attorney general knew at least they must have known if they had read my papers which after my house had been pillaged of them it was their duty to do that the whole of the evidence of taylor and     other persons brought forward on the trials was entirely false it was proved again and again that the persons accused were the very reverse of what they accused them of being and i can assign no reason for witholding our papers and property but the fear left we should be enabled to prove these circumstances but this is protecting liberty and property this is preserving the constitution—such protection o citizens would i could see that quiet that tranquil but that determined spirit of enquiry among you that you would hear and see before you judged that you would know the truth before you pronounced—you could not then be deluded by such ridiculous pretences you could not be made the dupes of such artifices as these but let me not lose again the tranquillity of my soul—i was in hopes that the scene i had beheld had entirely allayed those irritable feelings which youthful intemperance is but too apt to indulge let me not when the sting of indignation and the consciousness of injury urges my temper—let me not inflame your minds with similar feelings—i am to blame i have spoken with more warmth than either the circumstances or the authors of my injuries are worthy of—let me turn to that picture of philosophy which i have beheld on board the transport which is to convey our beloved fellowcitizen to the solitary inhospitable region of norfolk island where even the converse of those friends sent before him cannot soothe his melancholy hours let me keep before me the virtuous the godlike fortitude with which he bears his wrongs and blush at the recollection that while he with unmoved philosophy bears to be wafted across the tempestuous ocean into a long lingering disgraceful exile of fourteen years i have suffered a little paltry pillage committed by paltry individuals upon my labours and my little property to hurry me into an intemperance so unworthy of the principle i would inculcate o citizens could you have been with me—could you have seen what i have seen and heard what i have heard how would you lament the degeneracy of britain that could suffer such a man as gerrald in such a cause to be sent into exile in execution of such a sentence i met when i visited him not the dejected countenance of an exile but the chearfulness of a philosopher the health which had been impaired by his close and rigorous confinement was considerably renovated by the salubrious breezes of the sea and the cheerfulness and vivacity to which his  00 genius gave so peculiar a charm again animated his countenance i shall not attempt to picture to you the whole of those feelings which nothing but friendship can conceive and friendship only when it is kindled by such exalted talents and more exalted virtues but i cannot forget that he left me one bequest which is not only mine but is yours also it is a bequest to every friend of liberty i had parted from him the third and last time that i went on board the vessel i had come half down the ladder by the side of the ship that was to convey me into the little boat and take me back to portsmouth when with some agitation of countenance he called me back—my friend says he the tear standing in his eye look to my little girl let her not be forgotten i had intended to have mentioned her to him but the heart full of innumerable sensations all crowding forward at once will often happen to forget the most important i returned i enquired of him what could be done for her and offered her the protection of my house so long as oppression should leave me one—no no says he my friend i hope that is not necessary i believe that her situation is not at present totally uncomfortable but countenance her—countenance my little babe she is the vital drop that warms my heart it will be the balm of my soul to reflect that the friends of liberty have not deserted her i would not then disgrace the manly scene before me with a tear but now it is no shame it is no reproach to let them flow down my cheek while i conjure you whatever fate may fall upon me whatever may be the lot of the few particular friends that were dear to his heart forget not britons forget not during that long long fourteen years of banishment if fourteen years it is to be that joseph gerrald is in exile for his zeal in the cause of liberty and that joseph gerrald has an infant daughter who may perhaps want a friend and call upon the name of that country which he has served at the peril of his life for that support which the father can no longer yield having finished this brief appeal he turned cheerfully round and as for myself says he bear witness how impossible it is for the little malice of my persecutors to punish me they may punish themselves by the attempt but as for what they call suffering to me it is triumph and not disgrace such are the feelings and sentiments that animate the heart of the true patriot and while such feelings and such sentiments remain persecution may triumph for a while but liberty must be ultimately successful  0  the tribune no xiv saturday   th june      continuation of the narrative of the proceedings of the messengers c concluded from number ix in the early numbers of this work i began my promised narrative of the proceedings of government relative to the late prosecutions it will not appear surprising in the hurry and fatigue which must necessarily arise from preparing and delivering two lectures a week and correcting and superintending a weekly publication that i should not have found time regularly to continue it it appears however an act of duty to my readers not to close the volume without bringing this narrative to a conclusion i proceed therefore in the same hasty manner in which under my present circumstances i am necessarily obliged to execute whatever i undertake to perform this obligation the examinations being concluded for the day i was conducted back to the house of the messenger where i continued to be treated with that insulting mixture of affected kindness and jealous restriction which might be expected from ignorant hypocrisy the character of this man however i saw through in an instant and one of the first requests i made to him was that he would forbear to talk to me upon the politics of the day as it was totally improper in our situation to enter upon any such subjects to this he immediately assented and at first pretended to be very desirous of avoiding every thing of that description though it was every now and then conspicuous enough that he was laying snares to trepan me into imprudent expressions and during the three last days i remained with him he took such particular and repeated pains to lead me from whatever subject we talked upon into the very topic and the parts of that topic which it was most my duty to avoid that i could not but suspect that he had received particular instructions upon the subject and i was frequently obliged to repel his questions by the most indignant reproach once in particular he introduced  0  a man to sup with us whose face i never saw before but whom i understood to be a serjeant in the guards whose business it was to sleep in the house for my better security this was not of itself a circumstance which displeased me for i have some faith in physiognomy and when i looked in his face i had no doubt nor have i still any reason to doubt that my new companion was an honest though an ignorant man and i never objected even when at liberty to chuse my company to the society of such a man whatever might be his situation in life on this evening however while the glass was circulating timms contrived to introduce the subject of the condition of the lower orders of society this is a topic with respect to which my heart has always been warm and from the art with which it was introduced i am convinced that he had been tutored by persons better informed as to my passions and feelings than he had the opportunities or the penetration to be upon such a topic there appeared no danger in expatiating i always have thought and i never have disguised that opinion that the poor are oppressed that they are kept in brutal ignorance for fear they should free themselves from oppression and that there is a most wicked and scandalous disproportion between the encrease in the price of labour and the price of the necessaries of life and i made no scruple to assert this in pretty round terms the wretch had watched his time he saw that i was warm and supposing me entirely off my guard put some question to me about the purposed convention and the poor taking things into their own hands or something of that kind—the terms of which i do not now remember i remember however that it was a question of the most suspicious and improper description and that i turned immediately towards him and looking in his face with the utmost contempt and anger asked him whether he was not ashamed to put such a question to a person in my situation—i had several occasions to use this language to him—yet this wretch had the audacity to swear that i used to indulge myself at his table in very unguarded conversations and that i told him if i had been fourteen days longer at liberty i should have had so many friends around me that it would have been difficult for government to apprehend me it is scarcely possible to conceive any thing more absurd and improbable than this story yet as improbable stories are sometimes believed because it appears equally improbable that they should be invented it may not be amiss to shew out of  0  what slender materials they may sometimes be composed on the night of my apprehension while i was yet waiting at the secretary of states office the gentlemen clerks and others who were in attendance pretended to condole with me upon my situation which i desirous of marking as strongly as i could my contempt for my oppressors repelled sometimes with jocularity and sometimes with gay indifference and among other things i remember to have said that i did not care much about it though to be sure if i had been at liberty a fortnight longer it would have made thirty or forty pounds difference to me which in my present circumstances would have been of some importance—at another time while timms and myself were at dinner he told me that it had been intended to apprehend me in my lecture room i am glad you did not said i gravely it might have been a dangerous experiment these were the only foundations for the ridiculous fabrications to remain in the power of a being of whom one has formed such an opinion as i had conceived of timms must be sufficiently tormenting and it was rendered the more intolerable by the affected canting hypocritical civility with which his tyranny was interlarded let the reader picture to himself an illtempered mean and illiterate tyrant the discarded valet of one of our nobility deriving consequence from a house furnished with every article of ornamental luxury and a table supplied with costly viands yet as gloomy and restless as he was consequential a bigot in religion and a slave in principles—let him imagine this being intrusted with sole and absolute dominion over a man whom he pretended to commiserate but whom it was evident he both feared and hated and to whom in the struggle between malice and hypocrisy he alternately made an ostentatious display of his kindness and indulgence and of his power if so disposed to load him with chains and fetter him to the floor or the bedpost—when the reader has pictured all these circumstances to his imagination he may form some idea of the first stage of the mild and benevolent system of imprisonment for pretended treason but this was not all there was another circumstance relative to this close custody which if it had long continued must have committed me to the still closer custody of the grave that is to say the total exclusion of circulating air excluded from all exercise by day and shut up every night in a small room whose only window was not only secured with  0  shutters bolts bars and bells but also with a thick double curtain which in spite of my remonstrances was constantly let down and jammed close against the wall with a heavy table so as to exclude every breath of air i was thus literally parboiled in my own perspiration and reduced in the course of a week to such a state of debility that but for my timely removal to the tower it would have been impossible that my health should have supported the assault two days before my removal mr ford called upon me and told me in the presence of timms that as in seizing my papers which were very numerous the messenger had taken not only those of a public but of a private nature the latter should be restored to me without delay and he would give me his honour that nobody had seen them but himself he then asked me whether i would have them sent to my own house or to the messengers—i replied it would be some satisfaction to me to see what was returned and i therefore wished them to be sent to me upon which he shewed me his seal and told me that i might have the satisfaction of knowing they came from him to me without being subjected to the curiosity of other persons that he would send them sealed up with that impression yet when i enquired of the messenger at night how it came that my trunk had not arrived from mr ford he told me with more insolent rudeness of tone and manner than he had ever before assumed that it had been and that he had sent it to my house for that he would not have his room littered about with a parcel of papers whether therefore it was really returned as mr ford sent it or whatever impertinent curiosity might have examined its contents i cannot say but when i came after my trial to inspect the effects returned i found that all my fair copies and complete manuscripts were missing that none of my prints or similar articles so scandalously taken away in the general pillage had been returned and that the whole of the effects thus ostentatiously delivered back consisted of some private letters the notes of four or five of my lectures a few domestic memorandums and some blotted fragments and imperfect copies of my unpublished works so that in fact every valuable article is still withheld and i am yet to learn whether any part of the plunder is to be restored after being six days tormented by the hypocritical politeness and jealous tyranny of this keeper i was happily relieved by  0  being sent to the more tolerable confinement of the tower where notwithstanding the jealous restrictions and insults to which we were at first subjected i found my situation comparatively comfortable for my room was large airy and pleasant and the warders to whose custody we were committed with only one or two exceptions were civil and attentive and discharged their duty in a manner that does them credit to this bastille we were removed with the most jealous secrecy and although my wife was present when the coach that was to take me away came to the door of the messenger no sort of intimation was given to either of us where i was going nor could i get any information from my conductors till the direction taken by the carriage let me into the secret to the tower then we were committed and the first information i received was that i was neither to be permitted to send for my books nor have the privilege of pen ink or paper this intimation of a severity so monstrous and so unexpected struck for the first time a momentary damp to my soul for as i could not persuade myself that the minister would have the impudence to try us for high treason i expected that our imprisonment would be long and from the iron bars massive door and the centinel planted with fixed bayonet at the entrance of the room i conjectured that it was to be solitary the pang however was but momentary a proud exultation in the cause i suffered for rushed upon my mind i envied my fellow prisoners their share in the honour of such a persecution and ambition mingling itself with my enthusiasm i breathed a fruitless wish that i might have stood alone in a struggle so glorious and so important i recollected also a conversation i had held several years before with a friend of more facetiousness than delicacy upon the subject of my youthful peculiarities and in which with a sort of prophetic flight of imagination i had pictured myself as excluded in some dungeon without either books or pen and ink and asked what i should be likely to do with myself under such circumstances—do with yourself replied my friend why you would dip your finger in your own excrements and scribble poetry on the wall the conceit at first provoked my risibility but it led me into a train of reflection productive of sensations much more consolatory and important a croud of expedients rushed upon my mind a nail which i picked up in the room appeared  0  to be a fund of inexhaustible amusement and utility and i felt a deep conviction that there was no possible situation into which a man of active mind can be plunged in which he may not find means not only of improving himself but eventually of benefiting his fellow beings a conviction attended with sensations which the proudest of my persecutors might have envied it was not long however before i found that my confinement was not to be as solitary as i expected for that the centinel with his fixed bayonet not being deemed a sufficient guard for so desperate a rebel two armed men were also to be placed in my room night and day i was informed also that perhaps upon specific application to the privy council i might in time be permitted to send for some of my books it happened also that the person in whose house or tower i was lodged had formerly been a bookseller and had some few articles of his former trade still in his possession and of him i ventured to borrow some volumes of shakespeares plays neither myself nor the warders who had the custody of me supposing that any thing more was meant by the restriction than that nothing was to be brought into the tower which had not first been inspected by the privy council or its agents nor either of us ever suspecting that the safe custody of a traitor could be affected by his reading macbeth or as you like it—but we were miserably mistaken i was detected reading a playbook without permission of government the warder was reprimanded and the books ordered to be withdrawn and it was near a fortnight before the repeated and spirited remonstrances of my wise could procure for me the indulgence so it was called of perusing any book whatever or having the use of pen and ink but this was not all i had to complain of the perpetual and insulting visits of the military were such as constantly to remind me that i existed no longer under what have been called the wise and humane laws of england but that i was in reality submitted to all the jealous tyranny of a military government i was visited almost every morning by the officers on duty in the garrison some of whom were insolent boys of sixteen or eighteen who having no pretensions either to the dignity of the citizen or the urbanity of the gentleman aspired to consequence by the rudeness and haughtiness of their deportment three times a day i was also  0  intruded upon by serjeants and corporals and every two hours the centinels came bursting into my room with their arms in their hands without the least warning staring in my face with the most insulting rudeness and to crown the whole a serjeant of the guards was appointed to attend whenever my sister my mother or my wife came to visit me to be a spy upon our actions and note our conversation the insolent deportment of this man was no small aggravation of the jealous tyranny with which we were guarded our friends were not permitted to see us without orders from the privy council and this favour with respect to me was only extended to my nearest relations twice a week and for only two hours at a time and to have a surly fellow of this description seated close by our sides listening to every word and insolently rebuking myself my sister or my wife if we did not speak as loud as he wished us was a degree of aggravated despotism which no law has authorized and to which no briton ought to submit—the spirited deportment of citizen martin however rid us as i understand of this military interference the visits of officers and soldiers were laid aside and the office of watching and listening was transferred to one of the warders in the absence of the gentleman goaler but though the person was changed the vexatious jealousy was not to be laid aside and even when my apothecary the respected mr wilson procured an order to see me partly on account of a temporary derangement of my own health and partly to satisfy my mind as to the health of my wife whom the fatigues and anxieties to which she was exposed had thrown into a situation of the utmost danger not even he was exempted from the general restriction though medical men even under the most barbarous despotisms have always been regarded as privileged in this respect and i was of course obliged to forbear many of those enquiries which under such circumstances it is natural i should be desirous to make but which however important to his peace a husband will not be disposed to make in the hearing of a third person such then were the circumstances during our continuance in the tower of that treatment which mr dundas says was no punishment and of the lenity and indulgence of which mr pitt thinks fit ostentatiously to boast—for ten days or a fortnight i was debarred the use of books pen ink and paper  0  for about seven or eight weeks i was never permitted to go out of my room for exercise or for air during the whole of that very hot weather which prevailed during a part of the last summer my only alternative was to be closed incessantly within this apartment or to snatch an occasional breath of air on the little leads at the top of the round tower in which i was confined and where the intense action of the sun reflected from the metal was such as with difficulty could be supported and as there were three of us hardy horne tooke and myself who were alternately to enjoy the breezes on this funny height no two of us being permitted to bask there at the same time the intervals were short during which we could partake even of this indulgence at length a fresh order was obtained at the request i understand of some of the prisoners but which was extended in its operation to all further indulging us with permission to walk round the ramparts of the tower guarded each by his respective warder who had the strictest injunctions not to suffer us to speak either to each other or to any other person before i quit the subject of the military i ought to observe the very different manner in which they deported themselves at the beginning and towards the latter end of our imprisonment at first they seemed solicitous of every opportunity to insult us and even carried the expression of their abhorrence so far as to level their musquets at us when we appeared at our windows and to maltreat every person who testified the least affection towards us—a circumstance which surprized me not a little till i heard from one of the warders that among the infernal fabrications which had been so industriously circulated to inflame the public mind against us a report had been very successfully propagated among the soldiers that a part of our detestable conspiracy was a plan for surprising the tower by night marching immediately to the irish barracks where the soldiers were lodged and massacreing them all in their beds the eyes of the soldiery however as well as of the people in general became opened during our consinement to the infamous artifices of our persecutors and when towards the latter end of our imprisonment we were permitted to walk about the ramparts they shewed us every mark of civility and attention and even turned people out of the tower who attempted to offer us any kind of insult  0  at length after we had been kept five months in suspence unable to conjecture and those who best understood the laws of the country were least able to devise what our persecutors could possibly intend to do with us a special commission was made out to try us for high treason which was opened on the  d of october with a speech from chief justice sir james eyre which for the new and extraordinary doctrines it contains and the strain of plausible eloquence with which those doctrines were insinuated will long be remembered by the lovers of english liberty—a speech which without any portion of mr brotherss prophetic spirit i venture to foretell will at least be heard once more in a court of justice to the great edification of the country in general and of the bench and the bar in particular i shall not animadvert upon the indecent violation of what have hitherto been regarded as effential regulations with respect to the grand jury this has already been better done than i could possibly do it by citizen martin in his very excellent pamphlet an account of the proceedings on a charge of high treason—a pamphlet which i would recommend to the perusal of every citizen neither shall i make any comment upon the decency of lumping together in one indictment for conspiracy twelve persons several of whom had never seen each others faces nor heard each others names—suffice it to say an indictment for high treason was found the whole charges contained in which were of so vague and desultory a nature that they would not have justified a common justice of the peace understanding the duties of his office and the laws of his country to have granted a warrant for the apprehension of any individual yet the indictment had been drawn with special care and the crown lawyers had made of their case all that could be made—the plain fact is that though there are nine counts in this curious instrument there is no one direct overt act charged in any one of them and for this reason that the prosecutors knew they had no overt act to charge and therefore dwelt upon generals—thinking perhaps at the same time that general charges good sweeping clauses were best calculated to establish a general system of terror and execution of the indictment in which i was included together with a list of between two and three hundred jurors and two and three hundred witnesses i was served with a copy on the   th of october ten days before the day of arraignment and my   0 counsel and sollicitor were then permitted to have free access as was also my wife the person in my family whom i pitched upon as best qualified from her fortitude as well as her affection to be employed as my confidential agent in this trying situation ten days preparation being allowed to us by act of parliament from the service of the copies to the day of arraignment exclusive of that day and exclusive also of the intervening sunday we expected of course that those ten days would not be broken in upon by the prosecutors and that we should not be moved till the morning on which we were to be arraigned or at any rate till the evening preceding but we were mistaken at nine oclock on the night of the   d when the gentleman goaler came to lock me up i was informed that we were to be removed to newgate at six oclock the following morning this was to me a very considerable inconvenience my wife and myself had been writing all day till seven or eight oclock when she departed and i had still some instructions to prepare which my solicitor deemed important and which i was to have got ready against eight or nine oclock the next morning when she was to come for them and assist me in writing other letters and instructions to persons who were expected to be useful in my defence but it now became necessary for me to neglect every other consideration in the preparations for my departure such as packing up my books papers and other effects and when my faithful agent was on her way punctual to her appointment in the morning she had the mortification to meet the procession and to see her husband conducted into the abode of felons and murderers where she had a fresh routine of ceremonies and delays to go through before she could be admitted again to visit him nor was this all when i came to the coach that was to bring me from the towergate the sheriff eamer refused me permission to send for my books and papers which i had packed up but which i had nobody at my lodging to bring for me mr sheriff burnet would fain have insisted upon that act of justice but eamer obstinately refused the consequence of which and of other delays resulting from this circumstance was that even on the day of arraignment my books and papers had not come to hand and yet i am told that during a late canvas for the vacant gown some persons objecting the treatment of the state prisoners and myself in     particular this gentleman or some of his friends chose to affirm that i had written a letter—to thank him for the particular kindness and attention which he had paid to me there was one circumstance however attendant upon this removal which i own was highly gratifying i mean the deportment of the populace who as our removal at that time was perfectly unexpected were of course a mere promiscuous multitude and might therefore be considered as representing pretty accurately the general feelings of the country with respect to us but as this circumstance was faithfully detailed the next day in the morning post i subjoin the account from that paper—— removal of the state prisoners to newgate at ten oclock on thursday night when the gentlemen gaoler came to lock up the prisoners in the tower they were informed having had no prior intimation whatever that at eight the next morning the sheriffs would be at the gates of the tower to receive them and convey them to newgate accordingly within half an hour of that time the sheriffs arrived and horne tooke kyd and bonney joyce and richter thelwall and hardy were conveyed in three coaches to their new place of destination attended by a strong guard of constables notwithstanding the great precaution of secrecy the crowd however soon became very great and the strongest animation of feeling and sympathy was visible in almost every spectators countenance some could not even suppress the expressions of their regard or prevent the warmth of their hearts from becoming conspicuous not only in their looks but even then tongues much to their credit however whatever might be the feelings of the crowd they kept them within the bounds not of affected inanity it is true but of the most perfect real decorum which sufficiently shewed that the secrecy and precautions that had been observed were perfectly unnecessary and that neither private affection nor popular attachment was likely to induce the friends of liberty to injure their cause so much and perhaps the prisoners themselves as to attempt to impede the course of public justice—if the persons whose trials are this day to begin are guilty of conspiring to kill the king and to introduce a scene of anarchy and massacre those who have been hitherto deluded by them     ought to have an opportunity of being convinced of the mistaken opinion they have hitherto been led to entertain concerning them and we hope there is yet so much of the british character left that no jury can be selected that will pass upon them without the fullest conviction of their guilt in the full extent and real meaning of the charge if they are innocent it is good that they should have an opportunity of proving their innocence since their virtue will be ten thousand times more glorious for the ordeal it has to pass through the prisoners retained all that chearful fortitude or as some of the venal scribblers in the treasury prints have called it—criminal levity which has uniformly characterized them during their confinement appeared to talk with great gaiety to each other and to the attendants in the coaches and bowed and smiled with a gaiety evidently unaffected to those who saluted them from the streets and windows as they passed it was highly gratifying to those who venerate the real character of the british nation to see the manner in which they parted from their former keepers at the tower gate the mutual expressions of cordiality proved beyond a doubt that however rigid and we cannot help thinking some of them uselessly so the restrictions may have been that government thought necessary to lay them under they have been attended with all the softening circumstances of civility on the part of those who were entrusted with the immediate execution of those orders—a trait of character which we hope will long continue to mark every department of the executive power in this country morn post    oct      whatever little comfort might have been enjoyed while we were in the tower was now entirely gone and our accommodations were such as would leave an eternal stain upon the humanity of the country which subjected even the vilest and basest ruffians to so miserable and murderous a confinement richter was absolutely confined in one of the condemned cells and i in the dead hole or charnelhouse—the common receptacle for the putrid carcases of felons who die of diseases in the jail at my first entrance into this place i was struck at once with disgust and surprise i had heard of cells and dungeons and had pictured them to my imagination but a place so vile so filthy and so abhorrent to all the feelings and senses of man     i never had beheld or conceived there was a window it is true of six panes of glass at the top of the room but there was a high wall about six feet beyond it so that the portion of light was so small that there was but one spot in the room where i could see to read or write even in the middle of the day and as this window would not open and the door on account of the situation could never be left open a breath of air even such air as circulates within the walls of newgate was not to be had the ceiling and the upper part of the walls had once been whitewashed but they were now nearly of a colour with the chimney the lower part had also been wainscotted but the greater part of the wood had perished from the dampness of the place and all on one side the bare bricks grinned with a sort of sepulchral horror that might have persuaded me had i been inclined to indulge the terrors of imagination that i was already dead and buried there was indeed a tolerable bed in the corner hung with old filthy tattered curtains of red and white check but all the rest was one consistent association of the utmost wretchedness in a dark corner stood a shattered deal table under which my coals were thrown in a heap and upon which my victuals were to be placed and to complete the whole though the floor was of the colour of foot and in many places clotted with old hereditary filth standing up in hillocks sometimes thicker than my fist it was nevertheless flooded with wet under pretence of having just been washed that my feelings were shocked at the first view of this den of horrors i cannot deny but those principles which had enabled me hitherto to preserve not only my serenity but my cheerfulness did not desert me the proud consciousness of suffering for truth and virtue rushed instantly again upon my soul and i set myself down immediately to write a little sonnet the cell which appeared the next morning in the post and is now together with the other little scraps of poetry to which my situation gave birth published in a separate pamphlet i had scarcely finished this little sketch when the sheriffs c entered and mr sheriff eamer began to make a thousand polite apologies for not being able to furnish us with better accommodations every word of which i knew to be false and thence proceeded to condole with me upon the circumstance of my confinement and display his tender feelings by assuring me how painful a thing it was see and gentleman in such a situation of this civil insolence of     triumph which the tools of office throughout every stage of the proceeding shewed such a disposition to display i shewed my contempt as usual by a chearful indifference equally civil but more sincere i told mr sheriff eamer that very likely their uneasiness upon this subject might be greater than ours that for my own part i was very careless about the place i was confined in for that a mans happiness must spring from his mind not from the situation he breathed in and that i had no doubt that it was all for the best the voluble vivacity with which this was uttered appeared to shock mr sheriff eamer very much he lifted up his hands and eyes and turned away as though i had uttered blasphemy and as plain as eyes and gesticulations could speak seemed to reprove the criminal levity of my deportment the fact is that nothing was so offensive to our persecutors and their agents as our chearfulness and gaiety it was a contempt of their power and authority so marked and so impressive that it was impossible for them patiently to endure it this their low assassins of the quill the scribblers in their diurnal prints pretty openly confessed by their scurrilous abuse but their more exalted and more discrete agents revealed it in another manner—they affected indeed to fear that our indecorum should hurt us in the public opinion but their fears were evidently of another kind—they could not but perceive in this deportment an omen of the downfall of that system of corruption they are so desirous to support the plain and simple fact being that when men suffering for their principles are so deeply grounded in the conviction of their truth and propriety as to despise the utmost malice of their persecutors and by their chearfulness and fortitude to display that conviction to the world it is impossible that those principles should be beaten down tyranny and persecution may rage for a while but if the apostles of truth deport themselves with becoming firmness the gibbet and the consuming fire can only assist the propagation of those opinions they were intended to exterminate but whatever might be my own indifference about the place i was confined in it will not be surprising that the feelings of my faithful scribe when at length she obtained admission should be considerably affected in all former stages of this trying affair whatever might have been her internal feelings she had always appeared before me with a countenance of such chearfulness and fortitude as took from     separation half its anxieties but when she beheld me thrown like a dead dog into a hole so vile the heart can better conceive than the pen describe the sensations that must have been inspired—sensations not likely to be alleviated by the alternate howling swearing and obscenity of the female convicts when walking perpetually under my window deprived me of the possibility of enjoying even one moment of tranquility and silence this circumstance and a conviction that the publication of facts is a sacred duty which every citizen owes to his country determined me to remonstrate on the day of arraignment against the barbarity of our treatment in this particular and it happened that most of the prisoners had determined to pursue the same conduct as will be seen from the following quotations from the proceedings of that day as reported in ramseys edition of the state trials published by symonds—in gurneys edition the proceedings previous to the day of trial are totally omitted an omission which in justice to the public it is hoped he will remedy by an appendix as those proceedings are fraught with matter for important observation after the proceedings on the arraignment were over citizen bonney began as follows mr bonney— my lords will your lordships allow me a few words before we quit the bar i assure your lordships that if i had been arraigned for any known and certain treason for murder or for felony i would ask no favour of your lordships but when i stand before you upon a case in which and i believe i have your lordships opinion in my favour upon the subject if the facts charged against us should be proved there would be great doubt as to the law in such a case i trust i make no improper request to your lordships when i solicit that we may be allowed as many of the little comforts and conveniences of life to which we have been accustomed as may be consistent with the security of our persons your lordships i am sure will agree with me that a situation in which a man can neither sleep by night nor cast his eye upon a ray of comfort in the day is not the best adapted for the necessary preparation of his mind for so important a trial as mine—and yet my lords such is my situation i beg not to be understood to intend the smallest insinuation against the sheriffs their language and their countenances when they visited me yesterday in my cell sufficiently convinced me of the concern they felt at not being able to afford me better accommodation as it may be some days before my trial can come on my request to your lordships is that i may be remanded to the     custody of the governor of the tower where i have been treated for two and twenty weeks with the greatest humanity and attention l c j eyre— i doubt the court cannot say any thing to it if it should turn out that your trial should be postponed to any considerable length of time it will be necessary for you to make application elsewhere for indulgence mr bonney— my lord i cannot ask mr erskine or mr gibbs to visit me in the situation in which i am l c j eyre— i dare say the sheriffs will do all they can for your accommodation but as to ordering you back to the tower i think it is not within the proper authority of this court the application must be made elsewhere if you wish that to be done mr gibbs— mr bonney i dare say you will have nothing to complain of mr richter— my lord my case is precisely the same as mr bonneys in that situation it will be impossible for me to think of requesting the visits of messrs erskine and gibbs or indeed any persons who have been accustomed to the comforts of life l c j eyre— i have no doubt but the sheriffs will do every thing that it becomes them to do mr thelwall— my lord in addition to the circumstances mentioned by the other prisoners i will take the liberty to say a few words the situation in which i am though deplorable beyond any thing that ever before entered my imagination should not be a subject of complaint with me if i were alone concerned but men whose connections have been used to some of the decencies of life have persons coming to see them whose feelings may not be supported with that fortitude which the consciousness of persecuted innocence inspires in the breast of the individual i should wish therefore that some general regulation be made not only with respect to one or two individuals but with respect to the whole at least that we should be in some place where one mouthful of fresh air may be admitted in the course of the day in order to prevent those pernicious effects which may be produced upon the health of persons who have been used to different accommodations and that the few friends who may visit us may not have the anxiety and distress of mind which they must necessarily feel so cruelly aggravated by beholding the very wretched manner in which we are at present provided for my own part i would not notice this but there are others whose feelings it is a duty to have some tenderness for and     who cannot be expected to possess that fortitude which i flatter myself the circumstances of my situation have enabled me to acquire mr baxter— i wish to state that the circumstances complained of are not peculiar to two or three prisoners they are general to all i should therefore hope it will not be inconsistent with our situation that we should be better accommodated and that we might be permitted at least to walk in the open air two or three hours in the day mr richter— this was allowed us in the tower during the whole day l c j eyre— i can only repeat my recommendation to the sheriffs and the sheriffs assurance that you shall receive as good accommodations as the place will afford you and the nature of your situation will permit yet this assurance was so far from being followed up by any performance with respect to any person but citizen bonney who was removed to a small room on the state side that we remained in our miserable dungeons just the same as if no promise had been made the sheriffs indeed waited upon me to let me know that if i chose he would turn some one of the persons confined for seditious practices out of his apartment into my dungeon that i might be accommodated at his expence—a mockery to which i could only reply that it did not square with my ideas of justice to turn other men out of their accommodations that i might turn myself into them—the fact is however that this was not necessary for the prisoners for sedition proposed of themselves a plan by which three or four decent rooms on the state side might have been furnished for our accommodation but to this proposal it was not thought fit to attend the only indulgence therefore which we obtained was permission to walk in the square yard of the state side an indulgence which for two or three days we enjoyed pretty freely till timms and another messenger happened to pay us a visit to enquire after our health when behold the next day fresh orders came down to restrain this indulgence to two hours a day under restrictions so vexatious that it was hardly worth acceptance this confinement which lasted better than four weeks under circumstances totally excluding every requisite for health—where dampness could only be repelled by an enormous fire—where cleanliness was impossible and light excluded—where     even the disgusting necessities of nature were obliged to be complied with in the same close hole in which i slept sat and eat my food—and where the total want of atmospheric air was supplied by daily lustrations of vinegar—brought upon me a complaint in my bowels of the most malignant complexion of which i continue to feel the occasional effects even to this day at length bonney procured a habeas corpus to remove him again to the tower and i took possession of the room which he left and in which my beloved fellowcitizen gerrald had been confined before his removal to the new compter and citizen muir previous to his departure for botany bay—circumstances which induced me to reflect how much genius and virtue are frequently consigned under the present system of coercion to those dungeons which it is pretended are built for the punishment only of the most profligate and abandoned of the human race will it not appear extraordinary after the recital of these facts that any member of the government should have the assurance to boast of the humanity and kindness with which we were treated yet that this boast has been made in the most public manner appears from the debates of that assembly generally called the house of commons in which mr pitt is reported to have affirmed that the confession of the prisoners themselves bore testimony to the humanity and kindness with which they had been treated a falshood so unqualified as few men but mr pitt could have uttered without a blush having after all this oppression and injustice been acquitted of the ridiculous charge of high treason i imagined of course that the property seized in my house under false pretences by the agents of my prosecutors would be returned how far this expectation has been realized will appear from the following john thelwall   th dec      mr white correspondence with the privy council c sir i hereby desire you to restore to me the books papers collections of prints and other property taken

they the messengers     who seized them or any other person should have known with any tolerable accuracy and hence perhaps rather than from actual intention we may account for the perjuries of the messenger who upon my trial swore to have found upon the person of richter a letter which never was out of my possession and which another messenger must have found in my study between the leaves of johnsons folio dictionary and to have found upon my person another letter the direction torn off which i never saw and from a person i never heard of with respect to the first of these papers however there is one very suspicious circumstance which ought to be noticed namely that as this was an unsent and even unfinished letter—and as it was neither written in promotion of nor in relation to any alledged conspiracy it is notorious that it was not admissible evidence the circumstance therefore of the messenger supposing it was found upon the person of richter was a lucky mistake as this was a proof of publication and as therefore without some such mistake this letter upon which and particularly upon the avowal of my republicanism which it contains it is evident that all the hopes of my prosecutors were built could not even have been read upon the trial these circumstances relative to the seizure of papers if the present inquisitorial system is to go on are of the highest importance to the lives and liberties of englishmen and as the perjury with relation to the letter to allum had it been in reality any evidence of treason would have equally implicated richter and myself i therefore subjoin the following correspondence in further illustration of the scandalous injustice and negligence to say no worse of it with which every thing dear to man and to society is put to hazard by the agents of the present cabinet john thelwall  th june      hampstead j richter hampstead  th june      dear citizen having heard you mention some curious particulars that fell under your observation relative to the conduct of the messengers as to the papers c seized by them and their neglect of all precaution as to the means of ascertaining them i will be much obliged to you if you will communicate them to me without delay in writing as i am at this time publishing an account of my correspondence with the privy council upon this subject and as they will equally illustrate some gross perjuries of the messenger upon my trial and a curious     confession of our prosecutors that they have no means of knowing the books and papers of one person from those of another i am in civic affection yours to citizen j richter j thelwall j richter  th june      john thelwall citizen j thelwall beaufort buildings strand st jamess place  th june      dear citizen i have just received your letter of this day and take the first opportunity to answer it i must first mention that i have been this morning employing myself in writing a letter to the privy council in order to obtain a restoration of the property of which i have been deprived by their authority though from the account in your letter i fear some other means must be resorted to for that purpose and then proceed to state the circumstances of the seizure of my papers c as well as the precautions which the messenger and his assistant thought proper to take to identify them after i had been shewn the warrant they both employed themselves at the same time in different parts of my room in seizing written and printed papers and books of all descriptions which they then threw together indiscriminately into one heap without any mark to ascertain by whom they were taken or in whose possession they were found nor was any account whatever taken of them nor would timms suffer a friend of mine to be in the room at the time on observing this i asked timms if he would not mark them he replied no not now i shall give them to mr ford to examine first and shall then mark such as he desires me to identify—here i could not help reflecting on the very unaccountable negligence which was shewn as to the identity of papers which were to form the support if not to lay the foundation of a charge of the highest criminal nature known to the law and by which the fortune life and honour of the individual were to be destroyed and though i did not think fit to pursue the subject any further at that time i determined to watch narrowly the steps which were to be taken respecting them—they were then tied up in silk handkerchiefs and taken with me to the treasury chambers in a room leading to mr pollocks office shortly after this timms left the room and kennedy his assistant soon followed him leaving the papers behind them in the room with me some other persons being     casually present they soon returned and timms took the papers away with him leaving kennedy with me in less than five minutes however he came back without the papers i immediately asked if he had marked them he answered no not yet mr ford is now looking them over shortly after this i was taken into another room where i was left with kennedy alone for the greater part of the morning and in about two hours mr ford with timms came in the former returned me some of my papers which i now have and which have no mark whatever upon them and the latter had my portfolio containing letters from some of my friends with copies of my answers and also a small red leather book containing an account of the conduct of a committee of the society which he informed me were to remain in his possession as he had marked them these however together with those which had been returned to me did not amount to one half the quantity they had taken from me and indeed mr ford told me while i was in the council chamber that there were a good many others which were intended to be returned to me as soon as he could look them out† but although during our confinement i applied several times for them i never received them i need not make any observations on the presumption of a mans attempting to verify by his oath the identity of papers which were to bring to hazard the life fame and fortune of a fellow creature which were not only not seized by himself kennedy having taken part but on which he made no mark whatever at the time and before he took any measures whatever by which he might ascertain them suffered them to be overhauled by a third person out of his presence for at least an hour and a half every unprejudiced man will draw his own conclusion from the facts as i have stated them and will be able to account for the extraordinary testimony given by timms that your letter to allum was found by him in my pocket which however it is scarcely necessary to tell you i never saw or heard of till i had an account of his evidence—but an obstinate if not a criminal persisting in his own statements will never surprize those who have remarked that consequential     arrogance which appeared to me during the shor period i had occasion to know him to be the most prominent feature in his character as i believe i have omitted nothing in this statement and am conscious of having added nothing to the truth you are at perfect liberty to make that use of it which you may deem the most proper i remain your sincere friend and fellowcitizen j richter jun having illustrated this honourable confession of his majestys most honourable privy council i resume the thread of my correspondence john thelwall april        to the lords of his majestys most honourable privy council when i last applied to your lordships relative to the restoration of my papers books collections of prints and other property taken from my house under colour of the authority of a warrant from the secretary of state on the evening of the   th and morning of the   th of may last i received for answer after many delays if your answer was correctly reported that the messengers who seized these effects being out of the country it was impossible to know my papers from those of any other person understanding through the medium of the public prints that both the messengers are now returned i therefore renew my application and cannot but recal to the memory of your lordships the situation in which the liberty and property of the people of britain are placed if after a man having been arrested and kept seven months in close confinement upon an unjust suspicion has been pronounced innocent by his country and after the judges from the bench shall have declared as the chief baron macdonald did to me declare that he has been acquitted in the most reputable of all manners by the verdict of an attentive jury he is not only to be branded by members of the government as a felon and a person stained with moral guilt but his property the larger part of which the warrant itself did not authorize the seizure of is to be withheld from him as a punishment for not having been guilty of the crime he was charged withal—i cannot but add that it is a debt your lordships owe both to justice and your own regulations to shew that you do not connive at the almost indiscriminate plunder which under colour of the authority of government has been committed upon my premises beaufort buildings  april         signed j thelwall     to this remonstrance after repeated applications kennedy at last brought me an answer that mr white had orders to select and return my papers and that i must apply to him i therefore wrote as follows john thelwall   d april      mr white sir in consequence of my applications to the privy council i am instructed to apply to you for the restoration of my books papers collections of prints and other property taken from my house by his majestys messengers and others under colour of the authority of a warrant from the secretary of state on the night of the   th and morning of the   th of may last i therefore desire you to deliver the said articles to the bearer j thelwall beaufortbuildings   d april      to mr white solicitor for the treasury j kennedy   th april      memorandum saturday   th april      this day called on mr white solicitor for the treasury no   newsquare lincolns inn and delivered into his own hands a letter signed j thelwall requesting the restoration of the books papers copperplate prints c which had been taken out of mr thelwalls premises by the kings messengers c and that they might be delivered to me on reading the letter he threw it down and in a surly manner asked me what i meant by bringing him this letter—i answered the letter explains itself i was desired by the privy council to apply to you for mr thelwalls property and it is in consequence of their orders that this application is made he replied well sir you may tell mr thelwall that i have nothing belonging to him wit j kennedy john thelwall    may      to the lords of his majestys most honourable privy council i trouble your lordships once more upon the subject of my property taken from my house on the   th of may      under colour of a warrant from mr secretary dundas and never yet restored although the verdict of my country entitles     me to the restoration of the whole and a considerable part was of that description which there could be no pretence whatever for seizing i am to inform your lordships that in consequence of the answer i received to my last communication with you upon this subject i wrote to mr white the solicitor for the treasury stating that i was instructed by your lordships to apply to him for the restoration of my books papers collections of prints c but that instead of having proper attention paid to my demand my messenger was treated with great rudeness and dismissed with the following answer—well sir you may tell mr thelwall that i have nothing belonging to him this was on the   th ultimo and since that time i have had no further information whatever concerning any part of my effects nor any thing that indicates the least intention to return them i request your lordships therefore to satisfy me upon this subject—whether i am to consider myself as having any right to my own property or any expectation of its being restored to me or whether my books are to furnish the libraries and my prints to decorate the apartments of the messengers and bowstreet runners and my family to be deprived of all advantage which might result from the disposal of my former labours j thelwall beaufortbuildings    may      to this letter i have not been able to obtain any official answer whatever nor has any part of the stolen property been restored to me nor as i understand to any one of the injured parties yet none of the associations for the preservation of liberty and property have stood forward to offer us their assistance towards bringing the plunderers to justice ☞ the length to which the narrative and correspondence has extended and the applications made to the lecturer to print the farewell address with which the season was concluded renders it necessary to publish an appendix on saturday next with which will be given title preface c and no iii of the political songs     the manner in which some of the publications of the lecturer have lately passed the ordeal of criticism and the extensive circulation of this work induce him to subjoin the following extracts the peripatetic or sketches of the heart of nature and society   vols   mo  s      the author of these volumes is mr john thelwall who has lately been honourably acquitted by his country on a trial for high treason this work was published as appears from the date before his imprisonment in political character as the reader will be prepared to expect it breathes an ardent spirit of freedom boldly asserting the rights of man and condemning the incroachments upon these rights committed by those who have either assumed or been entrusted with power the author feels strongly on subjects of political oppression and writes like an honest friend to his species the peripatetic however is something more than a politician by far the greater part of the work is addressed to the imagination or the heart and either describes the different parts of england through which our traveller passes and the characters with which he meets or expresses the sentiments and reflections which may naturally be supposed to occur in the course of his tour a story by no means uninteresting is at several intervals interwoven with the other papers and the whole is enlivened and diversified with pieces of poetry on various topics the authors design appears to have been to unite the different advantages of the novel the sentimental journal and the miscellaneous collection of essays and poetical effusions the character of the language is rather that of ease than elegance it approaches nearer to the familiarity of sterne than to the dignity of johnson but is not properly an imitation of any former writer it is however on the whole pleasing and very naturally and forcibly expresses the writers ideas and sentiments after a quotation of several pages the reviewer proceeds mr thelwall possesses a happy vein of satire and nearly resembles churchill in the easy flows of his satirical verses we shall quote a few pointed lines in this way from an address to the genius of modern britain vol iii p      —not thou who taught

naturally expect from an ardent friend to freedom in such a situation as that of mr thelwall at the time when they were written rather transcripts of the heart than flights of imagination rather adapted to rouze the patriotic feelings than to amuse the admirer of poetic enthusiasm they are by no means destitute of the graces of poetic imagery and harmonious versification but their chief merit consists in the honest spirit of liberty which inspires them and in the noble example which they exhibit of the manly fortitude with which a patriotic mind can support unmerited sufferings the poems are sentimental but not in the hacknied sense of the term in mr thelwalls own words preface p iii—they who look for the sighs of personal regret and the elegiac tenderness of complaint will certainly be disappointed the pathetic ovid might lament his banishment from the country of his mistress and the social circle of his friends but the patriot immured in the walls of a bastille is called upon by important duties to repel every enervating sensation and cultivate those habits of reflection only which may increase the energy of his mind and enable him to render his sufferings ultimately beneficial to mankind and if he feels as he ought whatever affections or attachments may be incidental to him one preponderating idea will be constantly present to his imagination—the sacred cause for which he suffers anal rev april      see also montly rev march     the tribune no xv saturday  0th june      the address of j thelwall to the audience at closing his lectures for the season friday june   th      having finished the general sketch or outline of the history of apostacy and in that hasty and imperfect manner which the pressure of time and the copiousness of the subject would admit glanced at some of the innumerable characters whose biography that history would include i hasten to another part of my subject which the particular circumstances under which i stand this evening have occasioned to press more immediately upon my heart this citizens is the last time i shall have the pleasure of meeting you in this place for the present season i am going awhile into privacy and retirement and you will many of you ere long be seeking for health and recreation in other scenes let us then before we part have a few words relative to the nature of this undertaking the objects to which i wish to draw your attention and the means which i conceive the friends of liberty ought to adopt for the promotion of that cause of general happiness and general virtue which must always go hand in hand and which alone i hope will ever continue to be the actuating motive of the conduct and enquiries of the friends of liberty in the first place let me say a few words upon the reasons of this adjournment the thronged attendance upon this and the recent evenings will convince those persons however unwilling to be convinced who have hitherto employed themselves in invective and abuse against every individual however humble who has attempted to support the cause of liberty that i do not close these lectures because my venom as it has been called is exhausted and public curiosity no longer awake to my efforts but there are various reasons why my present exertions should not be continued without intermission   0 it is neither good for your health nor for mine that during the whole of that hot weather which we must now expect we should so frequently be cooped up within the walls of this place i feel also the necessity of some retirement i pant for the long lost pleasures of the rural scene for the vigour produced by rustic exercise for the cottage the thicket and the rill and the healthful inspiration of the vernal breeze nor will the man who has been so incessantly before the public as i have been be suspected of misanthropy when he confesses that he hungers and thirsts after solitude and obscurity since the time when i escaped by the virtue of a british jury from the charnelhouse of newgate i have never had any opportunity of enjoying that relaxation which was necessary for the restoration of my health and when you consider the infamous manner in which i was used when in newgate—crammed in a hole where one breath of air wholesome could never gain admittance and where the only substitute was a daily sprinkling of vinegar when you consider that for several weeks i was thus immured and debarred all possible resources of exercise and cleanliness you will not be surprized to find that i have not recovered from the injuries my health sustained in that noxious dungeon i think it necessary therefore to seek for awhile the shades of retirement which though they may appear for the time to draw me from the path of public duty are perhaps necessary in more points of view than one to fit me for the pursuit of that duty with more vigor and more effect for health is not all i expect from this retirement i feel that there is a necessity for the man who stands forward in so public permit me to say so important a situation to investigate political subjects that may involve the opinions and consequently the peace and happiness of thousands to retire occasionally from the busy haunts of life to that retirement where lonely deep and serious meditation may eradicate the views perhaps inherent in his nature and confirm him in those great truths which before he can propagate with propriety he must thoroughly understand it is from my deep conviction of the necessity of these occasional relaxations of busy and popular exertion that i have frequently been led to consider that one of the most fortunate and happy circumstances of my life—because i believe it was a circumstance which will assist towards my future utility to my fellow beings was the confinement i experienced in the tower and newgate     no kindness it is true was intended but if the mind has received a proper bias it will extract utility even from the persecution and malice of the bitterest enemies that which was intended to bow down my spirit to servility and terror and finally my neck to the stroke of the executioner gave me an opportunity to cultivate that firmness and strength of mind which can never be cultivated but in some degree of solitude and retirement i had an opportunity of investigating with more seriosness and abstraction than i could ever before have the means of indulging many of the sentiments which in the warmth of youth i had adopted perhaps without a sufficient degree of enquiry i used this opportunity in a manner perhaps which few would have expected and certainly which my persecutors would not have wished i struck with greater boldness into many of the new and dreaded fields of enquiry and the effects were widely different from what the common speculations of mankind would lead them to expect i had an opportunity of confirming myself in certain abstract principles principles which i believe i shall continue to venerate as the most dear and excellent things to which the human heart can be attached—because those principles properly applied to the condition and circumstances of society are the only guides to permanent virtue and consequently to the permanent happiness of the human race i had there an opportunity of confirming myself in many of those opinions which i had before adopted and upon which i had acted with an enthusiasm of conviction which had drawn down upon my head the hatred of the interested and the persecution of the powerful i had an opportunity also of detecting some erroneous passions and emotions which had sometimes perhaps perverted my feelings and which tho they had never seduced me into the approbation of violence had mixed perhaps too much of asperity and personal resentment where all ought to have been philosophy and benevolent enquiry i feel therefore the importance and necessity of frequently recurring to retirement and meditation that i may not be blindly impelling you to principles and modes of conduct the justice of which i have not duly weighed and that you may find this place as far as my capacities will enable me to make it so a theatre of instruction not a theatre of mischievous inflammation and that truth not irrational heat and     pell mell violence may be the consequence of your attendance round this tribune the meditations which led me to consolidate my opinions upon matters of politics have also had an influence upon a part of my conduct which it was always my intention to explain and which i think i cannot better explain than in this public manner namely that which some persons may be inclined to consider as apostacy in me—my withdrawing myself from the popular societies citizens one of the first reflections that suggested itself to my mind from the late trials and which was also confirmed by the judgment of all those on whose opinions i could rely was this—that it was necessary to make my choice between two objects—the tribune and political associations when we consider the arts and machinations that were made use of to connect together upon the late trials circumstances which had in reality no sort of connection whatever—that they endeavoured to hang hardy for sentiments which i was charged with delivering in my lectures and private correspondence and to hang me for the transactions of hardy at a time when i had no sort of connection with him or his society it appeared to be important both to my own safety and that of others that i should give no crown lawyers an opportunity of involving by legal sophistry any political association in the guilt if guilt it may be called of the sentiments that may be delivered from this place i and could not be ignorant that the more popular my exertions in the public cause might happen to make me—the more desirous those who wish to suppress all truth and chain the public mind in ignorance would be for my destruction i know that standing here unconnected with any projects or associations and adhering to the cause of truth i stand upon a rock which they cannot shake and that all their attempts against it must only render it the more firm the laws of my country are clearly and decidedly in my favor and honest juries shew an enlightened determination not to be misled by the sophistry of crown lawyers nor the inflammatory abuse of treasury scribblers and the garbled reports of interested alarmists they will not violate those laws which they are impannelled to defend to court the favour or shun the defamatory insults of a minister i balanced therefore between the two pursuits i found a necessity either of relinquishing the popular societies or of     relinquishing this tribune and upon serious examination i thought i perceived that my individual exertions could be more important to the cause of liberty in this place than in any society whatever i therefore quitted the societies not from any desertion of the cause not from any change of principle not from any opinion that political societies are dishonourable or unlawful—i am convinced they are legal i am convinced they are just i am convinced that they are important and that in many postures of society they are the only things that can save a nation from inevitable slavery and destruction but considering the necessity of putting a period to all their pretences for making ridiculous charges of high treason and conspiracy and hashing up mock traitors by the dozen in a dish some of whom as in the late cases had never seen each others faces or heard of each other before i found it necessary to cut the thread of connection between the tribune and the popular associations i therefore withdrew myself from them and chose this as my only field of exertion in the cause of liberty convinced that a bold decided and active mind determined to pursue the cause of virtue and by virtue i mean the happiness and welfare of the human race a mind trusting only to itself and independent of the humours and sentiments of others may in some circumstances of society do more service to the cause of liberty and justice than can possibly be done by the same individual when mixed with other persons whose wayward passions may sometimes thwart his activity and by whose imprudences he may perhaps by means of such complicated charges as have lately been brought forward be sacrificed at the sanguinary altar of ministerial ambition i will honestly confess to you citizens that there is also another motive which has had some influence in determining my choice for i ought to have no motive which i am ashamed to state to the public if it is an honest motive i despise the ridicule which dishonest knaves may throw upon it if it is an improper motive let it be known that its impropriety may be detected and that i may be benefited by the animadversions of my fellow citizens i have a family to support a family that perhaps may be growing continually upon me one that i believe would have been larger by two individuals at this time if the cruel persecutions of the present administration had not bowed down an aged     mother to her grave and murdered the infant struggling in the womb it was necessary then for me either to abandon in a considerable degree the public cause or to seek some way by which my personal interests could be united to the interest of the public such an union i believe is not dishonourable and if i know my own heart which i will not be too sure that i do—for it is certainly frequently too true that the heart is deceitful to itself above all things—but if i know my own heart there is no motive can compel me to sacrifice the general to the particular feeling abiding by that determination—and when i do not abide by it i shall no longer have your countenance i shall no longer have the cheering reward of your approbation—but abiding by that principle i do not feel myself at all disgraced by acknowledging that this theatre of investigation is the source of my subsistence and of the subsistence of that family which is dependent upon me it is a subsistence however that appears to me the most glorious independence it is the unsolicited price of the free exertions of my intellect it is perfectly voluntary on your part it is neither extorted from your charity by supplicating importunities demanded by the imperious voice of the tax gatherer nor extorted by litigious collectors of oppressive tythes no man is obliged to hire me to propagate what he does not approve nor to pay me for forging the fetters he must wear neither do i let myself out for hire to maintain all sides of all questions and determine the weight of argument by the weight of fee whatever advantage i receive is an advantage of the fairest reciprocity it is a voluntary exchange of your countenance and your rewards for the exertions which i make and for your opinion of my integrity and zeal in your service and tho it is impossible that periodical efforts should be uniformly successful the growing popularity and thronged attendance of these rooms forbid me to suspect that my labours have generally failed of bestowing satisfaction such a compact then—such a reciprocation i believe to be the most honorable means and the most independent by which an individual can hope to reap a livelihood by the exertion of his faculties i feel however the danger of my situation—i am conscious of moral mischiefs to my own mind in particular which are too likely to grow up from the situation i hope i occupy     i shall keep these dangers constantly before my eyes that i may avoid splitting the bark of my independence and endangering the shipwreck of that which is the dearest treasure i have my moral rectitude upon those rocks of delusion interest and passion which may unfortunately obstruct my course i am aware that in a situation like this the mind is sometimes apt to become inflamed to lose sight of principles and dwell too much upon personalities—to suffer passion to snatch the reins from reason and to foster prejudice and resentment when truth and justice ought to be the only objects i hope whatever there may have been of that conduct this season will be corrected in retirement before the next i trust there is less of it this season than in that which preceded and i trust also that there will be still less when we meet again else why live i an age of civilization if i am not to reflect upon the errors of my own conduct and feelings as well as those of others and by that means endeavour to attain to virtue wisdom and utility i feel also the danger and the temptation of being carried by the tide of popularity from the direct course of independent principle but i feel at the same time a settled conviction that i ought rather to court your hisses than your applause when that applause is only to be obtained by following instead of directing the current of opinion by courting your approbation instead of first looking to the approbation of my own heart and propagating any opinion but that which i am convinced from my soul is the opinion of truth and virtue to fortify myself in these convictions i retire awhile into obscurity ere i go however let me recommend to you to investigate with the most scrupulous exactness every opinion and sentiment you have heard either from my lips or the lips of any other individual remember—no man can deserve implicit confidence from himself much less from a numerous auditory remember that hearing and reading are no further useful than as they furnish materials for you own serious reflections and meditations opinions to be useful to you and mankind must be the result of ratiocination of examination and reexamination sentiments of genuine liberty must be the result of laborious reasoning and must spring from deep rooted principles to be efficacious they must be felt and understood and not like the babbling of a parrot who repeats the words     but understands not the meaning they are intended to convey let me advise you also to consider the state and posture of society we exist in it is an alarming crisis and no man can possibly determine in what sort of condition or what circumstances we may meet again at the end of that recess we are going to enjoy let us then fortify our minds with virtue and with principle let us restrain the angry and turbulent passion of our souls let us cultivate a benevolent affection for each other even for those who differ from us in opinion and let us labour by kind and gentle means to turn those from their error who may be treading in the path of vice or detect if we can the errors and vices into which ourselves have fallen above all things let us adhere to the principles of moderation but let these principles be properly understood for when it is properly understood moderation is virtue though as it is too frequently used it means the most contemptible of vices if by moderation you mean a compromise a midway path between vice and virtue i despise your modetion as i despise the cavilling of a sophist who would destroy the energy of my intellect instead of leading me to the conclusions of truth and reason but if by moderation you mean a steady adherence to the mild principles of justice—a determination to weigh and consider every sentiment before you adopt it to be inflamed by no factious principles to be misled by no party attachments but to do that which is just and never more always taking care that we do not let violence and intemperance snatch from our hands the reins of reason then i am the advocate of moderation—the votary of her power and the champion of her cause yes this genuine moderation so conducive to general happiness and virtue is the object of my supreme admiration i only love liberty as it appears to me to promote the virtue and happiness of mankind and if liberty will not promote this happiness and this virtue take your liberty for i will have none of it and if you could persuade me—it would be very difficult i believe—but if you could persuade me that the despotism of turkey could promote the happiness and welfare of mankind more than the principles of liberty and equality i would be the enemy of that liberty and equality because i am convinced that all our endeavours should be directed only to promote the happiness and welfare of the human species that welfare and that happiness which ought to be the dearest objects of every mans pursuit     the happiness of mankind then should be our first object but let us deeply enquire whether that happiness can be secured without liberty if it cannot let us brave dangers and persecution let us stand if i may repeat the simile like the spartan at his post and defend our landmark to the last and though the slaves and agents of oppression should heap rubbish after rubbish persecution after persecution upon us there let us stand till we are buried beneath the growling heaps leaving the monumental pile to all posterity as a trophy to stimulate their virtue and awake in their bosoms a correspondent flame in the cause of liberty a cause to be for ever loved because the cause of liberty is the cause of justice and of human happiness rewards of british valour the charity and liberality of this country is a subject of eternal egotism and certainly very large contributions for the relief of distress are levied upon the public both in the form of voluntary subscriptions and taxation but alas alldevouring corruption swallows every thing and a very small portion of these contributions are appropriated according to the original intention the following anecdote for example will give some idea of the treatment of those brave fellows who for the caprice or ambition of a minister are doomed to bleed in the field of flaughter and be deprived of the use of those limbs by the industrious exercise of which they used to support themselves and families william borton of  th regiment of foot commanded by lord harrington in the american war being wounded was with many others immediately sent to england by the barfleur    guns capt robinson a shot had passed through the right leg above the heel and taken out a piece from the back of the left he had besides two shots in his thigh there being neither a surgeon on board nor present at the engagement several of his companions being past hope were from the insupportable smell and at the same time dangerous consequences that might be apprehended from their mortified wounds absolutely thrown overboard alive he however arrived and was sent to the plymouth infirmary where the balls were extracted and his legs attended to that through which the shot had passed was in such a situation as to be     deemed fit for amputation borton insisted he could recover without such an operation and resolutely opposing he was at last dismissed and on this account could not procure a certificate for  l a year for life from chelsea hospital his leg is swelled tis true and he walks in some respects lame but is in no pain and is much better off than with a wooden leg now the surgeons have  l a limb for every one that is cut off therefore for putting  l into their pockets he might have had  l a year for life—but refusing this he is for ever deprived of what he is in reality entitled to this man now aged    who has since been supported by field labour has no resource but the workhouse if he can be admitted in one when he is incapable to work and is to be heard of either at the horns or dun horse kingsland road

and scarcity of provisions delivered by j thelwall wednesday april   th      citizens my feelings are peculiarly gratified to find so thronged an attendance when a subject like the present is held out for investigation because at the first view it must appear to be one of those which do not promise as large a proportion of amusement as many other topics might lead you to expect your   attendance therefore shews the deep anxiety you feel for the attainment of information and i am sure a subject equally important with the present cannot frequently be selected for your attention i know hardly any interest of humanity that is not involved in the enquiry i know hardly any branch of political knowledge that is not necessary for the complete and thorough investigation nor any individual subject that would require so large a proportion of time and attention to do it justice or so much ingenuity and precision to place the facts it involves in a proper point of view and it is justice not the ostentation of false modesty which compels me to say that i am well assured i do not come before you properly qualified to do it justice if i should however in some degree awaken the attention of the audience and through their means of the country at large to the serious consideration of the subject and a fearless enquiry into the real sources of the calamity i shall have effected a very grand part of my object and i am convinced that it is the duty of every individual as far as lies in his power to labour for the benefit of the human species by dragging forth to public view every fact which industry and opportunity can put him in possession of relative to circumstances which embrace so large a proportion of their happiness and prosperity there will arise considerable difficulties however in the investigation if i should confine myself simply to facts and arguments i am aware that a large portion of my audience would not only be disappointed but from not being in the habits of abstract speculation would fail of receiving that information which as far as i have the power i wish to give them i am aware also on the other hand that if i run too much into popular declamation or give the reins too much to fancy the great object which stimulates me to enter into the enquiry would be lost facts would not be brought to your minds with sufficient interest and simplicity and instead of giving you that light which should guide to happiness i might only produce that heat which by leading to turbulence would be injurious to society i shall attempt however as much as i can to steer a middle course and without disdaining to rouse attention by occasional appeals to your feelings and imagination i shall endeavour by the closest reasoning which hasty preparation enables me to command to force my way to the conviction of your   better judgments by such a combination i believe the best effects are to be produced but i am sure of this—that if i should be able to accomplish this purpose to the utmost of my wishes i should do the most dangerous thing for my own personal security and peace that any individual barring projects of violence and commotion could undertake for the facts involved in this enquiry are so monstrous the abuses of government and those who have the administration of government so enormous the scandalous practices and proceedings with which the understandings of mankind have so long been imposed upon while so large a portion of the people have been reduced to beggary are so dreadful that a man who should successfully state them to the public will be in eternal danger—from those men at whose interests he must strike and if he escapes the traps and pitfalls of perverted law he ought to wear a helmet on his head and a coat of mail upon his breast to preserve him from assassination i am however too far pledged to the public to retreat from the path of public duty after the situations in which i have stood after the malice that has been directed against me i cannot retire from the theatre of public action without betraying and injuring the cause i am embarked in more than i have yet been able to do it good i shall therefore put aside all personal considerations and proceed to the investigation of my subject nor shall i be prevented by any considerations from doing all the justice in my power to the truths which i mean to bring before you i warn you however before hand that small indeed will be the proportion of light which i can throw upon the subject compared to what might be thrown upon it by proper time and attention yet though i can do but little it will be no excuse for me if i neglect doing the little that i can the enormous increase of the price of provisions must be so evident to the most casual observer that it is not necessary to enter into any declamation upon the simple circumstance of that increase if however we take into consideration the facts of former history and compare together the state of human society in this country in former periods and at the present time the increase will come swelling upon our view in a proportion so monstrous that credulity will be staggered and i should not venture to state the facts to you if i had not aristocratic authority upon which those facts can be established   when we learn that   0 years ago a chicken was sold for a penny and a hen for twopence and that now a fowl is not to be purchased in the london market for less than five shillings we are struck with wonder and are led immediately to enquire how comes this monstrous increase in the price of provisions the philosopher perhaps will immediately appeal to theoretical reasoning and tell you of the immense increase of the quantity of circulating specie—he tells you and he tells you truly that the mines of peru have been constantly working that the bowels of the earth have been rent in every quarter of the globe in order to drag the hidden stores to the eye of day and that hence results a rapid decrease of the value of money he tells you also that in this country in particular the pompous use of furniture made of precious metals has very much declined that this furniture has also got into circulation and that hence arises another decrease of the value of money he tells you also that the state of society is such that the circulating medium passes with greater facility from hand to hand and that in consequence of that quick circulation he can adduce an additional reason for the increased price of the necessaries and luxuries of life—or in other words for the decreased value of money all this is true but let us see how far this will carry us it will show us it is true that a pound in money now is not as much as a pound in money formerly was and perhaps if we trace the matter farther back we shall find another reason for the increase of the nominal value of commodities namely that the weight of that coin which bears the same nominal value at this time is not so great as it was at the periods when that nominal value was fixed from the first of the norman sovereigns of this country to the present times we may trace a gradual diminution of the value of money i mean to say in the weight of it originally a pound weight of silver was coined into no more than  0 shillings and hence  0 shillings are called a pound at this very day although we know very well that  0 shillings are not a pound weight of silver at this time but that on the contrary  0s are now coined out of that quantity this makes however nothing to my present argument as by far the larger proportion and if bishop fleetwood may be considered as an authority the whole of this decrease in the weight of money had taken place before the reign of queen   elizabeth from whom i date the calculations i am about to make for that prelate in his very precise and laborious chronology of the fluctuations in the standard and value of money makes the sterling coin of queen elizabeth correspondent with the standard of the present day let us see then how far these facts will account for the increased price of provisions for if it is really true that the sole causes of this increased price are the increase of circulating cash and the variations of the standard of money then the condition of the lower orders of society and of all orders ought to be precisely the same as before because it being the money that has declined and not the articles of consumption that have advanced in value the consequence is that no other difference has actually taken place than an increased incumbrance in the quantity of money that you are to take to market with you to purchase the articles you want a little enquiry however will teach us how very small a proportion of the swollen price of provisions is to be attributed to these causes—for at the very time of which i have been speaking to you while depicting the very moderate price of several articles of consumption the common price of manual labour was  d a day you will therefore immediately see that there is no sort of proportion between the increase of the price of manual labour and the increase of the price of provisions during that   0 years which has thus passed away sweeping if i may so express myself in their flight every comfort and enjoyment from the cheerless tables of the industrious poor as i told you before i have aristocratic authority for these facts mr hume has never yet been suspected of jacobinism yet mr hume in the  d appendix to his history of england vol   page     of cadells small edition for i think it right to be very particular in my quotations states it as a fact upon the authority of an ancient author that between    0 and    0 a pig or a goose was sold for  d a good capon was sold for  d a chicken for  d and a hen for  d and yet continues this author who wrote at the very period relative to which he speaks at this time the wages of a common labourer was  d per day now supposing that the prices of other things were equally low according to the present ratio we find that the wages of a single day would have bought the poor labourer a fat pig a loaf of bread and some good ale to drink for himself and his family   but consider i pray you how many days a poor labourer must work before he must touch either ale or fat pig in the present situation of affairs for my own part i do not see why a poor labourer without whom by the way we should none of us have either ale nor pigs nor bread nor any thing else should not occasionally have his pig to banquet upon and his pot of ale after it to refresh himself but alas these things are now entirely out of the question and if a man has three or four children his ordinary wages will not even buy a sufficiency of bread alone for what is the present price of wages i believe we may estimate them at about sixteen pence per day throughout the country and i am in possession of facts enough to prove that for ordinary labour that is to say for eleven months out of twelve this is the outside now the price of a half peck loaf which for such a family is not too much is twentypence such are the blessings of our constitution in church and state as now administered but suppose we take the estimate from london where the price of labour is considerably higher the great part of labouring men employed in this capital receive from twentypence to two shillings a day some particular trades among whom combination is easy have by a sort of insurrection and violence extorted more but what is the price of a pig or gooose now i never go to market citizens and therefore am obliged to report these circumstances at secondhand but i am told that a good pig or goose at this time will cost about seven shillings instead of fourpence that a capon instead of threepence is six shillings and that fowls instead of a penny and twopence are about four shillings and sixpence at the lowest now taking the average of the increase from these facts supposing for the present that the increase of other articles has been proportionate the present price of provisions is about twentytwo times—mark the fact citizens—the price of provisions is multiplied by about twentytwo from what it was at the period i have been speaking of well are the wages of the labouring poor increased in a proportion of    to one if instead of this they are scarcely doubled let us mark in what a very different situation the lower orders of society are placed from what they were in the golden days of queen bess as they are called—golden they might be to the poor in this respect but i cannot help putting in my   caveat as to the general praise bestowed upon the reign of that despotic termagant if the price of labour had kept pace with the growing price of pigs and of poultry the wages of a labouring man would have been at this time not less than fifteen shillings per day now citizens if these are facts and if it is also true that no master could possibly afford to give his labourers fifteen shillings per day i am entitled to draw this conclusion—that the increase of the price of provisions does not principally result from the decrease of the value of money from the larger quantity of circulating specie or from any of those causes which mock philosophers have appealed to in order to gratify the tyrants who paid them for varnishing over their oppressions and deluding the people who listened to their fallacious arguments citizens this is not all i have some reason to believe that at the time i am now speaking of the usual days labour of a working man instead of twelve or fourteen hours was but eight i will tell you my reason for supposing this i know it to be the fact that in a particular part of the country it was but eight hours at that time and you will judge how far it is likely that this was an exclusive privilege about three years ago being on the coast of kent and taking up my habitation at a friends house at dinchurch wall which keeps out the sea from romney marsh and being at the house of one of the principal members of the corporation by which that district has the misfortune to be governed i had an opportunity of learning some particulars relative to their regulations by the charter of this corporation which was granted i understand about the time i have been speaking of the price of the days labour for a man working upon the wall which stands in need of constant repair is fixed at a shilling this will shew you that at that period  d per diem was the average price and not the maximum of the price paid for labour for the price of a days labour upon dinchurch wall for keeping out the sea from romney marsh was fixed by charter at  s being fixed by charter it remains the same at this time and the corporation itself has not the power of altering it but the days labour upon this wall being originally only eight hours the poor labourers finding themselves no longer able to live twentyfour hours upon one days work   perform regularly a day and an halfs work every day that is to say they toil twelve hours for which they receive  s  d for the support of themselves and families this is only an individual instance i grant and therefore does not authorize a very positive conclusion but as it has led me to suspect that the days labour was anciently no more than eight hours i state the foundation upon which the suspicion rests in hopes that others may think it worth while to enquire further into the subject it is certainly worth enquiry and for my own part whether it was the general practice or not i am thoroughly convinced that it is more than enough for the interests and happiness of society and more than enough to be put upon the individual nor can i give unqualified praise to the laws of any country that does not enable a poor man to maintain his family in decency by the diurnal labour of eight hours nay citizens if—which i believe never can be the case and therefore i dont wish to enforce it upon you as a thing practicable—but if an equal division of labour among all the inhabitants of this island and if the luxuries the follies and fopperies of life were banished even one hour per diem to each individual would be labour enough for the comfortable subsistence of all nay i am informed that mr nicholson a chymist and philosopher whose very name commands our reverence has absolutely calculated that the whole labour employed in producing the absolute necessaries of life when divided equally among the whole population of the country is not more than half an hour in the day now though i think it a very good thing that some of the embellishments as well as the necessaries of life should be attended to though i think it a very good thing that a country should be adorned with splendid edifices magnificent paintings books to inform the mind and diversions and indulgences to relax and soften it—that we should have articles of ease and gratification as well as the bare accommodations of life yet i do not think it right to grind the faces of the poor upon the millstone of oppression that a few worthless individuals may arrogate to themselves the individual possession of all those comforts and advantages citizens when i am thoroughly aware of the applications that may be made of what i am saying which i could wish always to be and how far the inferences will go which i attempt to draw from the facts i am stating i am very desirous   that i should never appear to draw a conclusion beyond that point in which the facts fairly and candidly stated will bear me out i ought therefore to observe that with respect to the former conclusion upon the prices of provisions there is some degree of fallacy and that when this fallacy is fairly stated it must be admitted to operate as a drawback in some degree with respect to the disproportion between the prices of provision and of labour and consequently that the depression of the lower orders of society is not quite so extravagant as it might in the first instance appear i wish to put you in possession of all the facts that i am master of and i shall not therefore be very much afraid of appearing to contradict in one part of my lecture what i advance in another i leave ungenerous advantages to the wrong side of the question our cause stands not in need of them i wish to submit the whole of the reasonings pro and con fairly and candidly that you may see how much and how little the facts i bring before you bear upon the conclusions i wish to adduce some abatement then is to be made from the calculation drawn from poultry and other articles of that description because the fact is that it was not originally so much as it is now the practice of a few particular individuals of the privileged and opulent orders of society to monopolize to themselves a particular species of food luxuries did not always bear a price so disproportionate to the necessities of life as they do now there was a time when salmon for example and all luxurious fish were so plentiful and abundant that the poorest individual in society as well as the richest could have them upon their tables and banquet upon them to satiety i had an opportunity to mention to you once before that it was found necessary at winchester to insert a clause in the indentures of poor boys apprenticed from the parish to prevent them from being fed more than three times in the week upon salmon but means have since been taken to preclude the necessity of such clauses it was known by the great and mighty potentates who dance before us in the puppet show of state adorned with stars and garters—it was known i was going to say by these mountebanks but i mean by these right honourable gentlemen that luxuries were adapted to pamper their appetites and fill them with the sinful lusts of the flesh and thereby corrupt their morals and render them  0 but little disposed to go to church and still less disposed to listen to every thing that the gentleman in the black gown should say to them and finally to render them unfit for labour and destroy their constitutions these right honourable gentlemen therefore with respect to many of those articles were willing to engross the dangerous enjoyment to themselves knowing very well that their own morals could not be made much worse and that if they did eat and drink themselves to death it was matter of very little consequence to society salmon was therefore contracted for by their agents of luxury the great fishmongers and agreements were notoriously made that only a given number should be brought to market and the rest let them be as plentiful as they would should serve to manure the earth other practices particularly the breaking up of small farms have tended to increase the price of pigs and poultry it being found improper for the swinish multitude to have such food—there being something monstrous in the idea of one pig eating another these circumstances have caused a great disproportion between the prices of those articles and of the articles of common food much greater within the remembrance of some persons perhaps to whom i am now speaking than it used to be but suppose we take the general difference in the price of provisions at the most moderate calculation possible suppose we should admit for the present that the price of these articles was no more at the period i am speaking of than the price of common butchers meat suppose for example at the same time that a chicken was to be bought for a penny meat was a penny per pound what shall we then find the proportion to be meat a penny a pound and labour eightpence per day the price of a days labour then at that period at the lowest computation was equal to the price of eight pounds of butchers meat is that the case now it this is the lowest calculation that can be admitted then certainly whatever the result is as to the difference between the proportionate prices of labour and provisions then and the proportionate prices of labour and provisions now we shall be compelled to admit that such difference does now exist between the condition of the laborious part of the community then and now well then to make the price of labour at this period equal in point of real advantage to the price of labour at that period—that is to say to enable a man for the same quantum    of labour to get the same quantity of comforts and accommodations the average price of labour ought to be  s  d per diem throughout the country let me be understood accurately i do not mean to set myself up as the arbitrary judge of what ought to be and what ought not to be the price of labour that is not what i am aiming at i want to convince you of the nature and causes of the evil and then let the good sense and understanding of the country seek for its remedy whether the proper remedy is to remove the causes of the extravagant price of provisions or to raise the wages of labour or whether both ought in some degree to be done i do not at present decide but i think i am entitled from this statement to draw this conclusion—that there is a monstrous advance upon the prices of the necessaries and accommodations of life the whole of which cannot be attributed to the decrease of the real value of the money by which these articles are bought i think i am entitled also to conclude—that either one or other of these two circumstances is the fact—either the quantity of money has been constantly increasing and the prices of provisions have consequently kept equal pace with that increase while the higher orders of society have monopolized the increasing money and all the consequent advantages to themselves so that the lower orders of society by whom the whole was produced have not been proportionably rewarded or else there is an increase in the price of the articles of consumption disproportionate to an extravagant degree with the increase of the specie by which those provisions is to be purchased i believe citizens both these statements are true i believe from causes which i shall afterwards investigate that the price of the necessaries of life has increased beyond the increase of the circulating medium i mean the general circulating medium i shall speak of that swindling bubble called paper credit at another part of these lectures i believe also that there has been a neglect of the lower orders of society and that the increase of their wages has not borne any sort of proportion with the real increase of the quantity and consequent decrease of the value of money but let us bring the comparison a little nearer to us let us take facts of more recent date and see what we are enabled to conclude from them i shall now proceed to statements to the accuracy of which if they are accurate a great proportion of you will be able    to bear testimony or the fallacy of which if they are false you will readily detect—facts relative to the prices of provisions within the last twentyfive years i shall then compare these prices with the increase of the price of labour and see how far the lower orders of the people have been benefited even during that period for a great part of which the growth of wealth commerce and prosperity have been so frequently boasted by that treacherous individual who has all the while had his dagger at the heart of every blessing and every comfort and accommodation of the country twenty years ago bread was fourpence per quartern now it is ninepence farthing i understand that in london it has since risen to a shilling nay this increase monstrous as it is has another aggravating circumstance—namely that many of those vegetables which used to decrease the consumption of bread are now scarcely to be got at any price whatever potatoes which since i have been a housekeeper used commonly to be sold at five pounds for twopence are now three halfpence per pound this circumstance may appear trifling and ridiculous to some of us but it is no trifle it is no ridicule to the poor individual who has five or six children to support and who hitherto has been able to give them but little sustenance but what was derived from these potatoes sopped in a little of that chalk and water which in london we call milk but these are not the only articles which have thus increased in their price we talk of famine in france we have a worse famine at home they have had no scarcity but of bread alone we it seems have a scarcity of every thing no kind of meat in any part of that country has ever been more than fourpence per pound what is the case with us boiling beef twenty or twentyfive years ago might be bought at from twopence to twopence halfpenny now from sixpence to sixpence halfpenny roasting ditto at fourpence now at eightpence pork and veal at fourpence halfpenny now at eightpence halfpenny mutton threepence halfpenny and fourpence now eightpence for good salt butter that used to be bought at fivepence we now pay elevenpence loaf sugar good aristocratic loaf sugar such as you must now pay thirteen or fourteenpence per pound for was then sold at sixpence as for the cheap sort of loaf sugar as it is called for which you pay elevenpence or a shilling at this time it is such coarse democratic stuff as no individual    at the period i am speaking of would have bought at any price whatever moist sugar a very important article to poor people who wish to keep their children in health by regaling them frequently with a fruit pudding used to be twopence halfpenny per pound it is now ninepence coals till within these seven years were scarcely ever so high as a shilling per bushel they have been three shillings and three shillings and sixpence during the late inclement season and twentypence was no uncommon price the winter before what is the result of all this—that coals have increased their price threefold common sugar almost fourfold butter and bread considerably more than double some meats have increased threefold in their price and the average of all animal food is considerably more than double the price now that it was twenty or twentyfive years ago now then supposing we could admit that all this increase of price resulted from the increase of gold and silver from the wealth and grandeur and splendour and prosperity of the country—and mr dundas having told you that general bankruptcy is a proof of the prosperity of the country may perhaps be able to prove to you that the increased price of provisions is a proof of the grandeur prosperity and happiness of the country but if this be true what justice has been done to those millions of our fellow citizens from whose labour from whose industry from the sweat of whose brow all that wealth and prosperity has been reaped ought not this wealth grandeur and prosperity to have enabled the labourer who procured them at least to eat as well drink as well cloath himself as well lay on as good a bed and be sheltered by as good a roof as formerly for the accomplishment of this the price of labour ought to be considerably more than doubled it has not however upon an average from one end of the country to the other been increased during that period one fourth in some places it has scarcely been increased at all and in many not one sixth mark then the blessed effects of the martial administrations of north and pitt two characters that will go hand in hand down to infamy the one for the sordid and pusillanimous cowardice with which he suffered himself to be made the chief tool and instrument of a war he never approved the other for his savage propensity to the destruction of the human race and the unfeeling duplicity with which he has pursued his ambitious views but why do i put epithets to the word hypocrisy itself includes every thing that is detestable and    abhorred and wherever you find that scowling countenance that shuffling gait that lapsided arrogance of deportment which marks the political maypole of this devoted country set down the being thus stamped by the broad seal of nature for all that the catalogue of guilt contains from solitary intoxication and debauchery to the ravage of nations and the depopulation of continents and the most inveterate hatred to the liberties and happiness of mankind thus then we find that the labourers of this country at this time possess considerably less than half the necessaries comforts and accommodations which they were able to obtain twenty or twentyfive years ago and less than a third of what recompensed the same or a less degree of labour in the middle of last century while at the same time the pensions places and luxuries of our rulers have been extravagantly increased the wealth the power the insolence of sucoessive administrations have kept pace with the growing misery of the people and while one are stripped of half their necessaries the others are insulting common sense and common decency with the pompous display of more than twice their former opulence and wasteful grandeur yet aristocrats have the shameless audacity to tell us that if the price of the necessaries of life has increased the price of labour has increased also it is a courtly virtue to lie with the words of truth and therefore i give them credit for their consistency the price of labour has indeed increased from eightpence to a shilling and from a shilling to fifteenpence while the necessaries of life have risen at a proportion of from eightpence to two shillings and from two shillings to five such then are the facts with respect to the usual articles of common accommodation but there are other articles which though not immediately consumed by man have also a tendency to increase his misery when they are increased in their price hay for example and indeed every individual article that bears any price whatever what then are the facts relative to those articles have they increased in price or have they not within five years from the year    0 oats have increased    per cent in price i believe i state this fact from such authority that i do not stand in danger of any contradiction i am not myself an adept in the market price of these articles or in the commerce that is carried on relative to them but i believe i can state from the best authority that since the year    0 the    price of oats has increased    per cent while hay every article of pulse and a great variety of those articles which contribute in a secondhand way to the comforts of life have kept pace with this increase what then shall we say to all these facts—is it necessary or is it not that the causes should be enquired into i believe it is necessary for whatever may be the case with respect to theological matters with respect to political concerns i believe it is virtue to know good from evil i believe that we ought to pluck the apple of science whenever it hangs within our reach i am sure also that if it is good to enquire it is necessary that the people should make the enquiry for themselves for i do not believe the ministry will be inclined to make it for them at this period indeed they have better employment abroad their wits and faculties are too much engaged in showing how consistent it is for them to talk of the faithlessness of republicans by persuading the royalists of la vendee to break thro all the oaths and engagements they have made with the republic of france they are too busy in sending their  0000 stand of arms with their scoundrel runaway emigrant officers to excite fresh insurrections—fresh scenes of blood and massacre among the ignorant priest ridden peasants of poictou—in arming afresh the chouan banditti—the midnight murderers of brittany that they may have the pretence of something like a shadow of a shadow of the shadow of a probability of success upon the strength of which to persuade the people of britain to be gulled once more to spend another forty millions in a fresh campaign and to have the honour of finding themselves in a worse situation at the end than ever however this gives me no uneasiness for things at the worst must surely mend and our rulers seem determined that it shall not be long before they drive matters to the very worst that human nature is capable of bearing but say these virtuous men and their most sapient advocates it is not right to enter into enquiries of this kind at this time consider the state of the public mind it will lead to commotion such is the trick and cheat which they have been putting upon our understandings and perhaps upon their own for centuries such have been always the pretences of the individuals who have walked the same infamous round before them and such always will be the pretences of those who follow in the same routine the delinquents will always think it is not a proper time to enquire into the state of their delinquency    but the fact is that commotions spring from ignorance and not from knowledge he who is wise knows how to redress the grievances he labours under he who is ignorant feels the sting of disaster but instead of taking the path of amelioration plunges headlong into violence men ignorant and uninstructed become mad and frantic with their wrongs for what is madness what is phrenzy but the want of knowledge and capacity to understand right from wrong truth from falsehood and to perceive which is the way to accomplish those designs which wisdom justice and virtue would dictate i wish to allay not to increase fermentation i wish i knew how to give you a spartan determination of soul together with the benevolence and philanthropy with which a few speculative philosophers of the present day have endeavoured to inspire mankind i would make you hard as rocks against the assaults of corruption prejudice and oppression i would make you stand like a marble wall and defy the assaults and encroachments of those wretches who dare to set a foot upon the sacred boundary and landmark of liberty but at the same time i would fill your souls with a destation of every thing like violence rancour and cruelty o that i could make you feel the true determination of generous valour and that you might be as wise and benevolent as you were determined and resolute how is it to be done how shall i steel your breasts and soften your hearts at the same moment if i knew how to do this i should then indeed be fit to stand in this tribune and listened to by my fellow citizens because i should then be able to point out to you the certain means of redress and insure you success in your struggles for the happiness of future ages without aggravating even for an hour the misery of the present generation i am sure however that this effect is not to be produced by intimidation or by ignorance i have seen since i last had the honour of meeting the countenances of my enlightened fellow citizens in this place i have seen some of the lamentable consequences of the miserable ignorance in which the governors of this country contrive to keep the people i have been rambling according to my wonted practice in the true democratic way on foot from village to village from pleasant hill to barren heath recreating my mind with the beauties and with the deformities of nature i have traced over many a barren track of land in that county surrey    which is called the gentlemans county because forsooth the beggarly sans culottes are routed out from it their vulgar cottages so offensive to the proud eye of luxury are exterminated and nothing but the stately domes of useless grandeur present themselves to our eyes i have been travelling over those spots i have enjoyed the fine prospects from leith hill and have turned round with a sigh to behold how many a little uncultivated valley there lies waste how many a beautiful spot lies desolate which a thousandth part of that revenue which has been so madly wasted in the present detestable war might have converted into smiling gardens and luxuriant fields yielding food and raiment to many a poor family while their little smiling cottages might have imparted delight where now nothing but gloomy sterility is to be seen in the course of these rambles i have dropped occasionally into the little hedge alehouses to refresh myself i have sat down among the rough clowns whose tattered garments were soiled with their rustic labours for i have not forgot that all mankind are equally my brethren and i love to see the labourer in his ragged coat—that is i love the labourer i am sorry his coat is obliged to be so ragged i love the labourer then in his ragged coat as well as i love the peer in his ermine perhaps better for indeed i should not be sorry if the ermine of the peer were employed in keeping the children of the poor raggedcoated peasant warm of a winters night i have mixed therefore with these people and i have grieved to hear their sentiments commotion and violence they can readily commend they can applaud the frantic proceedings of those who have seized upon the shambles the mills and the bakers shops and thus have endeavoured by their arbitrary proceedings to reduce the price of provisions thus far they think the interference of the people right but as to political enquiry to this they are too many of them dead the generality of them still cherish the prejudices that have caused their misery they hate a frenchman for being a jacobin as much as they formerly hated him for wearing wooden shoes tho they know no more of the meaning of the word jacobin than they did before of the guilt that was attached to shoes of wood nay too many of them idolize the name of a contemptible wretch whose fathers reputation was the sole cause of his popularity and whom a few grains of enquiry would lead them to execrate as the author of that very scarcity of which they complain i    have argued with these men upon the impropriety of tumult and violence for i abhor commotion more than i abhor any thing except despotism and corruption and i never meet with the advocate of violence but i endeavour to show him its wickedness and absurdity but alas the uninformed mass love this violence they uphold the propriety of it because they are ignorant of the real sources of their calamities because they do not know that the miller the baker and the butcher against whom their violence is directed are as much oppressed as themselves and that they must look higher if they would find the real instruments of their oppression that they must think more deeply if they would learn the means by which that oppression is to be removed the fact is as i shall shew you in the course of this enquiry that though the causes are multifarious indeed that have produced this oppression the greater portion of them is to be traced to the errors to the vices to the selfish usurpations of those ministers and their predecessors who think that no man has rights who was not wrapped in a swaddling band of ermine and that no man can be entitled to reason unless he has either in possession or expectation a bit of blue ribbon or a few gold and silver spangles embroidered on his nightgown there can be no doubt that the advocates of administration must be anxious enough to prevent enquiry because enquiry must point out who are the causes of the wrong and what is the mode by which redress is to be obtained there is no doubt that tumult and violence are pleasant things to them because they give them pretences for giving additional force to the arm of authority and for drawing tighter those reins of government which though the poor may bleed at the mouth while the gag presses hard upon them it is pleasant enough for those who only drive and whip and spur them to be holding with a hard hand they therefore have little objection to the butcher the baker or the miller being sacrificed to the ignorant indignation of the people provided thereby they avert the dreaded calamity of calm enquiry and shun the light of political truth which brings conviction to the minds of the people and threatens by the unanimous sentiment of virtue and justice which it might inspire to drive them and their crimes from the seat of power this they must abhor because whenever that unanimous sentiment of common sense and justice shall prevail among mankind down drops the curtain upon the mighty puppets of the day    the wires they have been moved by will no longer make them perform their evolutions and punchinello and his family strut in their embroidered robes no more citizens the field of enquiry that opens before me is immense the present subject involves almost every question connected with finance it involves the consideration of that delusion which has been so long upheld paper credit it involves the system of taxation it involves the present mode of partitioning land into farms and tenements it involves the scandalous neglect which has occasioned one third of the land in this island taking england scotland and wales together to remain in an uncultivated state on the succeeding evening i shall give you the facts stated by the committee of the board of agriculture and prove to you that one third of the lands of this country absolutely lie waste what a scandal to the government of the country what a shame that pensions places and emoluments so immense should be wasted upon a few worthless individuals while so large a portion of the country lies useless which with a tythe of that money might be converted into regions of plenty and population the despotism of china would blush at such absurdity go there behold the population thick almost as the bearded grain that grows upon the cultivated ground behold every street swarming with human beings what is the reason that even in the midst of despotism the human species can thus be multiplied they have no pernicious system of paper credit they have no monopolized system of external commerce they have no monopoly of lands into the hands of a few holders they are not year after year and month after month turning the little tenant out of his farm to throw a huge province almost into one concern and on the speculative mercantile trafficker in land bestow that which might produce the comfortable support of numerous families and tend thereby to the happiness and prosperity of the country it is not my intention to enter into the whole of this wide field on the present evening i shall confine my observations during the remainder of this lecture to a few particular points which are immediately connected with the abuses of government and with those circumstances that press particularly upon the present moment there are undoubtedly circumstances which have occasioned a gradual increase in the price of articles of the first necessity in this country there are other circumstances  0 which have tended to produce an absolute scarcity not only in england but in europe among those which have tended to increase the price of provisions we may reckon the enormous growth of corruption among the higher orders of society by which the expences of government have been greatly increased we are to consider also among the causes of permanent evil the restrictions upon the exportation and the importation of corn and we are to consider also a burden rendered venerable by its antiquity but whose grey hairs can no longer preserve it from contempt i mean the oppressive burthen of tithes and a great variety of other causes which shall be enumerated in their turn the part however which i shall particularly dwell upon this evening is that which relates to the present war and which as all other wars in some degree but the present more than any former has occasioned a considerable increase of the price of provisions independent of taxation independent of the additional burdens which encumber traffic—as the increase of freightage and insurance and the like the former of these is paid upon all articles of consumption which are removed from one part of the coast to another and therefore corn coals and other articles which are of home consumption as well as sugar and articles of foreign produce partake of the consequent increase of price now citizens i shall state a few facts relative to an individual article which will shew you by analagous reasoning how considerable an increase in the price of the necessaries of life must have been produced by the present war by the operation of these two species of burthen alone the freightage of sugars was only four shillings per hundred weight before the war now it is ten shillings the insurance upon the same article which used to be six pounds per cent is now increased to sixteen you will please to remember that the increase of freightage arises from so many individuals who used to be employed in commercial navigation being pressed on board our men of war to be cut to pieces and destroyed for the glory and honour of william pitt and co such is the price which one half of the community pays for having the other half cut and blown to pieces in ridiculous wars with respect to the increase of the insurance that is to be attributed to the activity of the enemy for as they sometimes take the liberty of sweetening their tea with the sugar we have paid for the underwriters of course must take a    greater premium before they can insure the respective cargoes and by the way it should be observed that these gentlemen underwriters do not fail to take advantage of these circumstances war is a sort of harvest moon to these legal gamblers so much so that i remember at the close of the american war hearing one of them lament that hostilities were over so soon—for that if they had continued a year or two longer he should have feathered his nest completely citizens i do not mean to contend that the freightage and insurance of all articles have increased in the same proportion but this will show you how to account for one part of the increase of the price of the necessaries of life resulting from the present war in short there is a thousand ways in which it affects them besides the wholesale accumulation of taxation and the obvious inconveniences of decaying manufactures and stagnated commerce see then the advantages of going to war to those whose destiny it is to survive at home as to those poor beings who had their heads knocked off abroad according to mr burke they are gone to receive their reward and therefore he might tell you the faster our brothers and friends have their heads knocked off the better because they are going so much the faster to heaven and as he had the honour of being educated among the jesuits at st omers i am sure i shall not contend points of religion with him but admitting this to be the case there can be no doubt that heaven has been very well peopled by the triumphs of the present war the last campaign particularly the exploits of which it is unnecessary to enumerate and indeed it would put one out of breath as it did the french to follow them from field of glory to field of glory—from the frontiers of france to the marshes of flanders and from the marshes of flanders to the dykes of holland and from the dykes of holland to the devil knows where—it would be impossible to enumerate the atchievements which will immortalize the name of the british frederic and cause posterity to go down upon their knees and bless the wise heads of pitt of jenkinson and loughborough and all the sapient projectors of this most glorious salutary and triumphant war paying a little more for the sugar to sweeten our tea or drinking it without or having a plumbpudding or pye or two the less every week are trifles in comparison with the permanent advantages reaped from undertakings so wise and exploits so glorious there is another thing has produced an increase of the price of all necessaries to be shipped from one part of the    country to another namely the embargo laid upon our merchandize in order to enable mr pitt to get more sailors to fight his battles for him but there are in the present war circumstances of peculiar aggravation which it seems our state politicians could not calculate it was boasted by that great teacher of the rule of three the chancellor of the exchequer that we should have for our allies all the powers of europe it was well answered by his powerful opponent in the house of commons much more powerful he would be still if he would shake off the trammels of party—it was well answered by him that the greater our alliances the greater our calamities because the consequence was that all europe being engaged in war no port would be left open no place would be neutral and therefore the greater would be the stagnation both in our external and internal commerce but he might have gone further he might have said not only our commerce is stagnated but the very sources of subsistence are dried up in consequence of this grand alliance all europe is at war your own produce scarcely ever sufficient for your own support is now to be sent in large quantities to the continent to supply all the armies of all the despots of europe stripped as you will be of every necessary article of life where is the neutral nation that is to supply you what corn will you get from any of the powers on the right or on the left bank of the rhine what supplies will you draw from any of those places from which you used to have them none—you have plunged all europe into war all europe of course must neglect the cultivation and tillage of its land all europe must lose the opportunity of supplying you with the necessary articles which your profligacy will destroy—where then are you to seek in the midst of those blessed victories which you anticipate how well they have been fulfilled we have since seen—where are you to seek for food to sustain the soldiery who are to fight your battles abroad and to feed the poor manufacturers who will be languishing in disease and want at home—will you expect it from america—from america who if she has one grain of justice or common sense must love the cause of your enemy and abhor yours—america who must regard every success you may happen to obtain as a signal of alarm to her independence—america who must regard your violation of treaties on the banks of the miami as a bone of    contention purposely preserved to furnish you with a sorry pretence if ever you should think yourselves strong enough once more to attack her and attempt her subjugation—according to this calculation has been the event hence neither wheat nor any other grain has been imported since the last harvest except oats and very small quantities even of these most of them from ireland very few indeed from hamburgh this accounts for the rise of    per cent in the price of that article which has been mentioned before the very great supplies of oats which used to be sent through the ports of holland from various parts of the continent have entirely ceased the states also on both sides of the rhine the austrians and the united netherlands have either neglected their tillage or what little they have produced has fallen not into the hands of britain but into the hands of britains enemy—your allies have left half their lands unsown and what has been the fate of that which they have cultivated the triumphant republican with his sword in one hand and his sickle in the other has reaped the harvest and carried it into his graineries let us observe also the conduct of our good and gracious ally the king of prussia that illustrious sample of the saith of monarchies that demonstrative reasoner in favour of treating only with regular and established governments even when he pretended to be our friend that is to say while he showed an inclination to receive our money for he never showed any inclination to do any thing else for us but to lighten us a little of that of which he saw we had so much as to make us proud—seeing that taking a great deal of it away would bring the people to their senses he very kindly helped the minister off with it but even during the time that he was receiving this money he absolutely prohibited the exportation of corn to any nation whatever now whether in reality he was afraid that this corn should fall into the hands of the french or whether he was afraid there would be a scarcity in his own country it matters not with respect to my argument suffice it to say that it being known to our wise minister that he had forbid the exportation of corn yet our wise minister thought proper to pay for a quantity of that article hoping i suppose to be able by weighty arguments to persuade the king of prussia after he had paid for it to let him have it and now we may find    perhaps that the eloquence of the french convention is more powerful in prussia than the eloquence of britain—that court having been a long time studying the french language tho i have not yet heard that any english grammarian has been sent for to instruct them in ours one part of the english language however the king of prussia understands very perfectly that which i mean is generally written in characters of the brightest yellow and which is considered in our senate as composing the most solid weighty and persuasive part of eloquence the ornamental part of rhetoric however he imports from another country and to these as there are some reasons to doubt the soundness of his royal capacity he may chance to be most attached but there is a still more important circumstance to be taken into consideration namely the exportation to the armies this is not easily calculated because i am credibly informed that in many instances what with the shifting of ground retreating from place to place—for you know we have been gravely told in the ministerial papers that notwithstanding their successes the french have never been able to take possession of any ground till the british troops had first of all removed from it thereby demonstrating a well known physical proposition that two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time—well then what with the bodies of the english armies moving first from one spot and then from another and the bodies of the french moving on to them what with sometimes burning the corn and sometimes drowning it that it might not fall into the hands of the enemy what with its sometimes actually falling into those hands it has been known that the orders of the commissaries have sometimes been three times executed before the stores have actually arrived at the army for which they were intended so that even the powerful genius of brook watson has sunk beneath the weighty duties and still more weighty profits of his office and he is said to have exclaimed in despair that it was impossible to supply a flying army here then is waste for you here is a source of aggravated scarcity the waste and consumption of a camp is always double the quantity that would provide for the same number of individuals in their own peaceful habitations and the support of a flying army is always three times as much as an army that is successful would require but this is not all the wicked and mischievous policy of the present system it adds wantonness to misfortune and    aggravates with wilful devastation the calamities of the human race it is reported that even so large a quantity of haystacks as would cover a whole mile and an half of ground in the neighbourhood of rotterdam was set on fire by the retreating english and hanoverians because it should not fall into the hands of the enemy a precious legacy this to bequeath a people whom we had forced into a war they did not wish for and whom we were incapable of defending magazines of hay having been so destroyed do you suppose that magazines of corn and beef have not been destroyed in the same way o feeble sense of reason and of virtue—o neglected spirit of justice and humanity that any being who has capacity enough to count his fingers or who can put down as many units upon a paper as will make ten should ever think of plunging continents into war for the gratification of their ambition when the consequences must be destroying thus by wholesale the means of the existence of so many thousands of their fellow beings who have the same right to the accommodations of life with themselves but who together with their families are to be reduced to misery and the lingering death of famine while mad revenge the avarice of office and the intoxicating love of power stalk with inflated insolence over the globe affect the nod of deity and snuff the incense of human sacrifices citizens the evening is far advanced but late as it is there is one subject i cannot pass over without some animadversion i mean the conduct of the minister of this country with respect to poland that country whose struggles for dawning liberty warmed the heart of every generous briton that country to which every man who had one spark of veneration for any thing that looked like liberty in the constitution of this country must have sincerely wished success that country has been beaten down its spirit has been annihilated its population thinned by massacres perpetrated by the regular government of russia every spark of liberty has been trampled out the hyæna of the north and the vultures of germany have torn its mangled limbs have feasted on its gore and have been supplied by british gold with the means of this destruction and inhuman partition this conduct will shew you that it is not jacobinism only that is hateful to the present minister—that it is not republicanism only that he detests that he is a worshipper of unqualified    despotism that he wishes to establish it throughout the world and that even the most temperate and moderate reformation even the merest halfway attempt towards liberty and the amelioration of the condition of the human species is sufficient to set his gall afloat and provoke him to glut his appetite for blood look at the history of the attempted revolution in poland were there any appearances of jacobinism there did they set up for that liberty and equality which has been so misrepresented no if they had they would have triumphed and pitt and the despots of europe would have been disappointed but they were too moderate in their views to warm the souls of the great body of the people too little careful of the rights of the mass of mankind to awake the glowing enthusiasm which liberty and equality inspires they could not unite in one effort the congregated energies of the nation but the congregated despots and cabinets of europe were united against them for their destruction hard british gold was sent over to the despot of prussia in subsidies what use did he openly make of it did he assist the alliance against france no did he not in the most barefaced manner apply that money to the destruction of poland and did not pitt still continue to send the money of this country to that despot even after he saw the use that he made of it and was he not thereby enabled to hold out against the vigorous exertion of the poles till the hyæna of the north was ready to pour her barbarians upon them and to repeat the massacres of ismael in the streets of warsaw yes this tiger in human shape this royal savage is one of the allies with whom our virtuous administration thinks a free people ought to coalesce for the destruction of republicanism in france and for the restoration of the despotism of the capets and the contemptible superstition of his holiness the pope but it may be said he was deceived he was so busy with his calculations with his arithmetical plans and schemes that he could not attend to what was doing upon such a spot of the continent as poland that he knew nothing of the exertions made by those brave people and but little of the attempts made by the tyrants of europe against them but no—he has abjured all such excuses with that matchless effrontery which nothing but a william pitt backed by henry dundas could possibly assume he steps    forward and tells you that even if he could have foreseen the manner in which the subsidy paid to the king of prussia would have been applied he certainly would have paid it here then is a direct avowal of his guilt—i wish not for punishments i wish for redress but if other persons not as philosophical in their feelings as i wish to be should ever take it in their heads to redress the wrongs of europe by coertion let him take care when the principal goes to rack i fear he will find but little security from his plausible harrangues nor will it be easy perhaps for men of honest and ardent hearts that wish to keep the cause of liberty unstained by wanton vengeance to preserve such a culprit from the gripe of a severe retaliation citizens i shall dwell no longer upon the subject this evening i have already extended this lecture to an unusual length i shall therefore adjourn till friday evening leaving you for the present with this invocation think i conjure you—deeply think of all the facts that can be collected relative to this subject it is a subject in which your own happiness is involved in which is also involved the happiness of your posterity the children yet unborn may bless your patriotic activity or reprobate your selfish sluggishness in proportion as you exert yourselves to redress the grievances under which the nation groans and when i invoke you to redress those grievances i do not invoke you to deeds of cruelty and violence i invoke you to the energies of the mind i invoke you to trace to the very source the causes of your calamitics i am convinced you will find almost all those calamities to result from the total want of a representation of the people in parliament i am convinced that you will find that the corruption the rottenness the prosligacy which have crept into your administrations in consequence of the want of this representation is the genuine source of your calamities and that there is no redress for a nation situated as we are to repeat those treasonable words which were to have brought the axe of the executioner upon this neck there is no redress for a nation situated as we are but from a fair full and free representation of the people in the commons house of parliament    on commerce from the peripatetic   commerce thou doubtful and thou partial good   tis true by thee we swell to wealth and power   and britains name and britains arts by thee   are wafted to each region of the globe

half the year perhaps to idle want   perhaps in age to learn a new employ    the tribune no xvii the second lecture on the causes of the present dearness and scarcity of provisions delivered friday may  st      many of the occasional reflections in this lecture will not be understood if the reader is not reminded that a known agent of the treasury planted himself in a very conspicuous situation this evening and made several attempts to interrupt the lecturer citizens in my lecture of wednesday evening i began with observing the vast and evident disproportion between the increase of the price of provisions and the prices of labour i proved to you from hume or rather from a writer quoted by hume as an authority that about   0 years ago when the common price of labour throughout the country was eightpence per day that many of the articles of consumption were cheaper in a degree of twentytwo to one than they are at this period i afterwards proceeded to shew you that in all probability a considerable degree of difference had taken place between the proportionate price of the luxuries of life and the mere necessaries and that therefore perhaps some deduction ought to be made from this calculation but i believe i gave you data sufficient to authorize me in the conclusion that after all allowances of this kind it was but a very moderate calculation indeed to suppose that in order to have kept any pace between the increase of the price of labour and the increase of the necessary articles of consumption that is to say to make the condition of the laborious part of the community precisely the same as it was   0 years ago that the wages paid for labour ought to be considering what the prices of provisions now are between five and six shillings per day i endeavoured to show you that it was not my intention absolutely to point out that such ought to be the wages at this time but to show you this fact—that either very great injustice has been done to the common people with respect to the prices paid for their labour or else a very extravagant augmentation  0 has taken place upon the necessary articles of life inconsistent with the quantum of specie in circulation i might have pushed this subject a little further and when i was enquiring what ought to have been the prices of labour in order to make the comforts and conveniences of the lower orders of society the same as they were were   0 years ago i might perhaps with very great propriety have enquired whether the condition of the lower orders of society ought not at this period to be considerably better than it was at that time for if it is admitted society has been in a rapid state of progress if it is true that knowledge has extended to a very considerable degree that the mechanical arts have been brought to much greater perfection that all the different employments to which men are devoted are now performed comparatively with much greater facility that is to say a greater quantum of production may be effected with the same labour and in the same time—if all these circumstances are true it would be perhaps a fair object of enquiry whether that class of society to whose industry and exertions we are to attribute this improvement ought not at least to have had some share in the advantages resulting from it and instead of living in a worse situation than at that time whether they ought not to be enabled to live in a situation much more comfortable than they then did for i cannot see what sort of justice there is in the great body of the people labouring eternally if the whole advantage is to be monopolized by a few idle drones placemen and pensioners some of whom if i were so inclined i could point out in this assembly i cannot perceive the justice or propriety of the great body of the people labouring and exerting themselves to increase the accommodations of society if the whole benefit is to be seized by a few aristocratic oppressors who are sending their spies and emissaries into every corner to catch up every word that may drop from a friend of liberty—let me observe however that i am glad they do send such persons here because they may chance to hear some truths that will incline them to be active and useful converts especially if the audience treat such persons with the candour they are entitled to for men ought not to be censured on account of the situation in which they are placed they have frequently been the choice of unexperienced youth frequently the choice of their parents and frequently have been adopted from accidents in life over which they could have no command i do not therefore make this observation to stimulate ungentle    feelings in your hearts those persons who frequently attend these lectures will bear witness that i have always been anxious to prevent any intemperance even towards the emissaries of those who have absolutely entered into conspiracies first to knock out my brains by hired bludgeonmen afterwards to kidnap and send me perhaps as lady grange was sent into the distant solitary islands of scotland and lastly to carve me alive into four quarters and stick my head upon a pole pursuing citizens the chain of reasoning from which i have been led into this digression by the illiberal interuptions of this man i say that perhaps i might have been entitled to argue that while the nobleman rides in a carriage twice as superb while he lives in an apartment twice as splendid and convenient the poor peasant has a right to expect that he should live in a cottage twice as commodious and wear twice as comfortable a cloathing for himself and family treasury runner interrupting—and so he has i shall show the honourable gentleman who has made that reply whether it is so or not by and by i will state not assertions but facts if gentlemen will make observations it must spring from their ignorance—however ignorance is no improper qualification for a tool of government i will state the facts i will tell that gentleman that i have read history and that from the facts contained in the records of times past and known state of the industrious orders of society it can be proved that their situation is three times as miserable instead of being twice as comfortable as it was i shall not however occupy your time by replying to the significant nods and monosyllables of one individual it is my business to investigate this subject and i shall investigate it upon general principles in defiance of all the idle vermin in office which our pockets are so incessantly picked to maintain i was going to add that i might have argued that if the liveries of a prince are to be increased from fifty to one hundred guineas per suit that the poor ought to have the opportunity of putting upon the legs and feet of their children twice as good stockings and shoes as they did before citizens i next examined the rise of provisions and the increase of the prices of labour within the last twenty or twentyfive years and as these are facts of which a larger proportion of those who heard me could judge i think it a little curious    that an individual who has apparently lived thirty or forty years in the world should attempt to contradict the conclusion from them—for as every article of provision has more than considerably doubled in its price and as the wages of labouring men have not increased one fourth part i should like very much to know from some curious calculator from some of the scholars into whom mr pitt has flogged his arithmetic how with so small an increase of wages at the time when so great an increase has taken place in the price of the necessaries of life a man can get twice the comfort and accommodation now for fourteen or fifteen pence that he used to get for a shilling before but citizens when i am speaking of the increase such as it is of the prices of labour i ought to animadvert upon the special care which the laws of this country from a laudable desire to preserve the peace and harmony of society have taken to place the lower orders entirely in a state of dependance upon those who employ them the consequence of which is that when any general national hardship takes place by means of which the prices of the articles of life are always increased but by means of which at the same time a quantum of labour becomes less the master takes a convenient and snug opportunity to scotch as they call it the wages of the journeymen many of you i dare say have read and i hope such of you as have not will take an opportunity of reading the excellent pamphlet of citizen frend for which that admirable advocate for the cause of liberty was so scandalously expelled the university of which he was so illustrious a member you will remember that in that pamphlet he takes notice of a very affecting circumstance of this kind just after the war had been declared citizen frend for i believe he will be better pleased to be called citizen than reverend and mr happened to follow some poor women who had been to a markettown to take home their work and who as they walked along rung in the ears of each other the doleful and angry complaint we are scotched  d in a shilling on account of this war—i repeat not the words but the substance—o says frend that the voice of truth and humanity might penetrate the walls of cabinets and that i might resound in the ears of ministers and princes—the labouring poor are scotched  d in a shilling to maintain your ambitious projects and destructive wars without common sense common virtue or principle of justice    citizens i have had some opportunities also of observing the dependent situation of these lower orders of society some years ago before my mind had taken that strong bias in favour of political pursuits to which it is now attached going into the native country of my parents i took the opportunity—being generally desirous to see as much as i could and not like those poor wretches condemned to the ignorant confines of the office of a secretary of state to know no difference between truth and falsehood right and wrong but what was taught me by the lying documents of spies and their employers which it is the duty of those poor ignorant beings to copy—my employment not being of that description i took the opportunity of seeing as far as i could the condition of those orders of society about whose happiness in the country i had heard so many romantic stories while i was an inhabitant of the town and took my ideas of rural felicity from novels and pastorals i beheld there poor women doubled with age toiling from morning to night over their wheels spinning their flax and hemp and i found that their condition was so miserable that many of them were positively obliged to take their work once or twice a day home to the persons who employed them in order to get the scanty pittance that was to purchase the meal by which they were to sustain their emaciated frames vide peripatetic vol i p     i was astonished i own at this picture of misery i had read a good deal in poems and romances about rural felicity i did not know that rural felicity consisted in sitting over a wheel till one is double and getting neither comforts nor conveniencies—no nor the necessaries of life to sustain and prop ones declining years by this eternal drudgery this made i own a deep impression on my mind which though it did not operate immediately stimulated me to a train of enquiry which could not fail of its ultimate effect—i had hitherto been a high government man a supporter of prerogatives and an advocate for venerating the powers that be—o that some way could but be invented to keep mankind all but the chosen few in utter ignorance then might placemen pensioners and the usurping proprietors of rotten boroughs enjoy indeed a golden age and the swinish multitude driven as their swineherds list and slaughtered at their will should grunt forth sedition no more—but it will not be enquiry will some how or other be awakened and when it is awakened the mists of delusion melt before the    rising sun of truth and the midnight hags of despotism bind us in their spells no more i soon found myself compelled to acknowledge that where such was the condition of so large a portion of society all could not be right—that there was something rotten in the state of denmark and every fact which in the progress of investigation came under my observation tended to confirm the opinion among other abuses i soon found that one of the causes of this calamitous situation was the unfeeling manner in which these poor beings were left to the arbitrary discretion of their employers who took the liberty when these poor creatures took home their work to scotch them as they thought fit so that under various pretences for every pound that was spun by the poor individual she never got paid for above three quarters when it came to be estimated by the masters and employers so much was to be considered as waste so many deductions were to be made and the poor individuals where they are not numerous enough to associate have no appeal—none at least that they have any hopes from for you know but little of justices of the peace if you believe a country magistrate will listen to the complaints of a poor friendless being against the tradesman who has arrived at opulence by his oppression thus then we find if we regard the facts which history furnishes that the inevitable consequence must be from the increased price of the articles consumed and the want of a proportionate increase in the wages paid to the industrious poor that within twentyfive years the condition of the latter has been so reduced that they cannot obtain half the necessaries of life they formerly used to obtain while their opulent oppressors the placemen pensioners and contractors of the day enjoy more than twice the luxuries and extravagance with which they formerly debated their nature i have stated to you also that oats and barley which in many parts of the country be it remembered are used as substitutes for wheat have still more extravagantly increased and that oats in particular have increased    per cent since the year    0 perhaps the honourable clerks of the treasury will not be inclined to contradict this they will have had some opportunity of knowing the truth of it—but citizens since i met you before i have had an opportunity of getting possession of some other facts relative to this very important part of the    question i find from a person who has been many years in a very considerable way of dealing in those articles that twentyseven or twentyeight years ago the common price of oats in the retail market was from  s to  0s  d per quarter that till within these twelve years   s was the common price and that they were never higher than   s—but now what is the price of them thirtyfive shillings an increase nearly fourfold in so small a distance of time as that which i have stated to you now remember what a very important article of consumption these are for the labouring poor in certain parts of the country remember that throughout the whole of the country parts of scotland wheat is a luxury which the poor man never tastes that oats that barley field peas and other pulse of this description constitute the whole sustenance of large proportions of the people there and i could instance a poor being of the name of crawford who emigrated to america on account of his miserable situation and who has now merely from the profits of his own manual labour been able to take a little farm of his own and to become a master farmer in his turn but whose sole sustenance for himself and family while he resided in scotland was one meal a day of meagre potatoes and that in the horrors and excesses of their hunger they gnawed the peelings and fragments for their supper having no other sort of sustenance whatever to keep themselves from absolute starvation now citizens in parts of the country where this was the case consider what must be the monstrous accumulation of their grievances and the miserable situation of the poor when such an accumulation has taken place upon the price of that article in particular oats which constitutes the most strong the most wholesome and the most important part of their subsistence so much for the increased comfort the double accommodation the twice as good apartments and the twice as good raiment and food which the common people in scotland maintain at this time such being a small very small part indeed of those monstrous facts which show the blessings of a system of rotten boroughs and the corruptions of faction i think myself called upon as a good citizen that distinction beyond all others which men ought to be most emulous to deserve to stand forward and investigate as far as i am able the causes of the mischief under which the people groan yes groan i say    for many a poor meagre emaciated depressed and heartbroken wretch in this country pays with groans and slavery for the pampered luxury of those who because they wallow in the wealth of which they have plundered the nation think they have a right to stop the mouths of the poor and the advocates of the poor with the gag of persecution and if they cannot effect that think it right to employ their pimps and perjurers oldbailey solicitors and the sweepings of the stews to disturb their investigations misrepresent their sentiments and deprive them of their lives citizens there is another reason why i am desirons of investigating this subject and it is this—that the investigation of such subjects has a tendency to prevent tumult insurrection and confusion how desirous some men who call themselves friends of government and the constitution are to excite such tumults we may learn from this fact—that whenever they believe a number of persons are assembled to enter into peaceable enquiry they send some one or other of their agents to prevent that enquiry and disturb the peace thus the very night that i had the honor to be arrested in this place upon the ridiculous trumpdup charge of high treason mr walsh the treasury spy absolutely told me that he took to the meeting at the kings arms tavern the great overgrown athletic irishman that created the riot and confusion there and gave the lordmayor a pretence for preventing in future the meetings of that peaceable assembly citizens citizens we know and our enemies know—and their conduct shews that they know it—that if men will enquire with impartiality and temper into the causes of these calamities they will have no occasion for turbulence they will find that the individuals against whom they are inclined to direct their fury are generally as innocent and oppressed as themselves and that it is not the miller against whose machine they direct their fury—it is not the butcher whose commodity they seize—it is not the baker whose shop they break open and rifle—that these are not the men who are the causes of the calamities under which they groan that the real causes are of much too weighty a nature to be removed by turbulence they are so serious so fortified so deeply rooted that they can only be removed by the unanimous spirit of enquiry diffusing itself through the country and awakening to unanimous effort by a spirited firm and determined but at the same time peaceable disposition to represent their grievances to each other in the first instance and then with    one congregated voice to that government which however it may pretend to make it high treason to overawe any branch of it will never fail to respect and reverence as it ought the sentiments and opinions of the people whenever in a firm and unanimous manner they are thundered in their ears it was from this conviction that i undertook the present enquiry and you will remember that on the last evening i traced some of the causes of the evil i endeavoured to shew you that the evil resulted from impolitic regulations and excessive exactions i endeavoured to shew you in part what i conceived to be the bearing of this question upon the subject of the present war and i traced among other circumstances the great increase of burthens which lays upon many commodities the increased expence of those transactions in which they must necessarily be engaged before they can bring their commodities to market and i shewed you that these were in many cases increased threefold from the drawing off of so large a number of sailors and useful labourers for the war from the superior vigour and activity of the marine of the french republic which while it has left to england the empty honour of gaining victories in general engagements and boasting of the barren sovereignty of the ocean has never failed to sweep our commerce into republican ports which it was the duty of the admistration of this country if they had understood their duty to have protected i noticed also as another cause the embargo which has been laid upon all and still continues upon a large portion of our most essential merchandise it is true from one or two articles it has been taken off but the evil was done and the effects continue to be felt i stated that the tillage of both sides the rhine from which we used to be supplied with various sorts of grain c had been neglected and destroyed—that this evil had been aggravated by the prohibition of exportation from the country of our good ally of prussia and also the very considerable mischief which had resulted to this country from the large exportations that have been made of all the necessary articles of consumption to the armies on the continent which on account of the calamitous and disgraceful circumstances in common with other machinations of our blessed and immaculate minister have been sent three times before they reached the army for which they were intended having fallen into the hands of the enemy or been destroyed sunk in the waters or consumed in flames to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy    and i noticed a particular circumstance of a whole mile and an half of hay stacks in the neighbourhood of rotterdam being set on fire in order to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy now citizens those persons who have been used to hear the arithmetic of pitt will not i suppose readily agree with the conclusion i shall draw from these facts namely that it would have been better for this country that this hay and these provisions should have fallen into the hands of the enemy than that they should have been thus destroyed i mean in general citizens to draw my arguments in this tribune not from partial interest and political expediences but from broad and universal principles to consider universal justice and humanity the deep root and solid trunk from which my arguments are to sprout and my conclusions grow and to teach you that these and these alone are the proper objects of your veneration but when i speak of the measures and maxims of ministers it is impossible to talk of general principles of philanthropy and humanity they have abjured all principle both by word and deed it is a sort of watchword of alarm which they never use but to couple it with the indefinable stigma of jacobinism when they want to hunt the persecuted patriot to botany bay or the scaffold i must meet them therefore upon the ground of expediency and it is the fate of these muddyheaded oppressors that chuse what ground they will they must be beaten you will please then to remember that every considerable destruction of the necessaries of life has a tendency to produce not only a scarcity in the individual country in which the devastation is committed but mediately in the general stock of the universe—that is to say in the aggregate stock of the whole of the productive countries from whence these resources spring all the world suffers in some degree in point of real wealth the wealth that consists in the quantum of real necessaries and comforts and to a very considerable degree when the devastation is so monstrous as that which has been committed by this foolish revengeful malicious disposition—the system of mad havock and extermination upon which the present war is conducted now let us attend a little while to a consideration of what is the fair and honest system of commerce not such a system of commerce as placemen and pensioners are desirous of promoting remember that the fair system of commerce is this—that whatever one country produces more than necessary for the    consumption of that country it sends to another country that is in want of that article in order that it may bring back some other article of necessity or luxury of which it stands in need this is the fair the just and rational system of commerce and with respect to articles of the first necessity this is the system upon which commerce must inevitably be conducted suppose then as is the fact that the whole produce of those parts of the world that have any commercial intercourse together taking all the different articles is pretty nearly in proportion to the whole of the necessities and consumption of all those countries this i say is nearly the fact and must be so for i take it for granted that man does not toil for the mere pleasure of toiling he toils to produce as much as he can find a good market for and is never disposed to produce more than he can consume himself and turn to his advantage by disposing of it to others it will therefore follow that the quantity requisite to supply the demands of the civilized world will bear a pretty general proportion to the quantity actually produced when the whole of that produce comes as by means of commerce it cannot fail in effect to come to a general market now the system of commerce being thus a general mart for the universe it follows of course that with respect to my argument it matters not whether these productive countries having intercourse together be three or three thousand i will take therefore the smallest number for the sake of simplicity and convenience i will suppose that two countries are at war together and that there is a third country which is in possession of abundance of necessary articles grain for example which it is the nature of war to render scarce and of which in consequence the other two hostile countries will be in a considerable degree of want now what will this third country do you may make as many treaties as you choose to bind the merchants and government of the pacific nation for treaties are not even packthread—they are nothing but rotten paper or parchment at best more feeble than falstaffs men in buckram which he knocked down by the half dozen at a time they stand for nothing at all when the parties have the power of breaking them—if you wish for a comment upon this text i refer you to the works of the present king of prussia well citizens the country that has corn to spare will send it to the best market and if there are two markets in want of the commodity  0 will find its interest and will follow its interest in sending part of its surplus to one and part to the other suppose england then that england were at this time the only country that felt this scarcity the whole superfluity of other countries would of course find its best market here or if the scarcity be greater here than in france the consequence must be that those who have would bring it to the english market because there it would fetch the best price but suppose you have produced a scarcity and famine in both countries reflect only for one moment what must be the consequence will the country that has abundance of corn bring the whole of it into the english market by which means the price would be smaller than if they had sent only half of that commodity to england and the remainder to the market of france now i ask you citizens if this is not a clear and plain demonstration that the common scarcity produced by the profligate and abandoned system of burning drowning and destroying the articles of human sustenance is an aggravation instead of a mitigation of your misfortunes and that you are in reality by these means in a worse situation than if the provisions destroyed had fallen into the hands of the enemy mr pitt and his coadjutors would have sophistry enough i make no doubt to answer all this in their own way and to carry the question against me in the house of commons but i put it to you as plain men understanding a plain question—men whose calculations are not merely confined to multiplication and substraction—understanding also that there is such a thing as political as well as numerical arithmetic—calculations of the desires wants and propensities of men as well as treaties compacts plans and cabinet projections—taking these things into consideration of which pitt i believe is as ignorant as the hobby horse that he rode upon when a boy at school—i ask you whether in defiance of all the treaties you can make if you produce a general scarcity you do not produce a much worse effect upon your own population and country than if you had produced that scarcity in your own country only and suffer that produce which you so ridiculously destroy to fall into the hands of the enemy thus you see that the generous humane and benevolent system of policy is the best policy at last for the country that adopts it as well as for others to whom it may be extended    citizens there is another circumstance of a very curious nature and almost as disgraceful as it is curious which it is necessary for me to dwell upon but disgraceful circumstances will never put the present administration to the blush and so i need not have any tenderness for them on the occasion i mean the conduct of the cabinet of this country with respect to neutral vessels there was a time when britons had an open manly and courageous spirit there was a time when britons had a sense of honor and a feeling of benevolence when they would have disdained to set the example of violating all the admitted laws of neutrality between nation and nation there was a time when the people of this country knew that neutral vessels were sacred whatever war might exist between two contending countries but this citizens was a time when britons disdained all weapons but those of open and manly exertion this was a time when the detestable policy was not understood nor could ever have been suggested of attempting to starve twentyfour millions of brave and virtuous men because they were struggling for their emancipation from unheard of despotism yes citizens there was a time when this country upon the very eve of a war with france freely permitted to go to that country large quantities and supplies of corn because it was known that the rival country was in want of such assistance i believe it is well authenticated that george the second for george the second was a gentleman—i say it is well authenticated there was a time when george the second actually engaged in a war with france yet suffered a supply of wheat to be sent into that country to prevent the people from perishing with famine this was glorious and magnificent conduct worthy of a briton and if i had any nationality about me it would prompt me to regret that the man who did this act was not born in the country which gave me birth there was also a time when the laws of nations were respected—there was also a time when the brave and hardy briton met his enemy face to face in the field—i mean not to stand up here as a panegyrist of slaughter i hate massacre and murder however disguised yet comparing the two periods and the two lines of conduct i cannot but admire the man who prefers to stand openly forward in the field of combat to the man who wishes by artificial famine to rid the world of enemies he dare not meet because he knows his    degeneracy of mind has sunk him below the gigantic powers of those who are struggling for freedom and justice there is a chance that the man who meets his enemy openly in the field supposes he is right detestable as the acts of murder must always be by which such enmity must be supported but the wretch who attempts to starve to poison or assassinate who hires perjured spies and tumultuous assassins to breed confusion in a neighbouring country that he may charge that confusion upon those whom he has basely and insolently injured such a man by his detestable arts and sneaking tricks proves that he knows himself to be a juggler and that his cause is as rotten as his heart is hollow well citizens while the generous spirit of freedom still remained britain respected the laws of nations and neutral vessels went free what has been the conduct during the present war i shall not recapitulate the circumstances which i stated the other evening relative to dragooning one nation and another into this mad war with the french republic i shall confine myself to the capture of the vessels of those nations which in defiance of the juggling and bullying cabinet of this country have continued their neutrality and here even the treasury runners will not have the face to contradict me they know the facts they are a little more in their way there can be no doubt when a man begs pardon whether he has committed the offence and pitt it is notorious has done so more than once he seized every neutral vessel and brought them into the ports of this country—what has been the consequence whether by mismanagement or what not even the corn seized in the first instance proved good for little upon the hands of the seizers but the neutral countries began to see this juggling and they began to juggle in return they put all their rotten corn on board proper vessels and threw them in the way of the ships of england that they might be seized knowing very well what sort of shallowpated bullies they had to deal with and that sooner or later they should have full indemnity for them well the ships were captured in due time and what did they do with them why they sent this blessed harvest which they had thus reaped by their system of piracy into the granaries and storehouses in this place and that place and the other place and you may know some of it by the smell if you go along bank side in the borough at this time but do not mistake it for dunghills or night carts i pray you it    is the corn your governors intended you should eat for they sent all the good corn out of the country as fast as they could to supply their good allies and behold when they came to open their magazines having been obliged already to pay down a good price for the commodity and make sneaking apologies as bullies usually do to the neutral nations they had insulted they found precious stocks of stuff the greatest part of which was obliged to be sold to the real swinish multitude not to the two legged swine but the real swinish multitude who run on all fours many of whom even had the seditious and treasonable presumption to toss up their snouts and refuse the ministerial banquet that was offered to them citizens the evil consequences of this war and the system upon which it has been conducted have not stopped here we must take into consideration the injury which has been done to our own agriculture at home the loss of those hands by which the agriculture ought to have been promoted by distress and misery by emigration to america by manning our armies and by the laudable and excellent science of kidnapping the individual whose plough should have furrowed the earth and produced the smile of plenty has been sent with his sword to gore the breasts of the friends of the human race and spread devastation and misery throughout europe if this has not produced an absolute decline of the cultivation of our farms it has at least operated to prevent the improvement and continued increase of production which the improved state of society would otherwise have insured we are to recollect that when war sounds his soulchilling trumpet when the shrill blast of revenge and carnage is sounding from one end of a country to another all other concerns stagnate commerce droops the arts expire science languishes and agricultural improvement is no more and they must be miserably ignorant indeed of the condition and state of this country who do not know that there is room enough for improvement with respect to agriculture among us i shall give you upon this head the best sort of authority to argue from upon such an occasion aristocratic authority i find by the report of the committee appointed by the board of agriculture to take into consideration the state of waste lands and common fields in this kingdom that the whole soil of britain is supposed to consist of about        0 acres now let us consider what is the quantity of this that is cultivated and what the quantity that is waste    we are informed that the waste lands in this kingdom amount to         acres we are informed that the waste lands in wales amount to      0  acres and we find that the waste lands in scotland amount to          acres the whole together amounting to    0 00  acres uncultivated while the whole cultivated land is only          acres so that there is almost half of this happy this glorious this wisely governed and flourishing country lies waste and uncultivated under the influence and auspices of so blessed a constitution and so blessed an administration as we have the happiness to boast almost one half of one of the finest countries in the world lying positively uncultivated and producing no one advantage hardly to man or beast these are facts i state not from the visionary conceptions of my own brain not from the ravings of democrats not from the insidious inventions of jacobins but from the agents of government themselves from committees appointed by their own board of agriculture let us consider then in the language of their own report what a difference would it make in the state and prosperity of this island were only one half of these extensive wastes to wave with luxuriant crops of grain—be covered with innumerable herds and flocks or cloathed with stately timber it has been objected that a large part of this waste land could not be cultivated this objection also the committee of the board of agriculture has been kind enough to remove for it states that the lands incapable of all improvement are only one million of acres that the lands fit to be planted are three millions of acres that the lands fit for arable and pasture are fourteen millions lands fit for tillage three millions and lands capable of being converted into meadow or water meadow one million so that we have eighteen millions of acres in this country now uncultivated which are capable of being applied to the most important uses those uses directly connected with the subsistence and comfort of the inhabitants—we have three millions fit for timber and which therefore would be useful in a secondary degree to the maintenance of the life and comfort of man and only one million absolutely sterile and even this one million might perhaps be covered with flocks of goats which though they yield no fleece to increase the commerce of the country yet afford a wholesome food by their milk and their flesh while young which would be better than for so many inhabitants of the country    to be in want of all wholesome and necessary comfort as they are at this time now citizens we are told from this same author that those lands might annually produce as much provisions as would be worth    00000 pounds per year and that they would produce wood for building firing c and other uses as much as would be worth several millions more consider then for a minute what blessings a wise and peaceful administration of this country might have secured by applying our resources to improvement and cultivation and reflect what curses they have procured by the mad havock and confusion into which they have plunged us and the rest of europe let us consider citizens how many deserts might have been made to smile in fertility by a proper application of our resources for though it has been said and i am much inclined to agree with it that the inclosures which have taken place in this country have been a great calamity yet i am sure of this that inclosure upon a fair and honest principle might be productive of the greatest advantages for you are to remember that in consequence of inclosure you may have a greater height of cultivation you may have a greater quantity of cattle and other necessaries of life produced that your wool is less injured and of a superior quality and therefore more advantageous to the producer and better for the consumer but inclosures ought not to be conducted upon the principle that has been usual among us the rich man ought not to have an act of parliament to rob the poor freeholder of his estate i say the poor freeholder for i challenge the greatest casuist of the law to produce me a better title by which the first nobleman in the land holds his estate than i will produce in favour of the estate which the poor man has in that right of commonage which may have been bequeathed or made over to him by the nobles and great landed proprietors of former generations citizens our nobles had once some nobility i wish not to recall to your admiration the ages of feudal barbarism but i wish not to have the chains of feudal barbarism without any of the advantages of feudal munificence i remember from the pages i have turned over accounts of the manner in which our great nobility enjoyed their revenues in former times the hundreds and thousands of individuals supported by their bounty their open halls of hospitality the recreations sports and pastimes with which they enlivened the    people at particular periods the bounty which they displayed towards them but in these times they had not learned to consider it as their best grandeur to loll themselves into apoplectick diseases in a stupid gilded coach they thought on the contrary that the splendour and greatness of their nobility and fortune was best displayed by having their tenants around them enjoying the comforts and relaxations of life about them at their expence however in other circumstances they might be inclined to oppress those individuals they had some degree of liberality at least in their conduct towards them in these respects among the most conspicuous of them in point of this endowment was john of gaunt duke of lancaster for dukes even royal dukes were not always made of such stuff as they are made of in the present day among the foremost of those dukes whose liberality kept some pace with their possessions was john of gaunt duke of lancaster who bequeathed a great quantity of land to the poor inhabitants in particular situations to be held by them and all future inhabitants of such districts for ever now i should like to know of those gentlemen who cry out about republicans and levellers of property and all this stuff and nonsense which originated in their own distempered brains i would ask which of them holds their estates upon a better tenure but the greatest plunderer and oppressor always cries stop thief first because he is desirous of creating that confusion which will prevent his own villainous practices from being detected what then is the system upon which inclosures are now carried on and what ought it to be with respect to agriculture two objects ought always to be kept in view namely to produce the largest quantity of the necessaries of life that the country can produce and to promote the most equal distribution of those articles of comfort which can peaceably and justly be effected this is my system of equality and justice this is my idea of the first and genuine principles of just government with respect to agriculture—to produce the largest quantity of the necessaries of life and to promote the most equal distribution of those articles a little observation will shew us that the last of these the most important has never been attended to at all and that the first has been attended to in a very imperfect manner witness the waste lands i have just stated to you    citizens the fact is that there is a third object which though it ought to be no object at all is the only object with governments in general namely revenue because without revenue that is to say without taxation the expences and extravagances of ministers and their favourites cannot be supported pimps and parasites cannot swell to power and grandeur numerous trains of spies informers and assassins cannot be supported and in short the whole system of that grandeur luxury extravagance and folly which constitute what ministers call the grandeur and prosperity of the nation must tumble into ruin if this revenue were not to be kept in the most flourishing and prosperous condition in order to support this revenue it has been necessary to oppress in a great degree the agriculture of the country for as soame jenyns who though an aristocrat could sometimes find out the truth observed the commerce of this country may be considered as a hog—you see he thought the rich merchants the swinish multitude—the commerce of this country may be considered as a hog if you touch but one bristle upon its back it immediately begins to make such a grunting that it throws the whole sty into confusion and the country is distracted with its clamour while agriculture like a poor sheep is led up silently every year to yield its fleeces to the shearer without uttering an individual murmur now citizens such being the pacific disposition of agriculture or the individuals who are employed in agriculture and such being the turbulent disposition of our rich aristocratic merchants it is easy to see that ministers will have as large a portion as they can out of the labour and sweat of the industrious poor but let us now consider how inclosures are at present carried on a bill is brought into parliament that virtuous and immaculate assembly concerning which i always want words to speak with becoming reverence—a bill is brought into parliament by a rich proprietor who has got a large estate by the side of a common and thinks that common would be a very good addition to this estate and is therefore desirous that this common should be inclosed for his benefit and advantage well what is the mode of proceeding a time is appointed and sometimes no time at all for you will remember that some years ago a mr william tooke had an estate in the nighbourhood of a brother of the lord chief justice de grey which chief justice was a very useful    friend to lord north and this relation of the chief justice had a mind to inclose mr wm tookes estate for his benefit and advantage a bill was brought into parliament it was introduced read and reread on the same day and committed to be read the third day and passed the day following how was this prevented why john horne who has since taken the name of tooke and who has done many gloriously audacious things in the cause of liberty and who notwithstanding the assassinlike attack that has been made upon his aged life by the reevites and pittites of the day during the last summer by keeping him shut up in a close unwholesome room i hope he will live to do many more gloriously audacious things in the same cause—this john horne tooke wrote a libel upon the speaker of the house of commons and i have heard him say that it was certainly the most audacious libel that ever was penned he got it immediately inserted in the newspaper this libel kicked up as he expected a monstrous riot in st stephens chapel—for that is sometimes—or at least it used to be—not the present house of commons to be sure—i speak only of former houses of commons about which it is no treason to speak ones mind freely these however have been formerly the most riotous and sometimes the most blackguard assemblies in the nation the present parliament is undoubtedly very much reformed but i hope the next will be reformed still more the speaker in a very great fury took the chair and immediately declared he would not sit there and have the dignity of the house attacked through his sides in this way a warm debate was produced and the attention of the public was called towards the subject they attempted but were not wise enough to know how to do it to punish the author of the libel but they never dared to bring in the bill a third time and the relation of the great and upright and immaculate lord chief justice who was the great and powerful friend of the great and powerful lord north never had his bill brought in again and was glad to make his peace in a fair and honourable manner with the said mr wm tooke whose estate he had attempted to inclose as his own in the usual course however a bill is brought in and petitions may be presented and which when they are supported some little compensation to be sure is generally made to the lower orders of society but suppose it happens as it does frequently happen and must frequently happen    that those poor individuals have no friend even to put it into their minds that they have the power of doing such a thing and the great are not very anxious that the poor about them should be very well informed as to their political rights no they are to be fleeced as bare as can be and their very bones are to be picked after they are fleeced by the rich man who having committed a highway robbery upon their little properties talks of the security of property and enters into associations with reeves and his cabalistical informers to prevent republicans and levellers from enquiring into the right by which these robberies have been committed but citizens it is very evident that a tenth part of that expence which has been devoted in this mad and ridiculous war and in supporting the places pensions and emoluments of the corrupt set who have produced the war—a tenth part of this revenue would have cultivated or made considerable advances towards cultivating all the waste lands throughout the country for the benefit and advantage of the common people—not a bare common with here a blade of grass and there a blade of grass and here a dangling briar and there a copse to destroy their little flocks no they may turn them into a plentiful luxuriant smiling country from which they might reap a part of their subsistence and not be compelled to toil from their bed to their table and from their table to their beds and thus from day to day in one constant succession of labour as if the great mass of mankind were only born to breed slaves for the higher orders of society and to toil and sweat and die without comfort and accommodation go even into the neighbourhood of this metropolis where manure is abundant where the means of cultivation are easy—go which way you will turn to the east the west the north or south—see what tracks of land lay bare and desolate which with a little of the care of government if they had time to bestow it upon such insignificant subjects might procure a comfortable subsistence for innumerable families whose little cottages rising here and there with a little assistance might turn this waste into a blooming eden and make this country as one of our poets has called it the exhaustless granary of the world but all our resources are swallowed up by this mad and ruinous war nothing can be thought of but the annihilation of freedom nothing can be thought of but spreading the name of a pitt over the continent and the empty boast of a shuffling individual and  0 his coadjutor dundas having given a constitution to a country who would neither accept of that constitution nor suffer either the one or the other of

the causes of the present dearness  scarcity of provisions delivered wednesday may  th      citizens this is the third time i have met you upon the subject of this nights lecture if i were to meet you again and again till i have gone through the whole of my subject i know not when this course of lectures could possibly close the further our researches extend the more we find to investigate this so true in sciences is perhaps more conspicuously true with respect to the sources of those great national calamities under which we are sinking i anticipated to you on the first night the very wide field of enquiry into which this topic would lead me i was not aware however of its full extent in short it would be totally impossible to do justice to the subject in a course of lectures that professes to be miscellaneous and i feel myself called upon from the pressure of temporary matter to bring it to a conclusion this evening in my mode of investigating it i have divided it into two general heads that is to say the immediate causes of aggravated scarcity and dearness and the general regulations which have unfortunately been adopted in this country by which the gradual increase has been occasioned for the sake of methodical arrangement it would have been proper perhaps to have begun with the latter circumstances however led me to a different arrangement particularly my having announced as a part of the subject a topic which necessarily connected itself with that branch of the enquiry at a time when i was not aware that i should deliver any more than one lecture upon the subject before me the greatest part then of what i had to say upon the causes of the temporary scarcity i have brought to a conclusion    in the former lecture i am now going to the immediate investigation of what may be considered as the permanent though growing causes of the dearness of provisions in this country and among those i shall consider paper credit the corn laws the monopoly of farms the encouragement of the breed of horses tythes the neglect of our fisheries and contracts and monopolies between fishermen and fishmongers from whence i shall digress once more to the affairs of poland and then lead you back to that which in fact is the fountain of all the other causes the monstrous growth of barefaced corruption in this country with respect to paper credit it may not at first view appear to be immediately connected with the subject but this opinion will vanish if you remember that it is an admitted principle making exceptions for accidents which may produce temporary scarcity and also for the contracts and monopolies between the holders of particular articles that the price of commodities must necessarily be regulated by the quantity of circulating medium—or in other words that gold and silver and all other arbitrary signs of property decrease and fluctuate in their value in proportion as they become more abundant but that the real articles of necessity always remain precisely the same the calculations and customary language of the world lead us indeed to a contrary conclusion but the fact is that it is gold that is purchased with commodity and not commodity with gold the gold being in reality nothing but the counters or the figures if i may so express myself by which the quantum of wealth is calculated whenever therefore the numeral or nominal wealth is more abundant than the production you must put down a greater quantity of these counters or the signs of these counters to tell how many sheep how many oxen or how much corn you are worth or able to buy you are to consider that paper credit thought it does not increase the specie but on the contrary may be proved to occasion its diminution yet increases the circulating medium that is to say that paper is taken to market particularly the wholesale market instead of specie and passing in common with the circulating specie increases the quantity of nominal wealth in circulation and of course occasions any given quantity of money to be worth so much the less thus then you will find that the circulation of paper begets an increase in the price of all the articles of consumption which the great mass of the people have occasion for it is so important that this    part of the subject should be understood that i would rather be guilty of tautology than be obscure i will state it therefore in another way as the price of the article which can be brought into the market must be proportionate to the quantity of circulating medium which can be carried into the market it follows of course that if i having  000l in specie can circulate my paper to the amount of  000l more and thus carry in effect  0000l into the market instead of  000l i produce an inevitable increase in the price of the articles to be consumed this with respect to the dealers in this paper coin is matter of no inconvenience it is a struggle of credit it enables them to carry on their commerce with greater facility and he whose word passes most current has the best of it but the common people the working man and the little shopkeeper have no part of the credit resulting from this circulating paper they must take it indeed sometimes in payment and they must abide by the loss of the exchange and the delay but their notes will not be accepted their accommodations between individual and individual will not pass current they are not permitted to swindle the public though the rich are but they must bear their part of the increased price of the necessaries of life in consequence of this swindling in which they have no share and yet citizens no sort of property is protected with so much jealousy as this fabricated circulating medium the laws of this country severe and sanguinary enough in many respects that relate to the treatment of the lower orders of society have thought it necessary to be still more rigid than usual with respect to this paper credit and consequently we find that forgery is among those crimes and offences which never escape the last sentence and punishment of the law why is this there must be some reason for it surely we cannot admit that forgery is a crime peculiarly marked with the blackest stains of turpitude—i stand not up as an advocate for crimes that violate property but i wish that a scale should be observed between the punishment and the turpitude of actions surely then i say we cannot suppose that there is more moral turpitude in the act of forgery than in many actions that are passed by with a much slighter degree of punishment the common feelings of mankind revolt at such a supposition and nothing but that commercial influence which of late years has contaminated our councils and our laws could have countenanced the unremitting    severity with which this crime has been pursued we find accordingly that where individuals have not been misled either by commercial connections or by particular attachments to the modes and practices of the times that a great disposition arises among mankind to condemn or blame this extreme severity nor could all the arguments of commercial expediency and the inviolable barrier of mercantile credit stifle the voice of public sympathy in the recent cases of peru and dodd a very ludicrous anecdote applicable to this subject was once related to me by an officer whose duty it is to attend one of the circuits a man had been indicted for forgery at the assizes and a jury of farmers and graziers was impannelled to try the offence the facts were proved beyond the possibility of contradiction but the honest farmers did not understand how it should happen that a man who committed a robbery without any sort of violence or injury to the peace of society should be punished in a manner so much more severe than many whose crimes were marked with deeper turpitude they therefore consulted among themselves and presently agreed that tho the thing to be sure were proven yet as for matter of that it was impossible to hang a man for a bit of paper if he had stole a sheep it would have been another thing but to hang a man for a bit of paper no they could never agree with that matter as they had just been trying a man who had killed another by an unlucky blow and which the judge instructed them to find only manslaughter they agreed to bring this in manslaughter also and manslaughter it was but however much at a loss reasoning like speculative moralists we might be to account why a superior degree of severity should be adopted for the preservation of this particular species of property practice will soon give us a clue nothing is so friendly to individual accumulation and monopoly this the legislators of the ancient world very well knew they knew that in proportion as you can compress property into a small compass a few will have an opportunity of ingrossing to themselves a larger proportion of the riches of the country and of keeping the other portions of society in misery and depression lycurgus therefore invented a species of coin which has been rendered famous through succeeding ages by the name of iron money so that if a man in sparta was worth twenty or thirty pounds he was obliged    to hire a waggon to remove it from place to place an expedient which could not fail of producing the desired effect of preserving a considerable degree of equality among the citizens a contrary object has been kept in view by modern legislators and of course a contrary practice has been appealed to it was found beneficial to the revenue it was found beneficial to corruption to luxury and to usurpation that property should come into the hands of as few individuals as possible and therefore methods have been devised to favour this monopoly the history of the progress of wealth or rather of the medium of wealth would be a very curious one if i had time to enter into it at large in the first instance undoubtedly all wealth must have consisted in what is now called kind—persons who have collected or who have paid tythe in kind will understand what i mean but this unwieldy sort of wealth would be very inconvenient upon the present system it would undoubtedly clog very much the wheels of what ministers call government—that is to say corruption this however you would not perhaps consider as a very grievous calamity and you might even be tempted to exclaim with pope   o that such bulky bribes as all might see   still as of old encumberd villainy   a statesmans slumbers how this speech would spoil   sir spain has sent a thousand jars of oil   huge bales of british cloth blockade the door   a hundred oxen at your levee roar   essay on use of riches   specie then was soon introduced but was found not sufficiently convenient for james i having ordered a large sum to be given to one of his favorites but happening by strange accident to have a minister who had a little honesty he took him into the room where the money was all spread out james was astonished at the formidable appearance of so many guineas and declared it was too much for any individual he ordered therefore that his favourite should be content with half nor is this the only kind of inconvenience which politicians have experienced from transactions in specie it has been found that guineas like roaring oxen can tell tales of    this i will satisfy myself with one example a great politician in the time of william iii had been desirous of a private audience with majesty and had accordingly crept up the back stairs for whether you have a whig king or a tory king there must always be a back staircase to the royal closet what the important intelligence was which he had to communicate was never known for the affair was conducted with becoming privacy nor would it ever have been known what was the occasion of the subsequent alteration in his sentiments and conduct but for an unlucky accident but just as he was stealing down again the bag in which the bribe was contained which was to pay him for his future votes in parliament happened to burst and the whole secret was revealed   once tis confest beneath the patriots cloak   from the crackd bag the dropping guinea spoke   and gingling down the back stairs told the crow   old cato is as great a rogue as you but citizens paper credit has at once given wings and secrecy to corruption there is now no necessity for cumberous waggons to take away your heavy iron wealth no occasion for canvas bags to hold your millions or cloaks to hide them from the public eye a little bit of paper that may be passed thro the hollow circle of a ring may answer every demand of government or corruption—may purchase a whole house of commons or transport a band of patriots to botany bay   blest paper credit last and best supply   that lends corruption lighter wings to fly   gold wingd by thee can compass hardest things   can purchase states or fetch or carry kings   a single leaf can waft whole navies oer   or ship off armies to a distant shore   a leaf like sybils waft us to and fro—   our fates our fortunes as the winds do blow the next article to which i shall call your attention you will immediately perceive to be most intimately connected with the subject i mean the corn laws it is not necessary for me to enter into an investigation of all those commercial regulations which have so strong a tendency to favour the wealthy few and keep the rest    of society in a state of depression and poverty i shall only notice such of those regulations as relate immediately to the subject in question though undoubtedly every one of them in some degree eventually affects the price of all commodities and necessaries of life commerce in fact ought to be no part of the subject now before us for the object of agriculture ought not to be commerce but the comfort and accommodation of the people but our regulations have not always had this beneficial object in view we find but too many of them which have a particular tendency towards favoring the opulent landholder and bolstering up thro his means the system of rotten boroughs and corruption we find many precautions taken to increase the weight and influence of those gentlemen and for a very good reason they are not only proprietors of land that might be of no more estimation in the eyes of a minister than any other species of commodity but they are proprietors also of those rotten boroughs which lord mornington and mr pitt are pleased to suppose constitute so sublime a part of the excellence of our constitution that if we were to tear them away there would be but little left in the glorious fabric to demand our veneration or promote our felicity citizens it is very clear that the higher corn and cattle sell the higher the landlord can raise his rent for he will always take care especially now long leases are out of fashion not to lose his share of the advantage whatever it may be which the industry or the ingenuity of the farmer may produce the higher therefore the market the higher will be his rent and the greater his opportunities of indulging in those gratifications to which undoubtedly the higher orders are entitled though it would be something like blasphemy to attempt to extend them to the lower classes of the community hence we find that among other wise regulations there is a bounty upon the exportation of corn whenever it shall be below a given price and as the persons who have an interest in fixing this standard as high as it can be fixed are the very persons who by the present constitution of borough jobbing and aristocratic influence have the power of altering it whenever they please we have—or rather they have by means of this politic regulation an infallible means of keeping up the price to the improvement of their own fortunes it is true—but to the beggary and starvation of the  0 multitude and yet while our wealthy landholders are thus associated and represented for the advancement of their rentrolls and our unrepresented labourers and mechanics are punished like felons for associating for an increase of wages aristocrats have the audacity to talk of the liberties of britons—of equal laws and equal justice but the injustice does not terminate here i have repeatedly proved on a variety of occasions that as all taxes must be paid out of the profits of productive labour the whole burthen of taxation must in truth eventually fall upon the shoulders of the laborious orders of the community who is it then that pays the bounty—the laborious poor—who is it that receives the benefit of that bounty—the landholder—the indolent rich—is there any doubt of the accuracy of this statement—reflect awhile—are not the taxes paid by the people is not the bounty paid out of the taxes does it not follow therefore of course that the more government pays in bounties the more taxes must be levied upon the people—and all for what why truly for the noble privilege of paying a greater price for every bit of bread they put in their mouths how monstrous to plunder the poor peasant and artisan in this manner of the very means of purchasing the necessaries of life and then to tell them that they must pay so much the more for having been so plundered nor is this all having taken precautions to prevent the price of the necessaries of life falling below the minimum which our landholders and boroughmongers will condescend to accept they have also taken other precautions to mount it up to the maximum which their consciences would suffer them to exact for this barriers are to be erected to prevent the free progress of mercantile intercourse—the first great maxim in the communion of nations let the abundances of each be exchanged that the scarcities of each may be removed is to be violated—and commerce the boasted glory of our isle—commerce who from her very essence should be free as air is to groan in manacles unless the average price in our markets should be upwards of  0s per quarter no corn can be imported from foreign countries now citizens be pleased to remember that though  0s is or was a very high price yet good wheat may be considerably more than  0s nay and must be so before the ports can be opened because all the wheat sold at market is not    good and as it is the average and not the maximum that opens or closes the ports the average price may be  0s while all the good wheat may be sold at a price very considerably higher i will instance this by a calculation the average is fixed by the inspection of officers who attend the markets for the purpose of taking an account of the quantities sold in different districts suppose that  0 quarters are sold at   s that will give you    l  0s suppose  00 quarters at   s the amount will be   0l then suppose  00 more at   s which is   0l for the whole the result is that   0 quarters of wheat selling for     l  0s the average price becomes  0s but the good corn has been sold at    and   s thus then you see that till good corn has amounted to   s or upwards the ports must be shut and no foreign corn must be admitted to come in competition with the corn produced in this country because such a competition would do what injure the great mass of the people—no do them good—make bread so much the cheaper and who can dispute that it would be good for the great mass of the people that all the necessaries of life should be sold as cheap as possible—no the injury would be to the rich landholder who would not be able to charge so great a price for his land a thing so monstrous that the happiness of millions ought not in the eyes of wise and beneficent legislators to be held in competition with it for a moment but even this average extravagant as it would once have been thought is not fixed it is fixed indeed with respect to you and me it is fixed that it shall never be altered for our advantage but it is not fixed that it shall never be altered for the advantage of our boroughmongers and legislators the fact is it is altered whenever it suits their conscience that it should be at no great distance of time the average was   s instead of  0s—but mark the consequence of your having no voice no interest in the choice of your representatives of having your legislature with those individuals who are to make your laws and regulations—the rich landed proprietors—the owners of rotten boroughs—the sapient individuals who happen to possess upon their estates the fragments and relicks of druids temples at old sarum or to see from the waveinvaded shore the ruins of a church still struggling with the surrounding sea whose shattered spire continues to be represented though the spot that encircled it is no longer the habitation of man it is natural enough that those persons being the only individuals represented being the only individuals who have any    power of controul over the representatives their interest should be particularly attended to and that therefore in proportion as the price of corn increases the average price fixed in the act of parliament should also be altered nor should i be at all surprized if in a few years we were to run from  0 to  0 to  0 to  00 why not the individuals who make the laws having an interest in making this average as high as it possibly can be borne what should restrain them but a dread of the enlightened spirit of the people and who shall dare attempt to inspire that dread to put the boroughmongers in fear you are told is to overawe parliament and to overawe parliament you are told is high treason and as no one it may be supposed is very desirous of being hanged drawn and quartered——   must not things mend in their common course   from bad to worse from worse to that is worst   spencer   yet notwithstanding all this a sapient magistrate in the northern extremity of the country—a place for the magistrates of which i dare say we all have a becoming esteem—i mean to say the lord justice clerk on the trial of morton and others for sedition chose to observe that the poor of this country particularly those infatuated people stiling themselves the friends of the people pay no taxes at all it is the landedproperty men alone that pay all the taxes for look you my lords we pay the poor for their labour and so as we gi the poor the filler to pay the taxes wi it is we in truth that pay aw the taxes and if they be not content with our good laws and wise government they may een tack their alls upon their backs and pack off wi themselves and let them gang well be better quat o them but we cant take our land upon our backs na we mun stay—so that notwithstanding the increased price of rent—notwithstanding the encreased price of the commodities of life upon which by the way all taxes ultimately fall—notwithstanding every burthen and imposition which the laborious poor are subject to we are told that they pay no part of the taxes and as a notable proof of this we are told that they have nothing left but that which they can put upon their backs and go off whenever they choose and as an equal proof that the rich people the landed property men pay all the taxes they tell you they have the misfortune to be encumbered with such valuable estates that it is impossible    for them to go let things be as bad as they will they cannot put their land upon their backs and consequently they mun stay citizens i might here animadvert upon the unchangeable nature of court politics justice clerk tells the common people they may get themselves gone as soon as they will they may put their alls upon their backs and away they may trudge for that it will be a good thing to be rid of them—what does the cabinet of this country say at this time why it issues a mandate legally i grant you but mark how consistently saying that though you are upon the brink of starvation—though your children are crying to you for bread—though distress and misery of every description encircle you round you shall not attempt to depart from this country if you have not the permission of mr secretary dundas it shall be esteemed as a crime of a very high magnitude you shall be dragged from the ships and the ships shall be detained and not permitted to proceed upon their voyage you shall have but one alternative—either to starve in your cottages or be both starved and butchered too in the ranks of those armies who are fighting for a cause from which undoubtedly you will receive very great advantages though i very much doubt whether any of you are wise enough to discover in what that advantage will consist but why animadvert upon inconsistencies if men can sit upon the bench and talk such rank nonsense as this what matters whether they contradict today what they said yesterday or tomorrow what they say today—the labouring part of the community may take their alls upon their back and quit the country suppose they did what would lord justice clerks landed estate be worth after they were gone what would it produce i will tell him what it would produce—such innumerable swarms of vermin as would threaten him with immediate destruction and to deliver him from which he would pray for the restoring arms of those sans culottes whom oppressive cruelty had banished from the country what can lord justice clerk and all the lords and the justices—and the lord knows who to help them produce from their estates let them sow them with the musty records of the courts of law let them plant them with acts of parliament and manure them with the sanguinary sentences of the court of justiciary let them if they choose dig holes and bury that gold which they so idolized what will it produce briars thorns thistles enough undoubtedly every sort of annoyance it will    produce but bread the food of man the barley that should make him wholesome liquor will it yield them these will it feed their sheep or oxen or make them broad cloath no—no sort of commodity whatever for sustenance or comfort will their land their law or their acts of parliament produce them nor will all the mandates of the privy council nor the grave decisions of the bench make a potatoe grow without cultivation or turn acorns into melons and peaches no these they must receive from the labours of that common rabble without whom the lord justice clerk has the wisdom to say they could do a great deal better than with them o what a sort of system is it we live under when judges sit upon the bench and preach doctrines so absurd and so pernicious doctrines which nothing can equal but the intoxicated cruelty of the late aristocrats of france who while in their gilded carriages they rolled carelessly over some poor tattered beggar whom they disdained to turn out of the way to avoid have been known to exclaim it is no matter it is only one of the common fellows and we had always too many of these wretches we have seen citizens what has been the consequence of such doctrines in france i hope we shall see no such consequences here but if we do whose is the fault does it rest with those who call out to the oppressor forbear your inhumanity—reform your ill policy or does it result from those who pollute the sacred vestments of authority by doctrines so diabolical as that which i have read another cause of the growing scarcity to which i shall refer you is the monopoly of farms the time has been as goldsmith beautifully expresses it the happy time when every rood of land maintained its man what is the casenow where will you go for those little farms which supported in comfort and supplied with all the simple necessaries and decencies of life a family healthy from its industry virtuous from surrounding necessities and whose interests were inseparably united by the humble situation it was placed in with that of the great mass of the people those little farms are no longer to be found large proprietors have grasped whole provinces almost in one concern and that useful order of men is annihilated to make room for the spacious granaries and unwieldy opulence of monopolists and speculators who by reason of their wealth and fewness find combination and compact easy and rule the market at their own will and pleasure    a correspondent residing in shropshire gives me the particulars of some circumstances which have taken place in his own neighbourhood he tells me that in two villages in the neighbourhood of his own residence he remembers at no considerable distance of time nine farms to have been contained in the one and seven farms in the other each of which supported of course the families of the occupiers in decency and comfort what is the condition now the nine farms are reduced to three and the seven are reduced to two thus then you have two families living in luxury where you used to have seven maintained in decent competency and you have three exulting in their large possessions where you used to have nine carrying their produce to a fair and early market to the accommodation and benefit of society whose is the advantage of this there can be no doubt the landed proprietors he collects his rent with less trouble he finds it more easy to obtain it immediately at the time when it is due or the proprietor forsooth is a man of capital and credit and if he cannot get specie from him he can get circulating paper he finds also that he is enabled to demand a higher rent because when only one family is to be supported where three were to be supported before the farmer can be content with a more moderate ratio of profit and yet his family live in greater abundance than the three families could afford this is not all the mischief does not stop here this monopoly of farms destroys competition and encourages speculation and consequently creates an artificial and increases the real scarcity the little farmer was obliged to take his commodity into the market when he wanted to make up his rent or other payments the great farmer can keep it in his barns till he meets with a chapman at such a price as he chooses to put upon it the little farmer could not speculate upon the chances of scarcity and thus create one where otherwise it would never have existed the great farmer can he finds no inconvenience in such speculation because being a man of considerable property a man of respectability as we denominate those who have the power and the inclination to starve their fellow beings by wholesale he knows that if he is pressed for an immediate supply he can have it by means of the fictious circulating medium the fact is that the very character of a farmer is almost annihilated in many parts of the country you see no such thing as an individual who attends to his own farm and is thus brought to something    like a level with the labourers whom he employs instead of this the land is divided between vast proprietors who consider their farms as objects of commercial speculation and who look down upon the poor dependent drudges who toil for them as beings who have no sort of title to commiseration and fellow feeling citizens we must immediately perceive if we use a moments reflection that in the present state of human intellect and human passions absolute equality of property is totally impossible it is a visionary speculation which none but the calumniators of the friends of freedom ever entertained reeves and his associators might deem it convenient to suppose performs to entertain such notions but they existed only in the distempered brains of alarmists but though this is not attainable there is another state of society perfectly practicable and which is the best substitute for this poetical vision—this golden age of absolute equality i mean the imperceptible gradations of rank where step rises above step by slow degrees and link mingles with link in intimate and cordial union till the whole society connected together by inseparable interests indulges that fellow feeling between man and man from which and from which alone the real fruits of humanity and justice can be expected alas what can we argue but from what we know this argument so often applied as the test of science we may apply to feeling also we must know what calamity is before we can feel for it the calamities of the order of society but just below us—an order into which we see the possibility that we may ourselves descend press home to our feelings we enter into the particulats that constitute their poignancy—we understand their nature and we feel them in their full force we are disposed both to respect and relieve them but he who has been nursed in pomp and luxury looks down upon the poor drudge by whom he is supported as a beast of burden created for his ease and advantage and feels no more for his calamities in three instances out of four than for the pangs of the expiring brute who bleeds beneath the stroke of the butcher to supply his table but these imperceptible gradations are destroyed by the present monopolizing system there are but three classes of men left among us—the monied speculators among whom may be classed the great farmers i have been describing the proud high towering drones who hum and buz and make a noise in the hive but who never brought a morsel of honey    into the cells and the poor hardworking drudges who toil from day to night and almost from night to day and receive for their useful and important services the bitter inheritance of unpitied poverty in great towns it is true gradations something more various may be traced even in these we are hastening to the same dismal state of separation hence it is from these wide gaps these chasms in society that there is no common interest no general affection no universal sympathy binding man to man and constituting one great united harmonious mass having but one object and adhering steadily together for the preservation of each other and the attainment of that object perhaps it is not proper for me who certainly am not very far advanced in agricultural speculations to lay down any particular regulations but i doubt very much whether it would not be to the happiness of this country if no farm was held by any individuals of more than two hundred acres but we have now thousands of acres held in one farm—what wonder then that there are monopolies what produces monopolies when great competition exists monopoly cannot flourish but when the power of competition is in the hands of a few individuals they have nothing to do but to agree to do that which their mutual interest will prompt them to fulfill and they have the whole public at their mercy and the power of starving them into a compliance with their extravagant demands citizens i do not intend to indulge myself frequently in speculative projects but one has been submitted to me which i think worthy of attention i have formerly shewn you that almost half the land in this island remains in an uncultivated state now we will suppose says my correspondent that four millions of acres of this was parcelled into small farms of  0 or  00 acres this would become a receptacle for  0000 families put into possession of a comfortable subsistence and would give us in a few years by the increased accommodation and comfort of these families an addition to the rising generation of many thousand individuals take into consideration also the advantage that would result to agricultural production and if we suppose only  0 acres of tillage in one farm this on low calculation would produce us    00000 measures of nett grain i do not pledge myself to the accuracy of the calculations made in this proposal but it is easy to see what advantages might result by employing our revenues in such improvements instead of    lavishing them in projects of sanguinary ambition these are the means by which our grandeur and power might be indeed increased instead of depopulating the continent and rushing into frantic crusades to extinguish the principles of jacobinism and restore royalty and popish idolatry—restore royalty in france—we restore royalty in france—what absurdity—what injustice—whether the principles of royalty be right or wrong—whether republicanism be right or wrong—whether jacobinism ought to triumph or jacobinism ought to fall what was it to us in the present instance it was the affair of france and france ought to be left to settle it nor had we any more right to go to war to compel that nation to adopt a government according to our taste than i have to break into your houses and say you have no right to have any sort of food upon your table but such as i choose for you you like roast beef perhaps but you shall have nothing but boiled you perhaps are a jew and will not eat pork i tell you you shall have nothing but pork and if you do not forego your damned judaical infidelity and eat pork when i command you i will pull every hair out of your chin and turn you out as bare as ever your king nebuchadnezzar was turned out to graze upon the common and eat cold sallads with the beasts of the field another circumstance connected very closely with the state of agriculture is the encouragement given to the breed of horses no person can be at a loss to conceive how very large a proportion of those commodities which might administer to the comfortable support of man is devoured by the numerous train of horses kept for a variety of purposes in this country if we turn our eyes to the studs of noblemen and princes if we consider that many for mere pomp and vanity have kept hundreds of horses in stables vying for splendour with the palaces of our nobility erected at an expence that would build cottages for all the poor in the neighbourhood of london—if we consider the monstrous quantity of steeds trained for the purposes of gaming to increase the detestable art of lavishing property on vice and profligacy instead of bestowing it upon benevolence and charity—if we take all those circumstances into the calculation which will arise in your minds at the bare mention of the subject we cannot but immediately reflect what a large decrease must be thus occasioned of the produce which would otherwise contribute to the support of man consider how many cattle might graze and how much wheat might grow upon the tracts of land allotted    for these steeds tell me if in this article of luxury and fashion you do not find one of the permanent though growing causes of that scarcity of provisions of which we at this time complain this also is extended still further the farmer must have steeds which occasionally he can convert into horses of pleasure his very plough would be disgraced by having an ox in it every part of labour some of which might even be better performed by oxen is performed by horses to this also we ought to add the waste the profligacy the dissipation and destructive vices which result from the scandalous practice of keeping an enormous train of lounging fellows in liveries the whole of whose labour is devoted not to increasing the necessaries of life not to add to the useful productions of society but to increasing the vice the licentiousness the luxury the pride of their employers swelling them up with the monstrous idea that one set of men was formed to cringe at the footstools of another and that there are in reality distinctions in society besides those of wisdom and virtue it would be digressing too far to describe all the mischiefs that result to the morals both of the lord thus waited on and the slave that waits my present concern is only with the effects upon the production and consumption of the necessaries of life and these are obvious to the most casual observation i cannot however pass by an opportunity of observing that the very practice of being waited on by a train of insolent slaves in merry andrews coats besides its other pernicious consequences to society has a necessary tendency to encourage the idea that one set of men is formed of baser materials than another that they were born to cringe and bow to a few terrestrial deities or to be hewers of wood and drawers of water mere beasts of burden for the convenience and pleasure of the erect and lordly few who call themselves the higher ranks of life when the fact is that these characteristics which we so properly despise result not from the original nature of man but from the vicious institutions of society which make many administer to the luxuries of one instead of cultivating that spirit of equality to which i hope one day or other to see the human race aspire it would be unpardonable when talking of the inconveniences under which our agriculture lies if i were to pass over the subject of tithes an oppressive burden which presses with particular hardship upon those articles to which a considerable  0 degree of favour ought to be extended in adjusting the burthens of the state the necessary articles of consumption ought surely by the wisdom and care of every government to be put under such protection and regulations that they should be sold at the easiest possible rate how is this to be done by taxing the farmer first of all in common with the other inhabitants of the country thro every gradation of his profession and in every form which the ingenuity of financiers can devise and then in addition to all this laying upon his shoulders the aggravated burden of priestly imposition to the amount of a tenth of the gross produce of the soil a burthen which when we consider what has been expended in rent to the landlord in cultivation of the land in gathering in the harvest and a thousand incidental expences will be found to amount at least to one third part of the profit this might perhaps have been endured with patience at a time when superstition reigned over every mind—when priests were considered as gods and had sometimes the audacity openly to call themselves such but now that the eyes of mankind are opened—when they begin to perceive that every one has a right to save his soul in his own way and that the pulpit is but too generally prostituted to purposes of political usurpation the motive for chearful compliance with so heavy a contribution is no more and the burthen falling without alleviation upon our shoulders we cannot but reflect on the immediate effect which this must have on the price of the necessary articles of consumption but let us consider also not only the immediate but the secondary operation of this sacred tax has it not a tendency to depress the spirit of agricultural improvement what encouragement have i to labour from the increase of the produce of my land what temptations do you hold out to me to improve the soil upon which i live and to invent new methods of tillage and agriculture by which society would be benefited why this is the advantage you tell me that a man to hear whom perhaps i may piously go three times every sunday or to whom perhaps i may think it greater piety not to go at all either because his doctrines are averse to the prejudices in which i have been educated or because my mind has some how or other towered above or sunk below for it is not for me to decide the objects to which he would direct my attention—this man is to reap the profit of my toil this man is to reap the harvest i have sown and in addition to the increased rent which i must pay to    the landlord in consequence of the benefit i have conferred upon his land i am to have an increased burden upon my shoulders to the pious gentleman in the black gown from whose assistance i am told i am not to reap any advantage in this world but am to receive a copious harvest in the world to come i have heard say there are but two sorts of bad paymasters those who pay before hand and those who never pay at all but unfortunately every one of us is obliged to be a bad paymaster in this particular we are obliged to give prompt payment here but we must trust to the other world for remuneration where if we should be deceived we shall have no opportunity of bringing the individual to the bar of the kings bench to receive compensation from the verdict of an honest jury it must however be admitted that these men have their uses in society when the country is plunged in war no matter how there are generally you know fasts and prayers appointed in order to influence the people to exert themselves courageously to procure a successful issue to that war now it must be admitted that these pious gentlemen have considerable influence in persuading the people to yield their throats to the knife for the grandeur and emolument of ministers and of course you know for our glorious constitution but to speak a little seriously whatever might be the objects in view in establishing such an institution as this is the imposition i am speaking of a means to make that institution successful is it consistent with policy even that the teachers and hearers should be in a perpetual state of warfare yet what but a perpetual state of warfare results or can result from this system of tithes every person at all acquainted with the history of any country village knows the disgraceful litigations scandalous to morality scandalous to the character of man with which the parishioners are harrassed by their ministers who preach forbearance and practice intolerance who tell them they are not to throw their debtor in jail for the sake of a little property and yet put their debtor into worse than any jail whatever the spiritual court for what common sense and justice cannot discover to be any debt at all i believe the best thing for the happiness and morals of mankind is that every individual should choose his own religion according to the conviction of his own heart if he chooses with tom paine to say the world is my country and doing good my religion i see no reason why he should be persecuted for that faith    if he chooses to bow down to the trinity believing that one is three and three is one it is scandalous to interrupt the freedom and tranquility of his worship it is equally scandalous to interrupt that freedom and tranquility if on the one hand he chooses to worship god in single unity or to bow down on the other to all the wooden saints or moulton calves which godsmiths can invent or priests devise let him hear all let him listen to all let him judge of all with candour and let him remember that his grandmother and his nurse generally the first formers of our religion are no better judges nor more infallible doctors in these matters than the pope of rome or any other old woman that might happen to model the infant faith of his neighbours let him determine according to the dictates of his conscience he can have no other guide than conscience or fear let those take the scoundrel passion—the principle of fear whose minds have not nerve enough for bold enquiry i am for the british manliness of internal conviction let him hear whom he chooses and let the instructor and the pupil settle their own terms it is no business of yours or mine where our neighbour goes or what he believes or what he pays all our business is whether he is a good member of society whether he exerts his faculties mental or corporeal to advance the interests of society if so general and benevolent a sentiment is adopted the diabolical rancour of theological hatred must be exterminated from the mind of man and difference of opinion would no more beget that rancour and animosity that have so long deformed the universe and under the mask of propagating the religion of peace spread fire and sword and desolation through the world while not content with external ravages the baneful rapacity with which it has been accompanied has seized upon the vitals of national industry has damaged the improvement of the most useful arts checked the progress of agriculture and aggravated the dearness and scarcity of those articles necessary for the subsistence of human life such citizens appear to me to be among the leading causes that affect the agricultural productions of the country there is another branch however of this subject which must not be passed over in silence corn and cattle are among the most important articles of consumption but they are not the only resources of life this country is so happily situated that both these may fail to a considerable degree and yet    barring impolitic regulations no famine reach us we are surrounded by seas and watered by innumerable rivers yet what is the situation of the fisheries of this country look to our northern coasts in particular you might look at every coast and see what neglect prevails consider how long the people of holland more industrious and more politic than ourselves have caught our own fish upon our own shores salted them and preserved them and afterwards sold them to us at a price extravagantly increased in diminished quantities i have dwelt in a former lecture upon this subject and upon the impolitic duties and regulations with respect to salt in my lecture upon the genuine means of averting national calamities i entered considerably into the subject and as i have printed that lecture in the first number of my tribune i shall not go into it again there are some facts however not noticed there which ought not to be passed over in silence some provisions under pretence of checking the growth of this evil have been made but they are very inefficient and perhaps were even intended to be so in aberistwith in wales in particular it is common for the fishermen during the season to go out in the morning and catch as many fine cod and fish of that description as they think they shall be able to sell in their own market these they throw upon the beech and the people of all descriptions come down and purchase what they want—the finest large fish at a penny a piece an attempt was made some years ago to raise them to twopence and the common people were so indignant that they threatened insurrection and the fishermen were obliged to keep them at the old price my correspondent from whom i have the anecdote—a person who has sent some literary productions into the world enquired why they did not catch a large quantity as they seemed to procure them with so much ease but he was answered—to what use shall we catch more than we can fell we can get no cheap salt to keep them with upon enquiring what was meant by cheap salt he found that a regulation had been made some years ago which required a given quantity of salt to be sold without any duty at the falterns or manufactories in that part of the country in order that the salting of fish might be encouraged for the benefit of the poor of that neighbourhood in particular and of the interior of the island in general but what was the consequence did the poor fishermen the common class of the people reap the benefit of this no    they had more wealthy and more powerful neighbours whose turn for they are represented in parliament was first to be served and the swinish disfranchised herd who have no voice by which their complaints can be made known were to be deprived of the means of laying up in the plentiful season that which might support them in the time of scarcity a few wealthy individuals in order to prevent the trade from getting into the hands of these little retail haglers which they thought would be injurious to their monopolizing plans contract regularly for the whole of the salt that is thus permitted to be sold without duty and the poor are not permitted to have a single grain of it for their own tables thus instead of the common people salting the fish and preserving it for themselves or carrying it to market the cheap salt is absolutely bought up and as it is said not made use of at all lest the product of the fisheries which monopolizing individuals have a particular interest in keeping at as high a price as possible should get into the hands of the common people and be sold at reduced prices that there are many practices of this kind it is impossible for us to avoid concluding when we consider the present price of fish and what it used to be in former times—when we consider that the inhabitants on the banks of the severn where the finest salmon is caught can rarely get a single fish and that in almost every place where these luxuries used to abound the same complaint is to be heard the reason is that the fishermen are under contract with certain great factors to sell to them the whole of the fish that they catch and are bound by engagements to destroy what is not wanted for their limited markets this statement at first view would appear like fiction but i have the facts from persons who reside in the neighbourhood of the severn and who have had opportunities of ascertaining them i know that at first blush it would appear that this is impolitic in the contracting parties for that the more they sell the larger would be the profit but this is not the case if the individual can obtain any thing like the sum for a tenth part of the commodity which he would obtain for the whole—if he obtains even the half he receives a very advanced emolument because the agents to be employed in the sale the care to be taken to prevent the whole from being spoiled the expence of carriage c c are much less when he sells a small than when he sells a very large quantity    but how should any individual have the right of making such regulations why should the streams which flow from the liberal urn of nature which are fed by the waters of heaven and break their unbidden way through the veins of the earth—those streams which are cultivated by no man—which are stocked by no man—which receive no benefit from this mans capital or that mans capital—why should they be the property of individuals are they not the bounties of nature and has not every one of natures children a right to share her bounties unless forsooth you choose to tell us the great are the only legitimate children of nature and that the rest are bastardized by those statutes of aggrandizement which have lifted a few to rank emoluments and distinctions which the mass can never hope to attain such then are a part and but a part of the causes of that increasing dearness of provisions and consequent misery of the mass of the people of which we complain that the effects of these gradually operating causes have lately been very much aggravated by others of a temporary nature has been already shewn nor shall i attempt to recapitulate them at this late hour of the evening suffice it to say that like the present war with which they are so intimately connected they may all be traced to the same original spring of action——a systematic aversion in our cabinet to the principles of liberty there is one of these topics however upon which i slightly touched at the conclusion of the lecture of wednesday last that seems to demand more ample notice than i then had time to give it not only as it is most intimately connected with the immediate subject of these lectures but as it tends to illustrate in a most eminent degree the real character and views of our ministers it will be obvious that i allude to the affairs of poland it cannot be unknown to you that poland in a very considerable degree was considered as the granary of europe what must have been the consequence of the devastations of last summer consider that this granary of the world instead of being cultivated by the peaceful ploughshare has been rent by the iron scythe of military tyranny—that the industrious peasants who used to cultivate the soil have been prevented from that cultivation by the trumpet which has called them to arms by the gnawing thought that what they produced another might reap that the sons of liberty might plow the earth but that the demons of despotism might come    with their scythes and claim the rich harvest and carry that which ought to have supported a race of men proud of hardearned independence into the granaries of northern savages whose only refinement is slaughter and whose only appetite blood and cruelty consider also the devastations of war which have raged through that fine country consider the extent to which this calamity has been diffused during that struggle whose glorious energy and whose prospects of success so frequently cheered my heart while confined within the mansions of the tower at a time when prospects of the happiness of other countries were the only consolations of the generous briton—for every thing at home laid tamely prostrate at the feet of a despotic faction—poor devoted poland you might have calculated largely upon the hardships and calamities you had to struggle with but you had one enemy which perhaps never entered into your speculations you did not expect that corruption would be employed by a british minister to blast and palsy your glorious efforts and to string with increased energy the tyrannic arm of the prussian despot citizens this conduct of the minister of this country—this underhanded exertion to crush the liberties of poland discover to you a dismal secret if you reflect it will unfold to you the real objects which that minister has in view compare this conduct with the conduct of those ministers in the time of charles ii who it is now universally admitted aimed at the establishment of despotism what conduct did they pursue wherever the dawn of liberty was to be discovered there the british cabinet found a soe the republic of holland felt the eternal hostility of the british court why because the flame of liberty such as it was in holland was thought to be inimical to the project of charless ministers for extinguishing the remaining spark of liberty in britain therefore it was that attempts were made to destroy republican holland therefore it was that a stadtholder was forced upon that people therefore it was that charless ministers intrigued with the despot of france for the destruction and overthrow of holland that destruction he did not effect for just at the time when the brave batavians despairing of being able to defend their country were about to embark and transport themselves to the eastindies the genius of british liberty burst forth and compelled the the court of britain to alter its detestable measures    compare these facts with the conduct of our ministers in the present struggle on the continent why should the minister of this country who deals forth his hypocritical admiration of the constitution of this country be hostile to the liberties of the poles they were not jacobins they did not proclaim liberty and equality they did not erect guillotines they did not pretend that sans culottism was to be the basis of their constitution they did not venture they were not enlightened enough—they were not wise enough—if they had they would have triumphed—they did not venture to proclaim the equal rights of man they did not attempt to set up a government in which every individual should have an equal share in the appointment of the legislature they were not robespierrists—they were not even republicans why then was there such animosity on the part of the british cabinet against the polish revolution—citizens—citizens i fear we shall be compelled to conclude that the real hatred of our ministers is not against republicanism but against liberty not against jacobinism but against the least shadow and appearance of independency and the rights of human beings a settled abhorrence for every thing like free just and humane laws o hypocrisy how transparent is thy veil—pitt pretends to approve of limited monarchy yet poland attempted to establish a limited monarchy and pitt subsidized a german despot to counteract the attempt and this very pitt has since told you in the house of commons for the audacity of some men is equal to their profligacy that if he had been aware of the use to which the subsidies he granted would be applied he would nevertheless have subsidized the king of prussia we have therefore his own authority for pronouncing that he was at least friendly to the subjugation of the brave and virtuous poles but for this subsidy it is clear prussia could not have resisted the brave efforts of the gallant kosciusko he did not resist them effectually at last he felt and trembled while he felt the zeal the ardour of that brave peasant—yes peasant i will call him for kosciusko like stanhope was an aristocrat only by birth he could perceive that the peasantry are the life the soul the existence of society and therefore he gloried in the character and assumed the appearance like a peasant he fought—like a peasant he conquered—and at last like a peasant fell—to chains indeed to anguish but not to infamy no he fell from prosperity but he rose to glory his name will be resounded his memory will be    beloved posterity will bow adoration to his bust when pitt and all his dependants are swept down the tide of oblivion or if their names are preserved will only be preserved to infamy o poland poland—yes there was a time when the friends of liberty might flatter themselves with a hope that not the general of the poles but the despot of prussia for it is now no longer treason to speak of him as he deserves would have felt the galling of chain but alas the gold of britain enabled him to hold out till the russian barbarians were ready to take the field the russian—how my blood curdles at the name o poland o exhausted country o depopulated warsaw whose brave exertions against one despot had robbed thee of the energy that should have defended thee against another—what heart bleeds not for thy fate behold the fiend zuwarrow hot from scenes of massacre and cruelty where ismaels sons groaned and bled by thousands at his command nor even circassias daughters the beauties of the east no nor the smiling infants at the breast escaped his butchering knife zuwarrow comes and warsaws streets groan beneath his bloodstained steps and thou imperial dæmon thou cursed hyæna of the north thou pouredst thy savage fury in his soul and gavest the dagger edge thus poland fell it sunk beneath the sanguinary grasp and scenes of bloodshed and horror marked its fall liberty expired humanity groaned the hero and his bride the infant and his parent fell together in one promiscuous carnage such are the triumphs—such the humanity of that regular government by whose assistance order and justice are to be restored in france what then was the consequence of this subsidy to poland desolation and massacre what was the consequence to britain the produce of that country which if our cabinet had yielded to the wishes of the people for the peoples hearts were with the poles where the heart of the minister was—if indeed he has such a thing which may be called in question—the produce of that country which might have been sent into our ports—that abundance which might have relieved our distresses is gone it is not only robbed from us it is destroyed annihilated it is worse than lost to us worse than fallen into the hands of our enemies it has fallen into the wide womb of nonentity it has perished and we    can never recover it is this then—this machiavelian policy of our rulers not connected with the causes of our calamities we were told at a former period when our blessed sovereign had the misfortune to labour under certain derangements of his transcendent intellects—we were told by the right reverend fathers in god the bishops in conclave assembled—and what right reverend bishops tell us who shall venture to call in question—we were told that the crimes of the people had caused the calamities of the sovereign whether this be true or no i shall not dispute i do not pretend to be as well versed in the occult sciences as the reverend bench of bishops but this i know that whether the crimes of the people produced the calamities of the sovereign or not the crimes of his majestys ministers frequently produce the calamities both of prince and people thus in the time of charles i when the apostate wentworth once a bawling advocate for liberty became minister of the crown and earl of strafford we find that his bad policy brought the nation into a civil war and the sovereign to the block we find also that when louis xvi yielded the reins of government to that profligate wretch calonne that calonne by his arts and intrigues plunged the country into bankruptcy and misery and afterwards his intrigues plunged louis xvi into perjury and eventually the country into anarchy an anarchy which pitt and his coadjutors would persuade you was occasioned by the friends of liberty but which in reality was occasioned by the intrigues of the friends of despotism by the cabals of that wretch calonne the crimes him of condè and artois and the profligacy of the court of france citizens i am no advocate for the doctrine of constructive treason but if it could be admitted must we not determine that those ministers are guilty of high treason who seeing the effects of this misconduct pursue precisely the same line of conduct which calonne and the apostate wentworth had pursued before the fact is citizens that the worst calamities of every nation result from the profligacy of ministers ever careless of the welfare of the people and ever grasping to increase revenue and the wages of corruption they continue the ravages of oppression till the energies and resources of the country are exhausted and desolation appears in every corner and mark how that corruption has swelled of late among us see the torrent which it has spread over the country once it  0 was a little rippling stream it played and murmured round the purlieus of the court in time it became a spreading river now a mighty torrent it has burst its banks and swelling like another nile has drowned the nation in one general inundation and behold the halfformed monsters of vice of misery and luxurious deformity which rise from its polluted slime yes citizens there was a time when corruption had its bounds when one place was sufficient for one man but now so intrepid becomes the honesty of our courtiers so zealous and enthusiastic are they in preserving the rights of the people so much additional energy have they acquired that to sap their independence requires not one place only but a dozen before they will consent to support the measures of the court and become hostile to the welfare of the people i shall not attempt to illustrate this by enumerating all the places possessed by pitt and his family in england by dundas and his family in scotland or by beresford and his family in ireland in short such is the power and patronage grasped by these three worthless beings that england scotland and ireland seem to contain but three men each of whom if you touch but the hair of his head or threaten to remove him from his places even though you leave him his salaries and emoluments can threaten you with a civil war and perhaps the wreck and ruin of the whole government from this monopoly of places arises another misfortune for you know ministers must be supported and if they monopolize all the old places to themselves they must create so many more new places for their dependants thus we find that instead of two secretaries of state we have three all principal secretaries of state though one of them forsooth is hardly permitted to sign his name to a warrant of any description unless it be to arrest a jacobinical fellow for high treason without permission from his high and mighty master and coadjutor dundas as to the creation of lesser places it were in vain to enumerate these—boards of controul offices of police and boards of agriculture with salaries for apostate secretaries and i know not what i will refer you however for an instance to the tower where if you should have the good fortune to experience the same opportunities of information that i have had you may learn that in consequence of the œconomical arrangements of that great reformer the duke of richmond wherever there are three labourers doing any sort of work there are always six clerks to see that they do it—i    beg pardon citizens i have been guilty of a slight inaccuracy in this statement the language of the tower is that wherever there are three labourers doing nothing there must always be six clerks to see that it is done then we must take into consideration also the increase of pensions and secret service money and the compromises which the ministry coming in always makes with the ministry going out once it was thought sufficient when one set of rogues—i beg your pardon—i meant to say ministers went out for the other set who came in to promise them indemnity and that they would not impeach them and bring them to the block but now indemnity they will say with a sneer—indemnity holding their hands behind them as they retire—i must have something besides indemnity or i will become so flaming a patriot i will not only oppose your measures but blow up the whole system—let the people into the secrets of office and make your places not worth your holding your contracts your monopolies your discounts upon subsidies your pensions from foreign courts all shall be exposed—indemnity indeed i say indemnity give me a good pension and i will oppose you only in a parliamentary way but if you dont take care of me i shall grow desperate and   let in the light to plutos drear abodes   abhorrd by men and hateful een to gods if you want authority for all this i refer you to fitzwilliams letters and if he does not say the same thing in other words i have no wit in decyphering the courtly character that this inordinate growth of corruption is the spring and fountain head of all our calamities cannot be doubted for it is clear and evident that this corruption as it leads to waste extravagance and dissipation as it leads to the decrease of productive labour and an increase of those inordinate burthens and taxes that consume the profits of productive labour must tend to increase the price of the necessaries of life for evils like these where shall we seek for redress from tumult and violence from destroying market houses and breaking open the shops of butchers and bakers sie sie sie can imagination be so dull as to suppose that outrage and tumult can redress calamities so enormous a little partial evil may perhaps sometimes get redress from these criminal exertions but calamities so great require the peaceful but determined energies of the national mind—a loud a fervid and resolute remonstrance with our rulers and a union and    association among ourselves that may command the respect of those who have the boldness to despise our individual efforts we must lay the axe deep to the root of the evil and not suffer our attention to be diverted by tearing the lesser branches the plain and simple fact is that the happiness of the lower and middling orders of society for let us not be so deluded as to suppose that the lower orders can be oppressed and the middle orders not feel the oppression the great body of the people are neglected because the great body of the people are not represented in the legislature and those who make the laws are not at all dependent upon their favour or approbation if you will have redress seek it quietly but seek it firmly redress the evils of corruption by reforming the source of corruption there is no redress for a country situated as we are but by restoring to the people their right of universal suffrage and annual parliaments rights which nature dictates and which no law can take away rights which the constitution of this country has stamped with approbation and which if we wish for happiness and prosperity we must seek to restore for the plain and simple fact cannot be more concisely expressed than in those words in which i have so often repeated it that there is no redress for a country situated as we are but from a fair full and equal representation of the people in the commons house of parliament price fourpence asterisks no xix containing the lecture on barracks and

british soldiery delivered wednesday june  0th      citizens the subject that claims your attention this evening is the modern ministerial rage for barracks and fortifications with sketches of the character and treatment of the british soldiery and an enquiry into the genuine modes of national defence at the very outset of the consideration of this subject it naturally suggests itself to us to enquire what are the real characteristics of the british nation and what have been the means and sources of her former strength and greatness if we look to history we shall find that the strength and grandeur of this country has always depended not upon its military force but upon its navy and if we enquire a little further we shall be disposed to consider that this circumstance does not depend upon any thing peculiar in the character of the british people—not upon any difference in the original conformation of englishmen from the conformation of men of other nations—for the plain and simple fact is however historians may attempt to seduce us into a contrary belief that britons are but men and that the inhabitants of all other countries are to be considered as men also partaking of the same common nature feelings capacities affections and powers of mind and body that they are in fact of one and the same family and bound therefore by the same universal laws of nature and affection we must look then not to the conformation of the british mind nor to the conformation of the bodily constitution of britons for any thing either glorious or censurable in the former history of britain but we must look to the circumstances in which the country has been placed either with respect to its natural situation institutions    of goverment or casual introduction of information and science for any differences of character or conduct among the people of this nation the plain and simple fact then is that our situation in the universe has pointed out to us the peculiar character we ought to be most anxious to cultivate both as to our peaceable pursuits and the vindication of our rights against external foes other countries which form a part of the continent are from the very nature of their situation compelled to cultivate the military science because they are at all times open to attacks from neighbouring enemies and if they had not that martial characteristic among them which enables them to defend their frontiers the imaginary lines that may be drawn upon a map or those more important barriers erected by the professors of tactics would but ill defend them against the ambition of conquest and dominion so long as the present mischievous system begot in courts and nurtured by ministerial intrigue the system of war shall continue to curse and torment the universe happily for this country had ministers understood its happiness we are situated in a different manner the ocean has formed a rampart more powerful than alps and fortresses to defend us from those hostile attacks to which other nations are subjected and thus has separated us if we were wise enough to make use of the advantage from the broils and politics of the other nations of europe what a source of happiness does this offer to us and how madly have we dashed the cup of felicity from our lips and drained the bitter draught of voluntary misery even to the very dregs certainly there is no country in europe that has so excellent an opportunity of keeping itself perpetually at peace as britain no country so little concerned in the phantastic balance of power no nation that has had so few real occasions to see her children orphans in the streets and her widows lamenting their husbands slain in the field of battle unfortunately however the country best calculated to remain in eternal peace has not only been the most signal for frequent wars but from a destructive ambition reigning in her court and a melancholy defect in her institutions which enables her ministers to profit most when havoc and uproar rage with the greatest fury has too frequently been the cause of provoking war throughout the universe and keeping europe asia    and the west in one continued strife of carnage and desolation this conduct with respect to the people who have been made subservient to it may perhaps in some degree be accounted for from one of the worst dispositions that degrades the human character—a disposition to be indifferent to those calamities from which by personal situation we are ourselves secured these ramparts raised by the billows of the ocean have rendered us strangers as it were to the real calamities of war we feel the burdens of taxation it is true and we feel them at this time cold and heavy almost as the iron hand of death ready to crush us into nonexistence but we do not behold those ravages which other countries frequently experience our burning villages do not light us in many a midnight march nor does trenching war channel our fields nor bruise our flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces the fields cultivated for our support are not laid waste by those aggressions that have reduced many parts of the continent to worse than deserts—unfortunately for mankind—nay permit me to say and even for ourselves we are too little acquainted with the real mischiefs produced by this system of war we are so fond of and remaining secure at home—that is to say—our statesmen aristocrats and rich traders remaining secure at home and partaking of no part of the danger send their fellow citizens without remorse to be butchered in foreign climes and to spread over other nations that devastation from which this country has hitherto been happily secured but let us not deceive ourselves we no longer can remain secure if we persist in this scheme of frantic ambition which must ultimately bring upon us the just hatred and detestation of the world proud of our situation unfeeling alike from this pride and from this happiness we have arrogated to ourselves a ridiculous dominion over the ocean forgetting that first great principle of justice that the bounty which results from no mans labour that bounty which never can be exhausted but offers a peaceful and eternal source of wealth to all mankind never as gregoire has observed in his excellent report on the rights of nations never can be the property of any man or any nation it is a common good owing its existence and its advantages to no one it is therefore the common inheritance of all the children of nature    and we must prove that the inhabitants of other parts of the universe are not men or we can have no right to arrogate to ourselves the exclusive possession of this grand and magnificent inheritance but thus arrogating to ourselves the dominion of the ocean we have not been satisfied with the fruits which that dominion gives it is the natural tendency of all evil passions when once gratified to stimulate fresh desires still more vicious and inordinate those who have obtained a monopoly of any kind and persuaded themselves that it is their right grasp immediately at a still wider monopoly and soon persuade themselves that the universe itself was made for them not satisfied with the empire of the ocean the indies must be subjugated to our mercantile ambition the western world must yield its neck to the yoke of british usurpation and africa must be depopulated and her sooty sons loaded with chains and fetters must cultivate for us those luxuries which have in reality undermined our independence and sapped that energy of soul which can only be cherished by simplicity and virtue these undertakings have been but too successful in the eyes of courts and ministers they have it is true increased the misery of the lower orders of society they have added to the burdens of the great mass of the people an opinion to illustrate which i need only appeal to the historical fact quoted in my lectures on the dearness and scarcity of provisions that a larger quantity of the enjoyments of life were formerly procured by a smaller proportion of labour—they have driven the multitude to a lower state of misery but they have increased the dominion patronage and grandeur of office they have increased the prosperity and monopoly of a few great families who have risen to power and opulence by the pillage of the nation yes by these great and glorious exploits tho the people are shrinking in bonds and wretchedness they have increased this grandeur and prosperity and have enabled the individuals thus advanced to lay additional weights and restrictions upon those people who but for this ridiculous pomp of patronage might be enabled with bold independence to lift up their heads and to the front of grandeur and oppression proclaim we are your equals as individual men as an aggregate body we are your superiors and you who call yourselves    our masters are servants whose duty it is to administer to our happiness it is for this you are paid for this you are supported in state and luxury for this that every labourer among us even to the lowest drudge whom you have the insolence to despise contents to bestow upon you a part of that property which his toil has created these fatal successes also have begot a lust of dominion in the country which is unfortunately too generally felt even by the great mass of the people to whom its fruit is nothing but increase of slavery hence the poor wretch shivering in nakedness hence the poor soldier who toils and bleeds for a scanty maintenance talks of the glory and grandeur of his country—talks of foreign conquests and great exploits without remembering that the only advantages to him are wounds and disease a family left to beggary and himself an outcast from that society of which he ought to be a member and which while he thinks he is protecting it he is assisting to enslave and ruin citizens it is in vain that we attempt to disguise the truth we may dress our opinions in as many pompous ornaments as we please but these attempts at external grandeur so much beyond the inherent strength and powers of the nation must beget and have begot—internal weakness hence we no longer feel that bold and manly consequence which occasioned britons once to suppose that their fleets were their only bulwarks and their breasts burning with the enthusiasm of liberty and independence the only fortifications necessary to secure this country and protect its liberty and its prosperity feeling this internal weakness but unwilling to confess it our ministers have at once amused and abused with a heap of ridiculous plans and projects to supply by adventitious aid that which can only depend upon the internal virtues of the soul hence the duke of richmonds ridiculous project of building fortifications all round the coast and thus walling out the ocean i suppose for the ocean is the only enemy that walls of earth and stone can keep away to think of protecting the country by these castles built with cards—for card castles would be of as much importance as the castles his grace of richmond has planned to expect by these ridiculous weak expiring expedients to protect a country which once looked to its own heart for its protection and wished for no vigour and no energy but that which the honest feelings of independence could impart to its martial arm to think i say of prolonging the existence of such  0 a country by such means shews that the disease is not merely corporeal that the nobler parts have yielded to the assault and that the intellects are as much enfeebled as the fibre you remember citizens that this plan of general fortification was rejected by the casting vote of the speaker—with one puff of air he blew down all the fine projects which his grace had so long been forming the pasteboard machinery sunk thro the trap doors of st stephens theatre and lo and behold the scene in the pantomime being changed you were presented with the comic spectacle of my uncle toby with his crutch upon his shoulder exercising his imaginary troops and storming ideal castles upon his bowling green but the noble projector was not thus to be disappointed though the parliament had rejected his plan for a general fortification—and it is a woeful picture of the energy and virtue of that parliament to reflect that it was only rejected by a casting voice though thus rejected he knew that there was another assembly which was not always known it is true to have the power of adopting in parties what the parliament had in toto rejected but in which no majority would oppose him where it was proposed that he should try his hand upon a narrower scale unanimity—unanimity you know is the favorite maxim of cabinets and they would be unfit to share the power and the patronage of a great nation who would quarrel among themselves about such a trifling circumstance as the expenditure of a few millions of the public money they saw that the poor man had fixed his heart upon it and so lest he should take on and fret himself about it they even saddled his hobbyhorse at the public expence and let him canter away at his pleasure fortifications have accordingly started up all over the country particularly at portsmouth where any man who has the disposition and an hour or twos leisure may have as fine an opportunity of laughing at the expensive absurdities with which his grace has chosen to saddle the nation as any man who wishes to amuse himself at his own cost could desire there you may behold immense fortifications which must have cost millions of money so magnificent and so capacious that all the troops in british pay would not be numerous enough to man them there you may behold portholes stopped up with cannon placed behind them and portholes that are open without any cannon at all    but citizens how comes it that these great projects are thus neglected is it that his grace of richmond and his fortifications are now the common jest of all the country and that the people in their risibility forget the millions upon millions which they have paid for the support of them and for which they pay a dearer price for the bread that goes into their mouths for the meat that should supply the strength and vigour for their frame—surely we cannot suspect any part of the british cabinet of such weakness as attending either to the ridicule or the complaints of the swinish multitude how comes it then that these great projects have been neglected certainly this does not arise from his grace having been—i was going to say drummed out of the ministerial regiment—but it matters not in what sort of manner i describe it—from his grace being no longer in that place of power which he formerly filled with so much lustre—a lustre which nothing but the wisdom and virtue of his first female progenitor could outvie this i say is not the cause for this neglect began to be conspicuous before his grace had thought of resigning his post the fact is that internal danger called off the attention of his grace from the external means of defence and he was obliged to neglect the fortifications at portsmouth to direct the whole energies of his powerful mind towards securing and fortifying the tower of london in which by a sort of divine forecast he perceived that traitors of a most dangerous description were by and by to be concealed and as he knew very well that nothing but strong fortification could resist the furious assaults of conventional reformers he made the bastille of london so strong that it would now almost resist an army of eight and forty bridewell boys for eight and forty hours yes citizens from sapient projects of external security ministerial attention was called to the dangerous perils that threatened the internal safety of their constitution places and pensions were declared in a state of siege sinecures honours and emoluments were likely to be invaded the fortifications of patronage and corruption were like to have been thrown down the coronet seemed to totter upon the empty head and the star to tremble at the hollow heart to avert these horrors—to resist this danger his grace of richmond and his coadjutors hastened with patriotic zeal and portsmouth and its fortifications were left to finish and defend themselves    new dangers require new means of security and barracks were now to be every were erected in which the soldiery shut up out of the hearing of the profane jargon of jacobinical reformers may repose in ease and quiet and be starved for want of that assistance from the great mass of the people which they might otherwise derive but citizens i will venture to prophecy that of all the projects of the present administration and surely no administration was ever more fruitful of projects of a particular description there never was one so fraught with danger to the peace liberty and happiness of the country—there never was one so replete with unconstitutional violations of every principle that has long been dear to this country as this of burying the british soldiery alive in barracks the alarming attempt to separate the soldiery from that mass of fellow citizens of whom they are a part to whom they are allied and whom it is their duty to protect in the full enjoyment of their liberty and happiness and not to be made the instruments of their oppression and ruin but the honest soldiery of britain will not be so deluded duty generous affection—interest alike forbid it for if the people are ruined and oppressed what are the soldiery but a part of the people their ruin their oppression their misery must be the consequence with the aggravated horror of reflecting that by securing the misery of their fellow citizens they have paved the way to their own chains and destruction will they consent to forge base fetters for their freeborn countrymen and then for their reward like the military machines of german despots be sold like beasts in the public market and hired out like assassins to deeds of murder for the benefit of a lawless court citizens you will remember—every individual acquainted with the history of the country will remember the precautions taken by our ancestors to prevent the possibility of a separation of interests and feelings between the soldiery and the great mass of the people one of the precautions to prevent this and to preserve a perpetual remembrance that every soldier is in reality a citizen and that it is the country he is to defend and not two or three people of high rank and office who too frequently send this soldiery to be butchered to promote their ambition—one of these jealous precautions was the total preclusion of a standing army i say the total preclusion of a standing army for i mean boldly to assert for i am ready to prove that a standing army is not only no    part of the constitution but it is a direct violation of that constitution and mark by a standing army of this country i mean an army of individuals who having once received the pay of government are therefore considered as having become slaves for life without the power of ever laying down their arms again if they wish to withdraw from the profession and without a power in the people to disband them whenever the termination of war renders it no longer necessary that their occupation should be continued and to restore them with proper reward with affection thanks and esteem into the bosoms of their friends and families to preclude the necessity of this standing army it will be remembered that an expedient of the utmost wisdom and propriety was invented that of arming a certain proportion or upon occasion the whole inhabitants of the country under the denomination of a militia an army which was always within the controul of the people whose officers were originally appointed by the districts in which they were raised and who thereby became the soldiers of the people and not the soldiers of the court when men are the soldiers of the people they will defend the people when they are the soldiers of the court the court will attempt to persuade them that they have an interest separate from the people and therefore liberty cannot be secured in so firm a manner in any other way as by arming the people themselves alternately man after man every one taking his share of the risk and burthen to defend the great interests of the people thus by dismissing them in their turns to mix with that body of the people whom they have at one time stepped forward to defend and taking others to be trained to the use of arms you in a considerable degree at the same time that you take care that every soldier shall be a citizen make every citizen a soldier that is you teach every man the use of arms and every man being equally able to defend himself it will be impossible for any faction either of clubs which designing alarmists pretend to dread or boroughmongers which the nation at large has so much reason to dread to overawe the honest majority of the nation by this means also you prevent those scenes of desolation with which the struggles of the people to get rid of tyranny is at all times sure to be attended citizens it is impossible to be blind to the great consequences that result from this system it is impossible to avoid seeing that every soldier being only a soldier for a time must have a common interest with the people it is impossible    to avoid seeing that by this means every citizen will alternately stand a chance of procuring a knowledge of the use of arms and on the other hand that it will be impossible for any separate faction to trample upon the rights and happiness of the great body of the people but there is another thing of great consequence and importance relative to this part of the argument which may perhaps command and which certainly ought to command the attention of ministers it is impossible to avoid seeing that by adopting these means you are in reality more secure from foreign invasion than you can be from any standing army because then the whole body of the people become soldiers and every individual is ready and able to step forward to the frontiers and expose his bosom against those who attempt to invade his country to pillage his little property and to destroy those comforts which his useful industry has procured for himself and family but if we pursue the thread of history we shall find that the house of stuart particularly after their disgraceful restoration contributed in a very considerable degree to the invasion of this great security of constitutional liberty that is to say when this country was unfortunately struck with such blindness and infatuation as to restore charles ii to that absolute dominion for usurping which they had justly deprived his father charles i of his life that profligate tyrant seeing that despotism was no way to be attained but by rendering a small part of the people capable of coercing the great body seeing that it was impossible to persuade the great majority of the country to surrender their liberties but that he must work his way by a minority he took precautions to establish a standing army that is to say he took certain citizens from out of the great mass of the people stript them of their liberty stript them of their right of free agency stript them of the power of returning to their families and living in peace tranquillity and ease and thus from the scanty pay which he took care to give them—much better however proportionately than they receive now keeping them in a state of dependency upon his bounty made them fit instruments of whatever oppression he might think fit to exercise against his people unfortunately at the time of the revolution the liberties of this country such was the degraded situation of britain were thought not any longer capable of being secured by the arms of the people alone and therefore the whigs and the    tories coalesced together and brought over a foreign king protected by a foreign army and thus in reality foisted a band of mercenaries upon the nation who however good however excellent the cause in which they were brought were notwithstanding that still to be considered with a jealous eye as being mercenaries and to be considered as having in some degree the power of treating us like a conquered people tho from the principles upon which this revolution was said to have been conducted it ought certainly to have established our liberties upon such broad and general principles as to have restored the people to the right and honour of defending themselves and to have stripped all mercenaries of the power of daring to interfere with the concerns of this powerful nation citizens it is impossible to do justice by way of digression to the innumerable mischiefs that result from the interference of any foreign power in the concerns of any nation there is nothing so diabolical in the whole system of machiavelian politics as the attempt of one country to interfere with the internal concerns of another if the people are disposed to change and alter the mode of their government or to alter the dynasty of their kings they have a right so to do and if they are disposed unanimously or by a great majority so to do they have the power of doing it but no party or set of men ought to attempt to enforce any change or alteration upon the people which the people are not by a decided majority inclined to adopt here therefore is one evil that must necessarily result from any revolution effected by foreign arms that you never know in the first place whether it is the revolution of a faction or the revolution of the great body of the people and in the next place it is sure to be accompanied with a degree of undue and undefined power produced by mercenary coercion which is eminently injurious to that large and liberal principle of liberty which the progress of reason and the enlightened spirit of a nation will be able to procure when no foreign interference is courted or permitted this was particularly the case with respect to the event i am now speaking of and william iii having been seated on the throne by a foreign force and having parted with his dutch guards not without exclaiming by god if i had a son these guards should not be sent back took the opportunity which the ambiguous circumstances of this revolution afforded to fortify his authority by a standing army    and thus one of the first fruits of this glorious revolution was the establishment of a standing army more numerous than the stewarts themselves had ever upheld but we have not got to the end of the chapter yet the invasion of the constitutional rights of the people by a standing army was in the first instance small and it was found necessary not only to extend this military establishment but also to oppress the poor soldiers who were to be the instruments of those persons before the grand views and objects of courts could be well effected accordingly in the reign of queen anne when a very large increase took place in the military establishment an alteration also took place which stripped the poor soldiery of a considerable portion of their pay i shall illustrate this by facts previous to that increase of the military establishment the principal offices in the army had been rather posts of honour than emolument rather places of trust and dignity than places that secured to the individual an increase of patronage and thereby rendered him at once more inclined to be servile and cringing to the power above him and more capable of reducing those below him to a state of abject terror and dependence but when this increase of the establishment took place the colonels who used to advance money out of their own pockets that they might occasion the soldiers to be better dressed and provided for and to make a more comfortable and more respectable appearance in the eyes of their fellow citizens—the colonels thought that this was a practice they might very well lay aside and instead of putting themselves to expence in order to increase the comforts of the common soldiers they began very seriously to reflect by what means they could turn the pay of the common soldiers to their own interest and advantage how they might bring money into their pockets instead of sending it out of them accordingly we find that from this time a regular stoppage was made out of the pay of the soldiery at the rate of  d per day which amounted to  l os  0d per year for the article of cloathing now citizens i have been informed by a person who has very considerable concerns in those trades which interfere with the cloathing of the soldiery that out of this  l os  0d per year which is stopped out of the soldiers pay there is in reality never more expended than from  0s to   s per year so that the colonel out of the pay of every man under    pretence of cloathing him gets in reality what may be called fleecing money to the amount of   s per year which taking  00 soldiers to a regiment amounts to    l a year sheered from the backs of the poor soldier in addition to that enormous pay which he receives as colonel and which ought undoubtedly to be considered only as a proper reward for the dignity and advantage which a man of birth and condition in life confers upon the army of this country by exhibiting his fine person before it three or four times in a year in a suit of gold laced cloaths of the finest scarlet but the peculation does not stop here for mark the growth of corruption corruption is a towering weed it is in short that grain of mustard seed often talked of but never before understood which once dropped upon any soil becomes a towering tree and the birds of the air and the beasts of the field priests ministers and pensioners—all animals of prey take shelter under its foliage corruption having risen to this height soon spreads to a more considerable degree for if you look through the roll of the army and examine the situations and the additions of rank added to the name of every colonel in the army you will find very few colonels but what have also other appointments in the army of still higher rank and dignity either as generals or majorgenerals or some other distinction of honour and emolument this in reality reduces the colonel of the regiment to a mere sinecure officer a person receiving a certain pay for no other service than that of bearing the title to which that pay is annexed and giving himself the trouble to send to the proper place for receiving the money when it becomes due for there is a sort of etiquette in the army which ordains that no officer who holds an appointment of superior rank shall ever perform any duty in the inferior rank and though a man is both general and colonel at the payoffice yet his rank as general precludes him from doing any duty as colonel in the field or on the parade—ergo the colonel is a useless office in the army because the supposed duties of that office are performed by other persons bearing titles of less dignity and receiving their pay according to that inferior station thus in reality the whole service that the colonel renders to his country for his pay and for this    l a year fleeced from the backs of the soldiers is no other than stalking about with all the pageantry of military authority and ornamenting an assembly or a levee with his cockade and sword    but citizens i have not yet got to the end even of that small portion of facts relative to the unjust and cruel peculations committed upon our brave soldiers which have come to my knowledge one of the advantages resulting from a commons house of parliament by whomsoever it may be bought or by whomsoever it may be sold whomsoever it may represent or whomsoever it may despise because it does not represent them—one advantage resulting from such a house of commons is that now and then in the warmth of those disputes that arise in a squabble for places and pensions indiscreet individuals who happen to be charged with more information than they can hold suffer it to boil out in the froth of debate and the people get thereby possession of a few facts of which they would otherwise be kept in profound ignorance for ever you will remember some time ago a very pretty pretence that was made of making an additional provision for our gallant soldiers in the debate upon this subject it was admitted by sir george young who at present does not take much share in the debates of the house of commons you know being better employed at the mint this sir george young was obliged to acknowledge during the investigation of that subject that there was sixpence a week stopped by the paymaster out of the pay of every soldier for necessaries and he in the course of his speech observed that some how or another—for these were the words he made use of—some how or another it happened that this sixpence a week sometimes amounted to eighteenpence or two shillings stopped for necessaries to be provided for the soldiery now it did so happen that in the whole of that immaculate house whose virtues whose independence and whose enthusiastic attachment to the people we never can sufficiently admire and reverence—it did so happen that in the whole of that house there was not found one member so metaphysical though metaphysical members we know there are in that house as to enquire what was the meaning of those words some how or another these words seemed so impossible to be understood or the investigation of them seemed to be so dangerous that they passed them over in silence or as the good old venerable dames who teach school in our little country villages more technically express it they skipped it go on child—go on says the dame i cant go on says the boy i cant read this word maam—spell it child—spell    it—i cant spell it says the boy—why then skip it child mayhap its latin so neither the great boys nor yet the old women in st stephens school being able either to read or spell this some how or another or to tell whether it were latin greek hebrew or esquimaux they even skipped it and went on to the next verse which was a vote of   000l per year of the public money to cover the peculation thus citizens you see that resulting from this system of a standing army independent of its tendency to reduce the great body of the people to an ignorance of the use of arms independent of the circumstance that it renders one part of the people liable to be called out to destroy and trample upon another independent of the circumstance that instead of the defence of the nation being vested in the hands of the nation the defence of the nation becomes vested in the hands of the minister and thereby that which was meant for defence is frequently made an instrument of destruction independent of all this there is the patronage there is the corruption there is the particular emolument resulting to those who batten upon the plunder of poor beings who toil and sweat and bleed for their protection poor unprotected soldiery of britain and is it thus you are subjected to the dominion of a few beings far far less worthy than yourselves did ye but know your worth and who treat you as objects whom they are to scourge for their caprice or gratification as objects whom they are to starve for their benefit and advantage and having reduced you to their dominion of slavery and terror to make you the objects of terror to others for the security of their own aggrandizement and corruptions but citizens notwithstanding all these encroachments there was one great advantage which this country and the soldiery of this country possessed till very lately with respect to the military establishment i remember sir william blackstone the doctrines in whose commentaries were once considered as the highest pitch of aristocratic assumption but which are so mild and moderate compared with the monstrous doctrines supported by the present administration that the friends of liberty are now glad to fly for protection under the tory wing of that courtly magistrate—i remember that this judge blackstone exults in his commentaries as one of the chief objects of constitutional security in this country that though we had a standing army yet it was not an army of men separate  00 and distinct from the people it was an army of men who lived among the people who mixed with the people who were quartered upon the people who were in all respect upon terms of fellowship and communion with the people and that it was totally impossible to keep them in ignorance of the general concerns and interests of the nation or the subjects that provoked investigation at the time because they were not like the armies of foreign despots shut up in barracks and excluded in consequence from the conversation of their fellow citizens but if this was one of the grand constitutional boasts of this country—if judge blackstone in his commentaries upon the law of england laid this down as the grand palladium of the security of british liberty and as the only consolation for the admission of a standing army among us what is british liberty at this period—look where you will—turn to what part of the nation you think fit—enquire in this neighbourhood or the other east west north or south what do you hear but rumours of erecting barracks—and levies and contributions a large part of which must be appropriated to the enormous expence of building those barracks in which the soldiery are to be immured and in which they are to lose their small degree of remaining liberty by being deprived of the opportunity of employing themselves in their peaceful vocations they are to be robbed even of that fragment of locomotive liberty which the very brutes in the wilderness enjoy without restraint—the right of moving from place to place the right of turning here or there even in the intervals of duty and seeking their society among persons whose conversation is agreeable to them or for whom they have formed an affection or attachment one of the smallest calamities that result from this system of barracks is the increased expence to the nation for every individual must see that it is impossible to maintain an army in barracks with the same expence as an army may be maintained when at liberty a large part of the accommodation of the soldier while mixing with the bulk of the people he derives from those exertions by which he assists the labours of his fellow citizens and promotes a reciprocation of kind offices of this he is entirely robbed and this must be some how or other supplied it is not then merely the expence of erecting those bastilles or dungeons that are to confine the degraded and insulted soldiery they are also to be maintained at an expence greater within those dungeons than that  0  at which they might be better maintained in greater liberty mixing with their fellow citizens and exchanging good offices with them but that expence grievous and burdensome as it is is nothing to the evils resulting from this system i shall not call again to your view the tendency it has to separate the soldier from the citizen but as a counterpart of this operation i must not notice its tendency to engender a ferocity of disposition for though soldiers are men and have dispositions no more inclined by nature to rancour than other men yet when they are shut up with men only whose trade if i may call it such is death when they are thus prevented from mixing with the innocent and estimable part of the softer sex and when all the other circumstances attendant upon such confinement are taken into consideration we cannot but dread the production of a degree of ferocity which they would never otherwise know thus it is that the regular and orderly governments of this refined and civilized age do all they can to change the nature of man into the nature ferocity and cruelty of the brute to tread the light of intellect in the dust to drive away from the breast of the soldier that milk of human kindness which is the greatest ornament of valour and to engender in its place the unsociable and ruffian ferocity which distinguishes the austrian the hessian and russian barbarians with which europe has so long been scourged thus it is we level that glorious distinction which till this time has lifted the british soldiery so much above every other soldiery of the world and made them pride themselves in humanity as much as valour but there is another point of view in which this system tends also to operate against the kindness and humanity of the soldiers breast the soldier becomes more oppressed and it is the nature of man to grow cruel by oppression witness the excesses committed in france excesses which could not have existed had not the people been so long trod under the hoofs of a swinish nobility i say a swinish nobility for the nobility of france were in reality the true swine of europe they were the men who wallowing perpetually in licentiousness to borrow a metaphor from shakespeare made their troughs in the embowelled bosoms of their countrymen and devoured or destroyed every thing which should have contributed to the happiness the welfare and glory of the universe  0  i say then citizens by the cruelty and oppression of the system of confining the soldiery within barracks you do that which may tend not only to make them less worthy members of society but to rob them of those comforts and that happiness to which they are entitled and to reduce them to a situation of greater misery than they would otherwise have been exposed to by these means perhaps it is wished to reduce the soldiery to a more abject dependence upon the government—to make them believe they have nothing to expect but from the ministry to teach them to suppose the people are not their friends to make an artificial distinction between them and in a manner to say to them—what do you partake from the people is not your pay from us—is not your food from us—are not the little indulgencies that we think fit occasionally now and then to extend to you all from us—is it not to us that you owe the ticket by which you are to buy your meat at a cheaper rate than the other citizens—do not all these things come from us—if the poor soldier is shut up from all intercourse with society they think perhaps that he may be disposed to answer yes but if he goes abroad among his fellow citizens and receives kindness from them and converses with them he will be able to answer no it is from the people all from the people all nay not only do the people pay for our support not only do the people pay for our cloathing but we tell you also that the people pay for yours our scanty meal our scanty cloathing is not an alms received from you no it is a part and but a small part of that just—that liberal and benevolent compensation which the people of this country are disposed to extend towards us and which in point of real pay and taxation they do extend but which in passing through the sieves of secretaries paymasters agents and contractors becomes most miserably diminished before it comes to us from them also you receive your gilded coaches that engender your proud diseases both of mind and body—from them you receive all your power your emoluments your distinctions and your luxuries and were it not for them you would be less than the least of those whom you pretend to despise less than the least of us whom you treat with this inhumanity and threaten with that situation to which you shall never reduce us because soldiers are freemen soldiers are britons and the feelings of humanity shall  0  not be torn from our bosoms by all the stripes you inflict and the severities of your military tribunals such then are the consequences of barracks they have a tendency to separate the soldiery from the people who are in reality one and the same they have a tendency to increase the burdens of the people they have a tendency to rob the soldiery of the greater part of those little comforts which from the present institutions of society they can expect they have also a tendency to keep up suspicion and distrust and increase the mountebank system of alarm and thus enable the jugglers of the day to play off their tricks with more eclat and prevent that discovery which if ever it should take place may bring them to account and may compel them to refund the ill gotten wealth extracted from the groans and ruin of the country but what are likely to be the consequences of all this has not a spirit of enquiry been long abroad have not the seeds of truth think you already fallen upon the soldiers minds are they the only set of men who have not begun to enquire citizens these artifices are vain i know that soldiers have been threatened and sometimes actually punished with dungeons and kept upon bread and water for reading a patriotic newspaper i know that some soldiers of the scotch battalion of guards now in the tower were threatened with confinement and with stripes for subscribing together to take in the gazetteer if they had subscribed to the times or the true briton—oh that ever the name of briton should be so prostituted that such a farrago of prostitution falsehood absurdity and contemptible scurrility should ever be stamped upon the forehead with the name of briton and that a man should be found throughout the country to give countenance to such a libel upon the national character if this had been the paper they had subscribed for there would have been no threats of stripes and dungeons for they have no objection to the soldiers or any other persons reading provided they would read nothing but the prostituted trash published by reeves and his associators or the farrago issued from the frantic brain of burke they are poor deluded shortsighted creatures however who have so narrow an opinion of the human intellect read read my fellow citizens it is better to read falsehood than nothing the trash produced by the pimps and  0  spies of the present day cannot but convince you of the falshood of arguments that appeal to such absurdity for support and countenance but have the soldiers received no sort of information have all the little pamphlets of the day escaped them after all the diligence which mr dundas about    months ago so pompously described of planting the highways and wimbledon common with seditious pamplets—what has the seed so sown no part of it found its way to the soldiers mess—and have the soldiers no wrongs to redress—what when sir henry clinton in a pamphlet lately published declares that a part of the spoil taken at charlestown has not even to this very day been divided among the brave soldiers who fought for the attainment of that conquest—such as it was—what after having bled and toiled many of them expired and others lost their limbs in the service of their country—as it was called—after all this are they or their widows and orphans defrauded of their part of the emolument did your officers and great naval commanders divide their thousands and ten thousands fourteen years ago and do great generals step forward to avow that the common soldiers remain defrauded to this day of their scanty pittance—and will not these wrongs convince the soldiery how much soever excluded from society that the abused and persecuted patriots who insist that reformation is required are not the enemies of their country or their countrys soldiery—are not the persons whose throats they ought to cut even if wretches were found profligate enough to issue such command do what they will so long as ministers and their agents continue to practice such injustice so long will the cause of truth be making rapid strides and the ultimate harvest will be that ministers and their agents in a few years time will no longer have the power to delude those whom they vainly suppose they can plunge into utter darkness and mental oblivion i could mention a great many other instances but it matters not dwelling upon particular circumstances the present situation of europe opens a wider field of enquiry we have found that men have rights we have found that men have capacities to understand those rights and spirit to assert them we have found that intelligence can only be extended in proportion as men enjoy those rights and we have found that virtue can only result from intelligence and therefore we have only to choose between liberty and virtue on the one  0  hand and ignorance vice and abject submission on the other having received these great truths facts and minute particulars when they can be brought forward may assist us a little in the prosecution of enquiry but the great principles are things to which we should be eternally resorting the events that have taken place in europe might be considered as a warning voice to ministers to induce them to reflect as citizen oconnor observes in that admirable speech which will illuminate unborn ages and confer immortal glory upon the man who delivered it—speaking of the treatment of the soldiery and of the attempts to separate the soldiers from the great body of the people he says do not depend on the bayonet for the support of your measures believe me that in proportion as your measures require force to support them in an exact proportion are they radically and mischievously bad believe me there is more strength in the affections and confidence of the people than if you were to convert every second house in the nation into barracks for the soldiery and when the gentlemen whom i have heard this night tell you that to act in contempt of the public opinion is spirit and firmness and that to act with a decent respect for that opinion is timidity and cowardice they make the character of the legislator to merge into the character of the duellist is it not enough that you live in the age and in the midst of the horrors of revolution to deter you from acting in contempt of the public opinion have you not had examples enough to convince you that men in throwing off the russet frock for the uniform of the soldier do not at all times throw away the ties of kindred and of blood have you not had examples enough to convince you that even soldiers cannot at all times be brought to shed the blood of their parents their kindred and their friends and we might add that soldiers also cannot always be kept in ignorance of the incontrovertible maxim that all mankind are brethren and that tho irish soldiers should be sent into england to cut the throats of englishmen or the english be sent into ireland to cut the throats of irishmen that in reality the englishman acting against the irishman is whetting a dagger that will reach the breast of his parent at home and the irishman acting against the english is also murdering his own relative at home yes they will see that it is only striking with the left hand instead of the right but that the blow is as certain  0  in this crosshanded fray as if brother pointed the bayonet at the breast of brother and the father were sabreing his own son he proceeds—and have you not had a great and memorable example to convince you that the soldiers of an odious gevernment may become the soldiers of the nation i would fain hope this warning voice should reach all the cabinets of europe that it should teach ministers to confess that not the men whom they proscribe and would destroy on account of their attachment to liberty are the enemies of the constitution not these are the jacobins as they chuse to call them but that the real jacobins are those who having seen the steps and measures which produced the revolution in france themselves being in power and having the opportunity dare to adopt the same measures and to pursue the very steps which rendered the revolution in france necessary and inevitable one would think they could not be blind to this conviction—that as similar causes will produce similar effects if they will adopt french oppressions french retaliations will take place and that upon their heads must fall the mischiefs that result from their vicious measures but citizens as i have objected to barracks and fortifications as i have objected to a standing army it may be asked what are the means i would advise in the present situation of society for the security of the country for no man can pretend to be blind to this plain and obvious fact that the country is in danger it is in some danger i believe from without from more quarters than is suspected for the mad and frantic measures of the administration of the country have roused a lion which they will not be able to soothe again to slumber they have conjured up a danger the whole extent of which they cannot perceive they have entered into a ridiculous alliance with the empress of russia under the vain hope of thus averting the catastrophe likely to fall upon the country but what have they done by this they have paved the way for the aggrandizement of their most dangerous and ambitious rival they have entered into a confederacy with a faithless woman the scourge of europe and blotted over with the most hideous crimes but if ever this woman shall bring her fleets into the ocean what is likely to be the conduct of russia taking her present system into consideration let us ask what is her interest and having asked that the ghost of a murdered husband shall tell you what sort of conduct she will adopt and what crimes she will stop at when her interest dictates  0  what is the interest then of this russian tyrant—why her interest is the destruction of the british navy she has nothing to do therefore but to appear to swell the bulk and importance of your navy to stimulate you into some attempt beyond the real force that you may carry with you and then desert you in the hour of battle and stand neuter while the enemy destroys your fleets then having been well subsidized she puts her subsidy in her pocket and pointing to the british nation with scorn ejaculates behold the salary you have paid me for insuring your destruction and my own aggrandizement it is not then by alliances it is not then by fortifications it is not then by barracks it is not then by a standing army that i would have you seek for security i would have you seek security in the first place by standing intrepidly but peaceably forward and demanding with unanimous voice the restoration of your rights shewing to the government of the country and to the ministers who are at the helm of that government that you have an enlightened conviction of the nature of your rights that you have a british determination to enjoy those rights making use also of this plain argument—there is but one way to make the people of any country unanimous and that is by giving them a common universal unanimous interest in the protection and prosperity of the country every man who has any thing to defend will stand boldly forward to defend it and that country where there is any man or any body of men who can be said to have nothing to defend that country may call itself a limited monarchy may call itself a free country or what it will but the plain and simple fact is that it is a country of slaves for the only distinction between freeman and slave is this—that a freeman has a stake in the country of which he is a member—has rights and the opportunity at least of procuring possessions while the slave has no stake at all no interest to bind him to the government under which he lives or to stimulate him to stand boldly forward and expose himself to defend that country of which he is a member make every man free and every man will be brave for freedom engenders courage if this were not the fact how does it happen that a neighbouring country whose population was so incompent to enable her to stand against this country while despotism prevailed should now lay prostrate at her feet the thrones and tyrannies of europe while the feeble arms of britain in vain endeavour  0  to prop their tottering cause and has almost fallen herself beneath the weight of that enormous ruin in which those tyrannies are involved it is then by a general system of liberty that gives every man an interest in the country that you can alone create that unanimity by which the country can be defended it is only by doing this that you can hope that every citizen in the hour of danger will become a soldier from the conviction that every soldier in the hour of peace will become again a citizen but this is a conviction this a system upon which i do not expect the present administration will act because i know that the instant such a system is established the gilded fabric of their ill gotten power must crumble into atoms and that part of the constitution which relates to the internal organization of the cabinet and to the system of boroughmongering—that part which is in fact an excrescence which corruption has planted upon the constitution will be wiped away the genuine constitution of britain will then shine forth with renovated splendour and liberty and equality justly defined and properly enjoyed will once more make britain an envied paradise in europe the lectures will recommence wednesday the  d of september  0  the tribune no xx the first lecture on allies and alliances with strictures on the faith of regular governments delivered wednesday may   th      note—this and the ensuing tribune are properly to be considered as concluding that course of lectures on the causes and calamities of war of which the first four were delivered at the beginning of the season and for which see vol i no         and   citizens the subject for the present evening is the modern system of allies and alliances with strictures on the faith of regular governments this subject is exceedingly extensive there are various points of view in which it may be treated and perhaps if we trace things to the foundation in whatever point of view we consider it we shall be inclined to doubt whether alliances such as are generally formed between nation and nation are more absurd in their principle or more dangerous in their practice the enquiry from the manner in which i find myself disposed to take it up divides itself into two heads first the political influence of these compacts between government and government and second their operation in a military point of view on the present evening i shall enter into an investigation only of that part of the subject which relates to the operation of these compacts upon the political liberty and civil rights of man what relates to the operation of alliances in the field of battle i shall defer till another evening—when i shall of course be led more at large into the characters of the present confederated powers of europe and into some speculations on the probable catastrophe of the present war   0 in the first place citizens i shall examine the arguments upon which the system of alliance is justified and shall consider how far these arguments may be opposed by others of more serious importance to mankind and perhaps when we enter seriously into the investigation we shall be obliged to confess that alliances are in general little other than combinations of particular governments to oppress and plunder not only the people of all other countries but even of their own the real principles of justice i believe and also the real principles of policy would teach us to observe a conduct exceedingly different from that which has been followed by the courts of europe not only during the present time but for centuries back i believe we should find that justice would dictate to us to do all the good in our power to all the nations of the world that policy would point out to us that the best things we can do for ourselves is really to promote the happiness and welfare of all the existing nations in the universe and that our best way to do that is to form no particular alliances compacts or treaties with any nation or any set or body of men whatever it is necessary for the happiness of mankind and it must be admitted as soon as examined that animosities of every description should be laid aside that human beings should consider each other as friends and as brothers and that they should seize all opportunities of advancing that fraternal felicity which nothing but such principles and such convictions can promote but it is evident if you form combinations of alliance at one time which are to dictate to you at future periods the events of which you cannot foresee that you must be frequently led to a direct violation of this principle compacts in their very nature inevitably proceed upon the shortsighted principle of self interest—or more properly of sordid jealousy and exclusion these combinations therefore set out in the first instance upon the narrow and unjustifiable project of promoting the interest of a few in opposition to the interests of the aggregate of the world and the strong probability is nay almost the certainty that the progress of events will shortly render the execution of these compacts even more unjust and impolitic than at the time of their first adoption courts however have paid very little regard in their practice to the grand rules either of moral conduct or national policy on the contrary all the cabinets of europe     have been perpetually endeavouring to foment animosities and aversions between the people of their respective nations and to draw the courts themselves into a closer union of compact and mutual understanding these combinations among the different rulers of different parts of the universe have for a long time gone on without exciting any degree of jealousy or enquiry among the people a sort of lethargic confidence seems to have taken possession of the minds of men and induced them readily to believe the tales of artful jugglers and hypocrites that those entrusted with the management of public affairs certainly must understand better what is for the public good than the public themselves and that therefore they were only to repeat by rote as parrots the lessons put into their mouths by their rulers without considering what were the ideas affixed or whether they conveyed any ideas at all but citizens i believe this is not precisely the case at this time a spirit of enquiry has gone very widely abroad a spirit which i do not think all the exorcisms of priests the persecutions of ministers or even the machinations of that arch inquisitor reeves himself will ever be able to lay the fact is that people begin to discover this truth that all the people of all the nations of the earth have one common interest and one common cause which it is their duty zealously to promote the machinations against which they are called upon anxiously to watch and vigilantly nay if necessary bravely to oppose this interest—this cause is the preservation of liberty peace and universal justice this cause which can flourish only by suppressing the malevolent passions and cultivating a disposition to universal benevolence if ever it triumphs annihilates at once the systems of nationality and cabinet alliances and unites the people of all climes and latitudes under the peaceful banner of fraternity if this statement is seriously and coolly considered if we strip ourselves of the animosities of faction and the attachments of party if we take away from this system the miscolouring and misrepresentations with which those who cannot controvert its principles have endeavoured to calumniate its supporters i believe it will bring immediate conviction to the heart of man for who can doubt for an instant that peace is better than slaughter who can doubt for an instant that all national aversion and hatred to persons on account     of their sects their opinions nations climate language or colour are hostile to those generous and noble feelings of philanthropy without which peace cannot be preserved and the general intercourse and happiness of mankind cannot be promoted let us enquire then whether alliances even abstractedly considered have a tendency to promote this disposition so desirable for the happiness of the universe let us consider also—and perhaps it would be well to consider this in the first place—whether even if alliances could be admitted in themselves to be good alliances upon the present principle of machiavelian policy are of that description which would be desirable admitting for the instant that alliances ought to be tolerated what ought to be their object and principle and what is the nature of the alliances that are generally formed do they arise from the people of the contracting—or rather the contracted nations mixing and confederating together and arguing with each other upon their respective views and interests and learning the real dispositions and qualities of each others hearts and thence entering into such compacts and treaties as grow out of their conviction of mutual utility or do they in reality grow out of those cabals and confederacies which a certain set of honourable spies called consuls and ambassadors carry on frequently to the disgrace of morality and the destruction of every virtuous candid and liberal principle which ought to be cherished in the human heart if the seed is bad let us not expect that the fruit will be good if you sow nightshade in your fields not bread but poison will be your harvest if you sow treachery venality intrigue and selfishness in your national intercourses do not expect to reap friendship faith and national advantage for your harvest can only be disappointment contention and the sword the plain and simple fact is i believe that the people are always kept in the dark as to the real objects of all alliances at present formed between the courts of europe they are anxiously prevented from knowing not only what were the motives but what are the objects and are hardly ever acquainted with the real tenor of the compact there are it is true certain general articles with which you are to be acquainted and upon the faith of which you are to pay your money—  00000 pounds perhaps at a time but if any over inquisitive individual should indulge a dangerous disposition     to know more than ministers think fit to reveal he is silenced at once by some member of the political priesthood who scruples not to avow with the true air of diplomatic mystery that there may be secret articles behind the screen but warns the profane enquirer not to approach with impious interrogatories the sanctum sanctorum of cabinet confederacy so that while you believe you are paying a nation to fight your wars and defend your interests abroad you may perhaps be hiring foreign mercenaries to cut your throats at home but citizens i am for my own part much inclined to believe that alliances conducted upon whatever principle will be found injurious to the happiness and welfare of nations i have always seen during that little intercourse which i have had with the world that the quantum of advantage produced by the individual exertions of any given number of persons each toiling and labouring separately has been very superior to the quantum of benefit or advantage produced by the same number of persons bound together by compact and combination and accordingly it has been very justly observed that when pope swift arbuthnot and gay united together to compose a particular work they all four clubbing their wits wrote a great deal worse than any one of them ever did when he trusted to his own individual genius and imagination it is so in every thing to which the physical or mental powers of the individual are any way competent whatever can be done by an individual is always better done singlehanded than when the same thing is attempted by several persons combined together i not mean to say that there is no benefit and advantage in mutual exertions and labour there are certain things which are beyond the strength which are beyond the longevity of man which it would nevertheless be very useful to society to have accomplished and there are certain undertakings which in a great measure depend and very properly depend upon numbers and combination chiefly for their success and therefore it is necessary for persons to enter into combinations when any such work is to be undertaken but i mean to contend that when the business is not of such a nature that it requires a larger portion of physical strength a larger portion of longevity than can be commanded by an individual nor is of that kind to which united suffrage is requisite to give it the stamp of justice and the capability of success—when neither of these is the case the individual     does better to trust to the powers the energies of his own intellect and capacities than to strengthen and fortify himself as he supposes but in reality to debilitate himself by depending upon the united efforts of other persons the question then is—whether the interests and concerns of nations are of that description that they require a combination of several nations together or whether they are of that description that the individual nation can execute them by depending upon itself alone for it must be observed that in many respects nations resemble individuals and the arguments that will apply to the individual will frequently apply to the nation considered as an aggregate individual also i do not mean to say that this is universally the case whoever argues by simile is in danger of falling into sophistry and therefore let me warn you whenever similitudes are offered to you from this or any other place to examine what are the particular features and accompaniments of the things compared for there are points always at which they do and others at which they do not touch but with respect to the general principles i have laid down i believe you will find that the individual body and the social body do exactly agree that is to say that whatever can be done by the individual nation will be better done by that individual nation than by any combination and alliance of various nations and that combinations and alliances of various nations ought only to be encouraged when the undertaking is of that description that in the nature of things an individual nation could not accomplish it as would be the sublime projects of dr darwin if indeed they can be regarded as practicable at all for ameliorating the condition and correcting the climates of the globe which we inhabit but there is another point at which i suspect the comparison does not touch for tho there are certain undertakings for which it is advantageous for individuals to combine there are strong reasons for supposing that there is none certainly there are very few objects that it is for the welfare of a nation to pursue but what it can pursue and accomplish by its own individual exertions in short putting out of our calculations the benevolent visions of philosophers and considering the characters and pursuits of nations such as they hitherto have been i am much inclined to suspect as you never can produce the same intimate connection between nation and nation as between individual and individual as you never can produce the same     mutual intercourse of mind and thorough comprehension of the views and objects of each so we shall find that all those undertakings which cannot be accomplished by an individual nation are of that description that it is a great deal better never to undertake at all for nothing but disgrace ruin and infamy generally have attended or i believe ever can attend undertakings of so extensive and complicated a nature as to make national confederacies necessary to their conduct but there is one circumstance in which this parallel between individuals and communities certainly very closely agrees namely the energy the vigour and resources of intellect which standing independent of all other supports has a tendency to generate in the character the man who trusts to friends to promises and to professions to extricate himself from embarrassment or to attain the advantages he looked for generally meets with nothing but disappointment and at last after trammelling himself with inefficient obligations is left to the pursuit of his original object in a worse condition than he set out with a mind stripped of half its vigour an imagination clouded a judgment embarrassed and a spirit deprived of that keenness and ardour with which if he had always been in the habit of depending upon his own individual exertions he would have been able to have pressed forward to the attainment of his wishes is it or is it not so with nations consult the facts of history consult if you will the analogies of reasoning—i believe abstract reasoning would convince you that the arguments are still more potent with respect to the nation than the individual but if you love an easier task turn over the pages of history and see whether facts do not bear me out in the assertion i have made tell me ye historians—i will endure interruption if any man can tell me such an instance what great what noble what glorious atchievement ever was accomplished by a number of nations in alliance and combination but if you want to know the glorious atchievements of individual nations even petty little states so small that their numbers would hardly people a secondrate city in france—if you want the glorious atchievements they have accomplished turn to the histories of the little states of greece consult the histories of athens and lacedemon those names for ever glorious—for ever dear to the heart that pants for liberty those small but magnificent republics which like stars in the political and intellectual firmament     will shine for ever as examples to mankind and light us in the path of excellence think of the great exploits of leonidas of themistocles of epaminondas—think of the glorious struggles of thermopoly of salamis of marathon—think of the astonishing atchievements which throng in the historic page of greece and of rome consider also the unconquerable energy displayed by the arabian tribes under mahomet and the early leaders of that religion which by the sword of unassociated valour was established over so large a portion of the earth not by the numbers not by the potency wealth or resources of the tribes who made those conquests but by that unity that individuality if i may so express myself which knit and combined the little bands of heroes and the enthusiasts together and occasioned them to have but one head one heart one object and pursuit but whenever alliances have been made we have always found that the nations thus allied have become enfeebled we have histories and records of alliances innumerable if i were to go largely into them i should forestall a part of that which is to be the subject of my second lecture i shall therefore neither dwell upon the crusades of ancient nor of modern times at present but shall refer them to their proper slation in the second branch of my enquiry i think i have said enough and every individual will be able to recollect enough to prove my position that nations as well as individuals are enfeebled by extraneous dependencies—by alliances treaties and combinations there is another part of the mischiefs however of those alliances which must not be passed over in silence it is their inevitable tendency to spread the mischiefs and the ravages of hostility through a much wider circle than could otherwise be affected by the rival interests the mistakes and passions of mankind alliances have been fruitful sources of calamity this part of the established system of regular governments alone has done more to ruin and depopulate nations than all the gloomy passions that ever inhabited the breasts of men nay than the ambition of princes and ministers themselves would ever have been able to accomplish without this powerful engine the hostility which grows between nation and nation but for this might be settled by the contest between the two parties but the system of alliance diffuses the mischief from pole to pole and if two neighbouring nations choose to contend     about the navigation of a river the possession of an inaccessible rock or a barren mountain the consequence is that the flames of war are to be kindled from nation to nation the whole universe is to be disturbed the peasant of every clime is to be torn from his useful occupation to the field of death and the matrons of the most distant nations to behold their infants quartered by the hand of war it has been pretended however that small countries or countries of but little political force would not be able to protect themselves and would consequently be trampled upon by their more powerful neighbours if it was not for this system of alliance let us enquire what sort of foundation there is for this observation or rather let us enquire what sort of effect has been produced in this respect by this boasted system of justice and generous protection if security to the weak has resulted from these confederacies of which courts and ministers are so fond there is then some colour of vindication altho i contend that the principles of justice and sound policy would produce this effect still better without any such alliances justice would dictate to me that if i am a strong man and my neighbour is weak i am not to suffer another strong man merely because he is strong to break into my neighbours house and destroy him i do not mean to say that you are not to lend assistance to those who are absolutely wronged i only say you are not to make alliances and combinations by which you agree that however a quarrel may begin whoever may be right whoever may be wrong for this is always the sense though not the express wording of every treaty of alliance you are to make yourselves a party in the quarrels and projects of your ally by whomsoever insulted or whomsoever he may insult it is the alliance not the principle of justice of protecting the weak against the tyranny of the strong that i censure and though there was no treaty of alliance between the court of st jamess and the court of warsaw yet if one half of that wealth squandered in this country against the liberty of france had been spent to protect the poles from that destruction which a combination of despots has brought upon them i should have gloried in the magnanimity of a nation which had stepped forward to save an oppressed and a virtuous people from the jaws of tyrannous destruction i should have rejoiced the more in the conviction that they did it from the dictates of their honest and virtuous hearts and not from the compulsive or supposed compulsive circumstance     of there being a treaty of mutual assistance between the respective powers but what stronger argument can we have of the impotency and absurdity of these treaties than the very circumstance of the fate of poland the court of prussia enters into an alliance with the court of warsaw by which they bind themselves to mutual protection and good friendship yet by and by true to the machiavelian maxim that a prince is never to observe his promises any longer than it is to his own interest forth steps the virtuous and pious representative of the regular government of prussia to make an alliance with the still more humane pious and virtuous representative of the regular government of russia and the sapient the just and magnificent representative of the regular government of germany and they make a fresh compact and a fresh alliance—for the protection of poland no for the division of poland with whom this self same king of prussia this juggling mountebank in gold and purple—this king of threads and patches had formerly made a treaty of alliance and support but it ends not here you have only got to the fourth act of the farcical tragedy in all probability the fifth is now in rehearsal and by and by we may have a treaty between the emperor of germany and the empress of russia against this self same king of prussia with whom hitherto they have been in alliance that they may for the better preservation of the balance of europe beat him out of the share of the plunder yet such are the allies we subsidize such are the powers to purchase whose faithful assistance we strip the poor labourer of every comfort and necessary of existence make his marriage bed a curse and turn the fruitful issue of his love into plagues and scorpions harrowing his imagination and piercing his ears with the cries of want to one of these precious allies in the midst of all our national distresses   00000 pounds are to be lavished how much we are to give to the other is yet perhaps a secret behind the curtain of the cabinet but which we shall one day or other be acquainted with to our cost such are the regular governments upon whose faith we can depend notwithstanding the frequent examples we have had of their unqualified treachery in the cobweb fabric of their promises we consent to weave the destiny of further years of tremendous hostility and of thousands of industrious families upon the frail trust of such a thread we hang our trembling hopes and with no better security consent to prolong the miseries     of europe and to perpetuate that famine scarcity and desolation so large a portion of which we have already distributed not only among ourselves but to all surrounding nations but what are the pretences for alliances one of these pretences—and a very favorite one indeed in this country is the preservation of the balance of power so you see first of all we describe power by a metaphor calling it a balance and then realize the dream of our own fancy and at the expence of the lives of thousands and the happiness of millions plunge all europe into confusion in order that we may break a piece of power away here and throw it in there to preserve the equipoise of these imaginary scales o convenience of metaphorical logic if it suited the purposes of these sophistical reasoners they would find that any other sort of simile was equally descriptive the british constitution used to be described as a triple balance and many fine declamations have been made by political jugglers upon the basis of this ridiculous metaphor but projects were formed for which this triple balance would not answer and judge eyre finding that this metaphor instead of supporting his new fashioned theory of high treason changed hocus pocus the balance into a wheel put the poor british constitution to the rack —poor constitution—it had been mangled enough already and then to show his knowledge of physical as well as metaphorical science he tells you that any thing that presses upon the circumference must injure the centre though we know very well that a centre is in its nature immoveable and that whatever violence is committed upon the circumference can only alter the direction or velocity of the converging points while the centre inevitably remains uninfluenced however a wheel or a balance or a sword or a halter are any of them metaphors sufficiently capable of extensive application to answer all the purposes of political reasoners having got the power in their hands to proceed at will to final demonstration who shall dispute the intermediate gradations of their logic or deny that a metaphor is as legitimate a basis of sound argument as a syllogism or a self evident fact—the rack at such times is just as good an emblem of justice as a pair of scales and it matters not whether you adopt the one or the other while the sword is ready to dispatch the individual whom neither the balance can weigh down nor the rack subdue   0 having made the power of europe a balance—a balance it should seem of a hundred scales each government supposed itself briarius the giant with a hundred hands that could uphold them all and accordingly it has always been thought necessary by one or other of them to keep the world plunged in wars to support the metaphorical equipoise but if we ever could be blind enough to suppose that the jugglers who talk of this balance of power were in earnest we ought to be very much obliged to them for their late conduct which certainly must have opened our eyes and convinced us that they never had any meaning nor ever meant to have any meaning unless it was that the people were to be put in one scale and the individuals who compose the government in another merely to show how light the former are in the estimation of the latter and how immediately they with their emptied pockets kick the beam weighed down by the pondrous mass of revenue places and patronage in the courtly scale the balance of europe will any person believe if in this balance there had been any real meaning that it was not more destroyed by the partition of poland than the navigation of the scheldt is it more dangerous to the safety of europe that savoy should be added to the french republic than that so large a portion of poland should be affixed to the immense empire of russia—whose ferocity and ambition whose rapid strides of usurpation and whose faithless conduct must have convinced mankind that the real object of her pursuit is the subjugation of europe the slavery of the civilized universe over which her barbarians are to be established as military governors to restore the reign of ignorance and ferocity another pretence for alliances a more modern pretence is the preservation of order and morality citizens in what do order and morality consist in destroying towns and villages in depopulating nations in laying fields and vineyards waste and then raking the ashes together to spread them decently over the graves of a few great victims whose power and grandeur could not preserve them from the stroke of justice when the wickedness and indecency of their conduct had shaken to their foundations the venerable structures of prejudice and superstition that once protected them if this is what is meant by the preservation of order and morality then indeed are the present confederates against regenerated france at least in their intentions most     orderly most moral and most pious—then indeed have alliances and royal combinations most frequently and especially in the late instance advanced the cause of order and of that moral distribution upon which so intimately depends the felicity of the world then iö kings courts and cabinets—iö alliances and royal confederacies for the promised millenium is itself at hand but if by order we mean the establishment of peace and justice if by morality we mean that system of benevolent conduct which promotes the general welfare and happiness of mankind what order i ask what morality can be promoted by a band of depredators under whatever titles or distinctions uniting themselves together to break into a country with whose concerns they had no right to interfere to spread desolation through nations that did not choose to adopt their system of politics—i know but one system of order and morality and that must spring from the heart from enlightened understandings directed to the pursuit of principle from a determination to promote the peace the happiness and welfare of mankind and as the best means of advancing these to resist the encroachments of tyranny and usurpation under whatever forms or pretences their encroachments may be made another of the pretences for alliances and combinations in the present day is the preservation of religion and here at least it must be admitted that the advocates for these alliances in this country have certainly shewn a great disposition to impartiality and justice so that they may but be employed in protecting religion they care not what religion it is popish protestant greek or mahometan it is all the same so that it be but some one of those systems long established in regular governments and who shall deny the praise of regularity to the governments of the grand signior or the czarina it matters not which we are now very busy in protecting and restoring the holy roman catholic religion and we know a little while ago that england i mean the ministry of england for the people you know in these matters are non entities were filled with just as anxious a desire for the dominion of mahomet as they are now for that of the pope just as ready to draw the sword to preserve the religion of the ottomans as now to preserve his holiness in the chair of infallibility and restore the great hats of the cardinals to that dignity from which they have been hurled by the atheistical revolution in france     but suppose we are serious for a minute upon this subject and ask ourselves whether we can possibly be guilty of a greater absurdity than in one instant to fall down on our knees and worship a being whom we say is omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient and at the very same time by drawing our swords to fight against his enemies admitting for the instant that such a being could either entertain or suffer enmity to confess that we do not believe he is able to take his own part or enforce his own will these are the pretences upon which alliances have been made but those who are acquainted with the history of courts and indeed they have been exceedingly busy in publishing expositions of their own history of late those at all acquainted with the history of courts know that pretence is one thing the real object another now citizens as i have all possible respect for the administration and senate of this country i shall not say one word about their motives which i take it for granted are the very best that they are capable of conceiving but i believe it must be admitted whatever is the case with the cabinet and court of britain that with respect to the cabinets of many countries the real object of these alliances has been to strengthen the hands of government against the people to support those individuals who have seized the administration or abused the sovereignty of their respective nations to fortify in their past and meditated usurpations and to enable them to pour foreign mercenaries into their countries and menace and overawe and if necessary dragoon the people who might be otherwise unwilling to submit to their propositions that this has been the case with some of the nations of europe i shall proceed to show let us remember what was the case with brabant brabant imagined as i suspect every nation will now and then imagine for there is no accounting for the strange conceits that sometimes get into the heads of men—the brabanters i say imagined that they had rights that they had a claim to independence that they were not a parcel of brute beasts a swinish multitude who were to be driven and whipped and slaughtered at the will of their lords but that they had a right to vindicate and assert the ancient laws and liberties of their country if they were wise enough to improve those laws and liberties for their own advantage as their ancestors before them improved the elder institutions and reformed the elder abuses that existed in their     days you know the history of that struggle brabant was upon the brink of accomplishing its object and the tyrant who refused to govern by the laws was about to lose his government altogether alliances however were formed with different cabinets of europe and o shame to speak it with that of britain among the rest which convinced the brabanters that they must relinquish the chimerical ideas of rights and privileges and peaceably submit themselves to the wisdom the virtue the moderation and justice of the regular and established usurpation brabant however you will recollect though disappointed then has since attained her object perhaps not so well as she would before because a nation always does best without the assistance of foreigners however just and generous these foreigners incline to be holland also thought it had a right to settle its own government the batavians remembered their ancient independence so bravely purchased and once so wisely established and they did not very much like the idea of being governed by an individual who was evidently the subject of another of the crowned heads of europe they therefore took it into their heads that as they had a constitution which authorised them whenever they chose to dismiss or set up a stadtholder just as they pleased a stadtholder being in reality no part of the ancient constitution of the batavian states—they thought they had right to appeal to the ancient laws and redress the oppressions usurpations and grievances under which they groaned and they began seriously to think of setting about the business but no says the stadtholder you are combined together and you are disposed to get rid of me and you tell me you have a legal and constitutional as well as a natural right so to do i will not dispute the matter of right with you it is not convenient to me at present to refer to histories and constitutions but i will let you know that there are other princes and potentates in europe who understand a logic of another sort and with whom i am in alliance and combination and with a prussian army and a british fleet i will drive you like a rebellious herd before me or tumble you into your own dykes like so many frogs till you croak for mercy and hide your heads in orange peel to get out again—so much for dutch and austrian alliances the old despotism of france had its alliances also and the french people being bit in their turn by this same mad dog love of liberty—for its astonishing how this dreadful canine infection runs from man to man and from nation to nation so     that dreadful to think it may perhaps in time disturb even the pope in his vatican dismiss the grand signor from his seraglio and infect the beautiful nymphs and emasculated eunuchs with metaphysical notions of the rights of man france began to think of its rights and to set about reforming the abuses of government aye says the king—or rather the queen for he good easy man give him but his beef steak and bottle of burgundy would not trouble you with speeches if you did not as you do with other automatons make the speech for him and compel him to do whatever you desired aye aye says the queen that is all very well and my good man shall appear to agree with it but i have great relatives and my german alliances shall back and support us whenever i see good that the royal puppet should break his oaths and promises they shall convince you that you have nothing to depend upon that oaths are air that bonds and constitutions are paper and that while we are amusing you with fair promises our allies but your open enemies were furnishing us with the means of crushing you at pleasure thus by infernal arts and machinations the offspring of alliances and family compacts was france interrupted in that career of virtue and philosophy in which she set out yes—i repeat it—that career of virtue and philosophy—for though the spectacled lunatic of st omers at the very commencement of the revolution fulminated his anathemas and with his diabolical howlings against the national assembly stigmatised their holy labours look at their maxims of virtue humanity justice and then blush ye combined courts and ministers of europe blush at those wicked hostilities and still more wicked intrigues by which you have driven them from this peaceful career of intellect to use the destructive weapons of force and violence france also was interrupted in her career by foreign alliances by combinations of foreign courts that refused to explain the nature of their compacts but france had too much energy too much intellect too much enthusiasm to be disappointed even for a time and though she chose an alternative which has been dismal in many respects in its consequences and was plunged by an infernal faction into excesses at which nature shudders yet she has taught one great and important lesson to the world that a nation bent upon enquiry and improvement may sometimes mistake its way may sometimes by the arts and the malice with which she is surrounded be plunged awhile into tumults and mischief but will persevere     not only to the final accomplishment of her own virtuous objects but to the downfall of those whose criminal artifices or ambitious usurpations would blast her harvest and croud the prospect of felicity and glory see then if it is not digressing too far what has been the consequence to those who formed those fatal alliances what has the emperor got you will tell me perhaps   00000l of english money but this getting will be to him no gain not that i believe he will ever pay you one shilling of it again or ever be able so to do but what has he got in point of power and grandeur let the brabanters answer you that question what has the stadtholder got a snug retreat on the banks of the thames and a dutch fair represented in pantomime at frogmore may perhaps convince him of the gratitude of his master but will poorly atone for the forfeit revenues of seven wealthy provinces with all the regal splendours of the hague but behold the consequence of machiavelian policy you may destroy the poor deluded puppets whose grandeur you would exalt over the rights of man but human intellect when backed by human energy is invincible and woe to those who are frantic enough to oppose its career citizens we may remember that about eighteen months ago we were also menaced with something like a friendly alliance of this sort in england a fortunate disease visited some foreign troops in the neighbourhood of our coast and they were humanely landed upon the isle of wight this was only accident to be sure but then it served you know to feel the pulse a little thanks to the state of intellect in britain the pulse of the nation vibrated as it ought the glorious energy of stanhope roused the country to a sense of its danger and the resolutions of the patriotic societies i shall venture once more to assert conspired with the speech of that noble citizen to chase the hessian and hanoverian barbarians from our coasts and to the latest hour of my life i shall exult that at the peril of a disgraceful death i contributed by penning some of those resolutions to save my country from that scene of desolation and mischief which i am sure will take place whenever foreign mercenaries shall be marched into its bosom to coerce the people and dragoon them into submission to any minister whatever may be the pretences with which a measure so diabolical may be coloured over hail hail ye fetters chains and dungeons—hail scaffolds halters and axes you were meant it is true as the brands of infamy and the punishments of guilt but when tyranny and oppression reign—when attempts are made to     subjugate a nation by bands of mercenary cutthroats ye lose your terrors in the patriots eye—ye are then the badges of virtue and the passports of eternal glory citizens it has been rumoured that such a design is again in contemplation but i do not believe it i think the minister of this country has learned a lesson which will prevent him from doing such things again so long as britons are ruled by britons i trust that they will use no weapons but reason and enquiry however great may be their burdens but i have not faith enough in human patience to suppose that they will bear to be dragooned by foreign mercenaries that they will yield their throats to hessian or hanoverian butchers and suffer themselves to be trampled into submission by any foreign interference nay i confess that my pacific principles do not go so far as to wish that they should the manly spirit of this nation will i hope be displayed in peaceable and tranquil exertions for i am sure of this that no important reformation no change or amelioration ought to take place except when there is a unanimous and manly resolution to demand it and when there is that manly and unanimous resolution it will require no artillery to enforce it no bayonets to accomplish it but when a government is supported by foreign troops it is then no longer a question of argument silence or resistance are the only alternatives citizens there is a good maxim among men of moral feelings as to common plunderers if they meet a highwayman or footpad if he demands their money they will rather give it than take away the life of a fellowbeing however depraved but if he proceeds to violence they must even if they can kill him in their own defence in the same manner i think the probability is that though the people suffer their money to be taken away by foreign mercenaries they will not suffer themselves to be dragooned by the admission of them into this country and if they would all i can say is that the modern inhabitants of this island are no more britons than the present race of slaves who inhabit what once was greece are athenians and lacedemonians be this as it will with respect to our money it must be admitted we have parted with it pretty freely for britain having rather too large a quantity of these golden globulæ flowing through its veins the political quacks have been very solicitous to apply the lancet and not a high german doctor of them all but has occasionally held the bason how much the better we are for these applications i do not pretend to determine but our great state physician our political sangrado seems determined to persevere in the practice     but all this is done to support the reputation of regular governments to regular governments notwithstanding the repeated instances we have had of their persidy we are ready to lend our assistance and our money with republican innovators we are not willing even to cease the monstrous contention of slaughter and desolation though we cannot produce one single instance of breach of faith in any of those governments at this time existing that are worthy of the name of republics has america broken her faith with any of the nations with which she has had any alliance on the contrary peruse the transactions on the banks of miami and then read the treaties between this country and america consult also the rights of nations and then answer me whether the irregular—the fantastical republican government of america or the regular government of greatbritain can most justly be taxed with violation of its faith has the republic of france in any one instance notwithstanding all its wild changes broke its faith or violated its compacts no on the contrary in the report of gregoire relative to the rights of nations observe what magnanimity what principles of justice—so sublime i am bound to say as never before were propagated by the government or public assemblies of any nation in the world hear them in the very moment of triumph and victory when all the nations of the earth were in a manner prostrate before them—hear them consecrating the equal rights of nations and declaring that sovereignty is the right of every nation that it depends not upon its power upon its riches or population that a dwarf is a man as much as a giant and has the same rights and that sovereignty is as much the right of the little province of sant marine as of the gigantic republic of france turn also if you please to the republican government of switzerland has switzerland—i ask the question with confidence—has switzerland been less distinguished for its faith than the other governments of europe quite the contrary no nation has preserved a more unblemished character than that republic in which to a considerable degree at least among many of the cantons the principles of liberty and equality are established that republic in which as the late king of prussia declared with a sort of involuntary applause every individual is at once a peasant a citizen and a soldier away then with the absurd pretences that you can have no faith in republics and that you are to seek for it only in the regular governments of aristocracy and monarchy     but they ask you what signifies making peace with france in her present state what security can you have for a permanent peace what do these regular governments mean by a permanent peace would not one suppose from this language that before the republican phrenzy broke out in france europe was always in a state of harmony and friendship that these regular governments with their compacts and alliances might quarrel once or twice perhaps in four or five hundred years but that their usual practice was to observe their treaties and keep the peace inviolate from century to century—but what has been the fact consult the records only of our own country for the last hundred years and you will find that of that period more than half has been devoted to war and desolation that we have been five times at war with france and six times at war with spain as i have shewn in a former lecture that some of these wars have lasted eight or ten years together and that it has been a long tranquillity indeed that has suffered you to be six or seven years at peace war after war scene after scene of contention has ensued no pretence has been too frivolous no object too contemptible to be the ground of hostility—the plain truth is that these regular governments that is to say the ministers who act under them have an interest in keeping the world perpetually in war that it is the people who bear the burden but the governors who are enriched by the plunder in short the regular governments of europe have hitherto shewn themselves to be consistent in but one principle—a principle which is indeed laid down by machiavel as the fundamental axiom without which no regular government can possibly exist namely that they should neither keep peace faith nor compact any longer than it is to the advantage of those by whom that compact is made and hence it is that one universal system of slaughter and devaliation has been incessantly pursued nor is it easy to foresee when we shall get to the end of this dismal chapter such then are the principles of faith and pacification among these regular governments i leave it to your serious consideration whether this is a picture to encourage you to persevere in war till destruction and misery overwhelm you in one common mass rather than trust to the yet untried faith of the french republic however various it may be in its occasional formation or whatever may be the internal factions which at present distract it and which are not to be wondered at when we consider the monstrous abyss of guilt oppression and contaminating corruption from which they have been struggling to get free     the tribune no xxi the second lecture on allies and alliances containing strictures on the consequences of employing auxiliary troops and on the character and views of our allies with a prospect of the probable catastrophe of the present war delivered friday june  th      citizens you will remember that when i formerly treated of the subject of allies and alliances i entered into an investigation of the principles of the system i endeavoured to shew you how far it was consistent either with good policy or justice to form alliances between one state and another or rather between the courts and governments of respective states i endeavoured to show you that it was not in reality a union of the sentiments passions and interests of the different countries that those who formed the alliances wished to promote but that on the contrary every opportunity was seized to aggravate hostile dispositions and to foment those prejudices which stimulate nation against nation and urge the deluded multitude to deeds of murder and desolation i therefore proceeded to conclude that these compacts were rather to be regarded as alliances between courts and governments for private interests and concealed purposes of their own than contracts of different nations nominally allied but in reality no farther interested in the bargain than as they must bear all the burden hazard and expence which result from such alliances i showed you that the subject naturally divided itself into two branches first the effect of these alliances as they relate to the particular concerns of nations and may influence the internal happiness and liberties of the people and secondly as they were likely to retard or assist the progress of those military projects which are generally   0 the avowed objects for which they are contracted it was only into the first branch of this subject that i entered to any considerable length that evening and i concluded with reflecting on the subsidiary treaty at this time about to be concluded between his britannic majesty and the emperor of germany there is a part however of that treaty for the imperial loan which i have not yet touched upon and which seems well worthy of consideration i mean the terms upon which the loan is granted and the delusive prospects held out to the people relative to the pretended profit to result whenever if ever the money so borrowed shall be repaid it has been insinuated that the terms of the loan are such that the people of this country are to be gainers two and a half per cent the emperor is to pay seven and a half per cent while the whole interest payable by our government taking all the circumstances into consideration amounts to no more than five it being wellknown that the general system is to borrow at three per cent and that the difference between the price of stock and hard cash makes it but about two per cent more whether this is the case or not you will presently see and in the first place you will please to observe that this avowed and evident interest namely three per cent paid upon the money borrowed and also upon the fictitious stock that makes up the deficiency of the nominal fund is only a part of what the nation in reality pays for there are bonuses commission money to the bank and to the brokers and a variety of charges of the amount of which those only who are in the habit of adding small items and incidental expences together can form any idea but citizens let us consider the real amount and nature of this loan a little closely before we suffer ourselves to be deluded with these ministerial fables of profits and advantages remember that   00000 pounds hard sterling cash are to be sent to the emperor that therefore in addition to all the expences of the negociation   00000 pounds is to be borrowed upon the funding system the consequence will be when it comes to be reckoned that so many millions of hard cash bona fide borrowed amounts in stock to twice the sum specified that is to say the loss upon borrowing is so great that the difference between the nominal fund and the sum of money borrowed all things considered is nearly two to one and of course to lend the     emperor   00000 pounds we contract a debt of about  000000 but you will recollect that to buy is one thing and to sell is another if it is so in the common concerns of life it is transcendantly so with the stocks and funds in this respect to those gentry who have thought fit to make a common gambling house of the change or market of those funds i shall take no notice of the absolute loss which results from the circumstances of buying and selling and the rise of stocks and consequent loss to the nation which would take place immediately even if this money were now to come into the market again by means of the fulfilment of the emperors pecuniary engagements there is another more important circumstance to be taken into consideration if ever this money is paid at all it must be in times of peace and if it be true that the minister has not already entirely ruined the country when peace returns prosperity will in some degree return also and the funds will necessarily mount to a considerable degree now the same quantity of money only that he borrowed in time of war is to be paid by the emperor in times of peace that is to say when the funds are high suppose at par he is only to repay the   00000 pounds which he now receives when the funds are exceedingly low i shall not enter into any minute calculations upon this subject it will lead me too far and minute arithmetical calculations with me require more labour than i have time to give them i shall just state however that mr fry the author of a book entitled the guardian of public credit and who is at this time about to publish a very useful and important work on the subject of the funded debt has calculated the proportion of the inevitable loss and finds that upon the supposition that the loan was to amount to six millions the sum originally proposed the inevitable loss would be to this nation     000 pounds upon this famous and most advantageous contract even supposing that the emperor for novelty sake should keep his word concerning the payment of the debt thus contracted you will see then that independent of the common losses and expences of the negociation independent of the circumstance of making a worse bargain for the english loan in consequence of having a loan to make for the emperor independent of all these circumstances you will see that the strong probability would have been supposing the whole six millions to have been borrowed     that the nation would have lost by this bargain     000 pounds but as only   00000 were accepted by our imperial ally you will find upon calculation that the probable loss is only     000 pounds and the positive loss independent of the circumstances previously mentioned is no more than  0  000 pounds a trifling sum for the important service of keeping a few austrians croats bohemians and hungarians a little longer in the field to keep alive the languid flame of war and avert for another campaign or so the dreadful calamity of turning the minister out of place to pave the way for an honourable and permanent peace with the brave insulted republic of france but let us take into consideration the facts which have lately transpired relative to the dispositions of the different states of europe let us call to our consideration the conduct of the king of prussia let us recollect how he has been receiving the money of britain with one hand and making peace with the enemies of britain—the enemies of the british ministers i mean with the other citizens you will remember also that at the time when the emperor—for the emperor of germany and the king of prussia seem as if they intended to prove to the world that they were of the same family—and indeed as kings and emperors are all of a race divine it may perhaps be admitted that there is some degree of relationship among them all you will remember that while he was ratifying the treaty which was to secure him the payment of this sum of money he also declared to the members of the germanic body that he was ready to make peace with the french republic by which declaration he in fact did that which the minister of this country will finally be obliged to do—acknowledged the french republic as one of the orderly and regular governments of europe but you are told by mr pitt that you are not to suppose the emperor sincere in his declarations to his own subjects there may be something in this for i conclude that if the emperor had been a dealer in sincerity he would not have entered into any combinations or agreements with mr pitt nor would mr pitt have ever thought of going to his shop you are told that this declaration of the emperor was a piece of state finesse one of those artifices which are very consistent with regular governments but which would fix an indelible stain upon the morals of a republic but as to the ultimate     consequences it is little to us whether the emperor is finessing with the empire or finessing with us—whether he is sincere in his professions of sending a large army into the field or whether he is sincere in his profession of wishing to make peace with the french republic or whether in reality considering the situation in which he is placed he does not know which he is sincere in or whether he is sincere in either but finding himself a little embarrassed applies in matters of state the maxim which ovid in his art of love enforces to those who are impressed with the tender passion—   speak boldly on and trust the following word   it will be witty of its own accord but let us proceed to the second part of our subject—namely the effects in a military point of view of those alliances by which a variety of states all having different objects in reality at heart though professing the same designs have endeavoured to press and bear down a particular country or to accomplish any great and extensive project whatever—what has been the degree of energy and conduct displayed by those confederated powers which in different ages of the world have combined their arms to subdue others to slavery or subject them to persecution or extermination on account of their opinions or for whatever cause from the holy crusades undertaken to gratify the popes of early times to the present crusade of kings in which the pope of rome has been piously guarded by the protestant bayonets of the english soldiery whoever has read must remember that envy jealousy suspicion misunderstanding contention and a consequent disposition to thwart each others views and objects howevever they might profess to agree have universally distinguished those confederacies disgraced their arms and disappointed their views each potentate envious of the reputation and apprehensive of the power of his colleague coldly assists or secretly thwarts his undertakings and when this mutual jealousy has produced defeat and shame each exclaims against the rest to shift the dishonour from his own shoulders and the consequence has generally been that discord and distrust have produced lassitude disappointment delay and ultimately retreat and ruin but it may be said that the army to which we are to look for the successes of the next campaign is not to be considered as     an allied army of this mixed and complicated nature for as it was observed by one of the french generals who retook toulon that the only troops the pope sent were cows and calves so it appears that in the next campaign the only troops britain is to send are her gold her stores and her provisions—if she knows where to find them but still we find though we are no longer able to conduct the war though our depopulated country drained of its youth and manhood to the dregs is no longer able to furnish soldiers for this desperate strife still its sanguinary and insatiate agitators cannot consent to give repose to europe—still we are determined to continue our crusade by the help of auxiliary forces but have we duly weighed the general consequence of a nation attempting foreign conquests by the arms of mercenaries have we well enquired what has been the general result of efforts of that kind and what has been the general conduct of auxiliaries when such projects have been pursued citizens there is a work which when i consider the moral complexion of mr pitts politics i suppose he has studied night and morning even from his youth upward i mean a work called the prince written by the famous secretary of florence machiavel a man of considerable parts tho taking him to be sincere in his political maxims of no small depravity of heart the ethics i say of this author our minister has studied with the most elaborate care and has been anxious to try his powers of carrying the precepts into practice but when i consider his conduct with reference to the degree of wisdom which it has displayed and consider how many excellent things there are in this respect which he might have learned from this same machiavel i then become persuaded that the morality which i was before inclined to attribute to the precepts of this master must be in reality purely and entirely his own springing from the congenial fountain of his own heart or inspired perhaps by the sooty deity he appears to worship for it is difficult to believe that even the present chancellor of the exchequer could read a book with the express determination to separate from it and adopt every thing that was morally depraved and pass over or reject all that was prudent politic and wise let me however ring in his ears the warning voice of machiavel who upon this subject has many observations well worthy the attention of the statesman and who at once by argument     and historical facts might convince him that he is pursuing those measures which will involve himself and his country in ruin and destruction hear then this machiavel upon the subject of auxiliary troops after having told you that the principal foundations of all states were good laws and good arms and having proceeded to shew the different kinds of arms that princes may employ he enters into an elaborate investigation of the nature and use of mixed and auxiliary forces and grounded in the facts of history and assisted by an acute mind he is led to this conclusion that no arms are efficacious but those of the individual country by which they are employed those arms says he that are mercenary and auxiliary are unprofitable and dangerous and the prince who rests upon them will never be secure of safe for they are disunited ambitious undisciplined treacherous insolent to their friends abject to their enemies without fear of god or faith to man and the ruin of such a prince is no longer deferred than till he is attacked he proceeds afterwards to show you that the reason is—because it is not affection for him that keeps such armies in the field they having no attachment but to their pay and this is not a motive strong enough to make them willing to die for him yes citizens—it is true we find that gold will purchase men to take away the lives of others gold will hire men to stab—to shoot—to poison—or swear—for that is the modern way of assassination you may hire a man to be a spy and a perjured informer if he is a little nice or so in his conscience and does not chuse absolutely to make the bargain with you in open and direct terms he may be given to understand that perhaps the obnoxious person owes him   or  00 pounds and that if he hangs him good care shall be taken that it shall not be lost but though people will sell the lives of others for the sake of recovering a just debt or the like nay tho some would even make a bargain of blood in a direct and public manner few men will consent for a little gold to be shot themselves or to get themselves hanged that is if they know what they are about but if a man is employed as a spy who is not clever enough to hang any body else you know why then he may chance to get hanged himself an appetite for blood being like all other appetites and when a man is keen set he does not like     to be entirely disappointed and will rather set down to a coarser meal than he intended than go away with an empty stomach but to resume the observations of machiavel he tells you a few pages afterwards indeed it appears by experience that princes and republics with their own forces alone execute great enterprizes and that mercenaries are always prejudicial he then proceeds to tell you the effect that this practice of employing mercenaries has on the character of a nation marking particularly the inevitable decay of vigour and spirit among those people who seek to be defended by foreign arms besides a martial commonwealth that rests upon its own valour is not so easily enthralled by any of its citizens as one that depends upon foreign troops rome and sparta maintained their freedom for many ages by their own forces and arms the swiss are more martial than their neighbours and consequently more free citizens we might find a great variety of instances to support and illustrate this principle and even the royal commentator of machiavel i mean the late king of prussia has furnished us with some he tells us experience has shewn that the national troops of a state are always the most serviceable as appears from several examples particularly from the valour of leonidas at thermopylæ and from the amazing progress of the arms of the romans and arabians but what was the situation of rome when she had recourse to auxiliaries and mercenary forces while she had wise and virtuous ministers more zealous to preserve than praise her constitution not usurping dominion for themselves but guarding the sacred rights of man from usurping destroyers she then defended herself by the force of her own arms and her own valour but when the romans were reduced to a state of degeneracy and slavery when their great men became their tyrants and their ministers their oppressors then abject rome whose ambition survived her energy was reduced to hire foreign arms and to fight her battles with hired swords but did victory continue to attend them were the citizens of rome when guarded by the savages of the danube and the rhine—the croats and hessians of the ancient world—were they then delighted as of old with songs in praise of their illustrious generals with triumphal processions     and wreathes of victory no they found that foreign exploits were nothing more than the forerunners of domestic misery and ruin and as machiavel well observes if we consider the decline of the roman empire we shall find it first proceeded from employing the goths as mercenaries by which means the forces of the empire were enervated and all their valour transferred as it were to those gothic troops so strong was the impression made upon the mind of machiavel by inferences which he drew from facts of history upon this head that we find him laying it down in absolute terms that it is better for a country to endure any distress and struggle with a brave despair than to permit itself to be defended by foreign troops or to employ the arms obtained by alliances with strangers let every prince therefore says he who would reduce himself to an incapacity of conquering employ auxiliary arms for they are more dangerous than mercenaries and a little further he says wise princes therefore have always rejected this sort of forces and depended upon their own chusing rather to be defeated with these than to conquer with the others and looking upon that as no victory which is obtained by borrowed arms and very good reason there is to think that nothing deserves the name of victory which is obtained by foreign arms because the arms that obtained that victory for them may and in all probability will withhold the fruits of that victory and if the nation for whom it was made should have the insolence to complain perhaps the very troops they so weakly employed flushed with the insolence of triumph and urged by that contempt which it is impossible for mercenaries and auxiliaries not to feel for those who are obliged to hire them may turn their sabres against them a victory thus obtained may in fact be considered only as a prelude to the destruction and overthrow of the apparently successful country in short the project that cannot be effected by the proper force of the particular country that undertakes it had better never be attempted at all for the same sort of reason that nothing but bankruptcy and ruin awaits the individual who embarks in any business in which he is not competent to conduct himself but there is one instance more which machiavel gives in illustration of this maxim which appears to me so exceedingly apposite to this country and holds up so very     forcible and important a lesson that i shall not neglect the opportunity before i quit this subject of reading it to you if we consider the progress of the venetians says he it will appear that they acted with great security success and reputation whilst they made war with their own forces that is whilst they fought only by sea the venetians being a naval people a people of commerce and whose strength lay in their wooden walls and not in troops employed in foreign conquests and crusades nor were the venetians while they were wise and flourishing ever disposed to interfere with foreign states or like our mad and ridiculous quixottes to think of such attempts as filling foreign nations with ready made constitutions before which they had been able to take the measure the venetians were successful whilst they fought only by sea but as soon as they made a land war—what then were they merely defeated no citizens that would have been little for in many instances defeat is better than conquest and how calamitous soever to persons in power it may appear and may eventually be yet i am disposed to think such is the case with us in the present situation of this country and that calamitous as the times now are they would be still more calamitous if it were possible that we should succeed in the present mad crusade but defeat was not all that the venetians experienced as soon as they made a land war they degenerated from their former valour and adopted the manners and customs of italy what were those manners and customs of italy which were such certain signs and concomitants of venetian degeneracy why they consisted in treachery in perjury in spying and assassination the last of these has not yet got footing in england an infernal system of inquisition is also to be considered as a part of the manners and customs of that italian profligacy which the venetians by their bad policy were led to adopt we know very well what sort of morals must arise from such a system the page of history has not left us the dark in this particular and we know what the state of society must become wherever these detestable italian fashions prevail where spies are planted in every house when men are bribed to become informers and when of course individuals are destroyed by falshood and perjury the venetians then in this state of degeneracy employed foreign troops to fight their battles with the gold wrung     from the industrious people of the country they purchased foreign mercenaries till they lost with rapid disgrace all that they had been acquiring with great labour and difficulty we have been told much of this country being made a department of france and of its being an appendage to the republic one and indivisible but you have not been warned of the still worse subjugation and slavery proceeding from the vicious morals and the impolitic character which ministerial practices are introducing into this degenerate country but be assured when the character of britain is lost—when the hearts of englishmen are no longer to be stimulated by those warm those generous and republican feelings of liberty of which of old we had not used to be ashamed—and when instead of these we adopt the base assassinlike arts of italian degeneracy be assured that the independence of this country can no longer be preserved and that something even worse than becoming a department of the french republic must inevitably await us be warned then by the signs and prototypes of history and let not among the rest the fate of venice be forgotten we are told that the catastrophe produced in the venetian territory by admitting this system of mercenary troops was that in one battle the venetians were stripped of all they had been acquiring with incredible labour and difficulty for eight hundred years nor is this surprising for the conquests that are made by mercenary troops are slow tedious and weak but their losses are rapid and amazing such are the prospects even according to this politician whom courtiers are most in the habit of consulting at least if we judge from the moral complexion of their politics such are the prospects that arise from employing foreign mercenary troops and attempting to subdue other countries by the assistance of auxiliary arms i shall proceed in the next place to consider as briefly as possible what are the characters the probable views and objects of our allies and what may probably be the consequences to this country resulting from the assistance afforded towards the accomplishment of some of these views by the present alliances some of the august personages upon whom it was once my intention to have animadverted with some severity have made it unnecessary for me to give myself any trouble about them on the present occasion   0 respecting the emperor poor man whatever character he may have had it seems necessary that he should now look sharply about him or else he will shortly have no character at all at least among the estates of the germanic empire if we consider the terms of the second treaty concluded between the king of prussia and the french republic and the effects that treaty may probably produce in germany we must presently see that whatever views and objects he may have had he must be disposed to think that the only view he can now profitably have is how he may disappoint the objects of the king of prussia which should they succeed as well as they have begun may possibly transfer the ascendancy in the germanic confederacy to the house of brandenburgh and annihilate the political importance of the house of austria you are to remember that one part of the treaty is that the king of prussia and the french republic have joined together to guarantee the neutrality of such of the principalities of germany as refuse to provide their contingents for carrying on the war it is believed that the prince of hesse cassel and the prince of saxe teschen in consequence of this have already declared their determination to avail themselves of this circumstance be this however as it will it is evident that if the circles of the empire should so far second the views of the king of prussia as to be beforehand with the emperor in making peace and thereby take advantage of the proffered protection the imperial dignity becomes from thenceforward a mere shadow—the constitution of the germanic body is shaken to its centre and yet mr pitt supposes it impossible that the emperor should be sincere in his avowed readiness to treat with the french republic—such are the intrigues going on among the princes of germany and so much for the faith of our regular governments the stability of allies and the dependence on alliances i conclude then that there must be a soft part in the head of the emperor of germany if he does not turn around and give a sharp lookout at his neighbours lest while he is attempting to make the sans culottes wear royal breeches again the king of prussia should snatch his imperial diadem from off his head and put a red nightcap in its place citizens i have talked about delineating the character of this emperor but i feel myself incompetent to the task and for this very reason—because it is evident that he has no character to delineate that he is a man of times and contingencies—whose     views and maxims have descended to him like his crown and whose grandeur and importance are derived from the taylor who made his imperial robes he is in short a mere thing of mechanism and detail—who upholds this and aims at that merely because the house of austria have so aimed and held for the greater part of the last century and therefore it is a new order of things having suddenly sprung up in europe that he knows not what to do in the present exigence and that his conduct is marked with nothing but indecision incongruity and absurdity—yet to such an ally we give   00000l but there is another of our allies who is to be regarded in a more serious point of view—an ally whom i shall treat with the utmost gravity and decorum for you know it is not very polite to level the shafts of ridicule against the ladies you will perceive that i can mean no other than our most august most active most virtuous most humane and most pious ally the empress of both the russias i shall not attempt to speak the truth and the whole truth relative to this good old lady no—i remember very well that lord george gordon was kept in newgate till he died for calling the late queen of france by a name which it was notorious to all the world as properly belonged to her as homo belongs to all mankind i shall not therefore when i am speaking of this pious humane and virtuous empress talk of wives who murdered their husbands and usurped their thrones and afterwards maintained with blood what had been so bloodily obtained neither shall i attempt to delineate the many instances of her piety and the zeal with which she attempted to convert the infidels of the ottoman empire by massacreing them as fast as the ministers of her holy wrath could fulfil her sanguinary orders neither shall i delineate again the conduct of her familiar spirit zuwarrow at warsaw but there is a part of her character which i think it my duty seriously to consider i mean that part of her political character by which she appears to me to have been stimulated to take part in the present intrigues and dissensions of europe ever since she has been seated on the throne of moscovy is it possible to be blind to the ambitious projects which this woman has been forming is it possible to be blind to the gigantic strides she has made towards the accomplishment of these designs is it possible to be blind to the consequent mischiefs which are rising from these projects is it possible to be blind to the policy of her present conduct while combinations     are forming between the powers of europe for objects the most extravagant and unattainable she pretends to make herself a party in order to stimulate their frantic activity and while they are exhausting their strength in this ridiculous crusade she sitting aloof from the storm husbands her resources and reserves her strength and ever and anon when the combatants begin to grow languid heartens them up with vague and delusive promises or rouses their passions with an inflammatory manifesto does this conduct mark the subtilty of intriguing ambition or does it not does it or does it not look like the conduct of one who has projects that may be advanced by the weakness of the respective combatants is it or is it not precisely the conduct she ought to pursue if she really grasped as by the late king of sweden she was publicly accused of grasping at the universal sovereignty of europe and ought we not to be alarmed lest we should blindly enable her to dictate laws to europe to destroy all commerce but that which will add to her own aggrandizement to make the operations in the present crusade the means of extending her empire over that ocean the dominion of which we have proudly arrogated to ourselves the accomplishment of such projects may appear very distant but should any event during the present struggle enable her to seize a port in the mediterranean the complexion of affairs would be immediately altered and we should awake from our dream too late cannot the fate of poland warn us of our danger was not her conduct with respect to that unhappy country perfectly consistent with the sort of policy i have here ascribed to her while the king of prussia was exhausting his strength and resources in the field she remained in politic inactivity but no sooner was he completely weakened and broken down and the poles exhausted by their gallant struggle than forth she rushes upon her devoted prey reaps the laurels and advantages which prussia had sown and partitions the devoted country according to her pleasure but our ministers are too busy for such speculations nor would they in these days of sedition and revolution be so jacobinical as to question the views and principles of the regular governments of europe all their energies are engrossed in trying the grand question between governments and people and deciding by the usual argument of courts the metaphysical problem whether the people have a right     to change their governments or whether they have not not knowing that the question is already decided and that altho they should reverse the decree in their chancery of appeal it would be of no avail since whenever the people are inclined to do it they will feel that they have not only the right but the power citizens it would require a greater degree of exertion than at this time i am capable of to enter fully into the views and objects of this good ally nor is it necessary perhaps to say much more upon the subject for i think there are few people the ministers of this country excepted who are so blind and stupid as not have some insight into her projects let us suppose that we continue to carry on this war that we suffer ourselves to be deluded and cheated as we have been year after year and campaign after campaign continuing all the while to be deluded by the pretences and promises of this woman till the resources of this country are still further exhausted and we suffer ourselves thus to be brought into embarrassments and distresses which may be nearer at hand than those men of wealth and property who plunged us into the war are inclined to think in what kind of condition shall we then be to oppose any ambitious project which she unwearied and unexhausted may think fit to avow and if these dangers are pressing so closely upon us as i believe they are it is not from republicans and levellers but from the profligacy and infatuation of ministers that this country is likely to be brought to ruin and destruction men of more generous hearts than those who have so long been rioting in the blood of europe would seize on the first friendly opportunity that opened a way to that mediation which under such circumstances must be the first wish of every one who does not in reality wish for the destruction of something more than that commerce which we have been told ought to perish that the rotten boroughs might live but suppose that we have not reason to dread all that i have described suppose that i have been a little visionary in my apprehensions relative to this empress of russia yet surely it cannot be said that there is nothing to apprehend from that quarter considering the great strides which she has been making surely it behoves us rather to watch with jealousy a power so ambitious so cruel and so faithless rather than admit her into a sort of partnership upon that element hitherto the scene of all our glories but where the treachery     of a false friend might in a critical moment prove more fatal than all the hostility of our open enemy such citizens appear to me to be the dangers which threaten us from a continuation of the present war even on the side of our allies if we look on the other hand at the progress of events at home and on the continent what is the probable catastrophe that stares us in the face look at our fields at our manufactories look at the state and condition of the people—see the wants the aggravated miseries that have been produced among us look at the enormous growth of the public debt look at the unexampled strides which the minister is making in the accumulation of this debt during the three years in which we have been engaged in the present war when we look at the facts we find an expenditure vast beyond all comparison with whatever went before we find that the taxes are levied with difficulty and that notwithstanding all the boasts which the minister regularly makes when he opens the budget of the flourishing state of the finances and of the prospect of the resources of the current year considerably more than answering the expenditure—yet that like the morning and even ingtale of the sluggard the concluding and the opening account never agree and when he comes to sum up the past receipts and expenditure he is always compelled to acknowledge that there has been a deficiency and what makes this more alarming and ominous as if we had nearly got to the end of our tether in this iniquitous system of stockjobbing we find by comparing the facts that this deficiency regularly keeps pace with the extent of our new loans and the consequent increase of the public debt so that our taxes are no longer equal and every year are less and less equal to the discharge even of the interest and we are obliged not only to borrow the capital with which we carry on this mad crusade but even each successive year to borrow fresh sums to pay the interest of the preceding citizens it requires no nice arithmetic it requires no elaborate calculations to prove that if we continue this game of growing desperation it must inevitably produce a national bankruptcy pause then awhile and think what you are doing think of the profligacy of your present undertakings—think of the wasteful expenditure—think of the misery waste and depopulation which has already been produced think what are     already the appearances of society remember how considerable a depopulation has already taken place how many useful labourers have been driven to the hospitable shores of america where punishment for opinion is not known nor starving industry to be heard of where the first law of nature may be followed without dread of famine and children are not yet a curse there where no frantic father pondering over the future destiny of his offspring and comparing his scanty rewards with his incessant and laborious exertions is tempted to exclaim with poor belmour in the play—   i have been thinking which of my three boys   some few years hence when im dissolvd in death   shall act the beggar best run barefoot fastest   or with most dextrous shrug play tricks for charity great impression—and a cry of encore citizens the speech i have repeated was given by the poet to the character of a gamester and none but a gamester in any tolerable state of society ought to be liable or so short a time ago as the period when the play i quote from was written could have been liable in this country to be driven to give utterance to a speech so full of melancholy and horrible images but now in england many an industrious tradesman and many an upright honest member of society with anguish of heart may be driven to apply those heartrending lines which in answer to your call i again repeat and exclaim—   i have been thinking which of my three boys   some few years hence when im dissolvd in death   shall act the beggar best run barefoot fastest   or with most dextrous shrug play tricks for charity   fatal extravagance   when i say you consider this depopulation and this misery when you consider the enormous expenditure of the public money when you consider the shifts to which this proud and insolent minister is evidently put even in the midst of all his arrogance when you consider the strides which he is going on to make like a desperate sprendthrift on the eve of bankruptcy when you see him still consent to pay millions upon millions to an ally who scarcely deigns even to promise his services in return—when you consider all these desperate     consequences of the present war—the miseries of the people—the symptoms of approaching bankruptcy the exhausted depopulation exhausted means and exhausted patience of the country—are you not led to apprehend a catastrophe too dreadful even for the imagination to contemplate without horror but citizens there is another part of the consequences of the present war upon which i cannot be quite silent i mean the consequent neglect of agriculture throughout europe how many fields upon the continent have remained unsown how many harvests destroyed by the iron foot of war what cargoes have been consigned to devouring flames and floods europe sees too late and trembles at the dreadful consequence the minister perhaps may exult in the prospect that france is on the eve of that famine which he wished to make the weapon of his revenge against all who depart from the sacred institutions of popery and monarchy see he may perhaps exultingly exclaim see the misery i have brought upon france tho i could not cope with their republican energies i have destroyed their means of life i have pillaged neutral vessels and seized their stores of grain it is true it has turned rotten upon my hands but still frenchmen are starving glorious prospect twentyfour millions of people starving by my machinations this is indeed a triumph worthy me a triumph a triumph thou monster look at home stand up and face thy country if thou darest and answer for the consequences of thy infernal plans the famine with which you meditated to subdue the liberties of france is gnawing the bowels of deluded britons and even the expected relief from our canadian settlement has entirely failed such are the prospects and such are the consequences of a mad profligate and desperate war such are the fatal effects of national animosity and delusion i conclude then that the probable catastrophe of the present war is famine desolation bankruptcy and national disgrace a large portion of which it is impossible we should escape though if we have wisdom public spirit and determined humanity we can avoid the worst part by lifting up the commanding voice of popular opinion and immediately abandoning that mad and frantic crusade in which it is impossible to succeed and in which were success possible its sole tendency would be to render us more enslaved and miserable     ode to liberty

commons that the condition of the common people in this country is worse than that of west india slaves the second lecture on the comparative estimate of the slave trade the practice of crimping and mr pitts partial requisition bill delivered friday february   th      citizens the number of facts connected with the subject which i am this evening to resume occasioned me in my former lecture to run rather more largely into detail than was at first my intention and therefore compelled me to leave untouched or but slightly touched many of the most important arguments that relate to this very momentous question it appeared to me therefore not amiss to resume it this evening and to endeavour to investigate those parts of the subject which i for want of time hurried over too much or totally omitted on the last evening on that evening i began with some reflections upon the general character of europe and was particularly led to condemn the avarice and cruel pride with which it arrogates to itself the right of enslaving the other portions of the globe my business on the present evening is to make a more particular application of those arguments to the character of the nation a portion of whose population i am now addressing and on this occasion i wish from those feelings of vanity every man has with relation to the country in which he was born that i were able to draw a picture in which nothing but the most pleasing lines and amiable colours should obtrude themselves upon the eye i wish it were possible for me to delineate a character in which every   0 thing should excite admiration and applause i am afraid however if i discharge my duty by dealing fairly with my countrymen it will be impossible to have so grateful a task on the present evening for tho the spark of reason has not only fallen upon the british bosom but its flame has extended to a considerable degree so that there is a great disposition in the minds of the people at large to benevolence and magnanimity yet i cannot be blind to the operation of those circumstances which have a tendency to introduce and thro a very wide circle have positively diffused characteristics of a very different description i cannot be so blind as not to perceive that for a very considerable time an illiberal monopolizing and rapacious spirit of commerce has diffused itself among the people and backed by those corruptions that have crept into the government of the country has tarnished the character of englishmen in short the over eager pursuit of opulence among one class of people and the consequent depression of the other have produced a notion among us totally subversive of the feelings of justice and humanity—a supposition that nothing is respectable but wealth and consequently an hardened cruelty or at least an insensibility of disposition so inveterate as nothing but avarice and rapacity ever can impart to the human character if there had wanted proofs of the existence of these qualities in this country the debate in a great assembly of yesterday would furnish me with abundant argument to substantiate the position i have laid down let any man but cast his eye in the slightest manner over those arguments which were used in opposition to a benevolent and humane motion in that assembly and then let them tell me whether virtue and enlightened generosity are in reality the only traits of character by which the present generation of britons are to be handed down to posterity citizens i shall take the liberty of entering into a serious investigation of those arguments because it will shew you to what retreats the friends of slavery are driven for shelter and how hard they find the task of supporting their system of enslaving one portion of the human race to support the luxurious vices and sensual gratifications of another a learned alderman has observed that this abolition the abolition of the slave trade ought never to be assented to—why—not because slavery is just not because we are entitled to the limbs lives and progeny of the poor blacks by means of the divine right of our white complexions no this he does     not attempt to prove but says he the consequence of such abolition would be the loss to this nation of the west india islands if i meant to enter very fully into this part of the enquiry i am not at all afraid but that i should be able to prove to you because it has been repeatedly proved beyond reply that this effect would not result but such a discussion would i believe be perfectly superfluous in more points of view than one—for this is a part of the argument which notwithstanding the boasts of some the grand exploits of others and the confidence of many i am much inclined to suspect will not be urged many successive years for notwithstanding some apparent successes and   the fine yellow harvest we have got if we look at the condition of our islands and the energy of the enemy and consider the resources which by our perseverance in the system of slavery we give to that enemy in those regions i am inclined to believe that the west indies will be lost not by the abolition of the slave trade but by that cruel and rapacious obstinacy with which we determine not to relinquish that inhuman traffic for if we will not relinquish there is another nation in europe that will abolish it—will tear it up and destroy it root and branch with the powerful arm of liberty and equality and with it will go i have no doubt or at least soon after it the whole of that system of colonization whose soil is corruption and whose manure is blood a feeble hiss i am delivering opinions citizens not wishes i do not call you together to invoke deities to further my prayers or fulfil my prophecies i call you together to listen to opinions which i am convinced are the opinions of truth with my wishes be they on one side or be they on the other it would be impertinent for me to trouble you and therefore i cannot but conceive that marks of illiberal disapprobation must arise from a trembling conviction that these are but too well founded and the calamity if a calamity it is to be considered will be traced to the maladministration of those who having no other way to preserve their popularity send their emissaries into every public meeting to disturb the tranquillity of investigation i however am very doubtful at least whether the loss of colonies is in reality any calamity to any country but if     it were is justice therefore to be sacrificed are the sacred principles of truth and liberty to be immolated at the altar of interest and for the sake of wealth and aggrandizement are we to persist in those practices whose cruelty calls aloud for redress and for the defence of which we have no other argument but interested necessity the tyrants constant plea yes says the learned alderman you are for if you loose your colonies there is another consequence behind a consequence connected with that disposition of rapacity which i have been obliged to acknowledge in some degree to be characteristic of my country the loss of great part of our revenue which would ultimately endanger the existence of the country the existence of the country the existence of the country how long are we to be deluded by unmeaning cant how long has party after party administrations and oppositions rung the changes upon those words in our ears but where is the individual who has told us what he means to convey to our minds by this pompous phrase what does the air of heaven depend upon our revenue do our streams derive their salubrity and our meadows their fertility from our revenue do the seas that wash our shores and wast to us the tribute of the world depend upon our revenue or is the aggrandizement of parties—the wealth of factions—the general fruit of this revenue—is this i say the existence of the country and will mankind be annihilated when ministers can no longer cover their tables with the wealth of a province and fill the senate and every department of an intricate system with their creatures and dependents the hungry consumers of this revenue—but flimsy as this argument is it is not true the revenue is not benefited by colonization i stand in fear of no contradiction when i say this and i do not say so because the nature of this lecture precludes contradiction but i fear no contradiction from the world when i affirm that colonies do not assist the revenue of a country they assist patronage it is true dependants upon courts and ministers they assist but they injure the real revenue for there was never yet a colony whose revenue equalled the expences of its government and as for their secondary operation upon the revenue by means of their commerce the genuine spirit of commerce abhors monopoly and restraint and the example of america might convince us that the best way to increase our trade is to make our colonies independent     but upon what principle let me ask is the idea supported that to revenue we are to sacrifice the cause of liberty and humanity alas the very argument stamps with deep conviction the justice of that character which i felt it my melancholy duty to assign to britain—yes it is my duty to convince you that such is the degraded state of our national character because till you are convinced of it you will not lend your virtuous and peaceable efforts to wipe the stain away behold the consequence of this rapacious avarice every thing is to be sacrificed to revenue without which the wages of corruption cannot be paid every thing is to be sacrificed to the interest of a few monopolizing traders because unless monopoly goes on to an extravagant length the extravagant projects of corruption cannot be supported it is only by the growth of monopoly that great revenues can be easily collected and therefore it is that wealth is to be held up as the idol of our adoration that we are to bow down in reverence to every thing splendid and that measure after measure is to be adopted project after project is to be carried into execution to keep those who are poor still poorer to push them further down the ladder of society to confine all favour and preferment to a few wealthy and powerful families and to make it difficult for any to acquire but those who have already too much but to illustrate still further this principle of rapacity and to shew you its curious effects upon the rational as well as the moral faculties of its advocates let us proceed to the curious arguments of that most honourable gentleman mr secretary dundas he is you know an advocate for the gradual abolition of this traffic a man of moderation that is to say one of those who not having the virtue to act right and finding the wrong to be no longer tenable endeavours to frustrate the cause of justice by finding out a middle path between the two you will remember citizens that in conformity with this system of moderation about three or four years ago when every guard and fence of the advocates of slavery was beaten down and the friends of liberty began to exult in the prospect that this great fortress of tyranny was about to surrender to the irresistible artillery of reason dundas stepped forward with his unexpected proposition of gradual abolition and under pretence of a capitulation induced the advocates of justice to raise the siege it was proposed by him that     the measures for this gradual abolition should not take place till the end of four years four years he told you was a period that would make no very considerable difference to those who remained in chains and bondage—four years longer continuance of a traffic admitted to be a perpetual scene of rapine blood and cruelty could be no great injury to the cause of humanity just as he told you on another occasion that seven months closeconfinement was no sort of punishment whatever another reason he says for giving four years to the planter was that he might have some time to furnish himself with slaves and not suffer a stagnation or bankruptcy in his business by a total stoppage can men repeat these words and yet be ignorant of their import can they lay down after laborious examination doctrines like these and not shudder at the consequences has it not been proved to you that the annual consumption for it seems that human beings are to be spoken of as stock in trade—that the annual consumption of africans in our west india settlements is no less than  0000 multiply—for if we consider men as property we must subject them like other property to rules of arithmetic and strike our balances of debtor and creditor with the coldness of commercial precision—multiply this  0000 by four and you find that   0000 africans were to be sacrificed to the moderation of this humane secretary—for what—why to prevent the bankruptcy of a few west india monopolists what then—is this the enlightened and generous spirit so often boasted by britons or is it that spirit of rapacious avarice that regards the lives of mankind the happiness and liberties of thousands as trifling circumstances compared with the hurling of a few wealthy individuals from that rank which their opulence has given them and casting them for a while into the humbler ranks of life they have so long been in the habit of despising but mark citizens i pray you the progress of this gradual abolition the four years being nearly past the same most humane and generous pleader comes forward and tells you that a longer time is necessary now than was requisite at the former discussion though only four years were requisite four years ago more than four years are requisite now and he thinks that the abolition ought at present to be deferred indefinitely this puts me in mind of an anecdote in ancient history of one simonides a poet and philosopher     who was consulted by the tyrant under whose dominion he lived about the opinion he entertained of the existence and nature of god simonides at first required two days to consider it two days were granted and when they were expired the monarch expected a reply but instead of answering the question he required four days more four days more were granted and at the end of these he came not with his reply but with a request of six days longer and at the end of those six days he requested an indefinite time because he said the more he considered of the nature of the divinity the more puzzled he was to give an answer to the question and so in the same manner we have a great and mighty statesman who finds the same growing difficulties upon a leading question of benevolence as the ancient philosopher and poet did upon the leading question of theology and he tells you after having had four years to consider upon the question that he is less determined in his own mind when the deity of benevolence shall begin to be acknowledged and worshipped than he was when he told you four years ago that four years only were necessary before the temple should be built but another reason why he now thinks a longer time necessary than at first is that in war the planter has not the same opportunity of providing slaves citizens we have heard of a variety of trades and we have heard of a variety of species of cattle in which traders may deal in some parts of the world they are very famous for dealing in black cattle with some no cattle are in such repute as the golden calf and there are other countries in which the cattle are all white now it happens that while the trade of war continues the traffic in white cattle admits of a quicker return and in consequence of modern improvements in the way of carrying it on is discovered to be more profitable than the trade in black thus then during the continuance of the war it is not quite so easy to procure black slaves for the plantations as it is to procure white slaves for the ships of war and the ranks of a devoted army and therefore you are told upon the old system of bringing forward one piece of iniquity in justification of another the slave trade is to be prolonged till the return of tranquility shall enable the planter to get such a stock of human cattle as may satisfy his conscientious desires if gold is thus to be admitted as an equivalent for life if trade is to be set up as a thing of more advantage and consequence     than humanity and justice can we be surprized that in the same assembly doctrines should be preached so abhorrent to the feelings of mankind as those i am about to recite to you can we be surprized to hear members in that same assembly declare that liberty—hear it englishmen if you can restrain your indignation and hear it with patience that liberty is not the unalienable right of man what is liberty then the birthright only of britons for it has been called the birthright of britons even by those borough mongers who swindle us out of the inheritance and then threaten us with the halter for appealing to the title deeds is not liberty the right of all human beings or is the period come when right is changed into wrong are britons also to be considered as implicated in this new doctrine and are they also to be taught that their liberties are not unalienable that they may be stolen by violence or taken away by fraud and that he who has once been a free agent may be reduced to the condition of a slave are we surprized to hear in the same assembly also that it would be inhumanity to the people of africa to leave them to their savage liberty and that nothing could exceed—mark citizens the curious argument it is not right to leave the africans to the possession of their savage liberty because nothing can exceed the joy and consolation which the negroes in the west india islands experience upon the arrival of a fresh cargo of slaves from africa and to rob them of this would be to deprive them of one of the greatest sweets of life and is this true have civilized and enlightened britons sunk the simple character of savages so low that they also can exult in the chains and torments of their fellow beings and feel a wicked consolation in the midst of their own sufferings by finding that others are rendered as wretched and as hopeless as themselves if this malignant disposition is in reality generated in the breasts of africans by the oppression with which we have treated them what becomes of the curious argument which mr alderman newnham thought fit to set up citizens i am no adept in theological questions i do not pretend to speculate either upon the world above or that below i am satisfied with the sphere i move in i am sure i can do no benefit in any other but divines i understand have upheld the doctrine that if it were possible for a man to get into heaven with the passions of demons and fiends in     his bosom still he would be miserable and heaven itself would to him be worse than hell mark however the very different doctrines of the pious alderman whose words i have before quoted he hoped that the slaves would have their reward in another world for any sufferings they meet in this life but while the life of our trade depends so materially upon their slavery he would never agree to their emancipation citizens i cannot answer for the faithfulness of reporters but the newspapers have given me this as the logic which this honourable gentleman—for they are all honourable men—used in the debate of yesterday but let us compare this with other doctrines that have been held in the same place and then let us consider what are humanity liberty and justice we have been told by some of the honourable gentlemen in that assembly that our commerce was to perish that our constitution might live now we are told that humanity must perish that our commerce may live and that we must never think of emancipating millions of our fellow beings so long as the success of our trade depends upon their groans and bondage what then—is humanity only a thirdrate virtue alas how blind have been those philosophers and moralists who have hitherto considered it as the first the only virtue and who imagined that nothing was excellent but only in proportion as it grew out of or was conducive to this great object we are now told that it is a virtue of the third degree that humanity is to yield to commerce and commerce in its turn is to yield to the security of the emoluments of placemen and pensioners to the sacred rights of the proprietors of rotten boroughs citizens another argument that has been made use of deserves also considerable attention the argument is derived from the dreadful consequences of enquiry and discussion those jacobinical weapons with which some late infamous conspirators who in the language of the solicitor general carried their criminal enthusiasm so far as to wish for the establishment of universal peace and fraternity endeavoured to effect their diabolical purpose an honourable member tells you that the discussion not only the abolition but the simple discussion may be attended with the worst consequences as it would add a spark to the general conflagration that now rages in europe     i know not what these honourable men mean by the general conflagration that rages in europe if by conflagration they mean the war and violence at this time raging over the whole continent let them throw their censure upon the minister whose intrigues produced that conflagration if by conflagration they mean the light of political enquiry i hope and trust the friends of liberty unawed by threats or prosecution will fan the sacred fire will continue to cherish it and keep it alive altho their own blood should be necessary to feed the flame and that they will never neglect it till its sacred light has beamed into every eye and warmed every heart in the universe not such however are the sentiments of those honourable men who constitute the infallible majority of that honourable house o the enquiry is certainly a shocking enquiry echo they it is a dreadful enquiry at this time you must not touch the subject at this period the terms liberty justice slavery will ring in your ears for ever and lead to speculations and principles which at such a time are horrible true says mr secretary dundas rising with the whole weight and patronage of scotland upon his shoulders true says he heaving and straining under that accumulation of places and emoluments under which he has the misfortune to groan true the subject is horrible the islands are already in a slate of sedition and if liberty is given them it is probable they will use their liberty in a very improper manner let us think also of the situation of the affairs at home let us consider in what a ticklish situation our places pensions and emoluments are at this instant even conversation on the subject now can only excite confusion and agitation and therefore i wish that the motion had never been introduced and then he proceeds to shew another excellent reason the necessity of subordination why the house of commons should not proceed with the enquiry till they know the pleasure of the house of lords which has now been three years nodding over the business if the house of commons does not venerate the house of lords perhaps the people will not venerate the house of commons such is the interpretation—the plain english of his argument—for i quote not these as his words i shall read when i quote when i make interpretations i deliver them extempore as my own this is the true interpretation of his argument in reprobation     of the animated and generously indignant language of mr whitbread who with a courage and independence worthy a representative of a free and generous nation reprobated the tardy indifference of the upper house on this great question but mark his words the honourable gentleman in pledging himself to bring forward the motion over and over again if he knew it vain to do so and that their lordships would be against it—he must say that the gentleman meant mischief to excite tumult by provoking a fruitless discussion the author of this motion is a man who except upon one question has always uniformly voted with our present upright heavenborn and heaveninstructed minister yet mr dundas says if the honourable gentleman wished to give the alarm that justice had not been done by parliament in past years he stirred the embers of sedition how came mr dundas to suspect that the conclusion from the arguments in yesterdays debate would be that justice had not been done by parliament i find no such accusation from those who argued for the abolition if i recollect right there is in an old proverb—something about a guilty conscience—i refer however to the better memory of my audience but if we are to admit this sort of argument let us consider awhile the situation in which we shall be placed you must not agitate in the house of commons a question upon which the lords have shewn a disposition to put a negative you must not meet in popular assemblies to deliberate upon subjects which are in the contemplation of the legislature you must never repeat a petition once refused and therefore the refusal of the legislature like the laws of the medes and persians is to be considered as irrevocable and it is sedition to attempt to agitate a question which they shew a disposition to lull to sleep what then is become of your right to petition what is become of your right of remonstrance if even your representatives must not press a disagreeable subject upon a confiding house of commons without being charged with stirring up the ember of sedition sedition is a new crime lately started up among us and like jacobin and buggaboo may be applied to any thing that the speaker fears or hates search me ye lawyers for i see there are several present search me your precedents explore your voluminous statutes tumble over your high authorities and shew me a definition of this crime which like the serpent of moses   0 swallows up every thing that comes in his way or converts to its own semblance every thing that is disagreeable to the minister we weakly imagine that we once had rights if we had they cannot be annihilated by a vote nor suspended by a nickname if we have rights surely we have a right peaceably to investigate them to remonstrate again and again to agitate the question to day tomorrow this year and next year and again and again till the mind of the legislature receives that light which may be struck out among what they call the dregs of the people by which they may be induced to tread in a new path and may alter the resolutions they may have rashly taken but this new doctrine of the passive obedience of the lower to the upper house and of members in opposition to a ministerial majority this doctrine that we are to bow down with implicit reverence and entrust every thing without a murmur to the superintending providence of the lords in parliament assembled calls to my mind some circumstances which though not generally known are worth attention relative to the manner in which the agitation of this question originated the fact is that many of those who first started the question had no sort of inclination that it should ever be so seriously attended to—that it was in short a mere party job in order says one to keep the popular attention from grievances at home let us enter into an enquiry respecting oppression abroad let us impeach year after year season after season and parliament after parliament a man whose only crime is having obeyed with zeal the masters whom he served and whose system iniquitous as it is is not only sactioned but cherished and encouraged by the existing government let us talk also of the rights of black men lest the rights of white men should be too much discussed let us go to africa and the west indies that while the attention is engaged in things abroad things at home may go on to our liking but their opponents were longer sighted than themselves they saw thro the thin disguise and determined to fight the enemies of liberty with their own weapons they saw that with proper management the discussion of this question might lead to the discussion of principles which afterwards they could apply to practice at home and thus as i have been told by a very valuable character whose name i shall not mention because he has already suffered enough from the iron hand of oppression—suffice it to say i have     been told this by one of the foremost of the agitators of this discussion that the cause of the poor africans was made a mere stalking horse by both parties many of the first and apparently the most zealous promoters of the cause having no other view than to promote their respective designs at home in such a project it is not easy to conceive which party must inevitably be worsted and now that the supporters of old abuses perceive too late the consequences they want to crush the enquiry entirely because they find that instead of distracting the popular attention from grievances at home it has rivetted their attention to the principles from the neglect of which all abuses spring but sir william young with arguments as brilliant and as weighty as if they were just come fresh from the mint contradicts the language of mr dundas relative to the seditious disposition of the islands he finds another argument to build upon and therefore proceeds without ceremony to pull down the argument of his friend and thus says one of these honourable gentlemen in reply to the other gentleman equally honourable the slaves are very loyal to their masters—we understand now it seems what courtiers mean by loyalty i thought it meant respect and obedience to laws fairly made and impartially executed but sir william young conceives loyalty to be a blind and implicit obedience to those who think proper to lash us when we dare to murmur the slaves are very loyal to their masters and this argument is worthy some observation and attention there are no peasants in this country more happy than the negro slaves what citizens is it an argument to prevent us from doing justice to the slaves in the west indies that the people of this country are reduced to a situation equally deplorable with those negroes whom they half despise and half pity but this is thought too cold by the learned alderman whom i have so often quoted he says i affirm that the condition of the negroes is happier than that of the poor among ourselves citizens i know not whether this is one of those statements which the orator thought selfevident and therefore did not deem necessary to pursue any further or whether it was one of those sudden rays of light and truth which burst in upon the mind sometimes in the heat of investigation but supposing the latter to be the case i am rather inclined to think that if this opinion had suggested itself a little earlier     when he was preparing the brilliant speech by which he hoped no doubt to recommend himself to some fresh contract or little bonus he might have pursued the argument much further and thus continued his oration— nay mr speaker so incontrovertible is this argument that it might not only be supported by the actual experience of every honourable member of this honourable house but i have absolutely written documents and calculations in my pocket by which i could demonstrate it to this honourable house nay i can produce proofs from the writings even of the jacobinical advocates of the abolition of the slave trade themselves to support me—for if this honourable house will turn to the work of one citizen wadstrom on colonization page    this honourable house will find these words as to the traffic of the slave trade as the whites practice every fraud upon them in the quantity and quality of the goods delivered and in trepanning their persons the blacks cannot carry on equal trade on equal terms without resorting to similar practices as to the injustice cruelty and rapine which at the instigation of the whites they practice on one another they are not more disgraceful than the well known trades of crimps and kidnappers and pressgangs the consequences of all which as this honourable house well knows falls entirely upon the lower orders of society all of which he continues are carried on without foreign instigation in several european countries and even protected or connived at by their governments nay mr speaker it would require no great eloquence to convince you that the parallel between the two situations is much more close than this honourable house would at first suppose nay and that wherever there is a difference that difference is in favour of the blackamoor negro slave for are not the people of this country suddenly seized and carried to crimping houses just as the blackamoor negroes are in africa where they are kept as long as pleases their masters or till they can find an opportunity to dispose of them are not the common people in england like the blackamoor negroes in africa treated with hard labour little kindness and less food are not those who are kidnapped and doomed to fight for us willthey nillthey punished with stripes and blows as this honourable house knows very well and are they not crammed down into miserable holes and dungeons and all that sort     of thing suffer me to call to the attention of this honourable house the miserable situation of poor englishmen—in crimping houses and presshouses and tenderholds and i am sure this honourable house will then perceive that the blackamoor negroes ought to be very well contented so long as white englishmen whom this honourable house knows are of the same flesh and blood with this honourable house are treated in such a manner nay and for matter of that if we were to do any thing for these here blackamoor negroes those there jacobins might perhaps say rightly enough that if we are to be reforming we ought to begin reforming evils at home before we go abroad for charity begins at home says one of our wise old ancestors and if this honourable house does not respect the maxims of our wise old ancestors how should the people you know and so as i was saying mr speaker i will prove to this very thronged representation of the people that the impress holes and the dungeons of crimpinghouses and the tenders and all that are worse than any thing the blackamoor negro slave experiences for i am enabled to assure this honourable house that poor englishmen when they are impressed are thrown into a place called the hold where they are kept day after day to compel them to enlist upon bread and water just sufficient to keep life and soul together and if they lie down to sleep the rats that run about the hold disturb them by gnawing and tearing the hair off their heads i am glad however that our wise minister is about to tax powder for poor men will not now be in so much danger of having their hair gnawed off in these most miserable dungeons because why there will not be any powder and pomatum to tempt them whereas the rats now sometimes eat their hair and sometimes their ears so that when the poor men are induced to enlist they look as if they had been in the pillory and mr speaker to keep up the parallel and show this honourable house that the condition of those blackamoor negro slaves on the west india islands is not worse than the condition of the lower orders of the people in this country i shall ask this honourable house what is it but slavery to toil fourteen or fifteen hours a day and after that not to get a decent subsistence for their wretched families what does this honourable house think slavery is does it not consist in stripes and bondage in the whole produce of your labour going to those who have not toiled     with you and nothing but wretched offals left for you what is slavery but having no rights no power to mend your condition nor no power of getting redress from the laws which this honourable house very well knows while law is so dear and wages are so low no poor man can possibly get in this country nay mr speaker is it not admitted that the principal difference between freemen and slaves consists in the one being governed by laws of his own making and the other by laws made by his masters because why we all love ourselves best and they who make laws will always make them for their own advantage and they who have nothing to do with making the laws will have no advantage at all now it is well known to this honourable house that the common people in england have no more share in making the laws than so many blackamoor negroes and therefore that they are slaves and as here in england those who toil and bleed for us are robbed of all their rights because they have so toiled aed bled now what is this but slavery and therefore what necessity can there be for abolishing the slave trade when the blackamoor negroes are no worse off than our own people for what though we have a commons house of parliament is it not very well known that the common people have no right to vote for them and therefore mr speaker one set of people making laws by which another are to be governed willthey nillthey makes them slaves and as the slave trade goes on here as much as in africa with this difference that the slaves who are seized and sold by crimps and pressgangs and the like are sold not to work in plantations but to be shot at in a war in the success of which if success were possible they can promise themselves no advantage whatever such citizens is i suppose the sort of argument which this learned alderman would have made use of if he had had time for that consideration which the subject demands he might also perhaps have animadverted upon the pending requisition bill he might if he had chosen have animadverted upon the unconstitutional powers vested by this bill in the hands of justices of the peace such as the clause that justices of the peace for the several divisions are to hold a court of general session for hearing as the last resort the appeals which may be made from the respective parishes by which without any trial by jury whatever the liberties and ultimately the lives of our fellow     citizens in the lower orders of society are to be determined upon of the same despotic complexion he might have said is the clause that petty sessions are to be held to receive the return of the parishes to such orders and to attest and inrol the men to be raised and for hearing the appeals of parishes c against the proceedings of regulating officers and this which is perhaps the most extraordinary of all that if returns of men for any parish or place shall not be made within three weeks after the service of the order by the constable or tythingman the justices in petty session may summon the churchwardens and overseers making such default to appear before them and if it does not appear to the satisfaction of such justices that such default has been unavoidable and hath not happened by wilful neglect they are required to fine the churchwarden without trial by jury without examination of witnesses in open court they are required to fine the churchwarden in the sum of thirty pounds for each man to be levied by warrant and distress on the goods and chattels of such churchwarden c and overseer if the churchwarden neglects to attend the summons as above he may be fined any sum from twenty pounds down to five pounds without trial by jury without any sort of trial whatever by the arbitrary will of the justice of the peace he may be committed to the common goal without bail or mainprize for a space not more than a month nor less than a fortnight and all this for not being sufficiently vigilant in crimping buying and inveigling those poor slaves called the common people of england into the worse than plantation drudgery to which this bill consigns them it might be asked what are the reasons why these clauses receive not the same revision which others which bore less hard upon more opulent classes have received the answer is obvious the revised clauses affected a set of men who not only have representatives but influence and weight and whose complaints could not be treated with contempt but as for these unaltered clauses they are parts of the general system justices of the peace are appointed by the crown and it is necessary every now and then to be vesting additional power in their hands that they may keep the lower classes of people in order who if they had the jacobinical right of trial by jury might have justice done to them when it would be more convenient for the exigencies of the state that is to say the exigencies     of ministers and placemen that they should be hurried on board a tender or thrown into a dungeon without any opportunity of vindication for this it is that power is to be vested in justices to send on board the tenders all whom they think proper to determine have no visible mode of subsistence and thus any man who has rendered himself obnoxious to these petty deities without possibility of redress may be seized and hurried on board a tender to toil and bleed at once a briton and a slave i am aware citizens that many other arguments might also be adduced to prove the truth of the position that the condition of the lower orders of the people in this country is as bad nay in some respects perhaps worse than that of the poor africans who are doomed to slavery in our west india islands who toil for the luxuries of others but want themselves the necessaries of life who furnish the nectar that enlivens our banquet but who pine in sorrow and hunger drink their own tears and eat at the known peril of the most barbarous punishments the tops of the green plants which their own toil has reared yes citizens i know it is not only in the west india islands where misery pines where groans are heard where anguish sobs in the cheerless gale and breaks the silence of the joyless night no in the wretched cabins of the poor artificers of this country i have seen myself famine and disease shuddering under the mouldering roof and crouching over a few mouldering embers that no longer emitted one ray of comfort go citizens to that part of the town where our weavers once resided in cheerful abundance but where now want nakedness and misery unspeakable throng every street and make each tenement a pesthouse this i have witnessed myself before the iron hand of power tore me from the sphere of my active exertions in behalf of my fellow citizens how must that affliction have been aggravated during that season whose severity has reached even the joints of affluence and grandeur through folds of ermine and double wadded doors how many of these poor beings must have fallen victims to that piercing season the bills of mortality may represent them perhaps as dying natural deaths but famine miserable famine was the real cause of those diseases which brought them to their miserable end relieve this slavetrade then ye friends of humanity—abolish unnecessary war abolish unnecessary places and pensions     let not one hundred and sixtytwo boroughmongers consider themselves as the sole electors of that assembly which as it legislates for all ought to represent the whole population of the country o wilberforce if thou art indeed that man of humanity which thy zeal in the cause of the wretched africans would lead us to believe seek not so wide for objects of thy benevolence nor expect that redress can begin in the western hemisphere the seed the root of the oppression is here and here the cure must begin if we would emancipate our fellow beings in whatever part of the world it is not by becoming ourselves the slaves of a minister that so noble an effect can be produced if we would dispense justice to our distant colonies we must begin by rooting out from the centre the corruption and oppression by which that cruelty and injustice is countenanced and defended citizens i am warm i cannot withhold my honest indignation i cannot see the sufferings of my fellow creatures and own myself a man without feeling the boiling blood rush round my heart in stronger tides let me not however by an imprudent warmth stimulate you too far judge me thou posterity who without the passions and prejudices of the present day shalt view my actions and shalt read my heart—i wish not to rouse to violence i would warm your hearts with a holy flame i would awaken the settled glow of humanity not impel you by the volcanic explosions of anarchy and bloodshed i detest i abhor alike the assassins knife whether openly brandished by usurping power or

the friends of reform—the introductory lecture of the autumnal course delivered by j thelwall wednesday september  d      citizens it is with great pleasure i meet you once more under circumstances i believe considering the state of the public mind still more auspicious to the cause of liberty than those under which we parted during the last season the anxiety and zeal with which in common with thousands of my fellow citizens i was prompted to labour in the public cause became so far injurious to my health that my life was in danger of falling a sacrifice to my exertions i come now before you with my health in some degree recruited ready to repeat those exertions wishing not by them to make myself any thing but desiring to make the cause of liberty and the triumph of human felicity all in all both to myself and you citizens you will permit me to bespeak your candour the exertion necessary to address you at the opening of a season is much more considerable than those who have not been in the habit of public speaking can suppose even this short recess occasions me to come before you again with that trepidation and anxiety which the importance of the cause i am labouring in is well calculated to increase there are always great advantages to be encountered on the renewal of any exhibition of any kind after a vacation and which must particularly operate when every thing depends upon the mind and exertions of the individual and when he is to trust to the moment for that expression with which he wishes at once to bring conviction to the judgment and rouse the amiable feelings of the soul this difficulty is still more increased from the impediments thrown in the way of mental preparation by the attention i have been obliged to pay to the enlargement of the room and the arrangement of the accommodations necessary for the throngs of auditors who honour this place by their attendance i trust therefore you will   0 listen with candour to the efforts i make this evening and that you will pass over those defects which result from the circumstances under which i stand and attribute them to the right causes another disadvantage i labour under upon this occasion results from my having been induced by particular circumstances to make some alteration in my plan it was my intention to have commenced this course with a very different subject from that which i am going to bring before you during my recess my time has been of course divided between contemplating those beauteous scenes which abound in the part of the country i retired to viewing the state of society calamitous and miserable enough indeed even in the midst of that eden of fertility and in directing my mind to those pursuits which might better enable me to do justice to the arduous situation in which i stand these circumstances cooperating together with the accident of having devoted some serious attention to the political works of hume and particularly my having fallen in this course of reading upon his essay on eloquence induced me to chuse as an introduction to this course of lectures an enquiry into the natural connection between eloquence and liberty and a refutation of some of the sophisms which that ingenious philosopher introduced into that essay not very friendly to the cause of truth and liberty i had occasion however as soon as i came to london to change this plan i had the mortification to observe that among the friends of liberty and reform there were strong symptoms of the growth of a disposition to envy faction and division against which every true friend to the rights and happiness of mankind will be anxious to set his face i am well aware and you will easily perceive that nothing can be so fatal to the progress of liberty as a spirit of this kind and that therefore there is nothing which it is so important to expose in proper colours that it may become the object of hatred and avoidance to those who but for thus contemplating it might be deluded to be the tools of personal faction when principles and not men ought to be the objects of their attention and when the happiness of millions and not the quarrels and contentions of rivals or calumniators ought to engross the faculties and call forth the energies of the human mind citizens i am not desirous of inflaming but of healing divisions and i will admit that a disposition to supicion     which is one of the chief causes of those factions into which the advocates for the cause of liberty so frequently split does not always as at first sight one might be led to suppose proceed from the worst and basest of motives that actuate the human mind there are generous qualities in the characters of men so nearly allied to certain vices and foibles that it is not found a very difficult matter amongst the agents of corruption to turn the very virtues that should warm our bosoms into scorpions to sting our peace and instead of suffering them to be conducive to our happiness to make them instruments of our destruction if we consider the real character of the principle of liberty we shall find that it is naturally connected with a certain degree of jealousy the great importance of the principle we are contending for occasions a thousand anxieties relative to those whose exertions we look up to for the promotion of its success as the tender mother suggests a thousand fears and apprehensions relative to the welfare of her babe while the hireling regards with perfect indifference all those probabilities of injury and danger with which the little cherub may appear surrounded so frequently in our anxiety and zeal for the cause of liberty in our conviction of the great importance of promoting that principle we are apt to have our minds perturbated with a thousand needless apprehensions and frequently to glance the eye of suspicion at the actions of our fellow citizens when if we had the cause less at heart this feeling might not be so prevalent i am therefore ready to make some apology for those who may be active in disseminating suspicions but i wish it to be remembered how far this apology ought to go we may excuse—we ought to applaud the man who weighs every circumstance who scrutinizes every action who dives to the very bottom of the soul of any individual or set of individuals before he reposes that confidence in them which if they are unworthy of it they may hereafter abuse to the injury of the cause but there is a wide difference between caution and calumny between jealous circumspection and the factious spirit of cabal and ferocious denunciation one may be excused from the good qualities of the heart or soundness of judgment which frequently produces it the other if it does not proceed from the worst of dispositions must certainly result from the blindest infatuation and i warn every friend to the cause of liberty at the same time that he keeps the argus     eye of jealous scrutiny upon the conduct of every man at the same time that he anxiously forbears to repose any more confidence in any man than results from the necessity of the circumstances under which we are placed may require—i warn every friend of liberty to avoid that malignant disposition to calumny suspicion and denunciation which has disgraced the otherwise glorious revolution of france has brought to the grave so many virtuous and enlightened characters has annihilated so much intellect that might otherwise still have been flashing light truth and conviction through the universe and has occasioned that country after all its struggles for the glorious principle of equality to go backward instead of forward in the career of truth and justice and to relinquish some of the most noble principles that were ever propagated for the felicity and moral advancement of man citizens this disposition to jealousy which actuates and which under proper regulations ought to actuate the breasts of those who are zealous for the cause of liberty has not escaped the observation of the tools of ministerial corruption the spies and agents of the infernal system of despotism veiled under the semblance of law and constitution despairing of success from other efforts conscious that like all men engaged in a bad cause every step that they take to extricate themselves from the difficulties into which they are plunged will but embarrass them still more—conscious that every effort they make to crush the cause of liberty and extinguish the light of human reason does but recoil upon themselves and like the stail in the hand of the unskilful thresher destroy—not the brains it is true but the heads of those who wield it—finding that their attempts to destroy the advocates of liberty have but promoted the cause and that by stretching too far the string of despotism they have so destroyed the energy of the bow of power that it will twang no more as usual nor drive home the darts of persecution to the hearts of those whom they wished to destroy—conscious of this they have changed their mode of conduct and being no longer capable of deluding themselves with the expectation of success by exertions in the open field they skulk behind the walls and bushes of pretended patriotism and thence attempt by covert arts and secret machinations treacherously to destroy those who invincible in the truth and justice of their cause laugh at the malice of open persecution and defy the storms of their arbitrary authority panic struck also at     beholding and who so blind as not to behold the rapid diffusion of the principles of liberty through every rank of the community they feel themselves called upon for still stronger exertions at a time when their folly and their injustice has palsied the arm of ministerial authority and occasioned the once omnipotent hand of corruption to sink listless by the side they wish in vain to defend feeling this they appeal to their last resort—they attempt to divide those whom united they cannot prevail against but whose attachment to the cause of human happiness it is impossible for them to forgive we have knit ourselves together say they in one phalanx distinctions of whig and tory we have buried in oblivion and thus united with the legible proclamation on our foreheads that we never had any other principle than the principle of getting into place when out and keeping in when in—with this proclamation engraved in brass and stuck upon every frontlet we have armed ourselves with lawless arrogance and with this weapon and this impenetrable helmet we wish to protect ourselves in the places of power and emolument which at the expence of almost thirty millions of taxation upon the groaning people we have monopolized to ourselves but it is in vain that we have made our citadels so strong it is in vain that we have thus armed to defend them the multitude are a swinish herd no more they have learned to walk erect they have discovered that they have intellect they have discovered that they have rights and the starvation to which we have reduced them disposes them to demand those rights we must therefore set them together by the ears among themselves as quickly as we can—induce them to hate each other and cut each others throats—or at least to blast each others characters and disgust each other with the thankless pursuits they are engaged in or else farewel to all those golden visions of hereditary places and immortal pensions with which we have delighted our imaginations and filled our coffers strong in a just cause vindicated by the zeal of honest advocates and rendered triumphant by the intrepidity of upright juries these champions for the rights of man will prevail say they against the sacred immunities of places pensions and emouluments if we do not find some other means for their destruction ye taylors ye lynams ye grovess and ye gostings bring us no more your reports of what     this patriot does or that patriot means to do even your forgeries and falsehoods though we know you are as ready to swear to falsehoods as to truths even these will no longer avail ye must adopt another plan ye must scatter the poisonous seeds of suspicion in every breast and sow division between patriot and patriot and if any little personal difference happens to arise between them or any misapprehension or suspicion you must inflame it into the rancour of party hatred and factious animosity and then perhaps we may have an opportunity of enjoying our golden situations a little longer and the system of corruption may last our day—which is long enough for us you know for by courts and courtiers there is one maxim at least of one philosopher which is always revered and held sacred—when we are gone let the world be consumed with fire it is no matter to us all our concerns are settled let us then destroy the characters of the men whose lives we cannot destroy let us calumniate those whom we cannot move and if we can neither find juries corrupt enough to do whatever we bid them nor assassins who are bold enough or cunning enough to wreak our revenge in secret at least we will stab that which is dearer than life to the generous mind—we will endeavour to send the honest and upright advocate of truth and liberty abroad into the world under the semblance of a monster as bloated with vice and corruption as we are ourselves citizens for such designs it is but too easy to find engines there are and there always will be men whose zeal and enthusiasm is greater than their judgment and these may be for a while deluded there are and there always will be other men whose minds are full of envy malignity and personal animosity and to these a hint is sufficient and there are and always will be others who without having either done or suffered any thing for the cause of liberty aspire to the reputation of being the only good patriots by denouncing every person who has done or suffered any thing and holding up to hatred and derision every one who happens to have that share of public confidence and affection which they know they have not the ability or virtue or courage to procure by their own exertions such individuals will always be ready to seize upon the slightest pretences for sowing divisions and creating factions not because they themselves really suspect or at least not so much as they pretend the men against whom they direct their fury not on the other hand that     they really wish to prevent the cause of liberty from triumphing—not that they are corrupt enough to mean to play the game of the minister but merely because they wish for that popularity which they do not like the trouble of procuring by honest and proper means to these men trifles light as air are confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ and there is no accident of the convivial hour there is no individual circumstance in the history of any mans life so insignificant that they will not seize upon to weave the web of calumny to blast his reputation and destroy his exertions whenever it happens to suit with their malignant caprice or be conformable to the views of their narrow ambition but though such dispositions exist in some few bosoms and though the passions of those are frequently communicated by a sort of contagion to the most excellent of human minds the real friend of liberty and man will not be driven from the course of exertion by all the calumnies and jealousies of faction others may be factious but the true friend of liberty will rather be the victim of faction himself than lend his assistance to disseminate those seeds of division which he knows must be injurious to the cause of truth for it is not personal popularity that is sought by the real friend of liberty no it is public good and he deceives himself strangely indeed who can imagine that he ever was seriously attached to the cause of public happiness and virtue who can suffer any degree of injustice or persecution to drive him from a steady perseverance in those principles without the establishment of which the happiness of mankind never can be advanced nor the calamities of the human race removed there are other dangers however which result from this factious spirit—this disposition to suspicion and jealousy against which it is proper to warn the friends of liberty the man who feels himself goaded with unmerited reproach is in danger of losing his temper and being stimulated to rashness which may be pleasing to those to whom otherwise he would be too wise to render himself subservient he may be urged perhaps in his zeal to prove how unjustly he has been reproached to acts of imprudence which may be friendly to the views of those spies and tools of oppression with whom guarded caution mixed with activity and zeal for the public cause constitute the highest crime because it renders the assiduous champion of human rights who unites those qualities superior to their little artifices and places him out of the reach of their base misrepresentations     it is therefore against imprudencies of this kind that i would particularly warn those who may be calumniated or who may have the misfortune to be thwarted in the prosecution of those pursuits of liberty and justice in which they are engaged these are dangers of which those who first stimulate to disseminate the principles of suspicion are well aware and there is no doubt but this is one of the objects for which calumny is frequently employed because it is frequently seen that warm and generous minds fall into this snare and lose the guard of prudence that they may get rid of those suspicions which instead of being thus thrown off their guard by them they ought to treat with contempt or to repel with the firmness and dignity of conscious innocence but there are dangers of a more alarming kind proceeding from this disposition to envy and suspicion and i am very much mistaken indeed if not forgetting the artifices and intrigues of the allied courts and cabinets of europe these are not among the the principal causes of those excesses and cruelties which have brought a stain upon some part of the revolution in france yes i am convinced that most of the crying acts of injustice that have sullied the french revolution are to be traced to this suspicious and factious disposition which i have thus endeavoured to represent in proper colours that you may abhor and avoid it and i cannot persuade myself but that if this principle of suspicion had been early eradicated that we should never have heard of the wanton excesses of robespierre and his party whose principles i must for ever revere though i abhor their practices so opposite to every thing which those principles well digested and deeply felt are calculated to produce had mankind in that part of the world experienced the advantage of a regular and gradual introduction to the principles of truth liberty and humanity which we in some degree enjoy had the scorpion malignity of suspicion generated by the base and treacherous corruption of the court been early exterminated from the gallic mind it is impossible that a principle the most benignant the most glorious that ever warmed the human breast should have been so disgraced as for one period we behold it in that country     i dwell not upon these excesses with a view to shock you from the principles of liberty europe is becoming rapidly convinced that it was not the principles of liberty that produced the mischief but that the evil flowed from passions and dispositions the most inimical to that sacred cause the principles of liberty are the principles of benevolence for i dont understand what liberty means if its object is not to promote the happiness of mankind and diffuse through all ranks an equal proportion of rights felicity and protection but let us observe the progress of suspicion let us observe the history of the rise and fall of the respective factions if two sets of men differed but a hairs breadth in principle the highflown enthusiasts immediately denounced the moderates as royalists and advocates for federalism while the moderates if such extravagant suspicions can be called moderation reverted the denunciation by calling out on every side that those violent enthusiasts were in the pay of the courts in alliance against the liberties of france and that they only wanted by the excesses to disgrace that cause in which they pretended to be so warm if we examine impartially we shall soon find that neither the one nor the other of these denunciations had any basis the brissotines were not advocates either for royalty or federalism they were not persons who attempted either to restore or modify the fallen despotism of france they were pure they were zealous they were generous republicans and if a doubt could have existed before their conduct in the hour of death proved them to be such in defiance of the calumnies that were heaped upon them nor can common sense for one moment believe that the energetic exertions of the jacobins those vigorous efforts of courage and intellect with which they roused the nation to an enthusiasm unparalleled in the history of man and drove the combined powers like chaff before the whirlwind were meant to support the cause of the allied despots of the continent by depriving them of their dominions and reducing them to the most degraded state of terror and humiliation let us then fairly and impartially admit that men may differ from each other in opinion without having corrupt and rotten hearts let us admit that even the most furious aristocrat may perhaps be deceived and deluded and that he wants nothing but a little serious argument and investigation to convince him of the error of the principles he has adopted     that even he perhaps has a heart warm and glowing for the happiness of his fellow beings though he is unfortunately ignorant of the means by which the happiness of those fellow beings can be promoted still more let us believe that it is possible for a man or set of men to differ from us with respect to some particular measures without immediately concluding that he or they must of necessity be hostile to the liberties and rights of man and wish to trample under foot those sacred privileges of which every man by the very circumstance of his manhood is entitled and which it is impossible for any set of men whatever to deprive him of the right of enjoying however they may take from him the present possession but there is another reason why we ought to be careful of these dispositions to split into factions and divisions what signifies to you or me what may be the difference in the particular parts of the system which you or i may have adopted if there are grievances mischiefs and oppressions which we are all of us convinced ought to be remedied let us seek by united peaceable and justifiable methods for the amelioration of society in those respects and leave the adjustment of more minute differences to the time when they become more important let us not split into fancied parties let us not give each other nicknames let us not distinguish this man as a thisite or the other as a thatite let us remember that not factions but the great body of mankind ought to be the object of our attention and that theirs is the cause that we ought constantly to labour to promote but of this we loose sight immediately that we put those contemptible ites at the end of names as if we were the adjuncts of some particular man whom we have been weak enough to make our leader not remembering that principles ought to be our only leaders and that men are nothing any longer than they promote those principles which are favourable to the happiness of mankind unfortunately from losing sight of this great truth the revolutionists of france have also lost sight to a certain degree of the grandest of those principles they have been so long struggling to establish i shall not enter at large upon this occasion into the investigation of the plan of government now before them this will be more proper to be treated upon when i come as in a few evenings i shall come to consider the indefeasible right of annual parliaments and universal suffrage but     let it be remembered that the true advocates of this universal suffrage the true champions of the real and just equality of man the true champions for the abolition of the odious distinction between citizens and low people so odiously restored by this last plan of the constitution in france brought themselves into disgrace by the cruelties engendered by faction and suspicion and brought by these means some degree of odium upon the principles they supported and thus france after a struggle of so many years seems in danger of losing by its factions and suspicions the glorious principle of universal equality—i dont mean equality of property no man was ever wicked enough to put that into the heads of mankind till reeves and his associators made their appearance among us he and his colleagues were the incendiaries who broached that doctrine and if it should unfortunately which i hope and trust it never will sink into the hearts of the common people they are the guilty wretches who at the bar of this country ought to answer for all the massacres and mischiefs which so absurd an idea has a tendency to produce it is not then this ruffian principle of equality it is the real the just principle of equality which says that all men—as paine has beautifully expressed it in that glorious and immortal work lately sent by him into the world—all men by the right of their manhood possess and to which their persons are their title deeds this is the sort of equality—an equality of rights for which i stand up as the advocate the equality which says that the man who produces every thing by his labour shall be as well protected as he who enjoys every thing by the advantages of his ingenuity or the accidents and circumstances under which he is placed this is the principle of equality that i defend this is the principle of equality which i could almost drop from the bottom of my heart a tear of blood to behold that the people of france are upon the eve of relinquishing and relinquish it according to this compromising constitution they will—at least in theory though the framers of the plan have glossed it over with expedients in the hope of rendering it palateable if therefore fellow citizens you are really advocates for the rights and happiness of mankind—if you really believe that fundamental truths ought always to be adhered to that expedients should be left to shuffling knaves and first principles be the land marks to direct the virtuous advocates for the   0 happiness of the human race—if you really wish to promote the cause of liberty—if you wish that the crops produced by your luxuriant soil should no longer be sent to feed hessians austrians croats bohemians and hanoverians—if you wish that emigrant locusts should no longer devour the fertility of this country—if you wish that the consequence of your industry should be plenty that the consequence of plenty should be universal and equally diffused happiness—if you wish that those calamities under which we groan should be removed that famine should be driven from our doors that inordinate taxation should no longer be heaped upon our shoulders to support in idle luxury and splendor those tools of corruption placemen and pensioners—if you really wish to promote your own happiness and that of your fellow beings dismiss from your minds the sordid principle of unfounded suspicion avoid by all means splitting yourselves into factions and divisions let candour the best anchor of freedom keep you to your moorings and when you do sail forward in quest of public happiness let humanity and justice be the pilots that direct your course and unanimity and benevolent feeling be be the mariner and the gale that direct and waft you to your port if citizens you will thus adhere to the great compass of principle and reason—though i pretend not to be god almightys nephew—though i cannot pretend to point out the oak under which i have lain while the dove of inspiration whispered in my ear yet i will venture to predict the day is not distant when the condition of britons must be improved knowledge is widely diffusing itself among mankind the principle of liberty has had a most rapid spread indeed during the last six or eight months mankind begin to feel in different parts of the country as they ought and i have been astonished to observe how numerous the advocates of liberty are even amongst those ranks and conditions of life in which we have been generally used to expect nothing but a servile compliance with the corruptions of aristocracy and the usurpations of ministerial tyranny shall we then relinquish this great pursuit from personal motives shall we render ourselves unworthy of the liberty we seek and thus lose the liberty we wish to obtain or shall we uniting heart and hand press boldly forward by just spirited and peaceful exertions towards the accomplishment of our object—towards the attainment of that liberty to which i trust all from their hearts     are attached and if there are any who now hear me or who may hereafter hear the doctrines that i have this night delivered who feel which under the restraints of principle it is justifiable to feel an emulation and ambition to obtain the applauses and affections of their fellowcitizens let them take from me one short and simple lesson—it is in vain that we make disputes about interest and duty if we wish to live among persons of enlightened intellect we shall find that interest and duty are one that he who labours to promote the general happiness brings to his own heart a satisfaction greater than any selfish exertions ever could produce and that he who instead of looking for popularity looks to the promotion of public happiness intelligence and virtue will earn eventually a more durable reputation than envy cabal and jealousy ever were capable of obtaining let us not forget that the reputation obtained by intrigue the popularity purchased by denunciation suspicion faction jealousy and envy is shortlived indeed while that which is obtained by principle and magnanimity will last for ever—the fame of marat flourished but for a day because built upon faction violence and injustice but the glory of thomas paine who has built his reputation upon principles and integrity and an unfeigned zeal for human happiness stands upon a rock that never can be shaken so long as the tongue of man can articulate the names of those heroes who have benefitted mankind so long in defiance of persecution will the name of thomas paine resound throughot the world for though i may not nor perhaps any other of his admirers agree with all that he has said in all his works or the precise manner in which he has sometimes treated his subject yet whoever observes the tenor of his writings and conduct must admit this was a man of principle who laboured for the promotion of the happiness of mankind who kept himself aloof and independent of all faction—this therefore is the man who has built himself a solid and lasting reputation because he sought for that reputation alone by promoting the happiness and welfare of man asterisks the following passages constituted a digression in the second lecture but they belong more properly to this and are therefore here introduced     i have spoken thus far in general terms because it is the general cause not the particular feeling that principally actuates my mind considering however the industry with which during my absence from town calumny has been employed against me it may not be improper to make a few brief observations upon that subject at the same time i shall carefully avoid all personalities and retaliation as my object is to prevent not to increase dissention and as it is a part of my system to have no personal quarrels and to cherish no animosities against any man who is labouring in the public cause whatever may have been his conduct to me in particular it is not difficult to perceive the source of these misrepresentations there are undoubtedly many wellmeaning but indiscrete men who are angry with me for withdrawing myself from the popular society a measure the motives of which i fully explained in the concluding lecture of the last season and which the doctrines enforced from this place sufficiently prove to have sprung from no departure from those principles of liberty to which i have so long been pledged it was also easy to foresee that a situation like this could not be occupied without exciting the envy and jealousy of those who have not magnanimity enough to look with complacency upon the good fortune of their fellowcitizens alas—those who envy me the applauses and emoluments of this situation know but little of the cares that surround it they perceive and exaggerate† the external advantages but they know nothing of the internal difficulties—the constant labour the perpetual anxiety and the sacrifice of health strength and social enjoyment which it demands if those things had been considered but ever so slightly surely it would not have been difficult to find a reason why a little retirement     in a distant part of the country should have appeared desirable to me without inventing the paltry story of my having accepted a pension from that caitiffminister who formerly attempted to pension me with a gibbet and an axe citizens i was not now to learn that calumny is the inevitable attendant of all active exertions and that he who wishes to benefit mankind in any way whatever must be content to receive as part of his wages not only the hatred and malevolence of those whose corruptions he would undermine but of others also whose factious intolerance cannot bear the slightest difference of opinion from the infallible standard of their own judgment it is not unknown to me—it ought not to be unknown to any man that whenever we engage in any efforts to ameliorate the condition of mankind if we escape the halters of aristocracy we ought not to be sure that we shall escape the guillotine of faction i am not therefore astonished that my back was scarcely turned—that i had scarcely reached the scene of my retirement before suspicion lifted its serpenthead and i was branded as a pensioned apostate who had abandoned his post and abjured his principles these suspicions however did not prevent calumnies of a very different nature and it is curious to compare the contradictory fabrications which were invented by the violent supporters of opposite principles who seem in a manner to have formed a coalition in this respect—or rather to have conspired together to place the poor bark of my reputation between the scylla of ministerial and the charibdis of democratic persecution to the scurrilous forgeries of the sun and true briton i shall make no reply—it is enough to say that it was in the sun and true briton that they were published and to confess the truth i have always had so much vanity as to be gratified rather than hurt at the abuse which ministerial hirelings lavish upon me a report which has passed through a different channel ought not however to be passed over in silence because it will exhibit in just colours the fidelity for which those gentlemen called spies are so famous and shew you in the clearest point of view how much justice there is in the government of any country upon the foundation of their testimony putting their fellowcitizens in jeopardy of their lives it will perhaps be entertaining to hear that while i was     in the isle of wight struggling with the attack upon my constitution information was actually lodged by some of those virtuous spies—that i was at the head of the riots pulling down a crimpinghouse in st georges fields if you ask me the authority for this anecdote—i tell you that i have aristocratic authority mr ford of the secretary of states office has himself declared that they received such information while i forsooth not knowing what my spectre was doing in st georges fields was  0 or  0 miles from the spot and scarcely capable of stirring across my room—a pleasant counterpart this for the report that i had retired from public duty upon a pension of three hundred a year citizens i will not make any boasts either of my abhorrence of violence on the one hand or my abhorrence of corruption on the other the man whose actions do not speak in his favor deserves no credit for his professions but this much i will venture to assure you that whether i ever head a band of incendiaries or become the humble servant of mr pitt i will never be bought for three hundred a year nor hanged for pulling down a crimpinghouse but let us dismiss this grating subject let us dismiss if the warmth of youthful exultation will permit let us dismiss all egotism—all personal feelings let me exhort you also every one who may hear me not by misrepresentations and illfounded suspicions to stir up personal factions and divisions so hostile to the cause of real freedom let us unite heart and hand and struggle together in the great cause of human happiness and if we must have rivalry among us let this be the struggle of our rivalship—not who shall most defame but who shall most merit—not who shall engross but who shall deserve the largest portion of the approbation and affection of mankind     the tribune no xxiv report on the state of popular opinion and the causes of the rapid diffusion of democratic principles part the first delivered at the lecture room beaufort buildings sept        it has been well observed citizens by one of our most celebrated poets that the proper study of mankind is man we may certainly then affirm that in the present state of society when political disquisition and novel truths are diffusing themselves in every country one of the most important studies is the state of popular opinion relative to those questions with which the universe is agitated nothing can be more desirable than to know the state of popular opinion under such circumstances because it is by knowing and duly weighing the state of this opinion that violence is to be prevented on the one hand and persecution on the other ignorance will always dispose mankind to exertions unfriendly to human happiness as he who is groping about in the dark is more likely to do mischief to himself and others than he who walking upright in the broad eye of day has the opportunity of perceiving and understanding the objects by which he is surrounded it is therefore that at this early part of the season i come before you to give you my report of the state of popular opinion in this country i cannot pretend that this is a subject which has been merely suggested upon the spur of the moment it was in my meditation before i adjourned the last session and it was a part of my intention to employ a considerable proportion of the summer recess in observing and collecting the necessary facts in different parts of the country if strength had enabled me to fulfill my designs i should have been able to come before you on the present evening with a much more ample and satisfactory account than i can at present pretend to present it was my intention to have divided my time principally between studious retirement and democratic pedestrian rambles from which     the opinions of different classes of society may be collected—in these rambles i meant to mix with all classes who came in my way—for they are grossly ignorant who suppose that a knowledge of the world is to be obtained by associating with one class of society and therefore it is that the most ignorant of all the ignorant animals that crawl upon the face of the earth are generally found among our high and mighty potentates and rulers i will grant that we are never thoroughly acquainted with society without some opportunity of viewing and beholding the conduct of the highest orders but as the highest orders are few and the intermediate and lower orders are numerous i will venture to assert that it is better of the two to be shut out from the society of the highest than to be excluded from all intercourse with the great mass of the people there is another reason why i would recommend to my fellowcitizens democratic excursions of this kind the man who travels in a postchaise from place to place generally collects no other information than is derived from the milestones he passes upon the road or the charges made by his postillion and the landlord of his inn he who on the contrary leisurely roves from place to place and mixes with every company that falls in his way has an opportunity of discovering the real springs of human action and learning the real value of the human character for it is not beneath the embroidered vest it is not beneath the plumed hat of aristocracy that virtue is to be exclusively sought many a time will this glorious principle united with animating intelligence be found under the tattered garb of the peasant and in the bosom of the laborious and despised orders of society to mix with all ranks of men is the duty of every individual who has the opportunity so to do for it is thus that we practically learn that great lesson so theoretically enforced that all mankind are of one family and that mutual obligation connects every individual of the universe together in one chain of sympathy and reciprocal duty   and thus as withal we excursively rove   the mind will expand and the heart will improve   till embracing mankind in one girdle of love   in natures kind bosom we daily improve   and no selfish distinctions to fetter the soul   as brothers to all learn to feel for the whole   peripatetic       with these views it was that i marked out for myself when i quitted london a very extensive rout a rout however which i was unable to pursue the plain fact being that my exertions in this place had undermined my health too much to permit me to execute any considerable proportion of the project i had formed and that i had scarcely set my foot upon the delightful shore of the isle of wight when a cruel disease seized upon that vital organ which in this tribune is particularly acted upon and threatened me almost with dissolution such information as i had an opportunity of collecting i did not however neglect and the fruits both of my personal observations and of my enquiries i shall lay before you acknowledging at the same time that my sphere of actual observation was confined to the island the neighbourhood of portsmouth gosport the adjacent roads and the city of chichester the last of these places i cannot mention without repeating by way of prefatory digression a little anecdote which may tend to illustrate the sapience and dignity of the loyal magistracy of that corporation and to shew you with what horror and alarm those most dreadful of all dreadful monsters the hunters of political truth are regarded by the official guardians of the constitution in church and state as now administered upon strong and repeated invitation i was induced to make a visit of a few days to chichester where i was informed a few avowed and unintimidated citizens to whom i was hitherto known only by name eagerly desired the opportunity of my acquaintance to such an invitation it was not easy to return a denial and i embraced the opportunity of repairing to a spot famous for its dependence on the famous duke of richmond and for the unequivocal display of his right noble apostacy i knew pretty well what sort of character was to be expected among the leading members of a rotten borough with the palace of a great man in its neighbourhood and i was not ignorant of the mean arts of official cabal yet what was my surprise to hear that the worshipful mayor of this worshipful corporation on the report of my intended visit had called his macers around him and given them express orders to keep a sharp lookout to the preservation of peace and order in the royal city during the time i should remain there and that if the least disturbance arose in any corner of the city no matter where i was at the time     that horrible jacobin should immediately be taken into custody—to be committed i suppose to the house of correction there undoubtedly to experience the humane treatment of jailors and the comforts of close confinement that mr pitt and mr dundas might again have an opportunity of convincing you by their logic that such confinement is no punishment—but this citizens was not enough a very stately and pompous member of that corporation who calls himself an esquire and boasts that he has prevented four petitions from coming to parliament from different boroughs and corporations in which he has a most constitutional authority and domination—this pompous gentleman we caught in the very fact of walking backwards and forwards under the window of the friends house where i was and clapping his ear against the crevices of the window to overhear our conversation we did not let the poor gentleman go without his errand for all ancient maxims ought to have sacred veneration paid to them and it would have been a great pity the old proverb should have been marred that listeners never hear any good of themselves thus much citizens for undoubted facts if the positive testimony of one individual is to be believed which in a circumstance so atrocious and extraordinary i grant you hardly ought to be the case there is a tale behind of much blacker import such testimony as if it were on the other side of the question would send a dozen or two of suspected persons to the tower and suspend for a third time the habeas corpus act that this esquirelike evesdropping member of the corporation of chichester with two other persons formed a plan and for two or three hours paraded the streets of chichester for the purpose of executing that plan—either to seize me by force that is to say kidnap me or if i made the smallest resistance to put an immediate period to my life i do not give you this as a story i mean to affirm as true it is a maxim with me that miracles are not to be believed on the same slight testimony as ordinary circumstances and i yet lack the faith to believe that however great their profligacy the aristocrats of the country have courage enough to put into execution schemes so daringly infamous threats of violence however no more than threats of persecution ought to terrify the advocate of truth from the duty of promoting human happiness and feeling as i trust i shall be credited when i say i have long felt not only a principle but a passion for the diffusion of political information and the     improvement of the condition of my fellow beings i have not relaxed in my endeavours to qualify myself for the situation in which i stand i have kept the tribune constantly in my eye and amidst all the wild scenery of the isle of wight the bustle of a great seaport and the social circles of chichester have endeavoured to collect as far as opportunities would admit such facts as would enable me to form some judgment of the state of popular opinion at this time citizens in order to accomplish this i have endeavoured to make observation go handinhand with my studies and while one part of my time was devoted to the examination of the arguments in favour of despotism from hobbess leviathan to peacocks defence of parliamentary corruption another part was taken up in observing the condition and developing the opinions of my fellow citizens for this last the sphere in which i moved was in some degree favourable for it is the promiscuousness of society and not the multitude that enables us to form in any degree a just idea of the state of popular sentiments and the places in which i have been are particularly favourable to observation in this respect inasmuch as they are the resorts of persons promiscuously collected from various parts of the country the island particularly is visited for its natural curiosities by people from all parts and it is among persons thus promiscuously thrown together that i have endeavoured to form as far as i was able some judgment relative to the state of opinion as to the persons to whom i was introduced and the individuals who sought my society on account of the principles for which i have been persecuted i put them entirely out of the question because these were evidently drawn together by a sort of magnetism of principle which occasions us to be pleased with those who correspond with us in opinion we should always therefore when we wish to estimate popular opinion put these out of the case and this is another reason why great and mighty potentates frequently betray so much of that ignorance to which i have before alluded used to flattery and unable to exist without it herding only with the particular set of beings about them who cajole them with false pictures of society and taking their own little narrow circle for the universe they think that the great majority of the people must be precisely of opinion with the little majority of the virtuous assemblies they frequent   0 but citizens it is in inns and public houses in groupes promiscuously met upon the road in passageboats and ferryboats in and upon stagecoaches and the like—in farmhouses and in all places of promiscuous resort where i was myself unknown and where i knew not an individual with whom i conversed that i collected my opinion on the state of popular feeling taking the persons thus promiscuously met as the fair though casual representative of the public mind i cannot but say that he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the strong current of popular opinion daily increasing against the men at present in power and the mad system they have been so long endeavouring to thrust down the peoples throats persons of all descriptions and almost all situations of life may be met with in excursions of this kind and i have been pleased to find that the opinion which i had drawn from my own observation was considerably confirmed by that of others who had opportunities of extending their observations through a larger sphere perhaps it may appear an extravagant calculation yet i believe it is by no means an exaggeration to declare that according to my observations and according to the correspondent facts i have collected from the observations of others taking all the classes of society together where you meet them in situations where they can openly speak their minds because they suppose they are not known a majority of nearly three to one will be found unfavourable to those mad and extravagant measures to which the present ministers seem attached even the most firm and furious aristocrats find themselves obliged to make considerable concessions and there are some subjects upon which the whole country appears in a considerable degree unanimous even those who profess aristocratic principles agreeing upon certain points with those who profess principles favourable to democracy among these we may reckon several of considerable importance we shall find i believe that the opinions of mankind are almost uniformly against the late prosecutions and that even those persons who seem disposed to wish that all the state prisoners had been hung up at once yet agree that the prosecution was marked with a sanguinary spirit never equalled in the annals of this country and readily admit that pitt and his administration have shewn a disposition for blood though     not so successful yet but little less keen and ferocious than that which distinguished robespierre and his faction in paris i declare to you that i have heard persons who think no words sufficiently strong to reprobate the measures of the french who think that even as it is at present administered there is something divine in the constitution of britain yet declare that they are very well convinced that a closer parallel could not be be found than between the present minister and the fallen dictator of france this is no exaggeration and i believe you will find it no difficult matter to draw the same confessions from the lips of those who were not many months ago the most zealous advocates of administration and all the measures they pursued there are other topics upon which i have found the public sentiment still more unanimous and you will remember that the places in which i have been are not very likely to have given me an opinion over favourable of the degree of sentiment that prevailed in behalf of liberty the island whose charms and luxuriant production ought to render it the paradise of human felicity is the centre of feudal despotism a few lordly tyrants exercise a tyranny so cruel that it is astonishing at the close of the   th century beings are to to be found so abject as to endure it i will not mention names because i do not wish to stir up ungentle feelings against individuals it is to reform the system that i aim and not to excite rancour against those who have the misfortune to be educated in that system the prejudices and errors of society are what i wish to see eradicated i do not wish to see men the victims of their prejudices and errors portsmouth and gosport are notoriously the centre of patronage and government influence and chichester is known to be almost immediately under the potent thumb of the great great great man whose consequence is increased by a tax of a shilling per chaldron on all the coals consumed in this metropolis yet citizens even in portsmouth which lives by war the voice of the people is unanimously against this war at least in as far as it is carried on with a view to the subjugation of france of invasion or continental exploit—it is true our successes at sea have inflated the vanity of john bull and many are much delighted with the idea of the british navy riding triumphant over the ocean but in the boats that passed from portsmouth to gosport i have heard the passengers—sailors—and even officers of the navy declare that they should like those conquests better if they found them     productive of any reduction in the price of bread and i have heard even naval officers exclaim with a degree of boldness little expected against the political measures of the times—i have heard them forward to declare and i have never met with any person who was hardy enough to deny their conviction that the calamities and miseries under which the great mass of the people groan are to be attributed entirely to the maladministration of men in power and to the foolish and ridiculous project of attempting the reduction of the french republic with one of these citizenofficers in particular i was considerably entertained he was an old veteran who seemed to have seen some service and among the rest i learned from his conversation that he had been in the west indies in his zeal for the happiness of oppressed and insulted man it is true he was a little vindictive but his heart upon the whole was rather brave than hardened the mention however of the conduct of our heavenborn minister threw him into a fit of true sailorlike indignation and in the execrations which he poured upon the author of the present distresses of the poor among other punishments which his active imagination devised he had the almost jacobinical wickedness to say he should like to feed him four times a day upon indian corn and let him have no drink the fact is citizens there is not a department in the state in which the ray of light and truth is not making its appearance the army seems as if it were not much disposed to be longer made the meer tool and engine of ministerial oppression the honest soldier begins to feel that he has not put off the rights and duties of humanity by putting on a scarlet coat he begins to perceive that all the people of the country have one common interest although the arts of ministerial corruption may attempt to make divisions between one class of citizens and another in fact the brave soldier begins to perceive that there is but one class of beings to whom the affections of the heart ought to be directed and that they are known not by the coat that is put on nor the trappings with which it is decorated not by a black cloak or a red jacket—but that they are known only by the upright form and stamp of humanity which constitutes the only title to affection and esteem citizens this war was once perhaps so near to being popular that what with the terror impressed on the public mind by a powerful faction supported by powerful armies it     might almost have appeared to have a majority of the people in its favour but whatever appearances were then produced it can now no longer be pretended that the voice of the people is with the war even aristocrats who bear all the strongest prejudices of the ancient system about them you will hear speaking with the utmost inveteracy against the continuation of this mad crusade and the worthless wretches in whose behalf we pretend to carry it on nay in this respect the aristocrats are more inveterate against the unfortunate emigrants than the democrats themselves the philosophical among the latter description of men may drop the tear of sympathy over the errors the delusions and even the vices of these victims but the aristocrat has no commiseration left for them and i have heard from the lips of the most professed advocates for existing corruptions the most bitter execrations and the most fervent prayers for the destruction of them all particularly one afternoon i had the pleasure of riding a little way with one of those aristocrats upon the roof of a coach for you know we democrats must not be ashamed of our principles and there is no disgrace whatever in finding it more convenient to travel upon the outside of a coach than the inside nor have i yet attained such refinement as to be much attached to being shut up in a glass case with a varnished cover over my head like the preparation of a stuffed monster in the cabinet of a natural historian—while enjoying then the prospects from the roof of a stagecoach i was joined by an aristocrat who happened to be one of the naval officers who had been upon the famous expedition to quiberon we had not then received the news of the catastrophe of that expedition but my companion after giving me to understand that he was present at the landing of the emigrants made no scruple of declaring his opinion that every man of them would be cut to pieces and he concluded with a most sailorlike oath that by god he hoped they would be so for he knew not what those damned lubbers of emigrants did in this country or why we should have spent our blood and treasure in endeavouring to restore such a pack of damned cowardly rascals to their estates—yet so far was this man at the same time from being at all infected with the principles of jacobinism as they are called that in boasting what great exploits we should perform     at sea he wished that the americans would join with the french that we might blow all the republican rascals to hell at once such is the opinion even of aristocrats relative to these gentlemen emigrants in behalf of whom we are wasting our best blood and reducing our people to famine in behalf of whom we can find stores and provisions to send upon their frantic expeditions while the industrious poor are starving and calling in vain to their profligate drivers for bread citizens every fact that i have observed every opportunity that i have had of looking abroad whether i have drank my bason of milk in the stone kitchen of the farmer in those parts of the island where you cannot meet as in many parts you cannot with the common receptacles for travellers—whether i have repaired to an aristocratic looking inn or set down in little hedge alehouses—or whether i have crossed in the common ferryboats that passed between gosport and portsmouth or in the passageboats that ply to and from ride whether i have travelled about the country on foot have journeyed in a caravan or taken my seat on the roof of a coach i have seen and glory to have seen so wide a diffusion of the principles of truth and liberty that i am sure if the advocates for reform would but persevere and preserve their temperance—if they would avoid factions on one hand and being made the tools on the other of villainous spies who wish to plunge them into violence that the minister may have a pretence for establishing a military despotism over us there is no machination of ministerial tyranny—no device of inquisitorial persecution though reeves could recover his reputation from that sink of infamy into which it is sunk and restore those associations so busily employed some time ago in disturbing the peace of society thereis no power upon earth able to snatch from us the glorious prospect of social amelioration to result from the restoration of our natural and constitutional rights—our annual parliaments and our universal suffrage which corruption has secretly and gradually stolen away war and corruption have long reigned hand in hand and the spawn of ministerial dependency produced from their fatal union has preyed upon the vitals the morals     and felicity of mankind while a few bloated vipers and serpents glutted with the miseries and destruction of mankind have swelled to a power and grandeur equalled only by the noble plunderers and empurpled ruffians that disgraced the declining state of the roman empire——yet these depredators are the people who talk of property and fearful least justice should call them to account—least honesty and virtue should be restored to their ancient rights talk of protection against levellers—the frantic creations of their own disordered brains as well might the banditti of castile while their caverns are filled with the spoil of murdered travellers when they hear that the officers of justice are on their way barricade themselves in their subterranean dwellings and say—fellowplunderers we must defend our property this system however draws towards its dissolution—the symptoms of its dotage are already apparent and the extravagant and preternatural exertions of the last three years have brought it apparently to the very brink of this awful catastrophe yet in the paroxysm of madness and infatuation the minister perseveres in demanding efforts still more disproportionate to its strength and more fatal to its existence experience preaches in vain disaster after disaster in vain cries out forbear—mad phaeton is in his car and the world must be consumed before he will quit the reigns regard the history of the last years of his administration—mark the whole progress of this ruinous crusade—behold how ridicule has has dodged the heels of all his wasteful measures—how disappointment disgrace misery and absurdity have stared him in the face at every turning and then wonder at the frenzy of the man who can still adhere to his visionary projects when this war was first talked about—when it was firit thought necessary to delude the people of britain into a struggle for the extermination of gallic liberty you were told forsooth that france was presently to be conquered and that the war could not possibly last beyond one campaign nay according to mr burke it was only a phantom we had to combat—a mere imagination which as soon as the torch of british indignation was uplifted would vanish away for having put his spectacles upon his nose and     examined the map of europe he declared that it was impossible to discover the spot which once was france the king was gone—the nobility were gone the priests were gone—the age of chivalry was gone and nothing but an immense blank—a vacuum presented itself to his eyes you therefore had nothing to do but to fill up this vacuum with an army of british soldiers and german allies and the business hocus pocus was done at once and yet citizens not only one campaign is over two three campaigns are gone by and if mr burke and the whole college of jesuits to help him were to put on two pair of spectacles apiece save only the little barren spot of corsica they could not find the speck of earth on which allied europe can raise a trophy in commemoration of those great exertions by which they were to overrun every spot of land where this nullity as they affected to call it and wished to make it liberty dared to raise her head and the light of human reason dared to shine an ther of the wasteful projects of this great and sapient minister was the conquest of the westindia islands but look a little seriously upon the state of affairs in that quarter and answer me whether the probability exists that one foot of westindia territory shall long remain in the hands of any european power you would not abolish the slavetrade you would not wash the guilt of blood from your polluted hands you listened to the great scotch logician mr dundas and he convinced you that you ought to finish the century in the same iniquitous way in which it was begun that it would be a shame to have a little patch of humanity at the fag end of that hundred years the whole of which had hitherto been one continued scene of cruelty—of westindia slavery and eastindia murders you listened to this flimsy sophistry you would not abolish the slavetrade but if you had had a few grains of understanding in this particular—i speak this to the legislature of the country—not to you my fellow citizens—for i suspect that the majority of the persons who now hear me did not wish to continue that iniquitous traffic—if those before whom the question was agitated had exercised but nine grains of common sense and reflection they would have perceived that the period was fast approaching when it would be impossible from the very nature of things to continue the slavetrade much longer they might have perceived that the only consequence of attempting to prolong it beyond its natural date would be that effect which in a great degree has taken place the total and precipitate emancipation     of the blacks before they were fit to receive that emancipation and consequently scenes of cruelty and horror which humanity cannot but sicken at even while she exults in the prospect unfolding for future generations when blacks no more than whites shall longer groan under the yoke of slavery and lift up their settered hands in vain to remind their fellow beings that they are men and brethren but monopolists—cannibals who fatten on human gore—wished to continue the bloodstained traffic of africa and see the consequence you would not abolish the slavetrade but the wicked jacobinical convention of france would they would go a step further i shall not commend that step if any choice had been left it is not to be applauded it is only to be excused from the dire necessities of the times and the circumstances under which they laboured they went further the whole herd of negroes rendered savage and ferocious by the cruel bondage in which they had so long been kept were emancipated at once and it is an absurdity too gross for human intellect to suppose that it is now possible to prevent that decree from operating in all the territories in the westindies though not so immediately perhaps as it will operate in their own this then is the prospect of the catastrophe of pitts famous project for conquering the westindia islands and monopolizing all the profits and all the duties and all the patronage upon collecting those duties of the whole sugar trade of the universe another famous project was the reunion of dunkirk to this country—but i will not dwell upon this subject i have too high a veneration for the unfortunate hero who failed in that attempt i will draw a veil over it and not excite your tender sympathy by a relation of his disasters next came the boastful projects of col mack who with a sabre two yards long and a pair of whiskers as long as his sabre threatened to eat up all the jacobins at a breakfast and restore louis xvii to the throne of france but it all went off in a whiff of tobacco which seared his magnanimous whiskers and obliged him to turn his back to hide his confusion not having like some persons who shall be nameless lost entirely the faculty of blushing no—he felt the blood not of courage but of confusion rising in his cheek and therefore prudently chose to conceal his shame from those to whom he could not show his valour     well citizens projects were not yet at an end and when all other things failed then forsooth louis xviii with a manifesto full of the sublime and beautiful in his hand and pardons and denunciations so hashed up together that one could scarcely perceive which was which in his mouth was to be restored to the crown of france to effect this the orderly faithkeeping government of this country persuaded the plunderers of la vendee to break the faith they had sworn to the republic well knowing that faith is never to be kept but with a regular government and even with that no longer than is perfectly consistent with the royal principle of selfinterest they persuaded therefore the poor wretches of la vendee to break their faith and throw that province once more into anarchy and slaughter and they sent an army of emigrants to assist these heroes of nocturnal plunder—for the chouans are nothing else—proper allies for emigrants you will say perhaps and for the patrons of those emigrants—and these men were to make a conquest of france—what french emigrants to conquer france did not  0000 of them run away in one day from france— 0000 men run away at once trust such men with arms—and expect great exploits from them if there had been one grain of valour if there had been one grain of honesty in their bosoms they would either have submitted at once as virtuous men ought to submit to the majority of voices in their country or else they would have shown that they had the courage at least though not the humanity of men and would have stood where they were to have defended their principles and not like cowards and poltroons with tears in their eyes and calumnies fictions and supplications in their mouths have fled to other countries for support in a struggle which they had not courage to support themselves well the expedition to quiberon failed as all rational men foresaw it would fail and yet upon the very morning when i departed from that part of the country i saw another immense fleet sailing to repeat as generally believed the same absurd attempt perhaps upon another perhaps upon the same part of the coast of france they sailed—that is the emigrants who were on board this fleet sailed—amidst the execrations of all parties and the only regret which arose at the foreseen catastrophe was to think how many of our own brave counteymen might perhaps be implicated in the event and how much injury would be sustained by the people of     this country from the loss of those stores provided for this erusade and its ridiculous counterpart the westindia expedition how shall we account for this hopeless perseverance shall we attribute the conduct of administration merely to the phrenzy which generally accompanies despair or shall we say that persons in very elevated situations are lifted above the influence of experience that their sublime faculties dwelling always upon their own golden speculations disdain to look down upon the events and realities which instruct a swinish multitude—or to regard the lessons derived from the common occurrences of life and that therefore they persevere in despite of the open conviction of former errors—or shall we as i believe we must attribute it to another cause more interesting and more sublime yes citizens all this ought to be attributed to confidence in supernatural assistance which though flow the stars perhaps have told them is sure in this opinion i am confirmed by having lately observed that our virtuous and excellent minister has got a fresh champion and advocate of most extraordinary and reverential character and this not an advocate who stops like mr burke to see the star fall upon the earth before she admires it no but one who soars to the stars herself and reads in them the book of fate by the optic glasses of aristocratical inspiration in short it is no other than the great mrs williams the farfamed fortuneteller who boasts in her dedication of her acquaintance with our most gracious and excellent queen and avows herself the champion of trembling royalty this heaveninstructed mrs williams—and surely a heavenborn minister ought to have a heaveninstructed comforter—this heaveninstructed mrs williams tells our sapient minister in her new book of fate price  s  d—and pray do buy it it must be a precious morsel that notwithstanding the ravings of brothers whom by her skill in judicial astrology she is enabled to pronounce a jacobinical impostor monarchy will be restored in france that the stadtholder will be restored in holland and that the present house of brunswick which god grant will reign to all eternity upon the throne of britain  00 citizens i cannot blame the ministers of this country for seeking supernatural assistance for they seem to have brought themselves into a condition from which no natural assistance can extricate them they have not only made those blunders i have already mentioned but worse than all they have sought to overthrow republicanism in france and they have almost occasioned it to triumph throughout europe—they have sought to increase the usurped power and sovereignty of rotten boroughmongers and they have sapped their power to the very foundation till the edifice of their highbuilt fame and glory seems tottering into ruins and we may shortly expect that like shakespeares baseless fabric of a vision it will leave not a wreck behind the plain and simple fact is and melancholy as it is to relate grieved at heart as i must feel at being compelled to announce it to you yet it is impossible to conceal the dreadful truth that the principles of democracy are spreading very wide in this country but i will not detain you at this late hour upon so melancholy a subject i will therefore adjourn till wednesday evening when i will trace the causes of its dissemination and point out the means by which it may be not checked indeed for i am afraid that is impossible but turned to the general advantage of the community and rendered it conducive to the renovation and the ameliorating of our happy and glorious constitution  0  rights of britons asterisks in the former volume of this work i took the liberty of inserting extracts from some of the reviews and making references to others relative to such recent publications as had passed the critical ordeal i take the liberty of repeating this practice on the present occasion by inserting verbatim the only review which has yet appeared of my vindication of the rights of britons—this is i believe peculiarly ustifiable in this instance as the work in question is intimately connected with the lectures published in the tribune it having been repeated in the lectureroom on the second third and fourth nights of the last season and containing in a collected point of view an abstract of those principles which have actuated my political conduct and which will be found diffused in a more ample manner through the whole of my discourses critical review july      p     the natural and constitutional rights of britons to annual parliaments universal suffrage and the freedom of popular association being a vindication of the motives and political conduct of john thelwall and of the london corresponding society in general intended to have been delivered at the bar of the old bailey in confutation of the late charges of high treason  vo  s symonds      mr thelwall informs us in a short advertisement that this pamphlet contains only the least important part of that statement for which he stands pledged to the public and which is soon to appear under the title of a narrative of the proceedings of government he sends this vindication into the world separately that the investigation of the principles upon which he has acted may prepare the public to appreciate with greater justice the practices by which his persecutors aimed at his destruction he asserts that he would have delivered this address on his trial if he had not been persuaded to resign his whole cause into the hands of messrs erskine and gibbs whose professional knowledge rendered them more adequate to the task of combating the host of crown lawyers that were embattled against him  0  this advice we are of opinion was judiciously taken however we may approve of many parts of this vindication as a political discourse it could not have been considered by the jury as an answer to the speeches of the crown lawyers nor however careless the author might have been of his life would he have acted the part of a wise man had he sacrificed it for the mere pleasure of delivering a severe censure on the measures of administration at the same time we do not dispute the right he had to publish it in its present form and think it upon the whole highly creditable to his talents as a political writer there are many passages which might be selected for their eloquence many for a nice and discriminating acuteness and many for the honest warmth of innocence and the fervor of unblushing zeal his defence of universal suffrage we are not prepared to agree with and there are other openings left for critical refutation but making allowance for a certain peculiarity of opinion and for the circumstances of the writer it is but justice to say that the performance is masterly both in matter and manner the following passage will serve as a specimen of the general style and conduct of this defence and contains a curious fact— the man who is at liberty can select his society and if he trusts himself alone with a stranger of ambiguous character or subjects himself to the misrepresentations of a perjured dependent he must abide the consequences but discretion is as impotent as innocence to guard against the inventive malice of the being who armed with the warrant of a privy council drags the victim from his home and excluding him from all choice of society and all guardianship of disinterested witnesses can afterwards come forward in a court of justice and deprive him of his life by swearing to circumstances which though they never occurred are incapable of contradiction but it is vain to cavil about particulars if loose conversations are once admitted as evidences of treason pretences can never be wanting to destroy the most innocent and virtuous of mankind yet to the disgrace of an english court of justice—to the scandal of the british character—to the indelible reproach of that constitution which those who have violated every principle of it continue so extravagantly to applaud—at  0  the close of the eighteenth century in a prosecution for treason is the feeble mass of accumulative and constructive charges bolstered by evidence of this contemptible nature for this purpose every tavern and coffeehouse has been haunted into which rare visitant as i have been to places of that description i may occasionally have put my head my hours of conviviality have been attended by spies and sycophants my doors beset with evedroppers my private chambers haunted by the familiar spirits of an infernal inquisition and my confidential friends stretched on the rack of interrogatory in order to extort from them the conversation which in the unsuspecting hours of social hilarity may have been uttered at my own table but it will not be believed—posterity will not credit the monstrous tale—that unsatisfied with former arts—despairing of

including definitions of democracy aristocracy and monarchy—original meaning of the word king—consequences of ministerial ambition c delivered at the lecture room beaufort buildings september  th      citizens the last lecture that i delivered in this place was the commencement or rather indeed the continuation of a report of the state of popular opinion i endeavoured to state as far as my means would enable me and candidly to shew you what my means have been the progress of popular opinion since i had the honor of meeting this company and i concluded with observing and giving you such reasons as appeared to me necessary to shew that there was a considerable increase of the democratic principle in this country i proposed then on a future evening to enter into the causes of this increase and to endeavour to point out the particular conduct of government to which we are indebted for this increase but before i enter into the particular causes it is necessary that i should give some explanation of my terms because words of almost every description are considerably abused in disputes between contending parties those to which i allude in particular it frequently happens that appellations of the highest virtue and excellence are used by the enemies of liberty as terms of the most contemptuous reproach when we consider the use of the word democracy we find that there are two interpretations to be given to it—the aristocrats are very fond of fixing an interpretation to it which the word never did—nor ever can bear in this or any other language there are however two distinct senses in which an englishman may naturally be expected to use this word if we look back to the real meaning of the term we shall find it to be a government by the great body of the people   0 now a government by the great body of the people taken in its strict and original sense does certainly describe a pure republic nay more it describes a republic without any intermediate order such as we now call a representative assembly but this is a system whose advocates in the present day if any are extremely few for the improvement of political science has enabled us to discover very considerable defects in all the ancient forms of government and it has been found that a democracy purely and simply considered can never exist save only in a small country consisting perhaps of a single city and a few miles of territory around it nor even in such a state can this species of government exist long without occasional tumult and disorder modern legislators therefore have invented what is called a representative democracy which is in reality if you adhere to the strict definition of terms no democracy at all because if the representatives are vested with the complete and full powers of the state i think i shall be able to state to you that this is the only thing which really justly and properly can be called an aristocracy aristocracy in fact originally meant a government of the wisest and who can have so great a right to be deemed the wisest as those who for their wisdom and supposed integrity have been selected by the great mass of mankind to be their rulers and governors this representative democracy is the real essence of what was formerly theoretically called aristocracy—the realization of the visions of sublime philosophers who in their attempt to discover how an aristocratic government ought to be constituted were never able to hit upon this project they foresaw indeed as every one would that a country ought to be governed by the wisest and were therefore anxious to establish a government of the wisest plato in particular considered an aristocracy—as the best government in the world but how was this wisdom to be discovered why forsooth a few philosophers among the musty cobwebs that hung about their cells were to dictate by a sort of divine right to the rest of the world and like the priests of the deluded multitude were to triumph by a sort of superstition of which they themselves were the authors and from which they alone could be expected to receive any advantage     having given these two definitions of democracy i think i shall be enabled to prove that every englishman ought in reality to be in a certain sense of the word a democrat i think i shall prove to you that what i shall call constitutional democracy ought to animate every breast ought to glow in every bosom ought to dictate to every intellect and that it is only by cherishing this glorious constitutional democracy—this emanation arising from the principles not from the corrupt practice of our constitution—that we can ever expect to relieve ourselves from the burden of immoderate taxation and to attain the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the fruits of our talents and industry let me then citizens put to your consideration this question what is the constitution of britain if we consider the external forms of our government we shall find that it consists of a chief magistrate and a senate of two chambers—the one elective and the other hereditary if we consider the description of this government which the spirit of our constitution has dictated we shall find it to consist of king lords and commons in parliament assembled now citizens to substantiate the assertion i have made that every true lover of the british constitution ought to be at heart a democrat it is only necessary to consider the meaning of the plain simple word—commons i should suppose citizens—notwithstanding the variety of abusive epithets that have been invented to obscure the real meaning of this phrase such as wretches rabble swinish multitude and the like—that it is still impossible for any individual to be so dull as not to know what the word commons means there is no man not even mr burke himself in the very paroxyism of his frenzy who can mistake a human being for a swine no man can be so ignorant of the english language as to suppose that the word wretch is a description of a class or order of beings there are wretches enough indeed in this country and woe to the wickedness of that aristocracy which has made them so wretched there are miserable beings indeed but it ill becomes those who have plunged us into this misery—this swinish ignorance to reproach us with their crimes and to think that their present usurpations are a justification for usurpations still more abominable and atrocious     the fact is that the word commons carries its own meaning with it every body when you talk of the king as one of the constituent parts of our government knows very well that you mean the chief magistrate of the country invested with certain powers and authorities by the constitution for the benefit of the people—yes for the benefit of the people this is the express condition of his power and the chief justice eyre himself who did not seem very anxious to make acknowledgments to the friends of liberty was obliged to declare in the outset of his speech that it was only for the protection advantage and happiness of the people that the laws of the country had raised particular fences around the person of the king and attempted to make him inviolable from the attacks of common incendiaries or individual violence which revenge might dictate or ambition lead to the king then is the chief magistrate—the executive power and he our constitution tells us is one and only one branch of the constituted authority by the lords we very well know what is meant though it would be difficult to find what is the meaning of some persons being made lords who have got that title it is however very well known that by lords we mean a certain number of individuals walking like other men upon two legs but unlike other men decorated with stars and garters and such other ornaments as you might have seen represented in gingerbread a few days ago at bartholemew fair they are called peers that is the companions equals and counsellors of the king for such is i believe the original meaning of the word and the constitutional sense in which it is to be taken because every peer of the realm has a right to demand whenever he chuses an audience of the king and has a right to give him his counsel and advice  leaving it to his wisdom whether that advice shall be followed or not thus then having found out that king means the only person we call king in the country and lords the whole of the persons called lords in the country i shall conclude that commons means all those persons who do not presume to be considered as either kings or lords or any thing else than mere common people it is true there are some amphibious animals who are in one sense commons but who are called lords by courtesy and mr windham and mr burke by their metaphysics might prove perhaps that there are uncommon men who     may be called commons by courtesy also but if they possess the capacity the shape and other attributes common to mankind i conclude that they are entitled at least to be considered as common men and consequently that by commons in parliament assembled we mean the democracy of the country who by their representatives are ought to be i mean represented in the commons house of parliament thus then citizens the constitution of great britain may be properly defined a democracy admitting some mixture of aristocracy in its legislature and adopting an hereditary chief magistrate to be responsible for the execution of the laws and who is called the king citizens modern theorists—for modern theorists we have had in abundance who have been very anxious by general denunciations against modern theories to abuse themselves mr burke mr windham mr wilde and some other champions of the fallen cause of chivalry are a little confounded at the old constitutional language which lawyers of two or three hundred years ago were accustomed to use they do not like to hear of the british commonwealth for commonwealth and republic are they know synonymous and therefore they have hunted for new theories and new coined phrases and have chosen to use a very curious phrase mixed monarchy now if these gentlemen instead of studying metaphysics had chosen to study their dictionaries a little they would not have made use of so nonsensical a phrase monarchy means a government in which the supreme power and authority are vested in one person how that can be and yet lords and commons have a right to share that power and authority with him is a paradox that will require all the subtlety of these metaphysicians to explain the fact then is that instead of talking of a mixed monarchy we ought to call our government a limited or restrained democracy the theory and the maxims of our government teaching us that it is for the sake of the democracy that is the great body of the people that all our laws and institutions are made and that all constituted functionaries are in reality as they always must be in practice whenever practice is called for subordinate to the grand object the welfare of that great body from whom all power is derived and for whom all power ought to be exercised     how then came this government to be called a mixed monarchy—or how can a monarchy be mixed lately indeed they seem disposed to get rid of the mixture and the chief justice eyre in plain and direct terms calls the government of this country a monarchy to pull down and subvert that glorious fabric the british monarchy are his plain and unqualified words let me ask this learned lawyer who made it a monarchy not the ancestors he talks of they made it not a monarchy—a despotic government of one they vested indeed in the hands of one man the executive power but the real sovereignty the right of making and altering the laws they vested—or if their language be supposed an image of their hearts they meant to vest in the great body of the people by their representatives by them chosen imagining that their councils would be rendered the more wise by having a house filled with men well educated and of superior knowledge which they called a house of peers but little did they foresee that in some future period—not at the close of the   th century it will undoubtedly be the   th before it takes place—little did they foresee that in some future period boxing and brutality were to be the qualifications of the ermine robe and that pimps and parasites were to be decorated with those ornaments which if they are to be worn at all ought to be the badges of honor virtue and actual service but these learned men happening to understand more of languages than principles and being able by the use of these languages to confound together the words king rex and monarch therefore endeavoured to make you believe that a kingdom a government by a rex and a monarchy are one and the same thing but let us enquire the meaning of the word king and we shall find it to be of a very different signification from the words rex and monarch as a learned etymologist informs me—for i profess myself to be but a plain man and neither etymologist nor scholar i want to discover the truth and a truth of six minutes old is as much revered by me as a truth that has the stamp of  000 years words and derivations therefore have little to do in deciding my principles i will use however when i can the knowledge of others to any good purpose king then is an old saxon word or rather a contraction of an old saxon word it is derived from the word konning which was sometimes     pronounced kenning and sometimes cunning—and from cunning or kenning—ben and king thus then in reality king means the cunning man you will please to remember however citizens that i do not mean to call the king a solomon again i have been once tried for high treason for calling the king a solomon already mr groves you know alias mr powell after saying that i spoke in the most contemptuous and reproachful terms of his most sacred majesty when he was asked by the judge what he meant by contemptuous and reproachful terms said he had heard me call the king a solomon you have heard the old proverb that the burnt child dreads the fire i am determined therefore never to call the king a solomon again being very well convinced that it is as high treason to call the king a solomon as it would be a high absurdity to call any of his ministers by that name however citizens to be a little more grave the plain and simple fact is that kings according to our ancient saxon constitution and according to the original meaning of the word were persons of eminence chosen to fill the office of first magistrate on account of their superior wisdom—real or supposed i say chosen for notwithstanding the boasts made by the supporters of divine right of lineal descent from the god woden or the devil knows what other gods or godlings i will venture to affirm that legally speaking the crown of this country never was hereditary till the revolution in      and that at this very time it is only hereditary under certain restrictions that is to say upon condition of a strict compliance on the part of the house of brunswick with the compact and terms under which the crown was granted citizens it is very true that our saxon ancestors had a notion so ancient and consequently so venerable is prejudice that wisdom is confined to particular families and therefore they always chose their king or their cunning man from one particular family but that they did chuse him is evident to every one who has read the history of his country they did not always take the elder son in preference to the younger an infant or idiot was never suffered to reign upon the throne and if they had the misfortune to be mistaken in their first choice they repaired the evil by setting him aside and putting up another     this was the practice of our saxon ancestors and i defy any historian to contradict the assertion and bring facts of history to support his contradiction what was the practice also after the invasion by that band of plunderers called norman conquerors how did they succeed did the bastard of a womanservant at an inn succeed to the throne of great britain by the divine right of lineal descent certainly not he seized the throne by power and conscious even in that barbarous age that power was not principle and that possession is but an unquiet state without some semblance at least of right he assembled the states of the country and procured himself to be formally elected upon certain conditions it is true with which he did not afterwards conceive that the faith of regular government obliged him to comply after his death did his crown descend to his eldest son no with the consent of the states of the kingdom he bequeathed his crown to his second son that second son was succeeded by his third in violation of what is now foolishly called the right of primogeniture and in fact if you trace the whole line of kings from the time of the norman invasion to the period of the revolution in      you will find that there never were more than three persons of the same family who from father to son took the crown in regular descent and held it during the period of their natural lives some circumstance or other sometimes real election sometimes pretended election and sometimes usurpation and violence under colour of election deposed one and set another upon the throne nay to take no notice of henry vii who could claim no sort of descent from any family whatever being a bastard—and of course according to the perfection of wisdom as revealed in the orthodox code of our law being no sort of relation either to his father or his mother—setting him aside we find henry viii convinced of this truth which i am now enforcing occasionally consulting his parliament he also had a tolerably obsequious parliament to get them to settle the descent of the crown on the head of one or other of this children just as his caprice happened to dictate or his passions prompt thus i think my position is proved and i could enter into a longer detail if it were necessary which it is not     as every individual can satisfy himself by referring to history that till the revolution of      there was no such thing as a legally established hereditary succession to the crown of this country for what then was the revolution in      made—every man who pretends to be an admirer of the constitution of this country as then established must acknowledge that it was made not for the purpose of enslaving but of further emancipating the people well then what is the reasoning that results from this our revolutionary ancestors had found that certain inconveniencies and very great ones too resulted from this species of elective succession they perceived and rightly that a crown such as it has always been held is much too great a temptation for ambition much too important an object to be made subject to what is called election but what under circumstances of such strong temptation must conduct to or found itself upon civil war rebellion or intestine commotion but citizens though they established an hereditary throne under certain restrictions which it is not now necessary for me to dwell upon they certainly did not mean to abandon the democracy this part of the constitution they proposed to leave entire i believe if they had thought a little more deeply they would have found that the only way to keep it entire was to introduce an immediate reformation into it to destroy the subterfuges of corruption by means of which that representation may be so debilitated as to be rendered a mere nullity—a phantom—or to speak more properly a fiendlike instrument of oppression veiled in in the angelic semblance of liberty to prevent this they would i believe if their attention had been sufficiently direted to this object have restored the people to their natural and unalienable right confirmed by the spirit of their constitution the right of annual parliaments and universal suffrage well then citizens if it be true that originally the democracy was the basis and foundation of the british constitution if it be true that the revolution in      was not made for the purpose of weakening liberty but for the purpose of strengthening it i have a right to conclude that democracy is of right the basis of our government and that we ought to consider the government of this country as a representative democracy admitting at the same     time the check and controul of an hereaitary aristocracy called a house of lords and vesting the executive government in a person whom we call not a monarch but a king this then is a sense in which the word democracy is not only justifiable but proper and to vindicate the democracy is equally legal equally constitutional as it is consistent with the fundamental principles of justice and of reason in this sense and in this only i beg the audience will understand me when i recommend the purification and support of the democracy of this country and a zealous attachment to the principles of that democracy but citizens it has been observed by hume and he brings a great number of facts to support this part of his observation that the government of this country which for a long while before had been running strongly towards a sort of democracy had when he wrote that is to say fifty years ago for a considerable time been setting very strongly in towards absolute monarchy and this man who calls himself a briton has the degeneracy of mind to declare that absolute monarchy is not only the natural tendency of the government of britain but the desirable end to which the constitution ought to arrive but while theorists of one description are talking of promoting the power of the crown and increasing the monarchic authority and while theorists of another description are talking of supporting the dignity of the democracy by vesting larger powers in the house of commons the plain and simple fact is that the government of this country practically speaking is no longer eether a democracy or a monarchy nor a mixture of monarchy and democracy but a usurped oligarchy constituted by a set of boroughmongers who have stolen at once the liberties of the people and abused the prerogatives of the crown to these men every species of reformation every species of discussion seems equally abhorrent and frightful to them the democracy which i described in the first instance and the constitutional democracy which i described in the second were equally dreadful every thing that should have a tendency to give any sway or influence to reason or to throw any authority into the hands of the people appeared so formidable that they looked with equal malevolence and hatred upon the most moderate reformer and the most violent revolutionist this was evident from the commencement of the revolution in france—a revolution which i will be bold to say till it was disturbed by the intrigues of foreign despots—till it was     counteracted by the machinations of pitt and his coadjutors conducted upon principles so philosophical with a humanity so astonishing and with a benevolence so enlivening that it has almost lifted ones ideas of the human species beyond the ordinary level upon which we have been used to contemplate them and painted to us that regenerated country as a nation of philosophers indeed—or rather of a guardian genii dropped from the skies to restore peace wisdom and happiness to every quarter of the globe oligarchic usurpers dreaded however the appearances of such a revolution they dreaded it more than they would have dreaded even the sanguinary proceedings which by their artifices have since taken place and upon which they have openly boasted their hopes of a renovation of that system which would be friendly to the continuation of the orderly regular governments of tyranny and corruption among the nations of the continent and to the system of rotten boroughs by which the people of this country have been so long oppressed taxed and insulted men who dread the truth and who have a cause to support whose most characteristic attribute is a rottenness at the very core always attempt to calumniate those who enter into discussion and i remember a couple of little anecdotes of this kind which perhaps will form some degree of parallel to the ravings of mr burke and his followers the former of these is from an essay on demoniac possessions printed in a recent volume of the transactions of the manchester society in which there is a quotation from an old book written by a pious divine of the church of england one of those inspired gentlemen whose holiness may be discovered by their lawn sleeves and who are vulgarly called bishops this venerable and right reverend book was written to prove the existence of witches ghosts and hobgoblins and the holy man who wrote it ventures to say that if you begin once to doubt the existence of witches ghosts and hobgoblins farewell to all hopes of the salvation of your wicked soul for as it is a wellknown maxim that they who are for no bishops are for no king so it is equally well known that they who are not believers in ghosts and witches cannot be believers in god—the other anecdote has come to me only in a traditionary way you must not therefore expect chapter and verse but i am told that one mr toplady in one of his sublime and terrible orations laid down a maxim equally clear and demonstrative of the damning dangers of investigation   0 and the consequent necessity of making a wide gulp and swallowing down the whole of the established creed at once without any chewing according to him if once you begin to waver and enquire you are lost and the steps to perdition are these from calvinism you go to armimanism from aminianism to arianism from arianism to socinianism from socinianism to deism from deism to atheism and from theism to the devil in the same way argues that mirror of political orthodoxy mr burke—for intolerance religious or political is the same in principle and must consequently appeal to the same mode of reasoning if these enquiries says he in essence at least if not in words—if these enquiries are permitted to go on in the world—if political reformations are tolerated by the regular governments of europe from overthrowing the despotism of france they will begin to reform the corruptions of rotten baroughs in britain—from reforming the corruptions of rotten boroughs they will attack places and pension and from attacking places and pensions they will proceed to grumble at enormos taxes—from grumbling at enormous taxes they will attack the enchanted castle of the british constitution itself overthrow the venerable remains of feudal nechromancy break down the magic tripos of ancestreal inspiration and hurl the great magician from his chair throw all things into anarchy and thence fall headlong into political perdition in the pious hope therefore of saving us from this calamitous fall he wrote the most raving and fantastical sublime and scurrilous paltry and magnificent and every way most astonishing book ever sent into the world a book i will venture to say which has made more democrats among the thinking part of mankind than all the works ever written in answer to to it or all the labours of those who according to the cant phrases and nonsensical jargon of our minister and his agents organise anarchy and establish confusion in every corner of the world yes i will venture to say that it is impossible for any thinking man really meditating upon the consequences of the facts and principles which every now and then escape from the pen of this burke even in this very publication and marking the shallow pretences upon which his     favorite doctrines are built—it is impossible for any man be his prejudice ever so strong to read that book without being convinced that mr burke is entirely in the wrong and that the truth lies on the side which he is so eager to calumniate—i confess for my own part that this was the impression the book made upon me i had like many others been educated in the high veneration of certain highsounding words and could not think that any thing could possibly be wrong in so glorious and happy a constitution as that enjoyed by this most favoured corner of the world where felicity blossoms like the primrose under every hedge and happiness towers like the lofty oak in every forest but when i came to read burkes book and i had a professional reason for reading it with very serious attention i was astonished to hear the man talk of the revolution in      as of an act by which the privileges and liberties of the people were taken away as an act by which our ancestors relinquished for ever a natural and imprescriptible right to which formerly he seems to admit we might have laid some claim when i found him him laying down theories so contradictory to sense and history and when i found him in order to throw unmeritted calumny on the friends of liberty representing a woman whose monstrous vices would have rendered her an object of disgust but for the particular situation in which the accident of birth had placed her as a star descending from heaven upon the earth to warm illuminate and cheer mankind—when i found him laying down principles which destroy his own conclusions and asserting facts which destroy his own principles—when i found him in the same breath denying the right of a people whom he calls free to judge of the conduct of their rulers and rejecting with disdain the supposition that such rulers ought to consult the feelings and stand in awe of the opinions of the people and yet contending that it was impossible for the members of the constituent assembly of france to effect their purpose of giving freedom to france because to secure any degree of sobriety in the propositions made by the leaders in any public assembly they ought to respect in some degree perhaps to fear those whom they conduct—to be led any otherwise than blindly the followers must be qualified if not for actors at least for judges     that is say the people must either be driven like wild beasts or else they must enabled to judge for themselves and how are they to be enabled to judge but by that very diffusion of information the very mention of extending which to the swinish multitude throws mr burke into such paroxysms of frenzy—to be led otherwise than blindly says he the followers must be qualified if not for actors at least for judges they must be judges also of natural weight and authority—not the factious authority of tyranny and wealth—but natural weight and authority—when i found in this farago every part of which that is not founded in gross falsehood and misrepresentation militates in principle against his own conclusions nothing to speak in johnsonian phraseology but the frenzies of sublimity the contradictions of reason and the tortuosities of sophistication could i avoid suspecting that there was something rotten in the state of denmark which this state juggler wanted to conceal from view and that there was in reality something so excellent in the principles espoused by the french revolutionists that it was impossible for a man even to write against them without promoting them the fact is that nothing can be fatal to truth but silence or commotion do but write or speak no matter how absurd the principles you set out upon and it must triumph nay perhaps the best way to promote it in an enquiring age is to write away against it as fast as you possibly can the writing of this book was certainly one of the first active causes of the growth of democracy in this country discussion was no doubt considerably promoted by the immortal writings of thomas paine joel barlow thomas cooper of manchester james mackintosh and many other enlightened men who took up the pen to vindicate the revolution of france little imagining that because they had thus vindicated the french revolution persons in this country some of whom had never read their books were to be tried for high treason for that which they had written but however these books assisted and undoubtedly they did very considerably assist the progress of the cause of democracy it is to be observed that they owed their existence to the publication of burke and therefore     we are to look upon him as the great father and first propagator of the principles of democracy in this country but mark the step that followed—it was thought that the reading of these answers would be a very pernicious thing indeed it was never attempted to prevent persons from reading the book itself for you know there is no harm in reading or inquiring upon on side of the question—but to attempt to examine both—o tis most horrible and on the opposition side all regular governments will agree that the press ought to be shackled as much as possible shackled therefore it was resolved it should be and the diabolus regis as in ancient times the kings attorney general was called—the diabolus regis that is the kings devil was instructed to launch forth the subterranean thunders of his legal pandemonium proclamations were immediately issued to forbid the people to read or think but the devil was in the people not the kings devil but tom paines devil or a devil of some other description and the more they were forbidden to read or think they did but think and read the more these proclamations instead of preventing their career of enquiry made them enquire with more avidity and judge with greater profundity and i understand it was very common on market days in little country towns for the country people who had never heard of paines name before to go to the little bookshops and not knowing any other way to ask for it to make themselves understood by saying why maister we want that there book we maunt read thus were proclamations against democrats a second effective cause of promoting the principles of democracy proclamations not succeeding the next thing was to proceed to prosecutions accordingly we find that men have been prosecuted by wholesale some for writing books others for having published them and others for having read them for my part my case was a little singular for i was prosecuted and that to the jeopardy of my life for not having read them joel barlows book in particular which was one of the things from which large extracts were read upon my trial i had never seen till after my acquittal since indeed i have read and admired it very much for i thought it necessary as i had been in danger of being hanged for it that i should know what it contained     that excellent and worthy citizen frend was also to be persecuted in the university of which he was so ornamental a member for having written a book professedly with a view of reconciling the contending parties and preventing the excesses which he and every man foresaw that the mad extravagances of the minister were plunging us into winterbottom for preaching sermons in which nobody can discover what were the passages that were called seditious was thrown into newgate where he is to lie four years and holt the printer of the newark herald while the duke of richmond and mr pitt are the principal members of the cabinet of this country is actually prosecuted condemned and imprisoned for republishing the letter which the duke of richmond mr pitts patriotic coadjutor so industriously disseminated throughout the country as containing the best and only means of restoring ourconstitution to its ancient vigor and purity but it was not enough to prosecute men for books perjured spies men known to be inflamed with the utmost rancour and hatred against the parties were permitted to swear in courts of justice from their loose recollections of conversation still more loose and unpremeditated and upon such evidence men were condemned for indiscrete and idle words words which not being deliberately spoken ought to be considered as all hasty and unpremeditated words must be in the view of candour and reason as perfectly innocent breillat was condemned for expressions of this kind alledged by his prosecutors to have been uttered almost a year before the time of his prosecution in the hour of inebriation in a coffeehouse the master of which gave the information poor hodgson was taken into custody crammed in a vile dungeon and now forsooth lies in jail for laughing over a bargain which no good man will approve—made between the prince of hesse cassel and the elector of hanover respecting the sale of their subjects at £ 0 per man and having therefore called his most sacred and august majesty a hogbutcher what is majesty if it can be wounded by a nickname—and who ever heard of any prosecution commenced against that most infamous slanderer edmunde burke for calumniating the still more sacred and august majesty of the people by calling them a swinish multitude yet for this foolish piece of levity and     buffoonery while the spectacled buffoon of st stevens is yet at large is poor hodgson forsooth also confined in newgate with a fine upon his back in violation of the constitution of the country magna charta and the bill of rights which expressly say that no judge shall at his peril lay unconscionable fines upon any man which must weigh him down for ever there he lies loaded with an enormous fine evidently for the express purpose of keeping him a prisoner for life because those who imposed the fine know that neither he nor his connections are worth the sum of money fixed upon his head the case of poor frost was still more wicked he had been drinking with his friends at a coffeehouse in a private room and was retiring to his home when a man stopped him as he was going through the coffee room i think you are citizen frost—yes i am—you have been in france lately—yes i have—how do you find things going on in france—oh very gloriously every thing goes on just as it ought—oh you are a liberty man you are for liberty and equality i think—yes i am for liberty and equality—what for liberty and equality and no king—yes sir for liberty and equality and no king—what are you for liberty and equality and no king in england vexed and indignant as every one must feel under such circumstances he replied yes sir i am for liberty and equality and no king in england i was present in the court when this cause was tried and i heard this diabolus regis fulminate such a volume of horrible denunciations and opprobrium against the culprit that one would have imagined if one had only heard his speech and not known the particular crime for which the man was tried that he had absolutely endeavoured to murder the king put his sons to the torture and violate the purity of his daughters indignation and not fear was stirred by these proceedings and men became more and more democratic when they saw the violence and injustice with which those who were the enemies of democracy proceeded the next step however instead of being a milder was of a more severe description men for speaking their sentiments in a convention—sentiments many of which may be traced to the glorious alfred himself the founder of our liberty—sentiments which at the period of the revolution     would have been thought to be the boast and the glory of englishmen britons—men for speaking these sentiments under that constitution which pretends to be the same as was established at the revolution in      were transported like felons to botany bay however what is the consequence how ignorant must those men be who think opinions will be beaten down by persecution—are they ignorant of the history of their country are they ignorant of the history of that christianity which they profess but which they disgrace by their conduct do they not know that when opinions are persecuted if they have but the least portion of comparative truth they will grow ten times stronger in consequence of that persecution men who never troubled themselves with the investigation before felt their blood boil within them at this treatment and stepped forward to shew that they were not ashamed of being the advocates of men thus cruelly treated and from being advocates of the men they became advocates of the cause though they would not have been so but for the injustice with which those opinions were persecuted well finding every thing they had done to prevent the progress of liberty had only increased its progress—what was the next object blood blood blood ferocity could no longer be restrained those beings whose glaring eyes rolling like fiends and convulsive lips quivering like beasts of prey with savage expectation exulted over those beings whom they thought they had in their power and thus made a place which ought to be the seat of wisdom and of sanctity a sort of beargarden by their ferocity—and who treated the persons who were brought before them like reptiles unfit to be looked at—these wretches—pardon me if i am too warm in my expressions—humanity cannot always bear with patience the recollection of such insulting brutality as i have encountered—these beings attempted to take away the lives of men for persevering in doctrines they themselves had set afloat and upon the stream and current of which they had sailed into the port of power in the midst of their ferocity however they were cowards they did not dare to act a wicked part like men and in order to fortify themselves against the consequences of so illegal an act they seduced persons who till that time were supposed to have some little character to join     them and make a most unnatural coalition and whig and tory joined together in a faction so heterogeneous as was never before thought of that thus by their united power they might venture to destroy a few plain simple fortuneless unconnected men who had dared to tell their fellow citizens that they ought to be free and that the principles which were true when these men were out of power continued still to be so now they are in hence came forward from the same cowardly spirit the assassinlike attempts of toadeating scribblers and hired journalists a pamphlet was published by mr reevess bookseller the very title of which treated us as if we were already convicted speaking of the treason committed by the persons now in custody upon a charge what affirm that a treason was actually committed and send these affirmations in heaps to every corner of the country while the men remained yet untried and the minister and all the lawyers around him had not found out what specific crime to charge upon the warrant what was this prejudication to be permitted in this land of liberty yes and more flagitious prejudications still sir john rose the recorder of london and one of the commissioners by whom we were afterwards to be tried if the papers recorded justly his speech on that occasion stood up in his judicial capacity upon the swearing in of the new sheriffs and accused us as though we had been men already convicted of having conspired against the life of the king gentlemen you will have in the discharge of your functions duties of peculiar importance to fulfil you will have to take charge and custody over men who have had the profligate audacity to lift the arm of treason against the sacred life of the king these are our judges o britons britons—what is our situation if upon such judges and such witnesses as those who sent us before such judges thought fit to provide the pure administration of justice is to depend but citizens these continual calumnies and prejudications would not do these are attempts which the passions of men cannot endure these are attempts which even the perverted judgments of aristocrats will not approve they had stretched the cord till it broke and the men whose lives they sought found glorious champions among the foremost leaders at the bar they wanted not the     assistance of honest men in another branch of the profession and they found a glorious asylum in that port and harbour of british liberty—an independent jury which all the arts and arts enough were appealed to of courtiers and ministers could not corrupt this attempt broke the charm of popular infatuation the furious aristocrats hid their heads in confusion and i am happy to say the democrats had the virtue and the wisdom not to abuse their triumph instead of becoming more furious they became more moderate and shewed the genuine excellence of their principles by not falling into that intemperance which the enthusiasm of weak minds is too apt to produce but which must be always injurious to the cause of truth and virtue but citizens there is another way in which these persecutions served the cause of liberty it was pretty universally believed that one of the terms of agreement made with certain parties when they came into the grand cabinet coalition was that the minister should absolutely prove us to have been guilty of high treason and convict us accordingly having found with what security and confidence he could promise and vow in the name of a house of commons without the trouble of a previous consultation the minister was realty to offer himself as godfather also for a british jury but a british jury is not a british house of commons and that which he promised in their names they did not think when they came to meet that themselves were bound to perform the country perceiving two such strong and mighty factions become so weak and so impotent that they were obliged to combine together in this extraordinary manner and to adopt such extraordinary measures against a few simple unconnected men began to enquire what the reason of this could be and they immediately found that the real reason was corruption—that these virtuous whigs finding they had no longer any chance of having all the loaves and fishes to their own share very prudently consented to take half the loaves and fishes rather than have none at all this then destroyed all confidence in party and confidence in party has always been found the greatest enemy to the principles of liberty and the genuine rights of mankind it is in principles only that you can confide     and no man can be entitled to countenance or affection but as he is subservient to those glorious principles upon which the rights and happiness of mankind are built and upon which alone those rights and that happiness can be supported the enormous taxation with which the people are burdened is another of the operating causes and when they found themselves by the multiplication of places and pensions burdened with additional loads this led them to consider a little more deeply the principles of that democratic branch of the constitution without which the constitution of this country would be worth nothing at all when they found that not only aristocrats but opposition men had places and pensions when they found that not only the tory pitt and the tories that adhered to him but the whig stormont now mansfield and other whigs held places of some thousands a year paid by the toil and industry of the people—when they found that illustrious ornament in point of intellect to the country in which he lives—that man of powerful mind whose exertions have contributed alone to furnish any respectability to the whig party during the last half century—that even fox though in truth he holds no sinecure place has spent the the money for which he sold one and that therefore he found himself bound to contend that patent places are property so sacred that you must not venture to attack them not even in the shape of taxation when they found all this was it possible for them not to see through the juggle of the present system and to wish for an assemby in which the democracy should be purely and truly represented in this then it is palpable that both parties are agreed administration and opposition are in harmonious concert when mr harrison brought forward a motion for laying a tax upon the places of persons receiving favors from the crown mr pitt thought it impossible any honourable gentleman could suppose the honourable gentleman to be in earnest no no he could not suppose the honourable gentleman could mean any thing but a joke astonishing assurance as though he should have said in direct language what does the honourable gentleman suppose after we have been grasping at power so long and so successfully—after we have devised so many expedients to turn that power to our own advantage—after we have laid such burdens upon the shoulders of the people in order   0 that we may fill our own coffers—after we have taken such pains to secure to ourselves the plunder of the country does the honourable gentleman suppose us to be so weak and inconsistent as that we will now suffer by our own free will and consent any part of that plunder to be taken away from us thus then whatever disagreement there may be between whigs and tories as to who ought to have the largest share of those places and pensions and the like it is evident that they are perfectly agreed that no part of this sacred property shall be touched for the purpose of lightening the burden of the people nor is john bull so blind as not to perceive the juggle and hence an additional reason for wishing the restoration of that true democratic house of commons by which alone this juggling can be put an end to citizens i am afraid i shall not be able to go through all the subjects i proposed this evening i believe i shall not be able to enter at large into the blunders the ridiculous professions the bravadoes and boastings with which the present war has been attended suffice it to say the people have opened their eyes and having discovered the real objects of the war are dissatisfied with its continuance they have begun to enquire how this war came to have been undertaken and they perceive it to have been undertaken in consequence of their having no organ to represent their interests in the national council—and they begin to think also that the man who earns every thing whose labour creates all the wealth of the country has almost as much right to have some voice in naming the representatives by which the country is to be governed as those who produce nothing but consume the whole something too towards opening the eyes of the people has been done by the imbecility with which this war has been conducted—which began with bullying was carried on with absurdity and is likely to terminate with disgrace this war and this conduct of the war has tended to a considerable degree to open their eyes and blunders and disgraces tho they have not made the minister a whit wiser have had some effect upon the people and if i am not much mistaken he will find that they are somewhat wiser than they were i hope they will be wise enough that whatever they attempt they will attempt by peace reason and justice not by tumult     and violence commotion and coercion are the game of the minister enquiry and reason are the game for us because we have truth on our side and if we once persuade the great multitude of the people and soldiers are people as well as we are—if we can once convince the great body of the people that they have rights and persuade them peaceably and firmly to demand their rights i should like to see the four or five hundred men or the four or five thousand who would have the impudence not to say the courage to stand against the congregated voice of the nation it is the very nature of men who are wrong who feel they are convicted of wrong and are confronted by millions having truth on their sides to blush and retire and violence is only rendered necessary by the intemperance of those who have not patience enough to wait for the peaceful operations of human reason citizens there is one very important thing however which the present war has taught us it has taught us the absurdity of the idea that one englishman can beat half a dozen frenchmen it has taught us that if englishmen formerly had any advantage over frenchmen it was only because the english were more free than the french for that liberty and enthusiasm are every thing and climate feature and complexion nothing at all the infatuation of ministers however still continues they have rummaged all the universe almost to find out persons who would accept of pensions commonly called subsidies in order to support the alliance and having ranged almost the whole of this terraqueous globe i suppose the next step will be to subsidize the prince of the infernal regions himself and get him to become their ally as being a fit—perhaps the fittest agent for their purpose nay there are strong symptoms of some negociation of this sort already for they have lately acquired an ally who may be supposed by some to have dealings with that great personage—and to be in no small degree in his confidence and i should not be at all surprized if mrs williams of store street who so timely stepped forward to boast her loyalty to the king and acquaintance with the queen of this country and dedicated her work to her foretelling that louis xviii would be restored to the crown of france that the stadtholder would be restored in holland and that the arms of britain in defiance of the false prophecies of brothers would be triumphant and the house of bruuswick preside upon the british throne for ever—i should not be at all surprized if this     august personage should by and by produce her formal credentials and take upon herself the character of minister plenipotentiary from his sooty highness and then both the pope and the devil may have their ambassadors at court and the atheistical practice of burning them in effigy on the  th of november disgrace the country no more but there is one reason why perhaps an alliance of this kind might not so very much contribute towards increasing the spirit of democracy among us as some other alliances have for we are informed that spirits neither eat nor drink and that the devil has wealth enough in pandemonium already he will not therefore want either subsidy or loan and it will not be necessary to send our bread and beef to the lower regions to feed these new allies this however we are obliged to do for our other allies and the common people finding themselves reduced to misery and starvation as in the most fertile parts of this country you may if you chuse see that they are reduced—i say the common people finding themselves so reduced for the sake of supporting the principles of aristocratic domination and usurpation is it not natural that they should be repelled with disgust from principles the maintaining of which cost them so dear and be led to enquire whether the cheaper dominion of pure justice and free equal representation is not to be preferred to the expence of aristocratic corruption citizens i cannot part from you without saying a few words relative to the condition of the lower orders of society you who listen to me are most of you persons who are raised in some degree above the misery which i have been condemned to view but do not suppose because you are a few steps higher on the ladder of society that the lower steps can be broken away without securing your destruction citizens in the isle of wight where nature seems to have poured her beauties her sublimity and her fertility with the most lavish hand where the common average of production upon every acre of land is a third part more than the average of the other parts of britain—in the midst of this fertility in the midst of this abundance in the midst of all the sublime beauties and romantic scenes which that enchanting country presents how often has my heart ached to behold the beggared misery of the great body of the people—great body no there is no great body of people there population is wasting away turn wherever you will you see cottages falling into ruin you see mansions of luxury rising the     fine feelings of whose masters cannot endure the sight of wretchedness and who therefore permit not a cottage to rise within their vicinity there you may see the little farmhouse turned into the summer house of some gentleman or lady of quality the grounds upon which the farmer lived turned into fermes ornes where the produce is grasped by the luxurious individual who has laid out the country for his pleasure and amusement it is true it is better that they produce corn there than that they should lay it out entirely in articles of pleasure and luxury but what is the consequence the wealthy individual hoards up the grain he has no calls for rent he has no particular necessities to compel him to do justice to society and bring his corn to a fair market and therefore he speculates and waits for an opportunity to take advantage of the artificial distresses of mankind and to such a height are these speculations carried that corn in the isle of wight has been sold this summer at  0l and   l a load standing on the ground though in the memory of the oldest man alive in that island it was never   l before citizens i have not concluded the picture it happens that this island produces in one year as is admitted by all the historians as much grain and cattle as would maintain the inhabitants ten it produces also the greatest abundance of shell fish particularly crabs and lobsters which are sent to the london market the markets also of portsmouth gosport and southampton are supplied with vegetables from this spot—and boats and even large vessels are built in the ports and creeks yet with all this except in a few particular spots the country is almost a desert in point of population and sometimes they are reduced to the greatest distress to get in their harvest you will suppose then that the peasantry being so few live in happiness and comfort that they have decent apparel decent education eat a little meat twice or three times a week at least but alas no such thing their wages are not sufficient for bread their children run in barefoot beggary in groupes at the chariot wheels of their oppressors and they will run for miles to get a halfpenny by opening a gate to let you pass through save your servant the trouble of dismounting as if the curse of canaan had fallen upon them that servants unto servants they should be and thus is the universal condition of the peasantry of that country i have been grieved at my heart to see human beings thus brought up in ignorance i have     been grieved to my soul to see beings whom nature made my equals thus subjected by usurping man to cringing beggary and doomed to play tricks and anticks to extort that from the levity of their beholders which compassion will not impart i have grieved to see the finest forms in the world for the rustic females of the island have peculiar advantages in point of person climbing over rocks to collect lampets—miserable shell fish that stick to the shelves and shingles to sustain an existence destitute of comfort destitute of intelligence destitute of every enjoyment—nay of every decent necessary of life oh citizens reflect i conjure you that the common class of mankind and you are one that you are one in nature that you are one in interest and that those who seek to oppress the lower seek to annihilate the intermediate orders it is their interest to have but two classes the very high and the very low that those they oppress may be kept at too great a distance—and in too much ignorance to be enabled to seek redress and that those who partake of their favors may take as little as possible from them of the wages of corruption and iniquity i have generally been most anxious about the condition of the most distressed orders of society because they have seldom an anxious advocate we are apt to feel disgust at abject misery and wretchedness and the sickly imagination turns away from such objects of contemplation it is therefore that i dwell particularly upon their case but it is not to one class of the people i wish to confine myself i wish not to limit justice to a particular sphere—i would have it extend throughout the universe and be participated to every being whatever be his condition his colour nation or his circumstances it is universal and not partial justice that i contend for the rights and happiness of the universe not the amelioration and benefit of a particular class let me however conjure the middling orders of society to remember that they are particularly interested that if we have not peace and reform in time those who are now the middling must soon be the lower orders for oppression though it begins with the poor and helpless mounts upwards from class to class till it devours the whole and let it be remembered even by the wealthy and unfeeling merchant who is now but too often the     ready instrument of ministerial tyranny that the only favor reserved for him is like the favor of polyphemus to ulysses—you have endeavoured to gladden my heart said the oneeyed monster by the beverage you have imparted and therefore when i have devoured your companions when i have torn their limbs to pieces and banquetted on their flesh you shall be the last sacrifice that shall be made to my rapacious maw     the horrors of royal ambition from the battle of barnet a poem in the peripatetic continued from p  0    loud cries of vengeance speak their brave despair   raging they turn as wolves their hunters tear—

opinion and the causes of the rapid diffusion of democratic principles part the third including inquisitorial associations—principles and conduct of the war—starvation—impolitic treatment of the soldiery c delivered at the lecture room beaufort buildings september   th      citizens on the last evening i entered into an investigation of the different species of democracy or rather of the different interpretations which have been given to the word and though i did not deny that there might be some prevalence of a spirit of absolute democracy among us the object to which i particularly directed your attention was that constitutional democracy which ought to prevail in this country which i conceived generally did prevail and which i recommended to your zealous affection and diligent cultivation i shall enter upon the business of this evening by observing that in the former lecture i was compelled to pass over some topics in a more slight manner than upon review i find consistent with their importance among other subjects there are many facts relative to the war and the influence it has had in rousing in the public mind an anxious desire for the revival of our constitutional democracy which were then not animadverted upon and also certain circumstances preparatory to the present infamous crusade which were indeed very slightly passed over the one i shall particularly notice is the system of inquisition introduced by the reevite associators a system it is true which late events have contributed in a considerable degree to supersede in england but which still continues to rage in another part of the nation i mean in scotland with a degree of obstinacy which would be surprising if one did not recollect that when judges are permitted to make the law which they are to expound there is no tyranny     so abominable no absurdity so gross which they will not have the effrontery to practise citizens during the last season i had an assistant or secretary of the name of kennedy whose only recommendation to me was that i knew he had been driven by persecution from scotland a country in which no man however innocent will stay to be tried if he can get out of it because there accusation and condemnation are the same thing one of the judges of the court of justiciary having indeed avowed as much by saying in so many words gin they had na been guilty they would na have been brought here this citizen contrary to the advice of his friends returned to scotland and was of course thrown into the tolbooth and a very curious charge is exhibited against him—to wit—of having been guilty of absenting himself from scotland when the treason hunters were after him and having come to england and there connected himself with the disaffected conspirators against our happy constitution which last as i understand are the words of the procurator fiscal and the interpretation of them is having been secretary to an acquitted felon i dare say you had no idea before that you were a gang of conspirators or that we may be conspirators without knowing it just as mystical divines inform us that men may sin—or as they call it fall ten times a day without being conscious of once tripping but perhaps it will not be amiss to take more particular notice of the origin of this system of inquisition than i had time for on the last evening it had its commencement in the reevite association which under the fanciful denomination of protectors of liberty and property stepped forward to denounce every man whom they chose to consider as a leveller or republican though they were not polite enough to give any interpretation of these cabalistic words this was one of the steps for precipitating the people into the present war numbers undoubtedly were deluded by the specious pretences of these men but the thinking part of mankind instead of being shocked from the principles of liberty began to suspect that there must be something very improper in the administration of our constitution when it could stand in need of such paltry props to support its power and give it artificial consequence this first attempt towards the jacobinical establishment of club law was followed up by the meeting at merchant taylors hall where the merchants     of this rich and flourishing country assembled together to behave towards those who differed from their opinion with a degree of brutality that would have disgraced a st giless club i beheld them myself distorting their countenances with every disgraceful expression of blackguardism and with hideous noises thrushing their gnashing teeth and goggling eyes in the faces of those individuals who had the courage to hold up their hands against their propositions telling them in terms and accents the most ferocious that they should mark them as disaffected men and take care that they should meet with the punishment they deserved for not being precisely of the opinion which they in their great wisdom had picked out from the journals and ledgers in their counting houses i believe it is not difficult to prove that those associations contributed in a very considerable degree to increase the democratic principle because they stamped an authority upon the very right they meant to dispute—the right of popular association to direct by the voice and will of the people the dispositions and actions of the government they however were of a different opinion and i am informed from very good authority that many of the ministerial merchants exulted with very great triumph after this meeting and in their letters to foreign and country correspondents boasted triumphantly and exclaimed well we have crushed those levelling rascals effectually citizens i wish they had crushed the levelling rascals—for the only levelling rascals i ever knew in this country are the reevite associations and cowardly alarmists reevess association publicly propagated the doctrine of levelling property which was never thought of before reevess association attempted to level all character to one common standard of baseness and insignificancy and to submit all the property of the country to the plunder of an upstart faction struggling to retain the seat of power without law or constitution on their side and without what is of still more authority the affections and confidence of the people the alarmists were very anxious to hurry us into a war by which how far the levelling system has been promoted let the innumerable bankruptcies that ensued and the opulent families reduced to beggary declare but however these levelling principles of the reevite associators and alarmists might ultimately tend to strengthen the true principles of genuine democracy in our minds it cannot be denied that among a particular class of people a different   0 sort of impression was at first produced temporary insatuation among the unthinking part of the community was produced to a considerable degree by those associations which was artfully increased by the inflammatory harrangues of placemen pensioners proprietors of rotten boroughs and the expectants of commissions and contracts who seemed for a time to be overwhelming every thing like democracy in our constitution and to be introducing a degree of tyranny which the country never before experienced i say never before—for the tyranny of corruption the tyranny of rotten boroughmongers the tyranny of associated inquisitors of men who hold their power and authority without any sort of sanction from the constitution whose forms they still pretend to reverence and preserve is on account of its indefinable nature and apparent popularity a tyranny more to be dreaded than that assumed by magistrates in the open eye of day confirmed by arbitrary laws or established by principles of pure despotism but the people in time began to discover the error into which they had fallen and to be anxious to retrieve that error it was however too late the war had taken place bankruptcy had stalked through every part of the country and a general prospect of misery presented itself this situation of affairs produced a conviction upon the popular mind that if we had not been entirely left to the power of the miserable nominees of monopolists and moneyjobbers that it would have been impossible such an infatuation ever could have taken place for if the parliament be appointed annually by the people they will find an interest in seeking the real welfare of the people but if on the contrary great lords monopolists and moneyjobbers are the only men who are to elect your representatives they will be the only men whose interests will be consulted and the great body of the people will be certainly a prey to those delusions which artful individuals will endeavour to spread in order to gratify their individual ambition and promote their schemes of private interest this conviction began to take considerable hold upon the public mind and the anxiety to restore the lost democracy of our constitution spread itself more amply among people of all descriptions and hence it was that those more coercive measures which i alluded to in the former lecture were adopted how vainly adopted you have all seen the next fatal blow to the system of monopolists and boroughmongers was the manner in which the war was conducted     britons have long been in the habit of boasting the openness and generosity of their spirit proud of their courage zealous to defend the reputation of frankness they were shocked to see that instead of open attack famine was to be made the instrument for the destruction of a brave and generous people that corruption was to supply the place of open effort and that intrigue treachery cabal and purchased insurrection were to be employed in the heart of the enemys country then it was that britons began to blush at the reflection of having lost that freedom upon which depended the generous energies of their souls and the noble character in which they had so long prided themselves this system of hired insurrections however is not to be abandoned to support the just claim of regular governments to the exclusive reputation of faith the vendeans who had made their peace with the republic are to be hired with british gold once more to violate every oath and contract and to lift the dagger of assassination once more against the generous and confiding breast of that republic which had had the magnanimity to pardon their rebellion and to restore them to the bosom of the country they had endeavoured to destroy and this we are told proves the good principles of the royalists of la vendee for windham in one of those curious metaphysical speeches in which he frequently indulges himself commenting during the last session upon the treaty between the royalists of la vendee and the republic says it is very true these men have made their peace with the republic and all seems in a degree to be restored to tranquility but when i consider the whole of the circumstances perhaps he knew more of the whole of the circumstances than we are informed of i am sure that i perceive a body of good principles still existing in la vendee which may be turned to the advantage of the alliance what then are the good principles of aristocracy violation of faith perjury injustice are these the good principles we are told to admire and can the men who vent such sentiments in a popular assembly expect any other than a growing conviction in the public mind that the principles which induce them to utter such expressions ought to be abhorred by all good men if these are the champions of aristocracy they will say give me the pure plain principles of democrats who think that faith ought to be sacred and solemn engagements ought not to be made for the purpose only of being violated     but it is not only by the manner in which the war has been conducted with respect to principle that the democratic feeling has spread among us its successes so glorious and so splendid and its expences so mild and so moderate have contributed in a still greater degree to bring the conviction that if we do not wish to be levelled indeed in universal beggary we muust appeal to those democratic principles of our constitution which if never violated would have saved us from the mischief and which if restored will restore us once more to peace plenty and glory yes citizens john bull is rather a sleepy animal it must be confessed he has not all the mercury of our neighbours but john bull has two nerves of sensibility yet remaining one of which is conveyed by proper meandrings to his stomach and the other to his pocket touch but the papillary nerves that open themselves into either of these receptacles and immediately the whole frame is seized with convulsive vibrations and his exquisite sensibility is delineated in every feature the minister has been determined that these nerves shall not lose their sensibility for want of being frequently stimulated he has therefore taken good care to make frequent applications to the pocket and in the course of two campaigns has expended seventy millions of money while he is now crying aloud if report may be believed for thirty millions more—glorious consequence of a war begot by corruption fostered by the fears of aristocracy and persevered in to preserve the sacred rights of rotten boroughs and prevent the ruins of old sarum from being overgrown with the moss of political oblivion with respect to the stomach the sensibility of that has been equally affected for what with the stoppage of our external supplies and the waste of our internal produce poor john bull has been almost reduced to that situation in which the gastric juice preys upon its own receptacle for want of other employment this country ought and if well governed would produce much more of all the necessaries of life than are required by the inhabitants yet what with the impolitic regulations that are made what with the neglect of cultivation what with the wasteful extravagance of some and the monopolizing arts of others we find that it does not produce a quantity sufficient for its maintenance     i shall not now enter into a particular investigation of the causes of this suffice it to say that this being our situation the measures adopted during the present war have tended in no small degree to aggravate the evil we suffered poland the granary of europe to be destroyed to gratify the ambition of a man who as soon as he had got possession of the prize abandoned those who had been secretly parties to the infamous fraud corn has also been sent out from time to time to supply foreign armies as if every mouth were to be fed but the mouth of the british peasant every mercenary soldier is supplied at the expence of britain and british produce is sent away with an extravagance never heard of before witness for example even in the midst of all the starving misery of the people—witness the immense stores sent to supply the rascally emigrants at quiberon those wretches the authors of all the desolations of their own country the authors of all the calamities under which the nations of the world at this time groan whose infamous delusions whose treachery and whose barefaced profligacy would have prevented any admistration but the present from lending them that countenance which they have experienced these beings seventy thousand of whom like a flock of geese fled from the fiery looks of the republicans these were to be sent back to conquer the country whose glorious efforts have almost laid europe prostrate at its feet and british gold british stores british ammunition and british food was to be sent to support them whatever might be the sighs and groans and anguish of those britons who languished in want of that which was thus wantonly thrown away yes citizens these were the men that were to be favoured they were aristocrats they were friends to the old despotism of france and therefore by the ministers of the free country of britain certainly ought to be countenanced if they were in misery or misfortune they were to receive their half guinea a week out of the public purse and mr pitt was to insert in his budget so much money applied to the distressed clergy and laity of france while thousands of industrious families were to subsist upon  s  s or less the reward of intolerable drudgery for twelve or fourteen hours a day but there are good reasons for this if you pamper those without whose assistance you could not be pampered yourselves they will be saucy     will think they have rights and thus you will be precluded from the opportunity of swelling to unwieldy opulence by places and pensions while those who produce that opulence are in misery and subjection such is the aristocratic argument but the plain truth is the further you sink them into subjection the more they will be dissatisfied the more you compel them to a state of ignorance the more disposed to violence and if you are disposed really to preserve them in that subordination which the order of society requires restore them to their rights let them feel that they are human beings that you love them as brethren not that you lash them as taskmasters do their slaves citizens at the very time that these emigrants were thus provided for in the house of industry in the isle of wight which is boasted of by topographers as the best regulated receptacle of charity throughout the country so miserable was the condition of those who are there maintained at constant and hard labour that the present master of that house after having made repeated remonstrances to the gentlemen who hold the purse of the island upon the scanty manner in which they are provided for has at last sent into them his determination that if they will not feed the poor better he will not remain in his situation for that he can no longer endure to hear the cries of starving children who call to him for bread which he is not permitted to give them yet the chouans must be fed—the midnight murderers of britany must be provided with the necessaries and comforts of life—the stores of this country must be exhausted and its provisions sent forth that these royalists these great supporters these enlightened advocates for the cause of despotism may not be beaten down under the arm of republican freedom and at this very time contracts are making in ireland to buy up fresh stores and provisions to send to the coast of france to be consumed in foolish expeditions in quest of defeat and infamy and so great is the exhaustion that salted provisions being no longer to be obtained they are buying up live cattle in ireland to send upon this mad project now i should like to know how it is possible for the common people of this country to perceive that they are starving for the support of the cause of aristocracy abroad without having their affections strengthened for democracy     at home if they should sometimes in the wild extravagance of their imaginations go farther than the infallible letter of the law prescribes if they should sometimes in their speculations not even be satisfied with that democracy which the laws and constitution of the country say they ought to enjoy can we blame them can we wonder when those who at present are trampling upon the constitution of which they call themselves the supporters if those who have but little information should draw this hasty conclusion—if this be the constitution of britain the british constitution ought to be reverenced no more we are for a constitution of equal rights and general plenty and not a constitution of ambition and starvation but one of the great causes of the increase of the democratic principle is the conduct of the present administration to the engines by which they seem to intend that their own power should be supported i mean the military whoever is acquainted with the history of nations must have observed that it is the uniform practice of wicked ministers who aspire to arbitrary dominion in the first instance to seek for the establishment of a large military force they know very well that two or three five or six hundred individuals whatever their rank fortune or situation can never trample upon the liberties of mankind unless mankind are weak enough to assist them in such an attempt this conviction is very ancient in this country and there was a time when our ancestors jealous of the preservation of their rights took care that the strength and power of the country should also be the strength and power of its liberties they knew well laws made for the benefit of all are best supported by putting arms in the hands of all and therefore by arming the great mass and body of the people they took care to put it out of the power of a few usurpers to trample upon the liberties of britons and to establish despotism in a country the people of which according to the wishes of alfred ought ever to continue free as their own thoughts the abhorrence of our ancestors to standing armies presents itself to us in the works of every political writer among the rest swift expresses himself in a letter to pope in a very strong manner—i had likewise says he in those days a mortal antipathy against standing armies in times of peace because i always took standing armies to be only servants hired by the master of a family for keeping     his own children in slavery and because i conceived that a prince who could not think himself secure without mercenary troops must needs have a separate interest from that of his subjects although i am not ignorant of those artificial necessities which a corrupt minister can create for keeping up forces to support a faction against the public interest such citizens were the sentiments of swift and such were the sentiments of our ancestors in general such were the sentiments of alfred when he established that glorious institution a national militia an institution by means of which he was enabled to purge the country from those depredators who had invaded it and to lift it to a glory and happiness which it never had known before nay citizens so anxious were our ancestors for the establishment of this militia so anxious were they for excluding a standing army that several laws had been made to punish those who neglect to have arms in their houses and to instruct both themselves and families in the use of them if you will read pultons reports you will find titles arms and archery particular instruction who is bound to keep pikes in his house who are to keep halberts and who are obliged to have complete suits of armour you will find that in proportion to a mans property he is obliged to keep a given quantity of arms not that it was thought necessary to keep the common people unarmed but the cheapér sort of arms were assigned to the common people because the common people could not procure those of the most expensive nature you will find also provisions made by those ancient laws to punish persons who keeping journeymen in their houses have neglected to have them trained to the use and exercise of arms and that every father of a family is punishable by those ancient laws if he neglects to instruct his children from the age of seven years to sixteen in the use of the long bow and other implements made use of in those days yet the pretended advocates for the laws and constitution of this country make it a crime for any person to have a pike found in his house nay they have even attempted to make it high treason for any man to have known a man who had ever spoken to another man who ever had been in company with a fourth man who had a pike found in his house or any implements of defence whatever     but citizens these men may perhaps tell you and perhaps some part of their conduct would support the pretence that they are ignorant of the laws of the country but unfortunately they have themselves been the formers and suporters of the propriety of every man being armed if we recur to a very curious pamphlet written by lord hawkesbury we shall find that he most strenuously recommends as a constitutional and necessary measure every individual providing himself with arms that he might be able to repel every enemy by whom the country might be invaded and even pitt himself in recent times could not help acknowledging the excellency of a national militia but let it slip over his tongue in a debate in the house of commons that it is impossible to subdue an armed nation—a very pretty argument this to persuade the house to continue a war against the armed nation of france but amongst the most anxious and zealous defenders of this system is to be reckoned the duke of richmond his grace while out of place is very well known to have held correspondence with an armed convention a convention of volunteers in ireland he is very well known also to have commended the plan upon which those volunteers were proceeding and to have supported their measures with all the might of his eloquence but his conduct was even still more explicit upon the occasion which he had of delivering his sentiments in the corporation of chichester gentlemen said he—if i may take the historians liberty of putting his sentiments into my own language—let every man get arms let every man learn the use of arms it is only by recurring to the old institutions of alfred—it is only by putting arms into the hands of every individual that we can support our liberties against the arts intrigues and corruptions of a minister who would wish to trample under foot the rights and liberties of britons—get arms gentlemen therefore get arms that you may save yourselves the necessity of an immense standing army resist with all your might a system so diabolical for if once you suffer a standing army in the country the liberties of britain are gone for ever nor will it be in the power of all the patriots in whom you may conside to snatch you from the despotism which a standing army must inevitably produce     yet citizens when the duke of richmond was master of the ordnance he found how necessary it was to fortify by standing armies the power which he and his friends had gotten and when a member of the same corporation not quite so versatile some time ago proposed that the citizens at chichester should be armed he writes a letter to that corporation to inform the membefs of it that the individual who could support such a measure was an enemy to his king and constitution arm all the citizens he might be conceived to say no you must only arm those few we can depend upon whose principles we are acquainted with and whose loyal attachment to pensioners and placemen and rotten boroughmongers can be depended on if those pensioners placemen and rotten boroughmongers should call for their exertions to silence the voice of reform which i myself taught to be loquacious and to crush the rising spirit of that freedom which however proper when i was out of place is certainly high treason now that i am in this duke of richmond was once a flaming whig but we have found that there is one point at least upon which whigs and tories unanimously agree namely that every measure by which they can help themselves into power is legal and constitutional and that every measure that in the least threatens to oust them is treason there is also notwithstanding all appearances to the contrary a very great degree of consistency in the language and sentiments of the present administration you will find that they have always been advocates for ancient systems but then when out of place their attachment was to the ancient system of british liberty and now when they are in place their attachment is to the ancient system of french despotism yes citizens the old french system is a very great object of attachment among our present ministers and they have been anxious to imitate as far as possible all its practices it is high treason to imitate even the language of french liberty but it is perfectly constitutional to imitate not only the language but the practices of french tyranny whence came the system of spies did it not come from the old despotism of france is it a practice congenial with the open character of britons is it a practice consistent     with liberty and with that social harmony which a free constitution ought to support—whence also comes your police established it is true under pretence of keeping the peace but in reality i believe for the express purpose of organizing the system of spies and informers who invaded the peace of all their fellow citizens and providing rewards and establishments for those whose perjuries in courts of justice have vainly aimed at the life of innocent individuals come not both the institution and its name from the ancient despotism of france to this i might add the list of proscriptions—the black books kept by the reevite associators in which every mans supposed opinion stands recorded the most important imitation however is the adoption of standing armies it may not be amiss to observe the exact conformity between practices among us and those which were adopted in france when louis xiv established standing armies to support his growing despotism it was well known by that crafty monarch that the despotic power he aimed at could not be supported without an immense military force an immense military force was therefore determined upon but say some of his counsellors may not the very power you raise to support your despotism turn their swords against you and overthrow it how are we to avoid this inconvenience for the army which is formidable to the people is formidable also to the monarch whenever they chuse to be so and the janizaries who overawe the slaves of constantinople hurl occasionally the sublime sultan from his throne o say others we will find a remedy for that we will sow hatred and dissention in the centre of the army and one class of soldiers shall burn with rancour and animosity against the other to execute this design songs were dispersed among them written for the purpose of exciting mutual jealousies some for the infantry some for the cavalry some to one class some to another this trick succeeded pretty well for the court but what were the effects to the country the army of france being thus disunited and being excited by mutual aversion were never able to stand against the armies of those countries in which union and mutual affection prevailed this was one of the causes why the glory of britain shone in ancient times so conspicuous when opposed to the military machines of enslaved france this was one of the   0 causes why a nation abounding in so much gallant spirit made so poor a figure comparatively speaking but since this system of dragoon hating infantry and infantry hating dragoon has been banished from france—since they have been fired by one hope and expectation mark the enthusiasm with which they have swept every thing before them appeal to those gallant soldiers who have experienced their efforts for the character of those frenchmen who inspired by unanimity have become vindicators of rights and liberty—they will tell you that courage and magnanimity have gone hand in hand and displayed a conduct the very reverse of that which the prejudices of this country have led us to expect among them a similar object in this country has been pursued by measures in some degree different it is not by songs for we are neither a singing nor a dancing nation that those who wish to make all soldiers slaves have endeavoured to excite one part of the soldiery against the other no they have found another way of doing it they have divided the army into a vast number of distinctions dragoons militias infantry cavalry yeomanry and voluntary associations and the most successful attempts have been made to prevent any degree of affection from existing between these different bodies the esprit de corps so unhappily prevalent among all classes of men renders it easy to excite animosities and a variety of arts are made use of to keep up this animosity so that they may be fit engines for the vengeance thus to be executed i shall give you an instance of this a mutiny took place in one of the camps no very considerable time ago the guards had been mutinous and their officers found some part of their claims so just and the men so obstinate that they were obliged to pay some degree of attention to them after having promised them the redress which they demanded it is very confidently reported that this sort of speech was made to them gentlemen i know how these dispositions have grown up among you you have been talking to the militia they have sown the seeds of discontent among you gentlemen why will you condescend to talk with the militia are not you gentlemen guards are not you the defenders of his majestys person you should disdain to disgrace yourselves by holding conversation with militia men a company much too mean     for you and therefore you ought to be above it and to keep yourselves from the contamination of them gentlemen if i were to meet with any of the militia i should think myself disgraced if i sat down with them i would advise you to preserve the dignity of your situation and depend upon it you will receive the favours consistent with such conduct now citizens if this language was in reality held i ask you what sort of principle what sort of justice and propriety could there possibly be in it what shall soldiers be set against soldiers shall guards be set against militiamen and militiamen against fencibles shall fencible be set against dragoon and dragoon against fencible if this is the case say what degree of safety and protection must you expect if the time ever should arrive when your wives and your children are to be protected from the sword of foreign hostility citizens to me it appears that it would have been much more proper to address the soldiery of britain in this manner citizen soldiers never forget that you are men enlisted not to support the authority of a few particular individuals but to protect the rights liberty and property of the country if you have complaints submit them in a peaceable manner to those who should take cognizance of those complaints indulge not a mutinous spirit by which the liberties and peace of the country may be disturbed by which part of you may be submitted to the cruel necessity of operating against another but cultivate the feelings of affection between man and man let dragoons remember they are bound to love the infantry who are the main strength of an army let the infantry remember that they are bound to love that cavalry which is to cooperate with them and without whose assistance they must be often impotent and inadequate to the protection of their country let both remember they are to love the militia the constitutional guardians of the sacred rights of britons let the militiamen also remember that they ought to love the other members of the army because they are to cooperate with them for the same great object remember also that the name of fencible corps or whatever names may be given to particular men alter not their nature that every man is the brother of every man and that upon the great principle of fraternity you are to act according to the spirit of justice of liberty and true military discipline in preserving     the peace and protecting the happiness of your fellow citizens that you may return loved and crowned with civic wreathes to your wives and families who shall bless you for transmitting the liberties of your ancestors to them and their posterity citizen soldiers as you are men you ought to love mankind as you are britons you ought to cherish british liberty as you are soldiers of a free nation you ought to be jealous of freedom one soul alone ought to actuate you one object you should have continually in view—the freedom and happiness of your country not the aggrandizement of a faction to whom you were never meant to be tools but the protection of the just rights the just liberties and real happiness of those whom if you are once made the instruments to enslave you do but forge fetters for yourselves more intolerable than those you confer upon your brethren whom you ought not to cease to love because they do not wear a coat of the same complexion with your own but it is lamentable to observe how successfully the language most opposite to this has been upheld every one who is at all acquainted with the military can inform you that the militia envy the fencibles for their supposed privileges and advantages that the fencibles arrogate a superiority to the militia that the volunteers disdain the regulars whom they consider as a parcel of low inferior beings and that the regulars on the other hand have contracted an inveterate hatred against the volunteer associations whom they consider as tools of men of power and fortune associated against the liberty and happiness of the lower orders of the community i speak not this lightly i have positive information of this being the case in parts of the country—particularly that this sort of language was held so continually by one of the regiments returned from the continent and quartered at chicbester that it was found necessary to remove them from that place lest massacres should take place between them and the gentlemen associators of that neighbourhood the very words damn the scoundrels that associate against their own poor were repeated from company to company and from man to man till they quivered upon every lip what then may not be the dreadful consequence of attempting to sow these divisions so destructive of all peaceful order all respect both for laws and military discipline without     which an army become instead of defenders the depredators and destroyers of their country these soldiers certainly inspired a considerable degree of panic and terror among the volunteers resignations were very common or notices for resignations stories were told about these gentlemen soldiers and the situation into which they were sometimes thrown in consequence of this terror are too ridiculous to mention in the present company suffice it to say the dreaded regiment was again sent to the continent not only on this account but because many of them were found diffusing democratic principles—principles let me add which the whole of this system has tended to spread very widely among the soldiery and which all the attempts to suppress them do but increase to greater obstinacy nay those very men who were enlisted and sent to the continent to destroy democracy abroad have brought home a huge cargo of it into england much to the alarm and terror of their rulers and therefore they have most of them been sent back to the continent to support the cause for which they were known to have such an inveterate hatred i confess i have not myself conversed with the soldiery i have taken my reports respecting them from those on whose veracity i could confide because i do not choose to have it said of me however unjustly that i tamper with the soldiery i wish not to draw them from their allegiance to the king but i wish them to know that they also owe an allegiance to the people whom they serve part of whom they are and with whose happiness their own prosperity is connected but all the persons i have met with who have by accident fallen in with the fragments and scanty fragments in general they were of regiments that returned from the continent have uniformly borne testimony to the good character which the british soldiery are generous enough to give to the french whom they have declared in open shops and public houses were the only friends they met with upon the continent they were ill used they say by the dutch they were ill used by the austrians they were ill used by all the foreign troops with whom they expected to cooperate and their enemies the french were the only men from whom they received any kindness or humanity it is therefore citizens that the greater part of these regiments or fragments of regiments are sent back to that continent from whence they were so lately withdrawn or else dispatched to the west indies lest their jacobinical doctrines should spread at home     this policy has been pretty systematically pursued whenever it was found that any regiment possessed democratical principles that regiment was immediately hurried out of the country this was particularly the case with the scotch greys who were found many of them reading paines rights of man they were therefore sent to the continent and i believe we shall not hear of the opinions of the scotch greys now but what has been the consequences of all this disastrous defeat when men are sent to support a cause they do not approve will they fight with enthusiasm in support of it no if you want enthusiasm among the military it is by a different mode of conduct that you must endeavour to inspire it it is not by persecuting them for opinions it is not by making reading a crime among them and ignorance the supreme virtue no it is by kind treatment by justice and humanity—by giving them a real interest in the cause they are to support—in short it is by mingling the proud independence of the citizen with the discipline of the soldier that the feelings of the hero can alone be inspired and the exploits of real glory can be produced yet so blind are our rulers to this truth that i have certain information that some poor soldiers in the tower were threatened with all the severities of what is called military discipline for having subscribed to take in the gazetteer the monstrous crime was discovered and the alarm was instantly taken—what soldiers dare to read an opposition paper soldiers dare to look into any thing that shall find fault with any of his majestys ministers military subordination could never endure it the poor men were obliged to relinquish their literary banquet and some of them were threatened with black holes and bread and water but a stronger circumstance is yet to be mentioned one archibald ewing who was a scotch fencible was found to be very fond of reading i dont know how it came into the minds of the officers that it was impossible for a man to enquire but he must become a democrat but they immediately began to suspect that he was no friend to present measures on the kings birthday therefore as they were marching from one part of scotland to another the officers determined to put this man to the test they had the soldiers seated in rings and gave them whiskey to drink his majestys health the officer however of the corps did not think it enough to give the kings health alone but coupled with it     a very curious sentiment the king and damnation to the french and the friends of the people ewing did not however choose to drink damnation to the friends of the people because he thought the people had as much right to have their friends as the king had to have his add to which that ewing was a religious man and did not think it such a mighty crime to be a friend to the people that he ought to wish any man in eternal torments on that account in short he was a soldier not a priest and did not deal in anathemas nor would he damn any body and as they had given the toast in that manner he refused to drink it at all for this crime which was deemed mutiny he was immediately according to the lenient practices of that humane part of the country put into confinement he was chained upright with fetters round his ancles and a collar round his neck for some days till he was tried by a court martial there is a citizen present who can authenticate this if necessary he was then condemned to receive five hundred lashes but repeated assurances were given him that he should be pardoned if he would declare that he was not a friend to the people which he refused some of the townsfolks hearing of the manner in which he was treated took him some food and other necessaries but the humane magistrates of scotland being informed of these facts prohibited any person upon the pains and penalties of law from giving him any assistance so that bread and water would have been his only fare for several days if he had not been generously relieved by a fellow soldier his obstinate virtue continued inflexible a hundred lashes were humanely abated and four hundred only laid upon his naked back after which he was turned out of the regiment now citizens i will ask you is it likely that soldiers should be otherwise than democratic while they receive such treatment i will ask you if this is the proper manner to procure the vindication of our laws and the protection of our country i will ask you whether on the contrary the proper way of attacking the soldiery is not to encourage by proper rewards instead of urging on by stripes and punishments yes citizens it is by reward and encouragements that you are to expect to rouse the valour of the british soldiery and if you will give them proper pay instead of exhausting all the resources of the country upon corruption and treat them honourably and kindly you will have little reason to find fault with human beings for not having enthusiasm     enough in their attachment to their country and not being sufficiently willing to expose themselves in the field of glory give them then but the rights of man to animate their courage and you will still find your soldiery what they were once esteemed invincible in the field and unequalled in generous exertions in the cause of liberty citizens i find it totally impossible at this time of night to enter upon the remaining and most important branch of this subject—namely the conduct of crimps and pressgangs but before we part i will slightly mention a circumstance of a very extraordinary nature and which has occupied a great deal of my attention today and in some degree prevented me from preparing myself as i could have wished on such a topic i have received documents tending to prove that this boy introducing a lad of twelve years old into the tribune has been most barbarously crimped i have received from the friends of this lad and from his own mouth circumstances which if i can properly authenticate i shall submit to your consideration on wednesday evening this lad—look at him—see what a soldierlike appearance he has and reflect how proper it is to trepan and steal such poor boys from the arms of their friends and relatives and prematurely to shed their infant blood in a struggle which it is impossible they should understand or have an interest in i will not state to you—neither time nor other circumstances will now permit—the particulars contained in this letter which after his escape he wrote from northampton to his only friend and relative in london i will not now state the variety of circumstances which these papers unfold it is necessary in order that i may preserve even from suspicion of credulity or imposture the dignity of my situation to make such enquiries as to eradicate every possibility of doubt upon the subject if i can substantiate the story i shall unfold to you a scene of criminality so abominable proceedings so horrid and flagitious that if they do not immediately have redress will bring a strong conviction to the breast of every man that in this country there is no longer protection for innocence nor law for the friendless and poor     the tribune no xxvii report on the state of popular opinion and causes of the increase of democratic principles part the fourth including animadversions on the cruelties and murders committed by crimps and pressgangs delivered at the lecture room beaufort buildings strand september   th      citizens i shall now resume where i dropped it on friday evening the subject of the treatment of the british soldiery and the tendency that treatment must inevitably have to diffuse a spirit of democracy through that rank of people from which the soldiery are taken there is an author whom i have had frequently occasion to quote not from any admiration of his morals but because he seems to be the great text book of all the ministers of all the regular and orderly governments of civilized europe the name of this author is machiavel who treating of the means by which the power of princes is to be upheld tells us that the two great requisites are good laws and good arms with respect to good laws machiavel does not say much for as he is instructing persons how they may become great despots or the despotic ministers of great despots he was more solicitous about arms than laws and gives to understand that whenever you can have good arms there the laws per force must be good also—that is they must be of that description which nobody can very safely find fault with citizens this machiavel who i am inclined to think was rather disposed to satirize the system he pretends to uphold enters at large into the mode by which good arms are to be procured and supported and goes into a description of what are and what are not good arms in this part of his enquiry there are many     things well worth the attention of the ministers of this or any other country but which upon that very account perhaps seem to be passed over in neglect for instance confederates allies auxiliaries and mercenaries he says never can be good arms good arms are those which are borne and exercised by the natives of the country for the protection of which they are to be employed and from them only can any considerable advantage be expected upon this topic i have already enlarged to a considerable degree tribune no  0 and    i shall not therefore dwell upon it particularly at this time it is more important that i should turn to another part of this discussion there is one observation he makes which is particularly valuable machiavel seems to have been very well convinced that in order to have good arms that is to say to have an effective soldiery able and willing to support your glory and carry your projects into effect numbers and discipline are not the only requisites that you may have a very numerous army and yet be very much disgraced and degraded—that you may have a very well disciplined army and yet the discipline of this army be fatal only to its employers and he considers therefore that the great object of all is the attachment of the soldiery to the cause they are to support and to the prince whose glory they are to promote citizens we need not have raked the musty ashes of antiquity to have discovered a maxim so plain and self evident if we wish to be well protected by a gallant soldiery we must take care that our soldiery are zealously attached to our cause and as the means to produce this effect we must merit by our treatment of them the attachment of those whom we expect to shed their blood in our defence and to run all dangers perils and hardships for the promotion of our happiness and our glory now how is this attachment to be secured it is very evident if we consider the situation of society at present that attachment is not now to be obtained in that easy way in which it seems to have been acquired in former times feudal rights and feudal attachment have happily in a great degree been swept away and we hear no more except now and then from some superannuated bigot to the old system of the duty and principle of inviolable     attachment to the leader upon whose estate you happened to be born and by whom you have had the honour to be treated ever since your birth as a slave or beast of burden the chieftains adhering to the houses of york and lancaster might indeed display their banners in the air and be immediately followed by all their tenantry and vassals capable of bearing arms and thus we might have host embattled against host one half of the nation seeking the destruction of the other with the most rancorous avidity without either being capable of explaining the reason why they had drawn the falchion from its scabbard and left their fields untilled to make widows and orphans of their mourning wives and children even in the time of james the first a considerable degree of this superstitious veneration and attachment to certain families and individuals merely on account of the high situation in which they were placed seems to have remained and we have instances in history of the most enormous fines and even corporal punishments chains and imprisonment being inflicted upon the base born plebian croud for having insulted by word or look the sacred dignity of those who are decorated with stars and garters and strut four or five times a year perhaps in an old red cloak bedaubed with gold and ermine but the progress of enlightened intellect tended in a considerable degree to do away this ridiculous and foolish impression we find it considerably weakened even at the period i have just been speaking of and still more so before the end of that reign in the revolution in      every thing that remained of it was swept at once away the superstitious veneration that had formerly been paid to birth and titles fled before the sudden burst of reason and was entirely destroyed for a considerable time even the trappings and badges of this superstition were abolished and though titles rank birth and distinction were afterwards formally revived at the restoration yet there was no power in human caprice nor human tyranny to restore the servile adulation with which those circumstances were formerly contemplated by the people my lord and his grace the duke had been stripped of their gaudy titles for a while—had been reduced to the plain humble level of citizens and had been exhibited to mankind unsophisticated by the ornaments of a court and proved to be only of the same class and description of beings with those whom they had before looked down upon with   0 supercilious insolence and who had bowed down to their footstools with so much illplaced veneration this discovery having once been made it was impossible for the people to get rid of the conviction that lords and graces and dukes were nothing more than men for as thomas paine has recently observed in that treasonable and seditious book which i hope none of you have read it is impossible to compel a set of beings to unknow their knowledge or unthink their thoughts that this permanent effect was produced by the temporary revolution of      seems to be universally acknowledged at least that the change has taken place is universally admitted though i do not find that the change has ever yet been traced to its real cause hume himself the advocate of approaching despotism is obliged to acknowledge in his essay on the british government that mankind are now no longer held in chains by a superstitious veneration to mere forms and trappings and he observes that even those things which in former times claimed the utmost veneration of mankind seemed to sink into oblivion from the persevering reason and enquiry that mankind have directed towards them most people in this island says he have divested themselves of all superstitious reverence to names and authority the clergy have much lost their credit their pretensions and doctrines have been ridiculed and even religion can scarce support itself in the world well then citizens this ancient foundation for the attachment of one class of people to another has been done away illplaced veneration from accidental circumstances exists no more men beginning to venerate each other to a certain degree at least though not quite so much as i could wish on account of the good qualities they may possess and the activity with which they may employ those good qualities for the welfare and happiness of mankind how then are those persons in power and authority to command the attachment which was formerly bequeathed to them from the accidents of their birth it is certainly necessary some how or other to secure the attachment of the people—no pardon me not of the people but of the large standing armies by which the people in case of necessity may be dragoond and to render them subservient to the will of those who created them there must be some means i say to attach this soldiery to the system they are hired to support for it is not to be forgotten     that the same power which is formidable to the oppressed is also formidable to the oppressor himself and that the janissaries who keep the poor trembling turks in awe sometimes hurl the haughty sultan from his throne and place the captain of their own banditti or some other more favoured robber in his stead a standing army then instead of being a defence is in reality a great danger to the prince or minister who employs it unless some particular means be devised by which the attachment of that army can be secured what are the means by which this attachment is to be sought will the scanty pittance of sixpence per day attach any reasonable being to particular individuals who while swelling to inordinate wealth by their own pensions and places still forget the soldier that bleeds in the field or languishes in the camp to promote their power and glory will punishment for reading and enquiry instances of which i gave you on the former evening attach a soldiery to the cause they are meant to support on the contrary will not the plainest capacity immediately perceive that they who dread enquiry have a lurking conviction at their hearts that they are wrong and that the cause must be a bad one which will totter to its foundation as soon as argument and enquiry are brought into the field to examine its merits or defects punishment and hard treatment win not the affection of mankind nor can stripes and blows scanty fare and scanty pay allure their attachment to those from whom they receive such treatment it is only by honourable reward and encouragement by raising the soul to a consciousness of its own strength and dignity that the hearts of a generous race of men are to be won if you will therefore reward as you ought the gallant heroes who fight your battles if you will encourage with proper subsistence and proper endearments those who stand foremost for your defence—you will need no crimps to fill your armies—no catofninetails to maintain discipline thus might cruelty and severity be for ever banished for however pretended philosophers and the hired agents of corruption may attempt to deceive you it is not the nature of man to be supine when men are properly stimulated by generous treatment there is more danger that they should have too much activity and enthusiasm than that they should be too backward to run the career of glory or to vindicate the cause of their country and if we look through the annals of     mankind we shall find that wherever this generous treatment has been attended to enthusiastic rashness and not cowardice has marked the character of those who were entrusted with the vindication of a nations honor citizens i refer you to the affairs of france for proof of this it was a common observation before the revolution in that country that no nation produced better officers than the french but that the common soldiery could never be kept to their duty but the common soldiery of france were at that time a herd of military machines whose duty was to protect the drivers of a race of slaves it was therefore that they felt no common cause and no enthusiasm while the officers who were treated with particular marks of honour and distinction displayed a gallantry of spirit which from the natural situation and many advantages of that country must always distinguish its inhabitants unless there be something superlatively iniquitous in its government counteracting the influence which those causes would otherwise produce see them now is it the soldiery of whom the convention of france have had any occasion to complain have they been slack and tardy in vindicating the honours and liberties of their country no—warmed with the cheering notes of equality enraptured with the flattering conviction that by being soldiers they did not lose the dignity of citizens breast deep in snow they have marched to encounter the enemies of gallic liberty singing the songs of victory as they marched and if the accounts were true with which we were pestered in the ministerial prints of the nakedness and forlorn condition of these troops at the beginning of the war we have indeed reason to wonder at the effects of kind treatment—the endearing rewards the honourable mention and the like which converted a race of men whom formerly we despised as slaves and cowards into a generation of heroes who thundered at jemappe and shook the tyrants of europe on their distant thrones citizens it is not my business to disguise any part of the truth and as this country according to its original constitution is a popular government—as the real constitution—that i mean which we are so proud of having been established by our ancestors not mr pitts constitution of rotten boroughs is in fact a democracy tempered and seasoned with a mixture of aristocracy but which was never meant to be robbed of that popular nature which constitutes its nerve and energy i shall not be afraid of spies when i say that this circumstance—this fair     and honourable treatment of the soldiery has always particularly distinguished popular governments and it is natural enough that the soldiery having been convinced of this truth during their residence upon the continent should have returned to this country with a considerable seasoning of democratic spirit in their minds and that instead of having crushed the hydra of popular government abroad they had brought back an attachment to the revival of that government at home one might imagine as it seems impossible for those who have the administration of the government to be blind to this—one might imagine that even from common sense even from the selfish design of supporting their own power they would have thought of extending more kindness and liberality towards those whom they wish to be the supporters of their power but this is very far from being the case a variety of measures hitherto at least in their present extent never heard of in this country before have been adopted as if on purpose to disgust those men to whose support one would think by other measures they wished particularly to look but inconsistency is never to be wondered at among selfish individuals there is but one source of consistency and that is the pure generous spirit of benevolence the animating love of all mankind which directs us to promote the general interest and lose sight of the particular men warmed by such a sentiment may preserve a steady consistency because they act from reason from deep felt conviction from serious meditation and a settled plan but they who seek only their own power grandeur and emolument are always inconsistent because the passions which are their sole guides are ever capricious and inconstant and that which may gratify one pursuit of ambition or vanity may be hostile to another on which in another hour perhaps they would fix their attention with still more steadiness and avidity nay perhaps having been so long in the habit of politically governing mankind by faction division and dissention—keeping up to the old maxim divide and conquer it may have become as it were a systematic part of their existence so that they cannot help acting upon it so that they proceed in fact instinctively—or as shakespeare would express it by a divine thrusting on on the principle of division and are hence disposed to keep a divided army in awe rather than to seek its unanimous love and affection by generous treatment integrity and honest liberality     but it may be said that in one paltry expedient at least this latter object seems to have been had in view namely the late curious order issued—i will not say in violation of the constitution of this country because it came from very illustrious authority and as i am known to bow down with great respect to authorities of this description i shall not fully my own consistency by saying any thing so harsh—but i will say that i never heard of the individual who pretended to point out the statute or maxim of the constitution which authorised such an order to be issued and executed without consent of king lords and commons in parliament assembled but perhaps it may be affirmed by those who support this measure that there was no necessity to consult the commons till it could be found out in what house of parliament the commons did in reality assemble you may perceive that i allude to the order for letting the soldiery have bread and meat at a cheaper price than other citizens had but how could they be so ignorant of mankind as to suppose that so shallow an artifice would escape instantaneous detection could they suppose that because a man might put off a coat of one colour and put on one of another that he thereby put off common sense or could they suppose that when they had decorated a man in a blue or a scarlet coat that he would put off the feelings of humanity and refuse to sympathize with a brother or a friend languishing in the want and misery which a profligate and ruinous war had brought upon the country or could they suppose either that the soldiery would not perceive the view with which this order was issued but citizens it is plain and evident that an individual practice like this cannot wipe from the mind deep impression produced by general conduct and as soldiers have been lately in the habit of reading and as i have given you the instances of some who have been threatened with the black hole and bread and water and of others who have been sent to the continent on the forlorn hope and others in scotland that have been fastened with fetters and chains against the wall kept upon bread and water and punished with  00 lashes because they would not damn the friends of the people—as all these circumstances have taken place on account of the soldiers having the wicked and seditious presumption to read mark learn and inwardly digest and as it is also true that there has been a certain rage of late for publishing small books cheap democratic sansculottish editions—and     as aristocratic works are sent into the world in this form—and of all things in the world to make men democrats there are none like aristocratic publications—if people will but read no matter what whether it is jack the giant killer tom thumb the great or burkes reflections or any other silly and mad publication i know where reading and thought must convey them and the more aristocratic the books they read the sooner they will get to their point that is to say provided they do not only read but to express myself in true orthodox phraseology also mark learn and inwardly digest as they go on now citizens as soldiers will sometimes read—and as it is probable that some impression of this book called humes history of england may have fallen into some soldiers hand it is probable that in consequence of this he may have picked out some facts which may have inclined him to meditate a little upon the circumstances under which he is placed recollecting what his pay is at this time and finding what it was in queen elizabeths days i gave you a history of the price of provisions in those days in the last season when a good fat pig was bought for  d a hen for  d and a good fat capon for  d a chicken for a penny c tribune no xvi p  —finding that in q besss days such being the price of provisions a common soldier received  d a day as his pay which was the price of two fat pigs he may be inclined to say to himself how comes it that i do not receive the price of two fat pigs for being shot at now as i should have had if i had been shot at in the time of that old fashioned queen citizens this fact is contained in a note so exceedingly curious and apropos that i shall read it to you both for your amusement and instruction and that you may see that i am not imposing upon you in the eighth volume of humes history of england page     you will find it thus written it is curious to observe that the minister in the war begun in     —o what would he have said if he had witnessed the war begun in     —that the minister in the war begun in      was in some periods allowed to lavish in two months as great a sum as was granted by parliament to queen elizabeth in fortyfive years but citizens the minister in      was a novice the present minister will lavish you much more in two hours hume proceeds the extreme frivolous object of the late war and the great importance of hers set this matter in a still stronger light money too we may observe was in most particulars of     the same value in both periods that is to say the current coin of the kingdom was of the same weight and standard of metal she paid  d a day to every foot soldier but our late delusions have much exceeded any thing known in history not even excepting those of the crusades for i suppose there is no mathematical still less an arithmetical demonstration that the road to the holy land was not the road to paradise but there is that the endless increase of national debt is the direct road to national ruin such citizens is the fact relative to the pay of the soldiery in the time of queen elizabeth and such are the reflections of an aristocratic writer when he notices that fact but if you please we will make a little bit of an irish progress and go on a little way further back having given a specimen from the time of queen elizabeth i will now give you another from the time of edward iii you will find that even in the days of good queen bess there was some degree of abatement in the comforts and enjoyments of life to be reaped by the soldier who fought the battles of his country and endured hardships to protect the enjoyments and comforts of all the rest for we find that in the time of edward iii hume vol   cadells small edition page     an estimate of the different pay given to a soldier and to a common labourer it not having been then perceived that a man ought to receive less emolument for being shot at than for being employed in the field a reaper in the first week of august was not allowed above twopence a day or near  d of our present money that is in the time of edward iii one shilling weighed as much as three do now for you must always keep in your eye when you are making a comparison of ancient and present times that the pound weight of silver was originally coined into  0s which is the reason why we now call  0s a pound and that it gradually altered from that standard till the time of elizabeth when it assumed the standard that it now bears do not forget either that this twopence which in point of metal was equal to our sixpence would buy as much corn meat and ale as can now be bought for  s  d or  s—a reaper in the first week of august was not allowed above twopence a day in the second week a third more a master carpenter was limited through the whole year to threepence a day a common carpenter to twopence money of that age it is remarkable that in the same reign the pay of a common soldier an archer was  d a day—which by the     change both in denomination and value would be equivalent to  0s or   s of our present money this was something like being a soldier—two or three campaigns made a mans fortune and if he escaped the first brush or two he might leave off trade and retire upon the profits to enjoy otium cum dignitate and yet strange to say a war could then be carried on for an hundredth part of the present expence but you will remember there were not then so many great ministers and agents—chancellors of the exchequer lords of the treasury lords of the admiralty clerks of the treasury lords of trade—lords commissioners—auditors and a long string of c c c c cs that would tire my patience to repeat and yours to hear and as they had not to pay thousands to so many persons who did nothing at all—they were better able to pay a good price to those who were to do the whole now citizens it may perhaps happen that these circumstances may not be quite unknown in the country since they have got in circulation in no less than three different editions of this size besides several others and such facts if known are not very well calculated to endear to the soldiery the present boroughmongering system but administration seems to have forgotten what the character of a soldier is and how should it be otherwise there was a time when statesmen were heroes not cabinet intriguers there was a time when he who thought he had a right to plunge a nation into war and send millions to slaughter thought he had no right to stay at home and enjoy the honors and profits of the struggle in security—ignorant of the temper as of the sufferings of those by whom it was maintained this being the case they were then enabled to discover that a soldier has a certain jealous feeling about him called his honour which one of our ancient poets calls the moral conscience of the brave but the present men do not seem to know that honour is the soldiers religion and that he who behaves to them like a swindler degrades himself before them and meets with their sovereign contempt not recollecting this we find that they have dared to rouse the fiery indignation of the british soldiery by tricks and artifices at which common honesty and common humanity recoil by these tricks they have carried on by wholesale the detestable practice of crimping for which some inferior agents have been so long famous in the retail way i allude     citizens to the circumstances of the enlistment and subsequent treatment of the fencible corps if i am not very much mistaken while the bill for raising these corps was before the house of commons an amendment was made by sheridan and at length adopted that they should not be sent out of the country but whether this clause was actually inserted in the act or not certain it is we have proof that under these terms and conditions many if not all the fencible corps were raised yet what has been the consequence has this agreement been abided by have ministers had the precaution even to keep their faith and honour with the instruments to which they look up for the support of their own power and grandeur no i shall not particularly notice on the present occasion the practice of sending english fencibles to ireland and irish fencibles to england or bringing scotch fencibles to this side of the tweed or sending english to the other because i hope and trust from the enlightened spirit that has gone abroad among us that we are fast approaching to the important conviction that english scotch and irish are one bound by one tie of interest and affection to love support and stand by each other as sworn and reciprocal friends who must mount up together to the renovation of their liberties and privileges or should one be struk down must tumble all at once into the abyss of ruin and destruction but there are other circumstances to which i most allude more particularly we can none of us have forgotten the mutinies and disturbances which have unfortunately taken place in various parts of the country we none of us i trust have reflected without horror upon those threatening scenes of terror which began to open before us and there is none i hope among us who would not join heart and hand to remove for ever the causes of such dangerous dissentions and prevent such terrible events as must exist if ever that military united for our defence should turn their swords against each other or level them at the breasts of their fellow citizens and extort their own terms from an affrighted nation let us not however be afraid to mention facts let us not shrink from the unpleasing but necessary recollection of scenes that have so lately passed we cannot forget that a regiment of these fencibles at bristol were recently ordered to be embarked for jersey and guernsey and that finding their offers were not to go with them they considered     themselves crimped trepanned and fold they took that opportunity also of complaining not only that having been enlisted under pretence of serving only in a particular county they were now about to be transported into another but that they had not received the whole of the bounty upon promise of which they were at first enlisted upon these grounds therefore they refused to go the event is well known they were remonstrated with they were promised their bounty as soon as they should get on board—they had been promised before but what are promises to those who have not the power to enforce them—they refused to quit the country whose shores they had enlisted to defend force was employed against them they formed themselves in resolute phalanx and bristol was upon the eve of witnessing the horrors of military rebellion when finding themselves surrounded by superior numbers they submitted were driven on board the transports and their ringleaders seized to be tried as mutineers and it is added the bounty of which they had been defrauded has never been paid the pretence being that the terms upon which this tardy act of justice had been offered had not been accepted by them in time whether this last part of the story is true or not i do not undertake absolutely to affirm there are certain circumstances which as it is scarcely possible to get to the bottom of them we must take upon such probable evidence as we can obtain and all that can be expected of us is that we do not affirm with greater confidence than we have good reason to believe at exeter a similar circumstance took place in a regiment raised by lord cunningham and composed almost entirely of his vassals these men were entered at a bounty of eight guineas per man the whole of which had not it seems been paid and part of the terms as they represent it were that they should not be sent out of the country and that they should serve no longer than till the conclusion of the war they however were ordered to the west indies—that is they were ordered to be drafted into the   d regiment which was bound to the west indies and which was under no sort of engagement to be disbanded at the return of peace and it is affirmed that they were in fact sold by certain of their officers to that regiment for fifteen guineas per man they having been raised at eighty a dead profit of seven guineas per head was thus to be gather by those upright men who considering that these poor soldiers were of the swinish multitudey might thus be said to have brought their hogs to a   0 fine market they also refused to be drafted insisting upon the fulfilment of their contract but litigations of this sort are settled in a shorter way than by suits in chancery they were drafted at the mouth of the cannon and compelled to quit the regiment to which under certain conditions they had joined themselves and enter into another bound by no conditions of a similar nature shall we dwell any longer upon these scenes shall we look to ireland where regiments ordered to the west indies considering that they were only going to a certain grave were also compelled contrary it is said to express stipulations to embark by the terror of immediate military execution while at the same time we are told that the officers were silenced by a profitable compromise they being gentlemen were to be treated in another guess sort of a way they were to be permitted to retire with full pay thus is the character of british officers to be degraded to that of common crimps who trepan and sell their fellow men for despicable lucre and sinecure commission citizens we are told in a ministerial paper of to day for what is it that ministerial papers will not tell us—we are told in a very peremptory tone in that famous oracle of ministerial wisdom the times that the story about trepanning the fencibles is nothing but a jacobinical fable invented by a parcel of incendiaries to draw men from the paths of duty and foment commotion but what do these ministerial oracles say to the letter of col hay upon this subject is the colonel one of these jacobins who are hired to disseminate these perjuries and falsehoods is colonel hay whose letter has been published in almost all the papers and who expressly declares that having an assurance from those from whom he received his commission that the men should not be sent out of the country he raised his men upon those terms and made that express agreement with them and that he considers it a violation both of his honour and the honour of his employers that this compact should be violated and the men compulsively drafted into other regiments which have not the advantage of any such terms in their favour citizens citizens are these men serious when they tell us they mean to support the present system do they wish we should reverence this aristocracy which they say it is treason to defame do they wish that we should peaceably submit to this oligarchy of boroughmongers which     has usurped the government and stripped both the king and people of their rights if they do methinks their means are ill adapted to their end for i do not see how it is possible that even the very instruments of their power should feel themselves thus treated by the leaders and supporters of aristocracy and not be induced to entertain strong feelings of detestation and abhorrence against a system under which they can be treated with such bare faced violation of every compact and engagement and every tie of good faith and amity—nor how it is possible for them not to wish for the restoration of that democracy which were it reestablished would render it impossible for ministers to practice with impunity artifices so base or to degrade the national character by such a violation of every duty towards those who are the hope and defence of the country but citizens we have not yet approached the climax we have yet to animadvert upon a set of beings at whose name nature shrinks with abhorrence a set of beings who bear the form and semblance of man but who like cannibals prey upon human flesh or revel at the banquets of low debauchery amongst the groans and anguish of those whom they trepan and destroy you will perceive that i am speaking of crimps and pressgangs—who have reduced the art of manstealing to a science and established their posts and stations in different parts of the country from which i suppose we shall by and by have intelligence carried by new invented telegraphs that their system may be conducted with the greater security i believe i should not be unauthorised if i were to affirm that immense fortunes are made by this infamous trade i will not dwell however upon many particulars nor name to you what captains went to what crimping house and told the crimp majors that they wanted ten men and would give a hundred guineas for them neither will i detail the commercial haggling that took place for the other fifty circumstances of this kind have been so repeatedly brought before the public and with such strong and convincing proofs proofs marked in blood proofs echoed in sighs of anguish to your ears that i need not occupy your time by much detail but remember citizens these dungeons of crimpinghouses could not exist—this practice of manstealing could not be carried on if there were not police officers in league with the wretches who commit these depredations—if the course of justice were fairly administered if our magistrates     were fairly appointed as by the ancient spirit of our constitution they ought to be—if instead of being the creatures tools and sometimes perhaps the panders of great men and officers of state they were men whose situations were conferred upon them merely by the confidence and respect of their fellow citizens practices of this kind cannot be conducted without official accomplices and accordingly we find enquiry repeatedly crushed by the specious pretence the king must have soldiers the king must have soldiers—but must the king have slaves for those who are stolen seduced or trapanned in the hour of drunkenness are not soldiers but slaves unfortunately from the growth of corruption from the immense volumes in which our laws are written—volumes which scarcely any human industry can toil through in a whole life—from the immense expence with which justice is to be purchased by english freemen it is impossible for the poor and the ignorant to receive the benefit of those laws and emboldened by this circumstance with such audacity does this trade of manstealing stalk along our streets that even persons in what are aristocratically called respectable situations—even those whom all mankind considered as having some claims to humanity are sometimes its victims i might refer you for a fact of a very suspicious nature to mr walker a bookseller in this town whose son a solid and respectable young man of    has been missing these five or six months—no one knowing what is become of him a young man as little likely to have quitted his family or friends on any vagrant project as any person in the metropolis instances of this sort are numerous indeed and many similar circumstances have come to my ears which i shall not take up your time by stating to you but there is another story circumstantially told me by persons ready to support the truth of it which i shall not pass over in silence the partner in a very considerable mustard manufactory in the borough was taken by force and violence upon one of the bridges by a party of kidnappers and crimps who evidently knew him and called him by his name and when alarmed by their abrupt greeting he denied that he was the man they felt for a large ring that he wore and upon finding it exclaimed yes but you are the man for here is the ring with which they accordingly made free they then seized him dragged him to a boat and carried him to chatham from whence he escaped from the simple     circumstance of a person accidentally recognizing him and explaining who and what he was but if he had been a poor man no matter how honest and virtuous what would it have availed who had seen or who had known him from this circumstance citizens i turn to the lad whom on friday last i produced in this tribune the aunt of this lad i should inform you having seen my posting bills called on thursday morning to relate the facts and the person who answered the door not knowing that i was above in my study said i was not at home the aunt accordingly left word that she called to tell me some circumstances about her boy who had been crimped and whom she was ready to bring to me that he might be produced in this place if i thought proper—that the public might see what sort of a lad had been so practised upon she was to come again on the friday morning which however she did not but about the middle of the day a person came from her and told me the story in a more particular manner bringing at the same time the newspaper in which during his absence he had been advertised and the handbill which had been cried in bartholomew fair to which he afterwards added the letter written by the lad from northampton to his aunt who had protected him from his infancy—he having lost both his father before his birth and his mother a few weeks after these circumstances he told me he would bring the aunt and the boy to state to me and in the evening they came accordingly the boy told his story in a very plain and direct manner stating that he went out from his aunts house with intention of going to school but that it being a little before six oclock he took a walk in the park till the school should open while thus sauntering about two soldiers came up to him my lad said one of them you look melancholy it may be so said the lad but you would not be melancholy replied the crimp if you were a soldier we who serve his majesty have plenty of money and plenty of good liquor and are as happy as can be i will give you five guineas now if you will enlist and five more when you have enlisted i will see your money at the devil first said the boy but he was immediately seized by the other who was behind him and who put a gag in his mouth and took him in a coach to some house he knew not where confined him in a dark cellar and in the night took him off together with two     other boys upon the road as he was informed towards manchester the boy relates many curious adventures upon this journey in a very circumstantial manner and very particularly describes the manner in which he found means after he was locked up alone in a two pair of stairs room at a public house out of the high road where they stopped by the assistance of his bed cord to let himself down from the window and make his escape he then enquiring of the first person he met his way into the high road for london was directed to northampton whence he wrote a letter to his aunt containing a rude statement of the foregoing facts and his aunt accordingly went down immediately to fetch him it was impossible i should have any objection to state facts like these but at the same time it was necessary for me to guard against the possibility of deception and to be cautious that i did not pledge myself to a story however plausible before i had sifted it to the very bottom i therefore only noticed it in general terms on friday and adjourned the more ample statement to this evening in the mean time i got a friend to go to the schoolmaster in the first instance from whom i learn that the boy had been absent in the manner stated and that he for his part believed the boys story to be true that he had a high opinion of the veracity of the aunt and that he did not believe there was any sort of trick in it i then got this same friend to write to northampton to know whether any such had ever been there and what was the story he had told the answer was that he had been there and the story he told to the poor woman who protected him corresponds with what i have already related still however i deemed it necessary to make further enquiries and i proposed to the aunt that she should appoint two housekeepers whom she knew and that i should appoint two that i knew and that they should crossexamine the boy and if to them there appeared satisfactory evidence of the truth of the story that then affidavits should be drawn up for the boy and herself and that they should go before a magistrate and offer to make oath of the facts this appeared to me the best way to avoid all possibility of deception and at the same time as a part of the complaint made to me was that the magistrates were unwilling to assist in searching the crimpinghouses c i conceived that perhaps they would not be very ready to administer the oath proposed and that if this should be the case     these preliminary enquiries and precautions would make the appeal to the public so much the stronger and expose the connivance in these infamous transactions the more completely but with this proposal the aunt refused to comply observing that she was an officers widow and was dependent and that she would not fly in the face of government i therefore chose to drop all further concern in the affair and she immediately went to the magistrate as i have since learned and offered to make oath of the facts the magistrate however as i foresaw refused to administer the oath and expressed no small degree of indignation at her having been with me upon such a business such then citizens are the circumstances of this story which it appears to me demands most serious investigation and which i hope some citizen will endeavour to probe to the bottom if it is true it is a truth so monstrous and so alarming to every one whose heart is alive to parental feeling as scarcely any instance in the records of human infamy can equal not to dwell however upon a story relative to which even the very shadow of a doubt can remain i shall conclude this lecture with a melancholy circumstance that took place at poole i shall not go very fully into the affair at present because from persons in that part of the country i have promises that i can depend upon of authentic and full particulars of the transaction and the general heads of it have been some time ago stated in the public papers the circumstances are briefly thus—a vessel coming into the port of poole with only a few hands on board perceiving itself likely to be boarded by a pressgang a banditti of wretches who though well known in this country for their open atrocities have no sort of legal right or pretence for the depredations they commit on individual security the crew determined to defend themselves but the master of the pressgang boarded the vessel and by the assistance of some soldiers whom he found means to compel reluctantly to assist his project he succeeded in reducing the unfortunate crew having shot three of the men who had the audacity to defend themselves two of them may perhaps be considered as having fallen in the struggle but the fate of the third can bear no softer name than deliberate murder the instance i allude to was the midshipman who perceiving his companions and friends fall beneath the ferocious rage of these cannibals bared his bosom and exclaimed you have murdered     my companions murder me also the ruffian lieutenant took him at his word levelled the pistol at his breast and shot him dead the whole of this affair and the disgraceful facts which followed will soon i hope be submitted to the public suffice it to say for the present that the enraged populace and particularly the relatives of the murdered seamen and passengers fell upon the pressgang with great fury and threatened to tear them to pieces they were rescued however and carried to gaol under pretence of being committed for trial but when the day of trial came the principal witnesses who were some soldiers quartered in the town were found to have been marched off in the dead of the night and thus was the course of justice perverted but the tale of horror does not stop here the inhabitants of poole affirm and i have seen very respectable persons who support the affirmation that the three men who were the principal perpetrators of these murders by the abuse of ministerial or some other corruption by the poison that has been poured into that ear which ought to be closed to every whisper but of justice and truth—these men—shall i call them men these tygers in human shape have been appointed to places and rewarded with pensions what citizens is this the law and justice we wish to maintain—is this our liberty—is this our constitution where is the audacious minister where is the wretched tool of party that can dare to stand up armed as he may be with all the terrors of perverted law or military domination—where is the wretch that dare to stand up and tell me that this is the law or constitution of this country—that these are the objects for which the prerogative of mercy was lodged in royal hands—or that it is for this britons ought to expend their treasures and exhaust their blood unhappy britons why do you rear with fond solicitude the offspring of your loves—why do ye toil to improve the futility of the soil or the excellency of your manufactures—why do ye plough the dangerous billow to enrich your country with the fruits of other climes alas alas and is it all for this—that the pressgang the crimp the kidnapper may tear the hopeful or industrious youth from the bosom of his friends and relatives or having slaughtered the innocent and useful member of society may exult in the rewards of violence and be crowned with commemorating honours     as the ancient romans were not when they had destroyed but when they had saved the lives of their fellow citizens we have talked of requisitions in france but what is a french requisition when compared with this the requisition of france was instituted to compel all ranks and orders of society to take their share in the common danger—to compel the wealthiest citizen to encounter the same hazard as the poorest which according to my conception is most impartial justice for why should the paltry pittance of a man wallowing in wealth and luxury be put in competition with my life because forsooth i have not learned his thriving arts why should the wealthy merchant—the ermined peer—the over pampered parasite of ministerial corruption remain in indolent security at home while the peasant quits his plough or the artificer his loom to shed his blood in defence of those who disdain to share the common danger why should the plain common man be doomed not only to an untimely grave but leave also a helpless family to beggary and distress while the rich man reposes in the couch of luxury amuses himself with the narrative of exploits performed at the expence of the blood of those whom nature made his equals and habit has rendered more useful to society than himself nay according to their own doctrines the rich and the rich alone ought to be sent to fight the battles of any country they impudently tell us when we talk of rights that we can have no rights because we have nothing to lose if we have nothing to lose we can have nothing to defend and i do not know why we should spend our blood in defending the possessions and enjoyments of others who care so little for us and repay us only with contempt instead of soothing us instead of encouraging us in this unequal warfare where we stake every thing and have nothing to gain instead of this the very reverse is the picture of their conduct and the poor common soldier either dies in the ranks or is consigned to a workhouse or an hospital to brood over his wounds and services and what adds to these aggravations and insults the bond of plighted faith is broken with the soldier enlisted for his countrys defence and military commissions once the rewards of patriot services are little other than patents of impunity for man stealing and the traffic of human blood what blind infatuation has seized upon the minds of our governors why talk we of jacobinism who are such rank jacobins as the administration conducting our present affairs why talk we of anarchy who are the organizers     of anarchy but pitt dundas and their subaltern coadjutors why talk we of the british constitution it no longer exists those who pretend to idolize it have pulled it down and even the ill constructed cumbrous pile of oligarchy which faction has raised in its place those who are most interested in supporting it seem emulous to destroy and like sampson of old to bury themselves in the ruins of an edifice which they are no longer capable of supporting rights of britons in no xxiv i inserted from the critical review an article noticing my natural and constitutional right of britons to annual parliaments universal suffrage and the freedom of popular association c—since that time the following article has appeared in another literary journal monthly review sept      p  0  art   — the natural and constitutional right c it is the unquestionable right of freeborn britons when legally accused of any crime to be heard in their own defence—but experience has fully proved that it is more advantageous to the party accused as well as more eligible for the public that his defence shall be made by proxy than in his own proper person weighty reasons might be assigned for this—even in the case in which the person against whom the charge is brought possesses talents which might well enable him to become his own advocate notwithstanding mr thelwalls eloquence improved by a habit of public speaking we apprehend he has no reason to complain that his cause was transferred from his own hands to those of the able and upright pleaders who so eminently distinguished themselves on the part of the prisoners in the late statetrials for high treason perhaps too the public may be of opinion that after the full report which has been given of their pleadings and of the whole process of the trials it is not probable that much important matter respecting these prosecutions can yet remain to be disclosed mr thelwall however thinks it right after his honourable acquittal again to present himself before the bar of the public in his own person by publishing the speech which he intended to have delivered on his trial and his vindication will be found to     exhibit many things respecting both the general cause and individual case of mr thelwall with a degree of force and energy which while it displays in a favourable light the writers oratorical talents may serve to establish in the public mind the fullest conviction of the equity of the verdicts in question and of their importance to the preservation of public freedom circumstanced as mr t has been it is not to be expected that with his ardour of temper and command of language he should be capable of writing without some portion of acrimony the work however not only has considerable merit as a political oration but states with great strength of argument several important points in which british freedom is essentially interested—particularly the question concerning parliamentary reform

ireland with a history of the progress of defenderism and reflections on the fate and deportment of oconnor delivered at the lecture room beaufort buildings strand september   th      citizens if the state of opinion in england is not very flattering to the champions of aristocracy let us consider whether by turning their eyes towards scotland and ireland they will find much more reason for consolation and satisfaction let us consider what is the state of the public mind there and let us keep it constantly in remembrance that we ought to be equally anxious about every part of the opinions of every part of the nation and that we ought to be equally desirous of promoting the peace happiness and prosperity of all the three divisions as they have hitherto been considered but as i would say the three integral parts of a state which i should wish to see to the end of time one and indivisible in sentiments wishes and in exertions with respect to scotland we cannot but be aware that there a disposition to dissatisfaction and that a very strong bias indeed towards immediate and thorough reform has been manifested even before it displayed itself with equal strength in this part of the nation we cannot but be aware that the principles of liberty are there very widely diffused and that a considerable degree of indignation and anger still boils in the breasts of scotchmen on account of the abject situation in which they are held by corruption and the slavery imposed upon them by royal burghs and other rotten corporations by     which their rights are extinguished and their suffrages monopolized it is very true citizens that from the unfortunate circumstance of scotland being a country where there are no laws an inquisition has been established in that part of the country more successfully than mr reeves and his honourable associates have been enabled to establish here—i say from scotland being a country where there are no laws for when judges from the bench shall declare as the judges of the court of justiciary have declared that an opinion delivered by the privy council is binding upon the consciences of judges because undoubtedly some of the judges of the country were members of that privy council—i say when opinions like these are delivered which in other words is asserting that the judges have a right to make whatever laws it is convenient for them to execute then the state of the people as to any hope of legal redress as to any hope of public virtue and justice is absolutely that of having no laws at all nay i speak too favourably they are in a condition much worse than if they had no laws at all for to have laws to punish but none to redress to have laws to crush but none to protect to have laws that can trample us into the dust that can subjugate us to a tyrannous aristocracy and no laws to obtain a redress against the usurpations of that aristocracy is a state infinitely worse than that of savages who run wild in the woods and seek for protection only from their own strong arm in consequence then of the modes of proceeding in the courts of justiciary in consequence of the public prosecutor being able to appoint in the most open and palpable manner the jury by the majority of whose voices the person brought before them is to be tried they have been enabled to produce a degree of terror never equalled except under the tyranny of that gallic dictator robespierre so frequently abused and so constantly imitated by those who abuse him most on this side of the tweed there is more difficulty in executing the arbitrary will of a few inquisitors exertions after exertions have been made to crush opinion and yet freedom of opinion still lifts its head on high and braves the thunders of ministerial and inquisitorial vengeance magistrates have tried all means to suppress discussion and all would not do they have tried cabals and intrigues of every description—nay they have winked and connived at violence and even sent into rooms were persons were assembled for the purpose of free     discussion their police officers to create riots yet still the treasury papers call aloud for the magistrates to repeat those fruitless exertions to crush every individual who dares to speak the truth and to find honest juries to acquit him for having so spoken yes citizens the oracular diurnal pamphleteer of a certain great treasury scribbler has been calling very loud upon the magistrates to repress assemblies in which it is wickedly maintained that cruelties and murders have been committed by crimps and press gangs citizens i should like to know what sort of exertion it is that magistrates are to appeal to in order to suppress the jacobinical crime of reason police officers have already kicked up riots and neglected to take themselves up for such rioting—police officers have brought huge deluded coalheavers to bellow forth outrageous songs within these walls—but who as soon as they heard the voice of reason well convinced of the truth of the principles they were sent to decry departed from the room with denunciations against those who had attempted to delude them and to inflame their minds against those who instead of enemies they found to be their best friends reeves—the grand arch inquisitor reeves the chief magistrate of this district has given orders to every constable and officer of the dutchy to crimp me—for i can call it nothing else to take a man up without warrant authority or criminal accusation with what view no one has ever been able to discover or divine—but probably to conduct him on board a ship to fight his majestys battles and maintain the honour of the british flag in defiance of the blasphemous thunder of republican cannon a pert little gentleman also who though at present no magistrate may perhaps be one some day or other—a little prating jack a dandy of the name of jenkinson employed on a certain occasion fifty bludgeon men to knock lecturer and auditors o the head and all has failed—nuisance has failed—sedition has failed and high treason itself has failed i should like to know what are the fresh exertions magistrates are called upon to make that they may rival the triumphant glories of the court of justiciary and crush the monster discussion in this part also of great britain to return however to scotland if we are to judge from mere external circumstances the sentiments of liberty there lie prostrate at the feet of those to whom liberty is always offensive and reason always a crime but let us not conclude too hastily appearances are frequently delusive and the rage     and indignation that is smothered and pent up within the bosoms of individuals who dare not speak frequently engenders fury more destructive and dispositions more inimical to the preservation of peace and happiness than all the flaming sedition as it is called ever breathed from the lips of those who boldly speaking their minds and investigating their principles are liable to be contradicted at all times and if they speak falsely to be convicted of that falshood and overwhelmed with the shame and disgrace due to the wretch who dare think one thing and another tell citizens we cannot be ignorant of the character of the scotch nation we must be narrow minded infatuated beings if we do not admit that our brethren on the other side of the tweed are a brave a gallant an intrepid and a reflecting people we must be lost to all knowledge of the human character if we suppose that such men relinquish their principles merely because they are not permitted for the present to speak them we must be blind indeed to all conviction that results from an observation of the conduct and character of mankind if we are not convinced that by attempting to smother and suffocate the discussion of opinions and forcibly to suppress the expression of popular sentiment we alienate the affections of those men whom we thus treat like vanquished slaves and create in their bosoms a determined enmity against that government which thus compels them to be enemies when they wish only to be reformers what can you suppose at this time must pass in the breast of the scotchman who feels himself no longer enabled on account of this system of persecution and inquisition to unbosom himself to the friend of his heart or speak his sentiments over the chearful glass what must be his feelings i say when he finds sentiments thus immured in his bosom must they not be eminently hostile to the aggrandizement of those who have thus chosen to be dreaded masters when they might have reigned in the affections of men who owning no master look only with veneration and esteem to their benefactors—and above all to the public benefactor whose eminent situation enables him to dispense felicity to thousands citizens the plain and simple fact is that there is but one source of national peace and popular attachment and that is the unforced affections of the heart you may compel men to hate you but their affections you must win by kind and gentle means—they can never be forced and not less ridiculous is any attempt to coerce mankind and compel them to applaud     your measures or be attached to your government than was the attempt of the oriental tyrant in the fable who attempted to compel by arbitrary laws every person throughout his court to wear the smile of gladness upon his face all the gloomy all the malignant passions you may extort but if you wish for dispositions friendly to happiness and virtue you must win them by gentle means—and if you will not by wise virtuous and just regulations secure the affections of the people if you will not by equal laws fairly and justly administered secure to the magistracy of the country that veneration which virtue and wisdom can alone obtain farewell to all hopes of enjoying any peace and tranquillity in the elevated situations to which fortune may have exalted you or to which you may have aspired by intrigue and artifice but let us turn from scotland to a picture still more gloomy and unfortunate let us behold the condition of our sister country ireland here i believe we shall find still less to exult in still less to be satisfied with here we shall find discontent disseminating itself through all ranks and conditions of the people and we shall find melancholy to relate that coercive measures have driven many an excellent and upright individual into the mistaken notion of looking for protection from a foreign army and wishing rather for the assistance of those who hitherto had been considered as their natural enemies than the protection of those who ought to be their natural and their zealous friends perhaps citizens it may not be improper in this part of the investigation to take a brief view of the former history of the country i am speaking of we are to remember that ireland was in the first instance a conquered province and we ought therefore perhaps to be the more anxious to treat the people with kindness since it is only from this kindness that we can possibly expect to fix their attachment and unite them to us in the firm bonds of amity the barbarous maxims of ancient conquerors always reduced the natives of a subjugated country to a situation little better than that of slaves and accordingly the descendants from the ancient irish to this day for we have not yet entirely conquered those prejudices which early tyranny taught mankind are to be found principally among the most neglected orders of the community while the generality of the gentry trace their descent from english families hence we have not yet that thorough incorporation of the different classes which must be the zealous wish of every good friend     to the peace and happiness of mankind since without this the gentle intercourses and sympathies of life the reciprocations produced by intermediate and gradual steps of accession and declension have never been known in ireland as once they were in england citizens the abject condition of the lower orders in ireland is such as no individual of feeling and humanity can contemplate without regret and anguish ignorance—savage ignorance reigns triumphant and what has been the blessed consequence there have been ministers in modern times who were very anxious to suppress all enquiry and who considered it as an enormous crime to impart information to mankind if you wish to rule people in peace and keep them in proper order say they you must keep the swinish multitude in ignorance thus and thus only are you to make them quietly submit to their lordly drivers yet look at ireland is the maxim supported by the experience of that country a greater degree of ignorance i should suppose than prevails among the wild irish as they are called even the ministers of this country would not wish to prevail and yet the history of ireland is little else than a continued narrative of ferocious depredations committed by these ignorant people linked in tumultuary combinations to extort by violence what they have not improved intellect to demand by the voice of manly and intrepid reason citizens i speak not from national feelings i wish to triumph over all nationality and with me indeed there is no national distinction between irishmen scotchmen and englishmen i care not which name is articulated first it is only contending which brother of the same equal family shall first be named and as i abhor the rights of primogeniture i am satisfied with which soever you begin so that you will but admit that they have all the same common rights of happiness and fraternity but at the same time i must observe that in almost all cases the brothers and sisters of the same family have a different character from the little intercourse i have had with irish gentlemen i have found it pretty uniformly agreed that even among the higher classes of society information generally speaking is but too much neglected hence it is that there is a greater disposition to neglect the rights and interests of the lower orders i know there are brilliant exceptions we have had repeated proofs of the strong genius and energetic understanding of the irish nation—proofs that make one     still more lament that a mistaken sort of hospitality too nearly allied to drunkenness and debauchery should have obscured the faculties which might have contributed so much to the happiness of the universe let me observe however that nothing can be more unfriendly to the happiness and consequently to the contentment of the laborious orders of society than that men of the higher that is to say the more useless ranks should be lost in extravagant debauchery and insult the starving wretchedness of the poor by the wasteful profusion of privileged licentiousness another circumstance contributing to this discontent is the common practice of the gentry in ireland farming out their estates as they generally do in large portions to intermediate proprietors whose trade being extortion trample still more upon those from whose industry the happiness the grandeur and the strength of the country is alone to be supported this being the state of society in ireland we shall not be much surprized to find that for centuries the history of that country has been uniformly marked by the excesses committed by combinations of the common people the first instance i shall particularly mention is the rapparees a set of persons whose history you will find amply detailed in sir john dalrymples memoirs and perhaps you will be a little amused by tracing the very great resemblance between those depredators and the virtuous peasants of poictou as the assassins and midnight plunderers of brittany have been affectedly called and whose sole virtue is being the tools of an insolent swarm of priests and aristocratic oppressors and lurking in woods at the corners of roads to cut the throats of every individual whom they think differs from them in opinion that such is the real history of the chouans if i were disposed to enter further into the digression might be easily proved and but too nearly such is the picture drawn by sir john dalrymple of the rapparees or tories and who were the individuals who had the merited honour of conferring a title upon the high flown aristocrats in this country after these rapparees arose another sect rather of a different description but still who unfortunately marked the history of the country by associations highly inimical to public peace and welfare but let us mark if you please how they arose as it may be a useful lesson to those who in this country are so very     fond of the inclosing system—not that i find fault with the mere circumstance of inclosure but with that system of enclosure by which the rich monopolize to themselves the estates rights and possessions of the poor the men of whom i am now about to speak are the white boys and who in the first instance were called levellers it may not be unimportant to tell you how they obtained that name for even they were not levellers of reevess description the sublime idea of levelling all intellect and plundering all property was left for discovery to the keen and penetrating genius of that great lawyer—the founder of inquisitions and the organizer of the system of spies and perjured treachery the levellers of ireland took their name from the following circumstance there were in that division of ireland where they first arose very considerable commons which had been long assistant to the comfortable support of poor families but certain persons of considerable power and distinction took it into their heads that they could make a better use of these commons than the poor people did and therefore without any act of parliament or legal authority whatever they seized those commons and inclosed them with what are called dry walls—that is to say walls of stones piled one upon another without any cement the common people not very well liking this system of encroachment levelled those dry walls constantly by night which the aristocrats constantly built up in the day hence they were called levellers the usurpers of the peoples rights were thus compelled to build wet walls that the joints of the aristocratic stones being combined by the democratic lime might resist the encroachments of these levellers such is the early history of these associators but as they afterwards adopted a strange fashion of wearing their shirts over their coats from that circumstance they came to be called white boys under this denomination they continued their depredations and at last in an unaccountable disposition to do some degree of justice to these common people who shewed that they would never be quiet till they got it those commons were restored by an act of parliament—to their right owners but as generally happens when rulers struggle against the rights of the people the repentance came too late the seeds of sedition were sown as they always are sown by the tyranny     ill management of the rulers and concessions were made as usual when those concessions could no longer heal the wounds which tyranny and usurpation had inflicted—may the concessions of modern aristocrats be made in better season before the discontents which their present system of oppression cannot fail to disseminate have taken such deep root as to be fatal to the tranquillity of the community that we may thus avoid the consequences which must inevitably result from a determination to uphold the rights of borough mongers in opposition to the rights of man and the privileges of a few in opposition to the just immunities of all citizens i shall proceed to observe that there are other circumstances which result from maxims of policy equally unjust and ridiculous which have a tendency at this time to excite in ireland even the wildest dispositions of democracy i mean in particular the universal dissatisfaction which at this time prevails in consequence of the refusal of an act of justice to the consciences of a great majority of the people which was so peaceably demanded and which there was at one time reason to hope would have been so honourably conceded we cannot citizens avoid observing that ever since the revolution there has been a disposition almost in whatever party happened to be uppermost to cherish a division of sentiments upon speculative opinions this is one of the engines constantly employed to divide the people it being the maxim with those whose principles are weak and whose ambition is strong to divide first that they may conquer afterwards thus for a whole century almost have the minds of the irish catholics been agitated against those of the established religion and the minds of the protestants agitated against the catholics hence also in this country have the ridiculous test and corporation acts been supported with a view as one would imagine to no other end but to keep alive the unnatural ferment and dissatisfaction which has so long subsisted between protestants of the church of england and protestant dissenters this maxim however of division upon religious sentiment has been strained too far as has always been the case with respect to dishonorable expedients if you go upon the plain simple principle of justice you can never strain too far because the further you go in the right road the nearer you get to the great standard of truth but if on the contrary you adopt principles of ambition and paltry expedients   0 for the gratification of that ambition those very expedients carried to an excess recoil upon those who have attempted to support themselves by such means and destroy the power they were intended to aggrandize such has been in a considerable degree the case with respect to disputations and jealousies upon religious subjects mankind have been taught by artifices so frequently discovered to consider these as intrigues of state tricksters and jugglers and have therefore come pretty unanimously to the adoption of this plain and selfevident axiom—that if you wish for the full and ample enjoyment of the rights of religious opinion you must first acquire the full and actual enjoyment of political liberty when you have annihilated usurpation tyranny and monopoly—when you have made the voice and sentiments of the people a fair and just rule for the principles of legislation you have done away the power of one faction to tyrannize over another and having established liberty upon so broad a basis you are enabled to found a temple so capacious as to afford every honest heart an opportunity to indulge every sentiment and exercise every inclination not hostile to the peace happiness and welfare of mankind we have talked citizens of toleration we have made an empty boast of granting a part of their rights to particular classes of people till mankind have discovered that the very word toleration is but an insult that no person has a right to tolerate the opinions of another because no person has a right to call the opinions of another in question the right to form our own judgment upon every abstract question is a right which can never be taken from man though its exercise may be tyrannically suspended interruption toleration means putting up with the opinions of others but i should like to know what right any person can have for supposing it a matter that depends upon his inclination whether another man shall have an opinion will or inclination of his own nay opinion is not only an inviolable right but a right that mocks the folly of persecution because it never can be taken away you may make men hypocrites indeed and perhaps governors not being very much attached to sincerity may not have any particular objection to hypocrites but you cannot compel them to change their opinions to talk therefore of toleration is rank absurdity it is the right not the indulgence of the free exercise of the     convictions of judgment upon questions which society has no right to interfere with that is claimed by every enlightened advocate for the happiness of mankind but let us consider what has been the conduct of the minister in this respect we cannot citizens be blind to the truth that the whole people of ireland have of late expressed a strong inclination that the catholics should be emancipated from the restrictions under which they lay it has not only been the wish of catholics themselves it has been the wish of protestants this unanimous wish inspired a rational expectation in the minds of the people that compliance and not coercion would follow this expectation we know to have been considerably increased by the appointment of earl fitzwilliam to the viceroyalty i shall not dwell upon events which are fresh in your remembrance suffice it to say that ireland expected emancipation but that ireland was disappointed and was taught to remember that she was dependent upon the cabinet of london or in other words upon king william the fourth—alias king pitt whose sovereign will and pleasure was that the catholics should not be emancipated and that the wishes of the people of ireland should not be indulged the fact is that a sort of congenial sympathy affected his mind he was exceedingly unwilling that the ponsonbys who monopolized all the power patronage and wealth of ireland should lose any part of that power while he himself monopolizing all the power patronage and property of england had the power of preventing so disagreeable a circumstance but what were the pretences for refusing the emancipation why forsooth we are told all of a sudden that the catholics hitherto proscribed as the most violent advocates for despotic power by a sort of magical hocus pocus are turned to violent democrats and that they would overturn royalty and aristocracy and all the peaceful and regular institutions of orderly government this it is true may appear strange such an alteration in so short a time but the wonder vanishes when we observe how rapid a progress certain principles are making and that even the pope himself has turned jacobin and forced his bull to bellow forth vox populi vox dei the voice of the people is the voice of god and therefore you my good son louis must submit to the will of god expressed in so clear and audible a manner if therefore sir infallibility himself has proclaimed this great truth it is certainly not impossible that the devotees of     his infallible holiness should entertain the same faith be this however as it will the catholic emancipation was rejected and instead of the abolition of ridiculous distinctions between one religion and another a system of military coercion is established in ireland and the reign of a new viceroy was proclaimed by the arrival of thousands of english fencibles into a country where english and irish ought to be no further distinctions than right hand and left of the same body one of which could not be employed against the other without involving an act of suicide but what must be the tendency of such a measure depression and terror for the present a civil war for the future disunion and destruction and scenes of slaughter in which brother perhaps must shed once more as on the plains of america the blood of brother and the irish relative glut the keen poinard in the breast of his english friend measures of this description mark a desperation which can only be ascribed to phrenzy that the minister of a great country should hope to enforce these measures which he cannot carry by trusting fairly to the hearts and wishes of the people by rendering one part of the country an instrument to coerce the other is a wickedness so wild and extravagant that one would be astonished any human being could adopt it without some preconcerted scheme to separate the two parts of the empire but it is impossible this system should succeed the light of reason has gone abroad humanity has warmed the breast of man and we have found strange indeed that we should have been so long in making the discovery that even the footy african is our brother that even the poor whipgalled slave in the west indies deserves our commiseration and this being the case do you suppose we can be blind to this still more evident truth that english scotch and irish are one and the same—that they are united and bound together in the chains of inseparable interest—and that to attempt to employ one of them as an instrument of coercion against the other is an attempt to make men the assassins of each other who upon the first moments reflection instead of poignards instead of coercion and malice will extend the hand of fraternity to each other and rush forward not to each others destruction but with open arms to the embrace of concord peace liberty and affection exclaiming with ardour—think not to make us brutes and savages to tear each others breasts we are all men we are all brethren     and will not shed the blood of those whose manly hearts are warmed with affection for us and whose generous virtues call for our admiration and esteem but citizens notwithstanding all this progress generally speaking towards this union of sentiment it cannot but be acknowledged that the measures adopted by ministers have in particular bosoms stirred up a spirit of disunion and i am much deceived if there are not in ireland at this time strong dispositions to an absolute separation from this country i speak not wishes but fears my sentiments are certainly congenial to the indivisibility of the three countries i think we are not too large considering the great and powerful nations in our neighbourhood and though i have hopes that the system of hostility is dying away—though i have great expectations that the present hostilities are the last agonizing and convulsive throws of that system of perpetual war and devastation which has so long depopulated europe yet at the same time i cannot but think that some degree of proportion between the strength power and population of neighbouring countries may have some tendency towards protecting them from the renewal of that system therefore i do not in this case speak by tropes nor by my fears express my hopes to whatever degree this disposition may have spread certainly the measures at present adopted must have a considerable tendency to increase it for can we be extravagant enough to suppose that by mere military force we can retain ireland as a dependant colony no—she has a right to be considered as an equal part possessing all the immunities that we ought to possess and therefore in subjection the never will be held observe what dissatisfactions make their appearance when prosecutions for high treason are going abroad there is generally a conviction in the minds of those who institute them that their measures are such as justify attempts of that description when we perceive the manner in which they have behaved lately towards the defenders and when we consider how these defenders have apparently increased in number i think we shall perceive that we are not strengthening the bonds of union and affection and though these defenders in many respects bear great similarity to the white boys or levellers of former times yet i think the late trial will lead me to suspect that there is a powerful and formidable conspiracy to effect a separation between ireland and england     i should wish from the bottom of my soul that no such conspiracy existed but if it do can the late event promise much for the frustration of such a design quite the contrary what has been the conduct of the man who upon the oath of a single witness swearing himself to be foresworn has been condemned to execution think of his manly his intrepid his magnificent conduct hear in every word and sentiment that he speaks the feelings and convictions of an honest enthusiasm—misled and deluded it is true or rather driven by the persecutions and oppressions of the times into notions and projects offensive to the laws and opposite i believe to the real interests of his country—yet an enthusiasm so powerful—so fascinating—so encouraging as cannot fail to produce an effect the very reverse of panic depression and dispersion let us be just to those whose actions we do not applaud let us confess then that this man could not have so deported himself—could not have so expressed himself—could not have waked this glow of involuntary admiration in our hearts if he had not been prompted and animated by an internal feeling of the justice and propriety of his conduct and who knows how widely this delusive feeling may have spread or how much warmth enthusiasm and revenge may have been generated in the breasts of his followers by his heroic intrepidity do we who disapprove the cause feel this veneration for the man—what then may be the emotions of those who participate in his political feelings let us remember also that these defenders in general if there were not a great mixture of justice and truth in their pretensions could never have become formidable to government wat tyler that great and glorious character so infamously assassinated and so wickedly blasphemed by courtly historians would never have been the leader of a powerful body of the populace if the pretences for which he had armed had not been founded in justice and natural equity nor would these defenders ever have been formidable if there had not been oppressions and acts of injustice which stimulated the feelings of many an honest but impatient being rather than endure the miseries of his country to appeal to means unjustifiable but which from the ignorance they are retained in are the only means they know how to devise in short i am convinced that this act of coercion and the magnanimity with which the man has perished will rather     promote the cause of defenderism than beat it down and that if we would in reality check the progress of this evil we must not appeal to coercion but must ameliorate the condition of society and reform those abuses which have reduced the lower orders to their present melancholy situation on the independence of mind produced by genuine benevolence—from dyers dissertation on the theory and practice of benevolence the pamphlet from which the following extract is made is the production of geo dyer b a a citizen whose life appears to have been spent in the active exercise of the virtue which his pen is employed to recommend to others the particular work of which these paragraphs are a specimen and the complaints of the poor a pamphlet formerly published by the same estimable author contain innumerable passages which both in point of fact and principle challenge the attention of all those who sincerely wish properly to understand the condition and practically to alleviate the calamities of mankind the independence of a good man consists in a superiority to every influence but of moral persuasion and to every force but of rational conviction it proceeds from a sense of dignity and personal rectitude it is that decent pride that characterizes generous minds that high sense of honour that will not suffer them to yield to profligacy or to stoop to meanness it is a kind of majesty essential to virtue or more properly speaking it is the grace of ingenuousness and the freedom of innocence this virtuous independence crowns the happiness of private life and happy are the governments that give it public security in steady and pure governments this becomes a principal consideration of national regard their aim is to produce public happiness not to aggrandize or enrich individuals to procure moral freedom through the medium of political justice offices are appropriated to talent and if virtues are not distinguished by honours they are not at least exposed to penalties the cultivator of the land enjoys the fruits without oppression the legislator and the magistrate are indemnified if not rewarded no one is tempted to exchange     his principles for a livelihood and each considers himself as an individual of a family in which no one is a slave but governments as well as individuals are imperfect some in a greater others in a less degree in many an original sin lurks that breaks out at intervals through every department and weakens and exhausts the whole political system one powerful spirit of tyranny pervades them and men through habits of tyranny have scarcely a term to express freedom or honour in others where despotism is not so conspicuous corruption may supply its place in a system where besides the regular salaries of office sinecures and douceurs are held out corruption is inseparable a sinecure is sometimes an unequivocal and direct bargain and at others where no bargain is openly made it is secretly implied you are the property of your patron not indeed his beast but his dependent his political slave and whether your reward be money or honour it stands not in necessary connection with talents or virtues but is the price of your principles and of your influence to give directions would be unnecessary and tedious you must understand hints study the language of becks and nods utter such a word though you comprehend not its meaning perform such an action though convinced of its baseness an honest man perhaps would denominate such douceurs bribes and though possibly he would not call the receiver a villain he would scarcely consider him a good man the douceurs of government are not the only obstructions to independence considerations arising from rank learning religion political sentiment and country have their separate weight in different minds but the man who before he performs a beneficent action or exercises the tender affections must be first satisfied on these

confession of the injustice and absurdity of their system—the exordium to a course of lectures on the causes of the recent disturbances—commenced sept   d citizens i shall begin with observing that among other good effects lately produced by this practice of lecturing one of the most important is that a class of men tinctured very deeply with aristocratic prejudices have during this season very much frequented and greatly to their honour have very peaceably and quietly deported themselves in this room—for this i am perhaps indebted in no inconsiderable degree to the most virulent of all the ministerial newspapers for although the government i should say the clerks and ministers of government have prevented my advertisements from appearing in those papers yet the true briton kindly and generously favors me with a puff almost every day free of all charge and expence these men perhaps remember that they are very well paid by the treasury and may therefore afford to do a kind action for a sans culotte without reward but whether it be from these kind puffs oblique or from whatever circumstance that i am indebted for such attendance i know not but this i know which is more important—many persons have gone away from this place proselytes to the cause they came to ridicule and ashamed of the prejudices they had so hastily adopted there are others also it must be admitted who quit the room with denunciations and threats of vengeance and by anonymous letters testify their rancour and threaten me with the pillory newgate and the gibbet citizens i cannot pass over these absurd proclamations of the terror and apprehensions which these aristocrats seem to feel at the present political enquiry without enquiring why this anxiety to suppress meetings of this description my doctrines are peaceable i labour to prevent commotion not to promote it and it cannot be denied that the discussion of  0  political subjects is a constitutional right of britons and the unalienable right of man yet forsooth discussion must be crushed—enquiry must be prevented but how they can no longer hope assistance from the perjuries of their spies and informers conscious of the legality of my doctrines i am provided with a shorthand writer who can prove what i say and detect by accurate evidence the misstatements of these assassins and if it should please his majestys ministers that these lectures should be repeated in a court of justice and circulated through the country in reports of secret committees word for word it may be pointed out what are the dreadful doctrines delivered from this place but citizens there is a consistent want of policy in the conduct of these aristocrats what will you conceive when you hear what a dreadful alarm has lately been created through the village of chelsea by the libellous jacobinical words death or liberty written on the walls and gateways of that neighbourhood would you suppose that meetings of the churchwardens and overseers could be held on such an occasion and that a lady of quality—a titled lady strange degeneracy descended from one of those illustrious houses that have spilt their blood in the cause of liberty has occasioned a handbill to be stuck about offering £ 0 reward to whoever would discover the writer of these dreadful cabalistical and jacobinical words—it was not enough to send a lad to rub them out with denunciations in his mouth and a dishclout in his hand hoping that death would be the portion of the wretch who was bold enough to write so wicked an inscription no rewards and parish proclamations were to be issued to terrify the gaping multitude into the belief that even to talk of liberty was sedition and high treason citizens there was a time when death or liberty was the burthen of every britons song when it was thought that no man was a friend to the constitution or country of britain who was not ready to reverberate those sounds with an energy that proved them to come from his heart what then is the reason of this change is it the intention of aristocracy thus to libel the institution that sanctions their privileges is it their opinion that liberty and aristocracy are inconsistent with each other if it is i cannot wonder that a miserable system should be accompanied with such miserable fears—fears which every little noise can startle and every breath of wind fan into a flame  0  i will give you another instance of this—the man that kept the magpye in chelsea had in his house the model of a guillotine which had been exhibited about the town and particularly in the haymarket at the time when every exhibition and spectacle was encouraged by the alarmists that could excite the terrors and inflame the prejudices of the people this machine after having done its duty before the public was deposited as a security for a debt which the joiner was not able to pay in the hands of the publican it was accordingly put in a room seldom used and where of course this treasonable curiosity was seldom seen it happened however that some partycoloured birds that is to say some justices and parish officers dined at the magpye and the house being uncommonly full necessity induced the landlord to introduce the churchwardens overseers their worships and the whole lot of loyal etceteras into the room where the guillotine was placed the consternation and terror of this worshipful company at the sight of an instrument so tremendous is not to be described the poor landlord was denounced for a jacobin it was in vain that he told their enraged and terrified high mightinesses the occasion of his having the machine in his possession it was impossible to have such a thing in his house without some evil intention a suspicion was even suggested that when he wanted a fowl for his spit he made use of this implement of decapitation in order to bring his hand in and after a very tumultuous debate they insisted on his burning it before his own door but the master of the magpye not being such a jackdaw as to obey such a command they executed their vengeance on the next licensing day by taking away his licence citizens what can be the reason of these panics and alarms—frail indeed must be that loyalty which the exhibition of a guillotine can overturn frail indeed must be that constitution conscious indeed of their corruption must be its supporters if they feel themselves convinced that to support it they must be sheltered by darkness—they must shrink from every ray of enquiry what are not the sublime rhetorical flourishes of burke the metaphysical harangues of wyndham the flowing eloquence of pitt and the effrontery of dundas—are not all these combined in one harmonious concert of panegyric and assisted with the full chorus of all the authority power and wealth of the country potent enough to overwhelm the feeble voice of one unconnected individual—is  0  it necessary with such a combination united together to protect as they say to support our blessed and glorious constitution to impose coercive silence upon a solitary lecturer lest with two hours discourse per week he should talk down the venerable walls and massy pillars of this ancient edifice and outdoing sampson himself overthrow the lords of gaza and their temple together not by the strength of his muscles but his voice no citizens they know very well that whatever threatens the constitution of this country is to be looked for from another quarter it is the pillars of corruption not the pillars of the state that they are afraid should be shaken it is system it is the rotten boroughs—not the institutions of our ancestors they tremble for and perhaps they are wise having this system so much at heart to prevent enquiry as much as they possibly can for the moment the light of reason shines upon it its cumbrous deformities and ruinous defects will be evident and men will live under such a tottering pile of dangerous and disjointed fragments no more let me advise these very wise and very sapient rulers to examine the question a little further to think a little deeper let them consider the absurdity the extreme danger of attempting to crush the progress of political enquiry for it is the tendency of political enquiry to inform the mind and though you may keep the mind in ignorance unless you can also prevent the feelings of mankind from taking cognizance of wrongs you cannot prevent them from being impatient under those wrongs and when a people are at once impatient of their sufferings and ignorant of the means of obtaining redress violence commotion and desperate revenge are inevitable you may instance indeed the despotisms of asia or the subjugation of turkish slaves in opposition to this sentiment but the cases are essentially different the people of this country are not a herd of twolegged brutes with whom the divine rights of the scraglio or the cabinet constitute a part of their religion the spirit of this country is not yet broken down energy yet remains among us and courage and hardihood continue to be traits of the british character let reason then have fair play set wide open the portals of discussion and enquiry that this spirit may know the manner in which it ought to exert itself  0  on the causes of the late disturbances part the first including strictures on the opinion of lord bacon that the poverty and misery of the people is the principal source of seditions and troubles i now citizens proceed to illustrate the axiom that parliamentary corruption and ministerial ambition are the original sources of all the calamities and disturbances that afflict the nation i shall begin this subject with observing what appears to me to be an ample justification of this enquiry that violence is the twin brother of ignorance and that both are engendered by misery and nurtured by corruption in order to illustrate this let us consider awhile the nature of the late disturbances and recollect who are the men that have been engaged in them have they been the frequenters of political lecturers or the members of political associations—we know from facts the contrary reformers have proved themselves to be no rioters and we have seen by the melancholy occurrences at the old bailey a few days ago that the very men employed to support by coercion the present system of government are those among whom the unfortunate beings have been found who were foremost in expressing in an improper manner their detestation of certain practices of an oppressive nature and to express by violence and fury their impatience and sense of their wrongs i allude to the unfortunate drummer whose life it seems is to atone for the injuries he has committed against the peace of society a poor being actuated perhaps by an honest and laudable motive but unfortunately plunged so deep in ignorance as not to know the manner in which such motives ought to have directed him to act yet what is the conduct of the scribbling retainers of this coercive system—what is the conduct of those diurnal retailers of slander and defamation—which call themselves newspapers—as if falsehood and calumny could ever be new when corruption and injustice bear the sway—we find them anxiously and busily employed in base attempts to turn the attention of the people from the real sources of their grievances to the unfortunate agents and  0  traders who are suffering at least their share of all the miseries of the nation citizens if you persuade mankind that the miller the mealman the butcher the baker are the causes of the dearness of the necessaries of life what will be their conduct they will see the objects of their resentment at hand and these will become the victims of their mistaken rage but the fact is that it is not individuals—it is mistaken institutions false principles and the delusions of corruption that have reduced the great mass of the people to that melancholy situation into which they are plunged it is therefore not by disturbance not by violence but by reformation that these objects must be effected to this political melioration let us then direct our attention by a conduct opposite to this these disturbances these dispositions to violence have been considerably cherished and fermented by the advocates of the present administration nay a part of the system of some of these supporters seems to have been with what view it seems not difficult to divine to foment among the people a disposition to outrage witness the commotions at manchester at birmingham and other aristocratic parts of the country—commotions that were evidently excited and encouraged by those very individuals whose duty it was to protect the inhabitants in the peaceable possession of their opinions and property let us remember the very inadequate compensation that was given to that excellent experimental philosopher priestley who after all the labors of a wellspent life is driven to seek in transatlantic regions that asylum which the laws rather let me say those who have grasped the administration of the laws of this country would not afford him let us remember also that after citizen walker and citizen cooper had been attacked in their own housess by the lawless insolence of a churchandking banditti the only recompence they received was that one by a cruel combination of aristocratic intriguers was driven into banishment and the other on the evidence of a profligate wretch who confessed that he had been bribed to take away the life of this citizens man was accused of high treason and tried for a fictitious conspiracy can we wonder citizens if after this persons thus schooled in violence should change the object of their depredations can we wonder that there should be found those who were hardy enough to follow the precedent thus set them to the destruction of peace and order and that those who first  0  encouraged this spirit of turbulence should tremble at its effects i remember citizens at one of the meetings of the friends of the freedom of the press mr grey in a very animated manner described the absurd encouragement that had been given to people assembled in a tumultuous manner to burn the apostle of liberty thomas paine in effigy after having first carried the mock victim about the streets with a bladder of bullocks blood for a heart that they might prick it and give the surrounding spectators an idea of a fellowbeing bleeding to death beneath the assassinating fury of the multitude—i remember mr grey after describing the disgraceful scene exclaiming with a sort of prophetic feeling o weak and deluded men thus to stir up the malignant passions of a deluded multitude how will ye answer for the consequences how will ye be assured that in the revolutions which so rapidly take place in popular opinion the sanguinary dispositions ye are thus endeavouring to excite may not recoil upon yourselves perhaps the time may not be distant when those who have taught this lesson may be the victims to it and repent too late that turbulent malignity they have taken so much pains to encourage—if we turn our attention to the loyal town of birmingham shall we not find this prophecy is partly verified already having wreaked their vengeance on those who refused to think upon religious and political topics as they dictated they have now thought that they might do the same on those that did not choose to sell provisions at the price they demanded them—but it is not to one or two it is not to half a dozen places that these disturbances have been confined and we cannot but have reason to dread the dangerous consequences which may result to the peace and tranquillity of society from the still remaining seeds of these commotions—citizens if people are not to be shewn that reason is better than violence and peaceful enquiry better than turbulence and the sword however we may lament these delusions however sorry we may be to find that mankind cannot perceive that the calamities of a nation are not to be amended by pulling down a mill or gutting a crimpinghouse violence must be expected whenever popular distress prevails let us see then if there are no means to prevent these calamities if there is something in the state and policy of the country that can be proved to be the cause of these disturbances surely we ought to pity rather than abhor the  0  disturbers and to wish that instead of punishing these individuals we could find other means of removing the occasion of the evil finding as we must find that insurrections are never produced in any country without a gloomy and ferocious opinion having first been produced in the minds of the people that they have nothing to lose by their imprudent conduct let us then review the state of society and endeavour to develope the cause of the evil and then consider how we are to procure the remedy we shall soon find i believe that though coercion seems to be one of the readiest ways of correcting offences yet that it is never the best that bodies of men of whatever description who have been decimated by the arm of chastisement are not the better for such severity and that by such punishment we aggravate not remove the evil we wish to cure this is not a jacobinical sentiment citizens from the school of french philosophers it is a maxim laid down by one of the greatest philosophers of this country lord bacon of verulam who in his essays page    says neither doth it follow that because these fames are a sign of troubles that the suppressing of them with too much severity should be a remedy of troubles—citizens we have found that it is no remedy our gaols have been crowded and botany bay has been peopled with individuals who were ornaments to society and who have been subjected to cruel punishments for offences without a name and we have poor unfortunate beings languishing under cruel sentences upon charges of the most frivolous kind witness the heavy sentence passed upon poor watson for being proved to have sitten in the same box at an eatinghouse with a person whom a french emigrant spy swore to have delivered a handbill to him—and poor barrow a young man of education of parts and expectations not only now languishing in confinement but reduced to such misery by persecution and hard treatment as to depend for his support upon casual charity have their punishments so damped the rising spirit of the people as to lead us to expect that contentment and tranquillity are to be restored by such coercion if you want further illustration look to a neighbouring country take a short review of the state of ireland are coercion and punishment persecution and dragooning from this picture so devoutly to be wished  0  a conventional bill was passed to prevent the people of ireland from meeting peaceably together to seek a redress of grievances what was the consequence of this convention bill their own statement shall be my reply they tell you that plans of treason have grown up in secret holes and corners under the name of defenderism do you want a more conclusive argument that when you prevent the progress of reason and investigation you drive mankind to projects of violence and distraction which never else would have entered their heads when these lurking discontents then are afloat throw not the individual into the gloom of concealment and fear let him speak his griefs in the wide circle of society let him see the honest faces of his fellow beings and he will blush at the idea of harbouring intentions hostile to the peace and happiness of man he will be obliged to use his reason instead of attempting violence and thus by free open and manly investigation though a herd of venal ministers may be hurled from their seats yet peace happiness and virtue the fair fruits that ripen on the tree of enquiry will impart their chearing influence through the land but citizens this is not all severity will recoil on those who make use of it when you employ force and coercion the instruments of the system so unwisely adopted may do you more mischief than you dreaded even from those against whom these instruments were employed of this if report says true we have a very melancholy instance in the transactions that have taken place relative to the soldiery in cork soldiers were first enlisted for what is called the internal defence—that is to say to support the system of coercion at home and these it appears were afterwards obliged to embark on board certain vessels contrary to the terms on which they were enlisted to carry on the system of coercion abroad—to this the troops demurred the government became alarmed at the turbulence and threats of its own favourite agents and other soldiers were obliged to be poured into the city to coerce these instruments of coercion and compel them to embark what if report is to be trusted has been the consequence the very troops brought into cork to compel these soldiers to depart to a foreign country become the scourges of that city and its affrighted neighbourhood—and humanity shudders at the recapitulation of their excesses the morning post of yesterday states the circumstance i allude to in brief—that the most shocking atrocities have been committed rape pillage murder and every cruelty   0 are said to have been practised on the peaceable inhabitants this intelligence rests it seems upon the credit of the irish papers it has been detailed not only in the cork gazette but also in the hibernian journal and in the morning chronicle and telegraph they have given a much fuller account than i have stated the times have not been silent upon the subject they presume this day to contradict the report they gave yesterday and the briton just pretends to doubt it but it is scarcely possible that a paper printed in so small a city as cork where the inhabitant of one part could not long remain ignorant of what passes in another could have admitted so circumstantial an account as is there given if there were no truth in it be this as it will whether this part of the instance can be supported by good evidence or whether it cannot the general reasoning which is more to my purpose is not affected nothing can be more evident than that violence has a tendency to beget violence and that coercion is an instrument which like the flail is apt to recoil upon the heads of those who use it so that those who foster the system frequently in the end are the victims of the errors they have adopted let us then citizens wisely conclude that redress is better than punishment and that all pretended cures that do not eradicate the evil are in reality aggravations rather than remedies you stifle by quackery for a while the flame of disease but if the glowing embers remain behind it will burst out again and the relapse is more dangerous than the original distemper nay sometimes from mismanagement the doctor himself is the worst part of the disease so in political cases if there are existing grievances in the country if there are real calamities and those calamities are deeply seated in the corruptions which have stolen in and contaminated the vitals of its constitution let us be well assured that so long as you refuse to reform those abuses though gallowses should be erected in every street you only compel those whom you wish to coerce to make you still go on further in violence and coercion till at last your system becomes so odious in the eyes of mankind that humanity can tolerate it no longer lord bacon whom i quoted before has a very emphatic observation in the aforesaid essay which is very much to my purpose and therefore i quote it to you and some persons may perhaps be more disposed to pay attention to the maxim     when it is presented in the language of a philosopher of the sixteenth than in that of a political lecturer of the eighteenth century the surest way says he p  0 to prevent seditions if the times do bear it is to take away the matter of them for if there be fuel prepared it is hard to tell whence the spark shall come that shall set it on fire and to shew how unwise it is to trust to any of these imperfect and quack remedies whether of coercion or what not which produce a temporary suppression of these discontents without removing the causes of them he also very justly observes p    neither let any prince or state be secure concerning discontentments because they have been often or have been long and yet no peril hath ensued for as it is true that every vapour or fume doth not turn into a storm so it is nevertheless true that storms though they blow over divers times yet may fall at last and as the spanish proverb noteth well the cord breaketh at the last by the weakest pull let us then remember that if coercion had even been successful yet we ought to consider the sedition as stifled not as quelled and the very success of the system would be a sort of argument against its continuance if then it be only by removing the causes of discontents that seditions and troubles can be prevented let us proceed to enquire what these causes are in doing this i shall have to dwell in particular on the picture of the condition of the lower orders of society i shall then trace this misery to its immediate cause—the inadequate rewards of labour the scandalous disproportion between which and the prices of the necessaries of life i shall shew to be rendered still more calamitous to the common people by the decline of that system of liberality and hospitality which was once the boast of the english nobility and the great proprietors of the land ere every claim to liberality and real grandeur yielded to the inroads of corruption luxury and licentiousness i shall afterwards have occasion to take into consideration the national debt and the constantly increasing burthen of taxes—those fruits of the blessed system of corruption which it has lately been thought high treason to assail the disgraceful system of rotten boroughs will not pass without its share of animadversion in this discussion—a system which has done so much towards debauching the morals of every class of men from the most wealthy aristocrat who revels in luxurious splendor to the poorest peasant who toils like a slave in the fields to support the imperious grandeur that tramples him     in the dust—i shall then endeavour to point out the connexion between them and the tendency which all these causes have had to produce fermentation instead of tranquillity in the public mind i shall also endeavour to shew that if immediate reform do not remove the danger we are on the brink of calamities still more grievous—calamities from which i believe we have no other means to redeem ourselves than by promoting a thorough reform in the representation of the people and procuring a restoration of the popular right in the appointment of their respective agents of the constitution you will perceive at once that it is impossible i should go through the whole of this extensive subject in one night and it may be taken for granted that there will be considerable inequalities in the manner in which i shall handle the respective parts no man can periodically command that energy of mind and flow of spirits necessary to give full force and expression to the ideas he wishes to inculcate but from the mass of materials which i have collected i think i may venture to promise thus much—that each of the lectures into which i shall divide this subject will contain at least some facts not unworthy of your attention and which may tend to throw some degree of light on the subject i am treating i proceed then immediately to consider the part of the subject intended for the present evening namely the immediate cause of the existing disturbances—this immediate cause i believe we have found to be the distresses among the lower orders of the community for so according to the present system we are to regard those worthy and excellent members of the community the real pillars of the state by whose toil we are fed and by whose valour we are protected that the distresses and misery of the people are the principal causes that produce disturbances is a fact which has been discovered and laid down by the philosophers of elder times bacon in particular p  0 says that the matter of seditions is of two kinds—much poverty and much discontentment—please to observe that this is a little contrary to the maxims of modern aristocrats our drivers would persuade us that the only way to keep the labourer in proper subordination is to keep him poor and miserable to retain the wretched lowborn herd in a state of absolute vassalage is the only way say they to preserve the peace and they can only be so retained by penury and ignorance but how is this illustrated     by present experience it is long i believe very long since so general a disposition to turbulence has manifested itself among this common herd as they are called and yet it is equally long i believe since so large a portion of them went with hungry bellies for further illustration let us look again to ireland is not ireland according to ministerial accounts in a state yet more alarming and yet ireland is in still greater ignorance and misery than england in short if it were not for the extreme assurance with which these doctrines or arguments which in reality amount to these doctrines are frequently advanced by unfeeling greatness and its ruffian retainers they would not be worth the formality of refutation for if it is really true and i should suppose nothing less than a prime minister could have the blindness to doubt it that a tradesman would be better pleased with the government of the country when he is getting rich under its protection than when war and taxation are driving him to bankruptcy and his family to a workhouse how is it possible that the discontents of the people should be proportioned to the causes they have to be well contented and if these maxims of state so incessantly reiterated by pittites and burkites reevites and wyndhamites are indeed supported by the experience of mankind how came that foolish dreaming philosopher lord bacon to be held in such esteem and how comes it that in the midst of this general misery that devours us the people are so far from being the tame and complacent beings they are wished that english soldiers can no longer be trusted to keep englishmen in order—nor irish soldiers irishmen—nor scotch scots but that you must juggle and shuffle them together like a pack of cards in the hands of a swindling gamester in hopes that the knaves of one suit may knab the better cards of another but let us return to this sometimethought philosopher bacon this same foolish dreaming politician says essays p    and if this poverty and broken estate in the better sort be joined with a want and necessity in the mean people the danger is imminent and great for the rebellions of the belly are the worst—the rebellions of the belly the worst—strange delusion—why it should seem that this supposed philosopher bacon would not have been able to understand the sublime policy of reducing ten millions of people to the brink of famine in one country in order at once to pinch and wring all sedition out of their stomachs and effect the starvation of twentyfour millions more in another     again this same musty philosopher among other things seems as if he were bent upon the mad and foolish project of persuading ministers that it is dangerous to levy too much money upon the people by the imposition of taxes this part of his argument however if it ever had any weight must have less and less every year—less for example this than the last for though the demands have become so much greater yet there is reason to believe their actual levy will be somewhat less and if things go on in their present career i believe by and by we shall have no cause of complaint of this sort we shall pay no taxes at all having nothing left so pay them with for you know citizens i have frequently had occasion to shew you that however freely john bull may bleed and however patient an animal he may be he cannot possibly have more blood taken from his veins than there is in them bacon however goes on to observe that the causes and motions of sedition are innovation in religion—or he might have added political exclusions on account of religious opinions—taxes alterations of laws and customs such for instance as making truth a libel and argument high treason in open defiance of the flatute of the   th edward iii the only lew of treasons to which we ought to pay any attention the alterations of customs such as the introduction of systems of inquisition that fill every house with spies and every corner of the streets with informers and thus subjecting a once free people to the most detestable slavery of the worst parts of italy alterations of customs breaking of privileges general oppression advancement of unworthy persons—such for example as making a mere who wants me one of the principal ministers of state or a sleepyheaded booby of a lord who cannot say boo to a goose even when he sees his own shadow in a lookingglass first lord of the admiralty   at that damned board where yet he neer could learn   of ships the difference twixt the head and stern merely on account of family relationship to these causes bacon adds dearths disbanded soldiers and the like now citizens of the circumstances thus mentioned as causes of seditions troubles and insurrections a great part     at least appear to exist in this country at this time i think therefore if these axioms are all put together the conclusion will be that the way to restore peace to society is not to string men together by dozens who never saw each others faces in indictments for imaginary treasons—it is not to make popgun plots and gamecock seditions—it is not by these but by timely and radical reformation of existing abuses that peace and tranquillity are to be restored and though you may keep the common people ignorant of principles and the true means of redress by these coercive measures you cannot keep them ignorant of the extent of the evil inasmuch as relates to the misery they suffer it is a great mistake of ministers and aristocrats to suppose or pretend that seditious declaimers can make men believe they are miserable when in reality they are happy i should like for my part for the curiosity of it to hear the man whose eloquence could persuade a man who had just filled his belly that he was still very hungry or could convince the peasant who was half famished that there was no occasion for him to taste food—as for punishing seditious declaimers as they are called for pointing out the causes of the calamities which indeed is all that argument can do you might as well punish the physician for pointing out to his patient the causes of his disorder as if the discovery of the origin were in reality the creation of the disease a few disturbed imaginations may perhaps be agitated here and there—a few fantastic individuals may be found who will credit falsehoods because dressed in the garb of declamation but these are too few too flighty and too frivolous to give any rational alarm and i believe it is equally impossible for all the declaimers in the world to make the people believe they are miserable while they are living in ease and abundance as it is for all the eloquence of the treasury bench to convince them that they are happy and flourishing when they are in a state of absolute stravation but it is said that it is clear that these seditions proceed from mere infatuation and artful delusion because they always begin with the ignorant and common people who are evidently most easily played upon—hear what dr davenant says on this subject the common people are the first to complain of misgovernment and the first to feel the bad effects of it long wars are carried on at the expence of their blood heavy taxes pinch them most revenues are     mismanaged at their cost they soonest feel the decay of trade and the nations poverty pol works vol   p    this was the language of an honest member of parliament at the beginning of the reign of queen anne for then we sometimes had an honest member of parliament and though i believe there are many political errors in his writings yet they breathe this sort of conviction that the way really to enrich the country is not to throw all advantages into the hands of a few individuals but to make the majority comfortable and happy and that having thus laid the foundation of general prosperity you may then build your superstructure of national grandeur without fear of its tumbling into ruin do you want any evidence of the truth of the passage i have just quoted if you do let me appeal to the city of norwich that once flourishing mart of trade and manufacture the number of inhabitants is estimated at only  0000 and yet   000 of these have been obliged to claim relief from the hand of charity the poor rates are twelve or thirteen shillings in the pound remember it is upon the middling orders of society that the great burthen of this oppression falls it being very easily proved that in every large city the rich furnish a much smaller proportion of the maintenance of the poor than the middling orders because the rich live together in the same neighbourhoods while the poor and middling orders are huddled together and therefore the parishes in which the rich are not to be found are those in general which have the heaviest poors rate to pay but this rate heavy as it is is not the whole of the burthen there have been voluntary subscriptions also to a very large amount to afford charitable relief to the poor of this city but what is this which we call charity what is this ostentation of humanity which enrols our names in lists of subscription and builds palaces for the reception of our poor what do we do more after all than a partial act of justice what do we more to confess the fact in plain and simple terms than render in ostentation a pretended charity a part of that compensation to useful industry the whole of which we are called upon by justice to afford—it is the duty of every member of society to see that the laborious classes of mankind are enabled to maintain themselves in comfort and abundance by their labours and shame shame on that being who can call himself a man while wallowing himself in wealth and superfluity he suffers those from whose labour every thing is derived     to pine in abject penury and distress short of this all that we call charity is insult and even this is nothing more than justice i remember i was once talking to a friend of the charity and benevolence exhibited in this country when stopping me with a sarcastic sneer yes says he we steal the goose and we give back the giblets no said the third person who was standing by giblets are much too dainty for the common herd we give them only the pen feathers but norwich is not the only place in which this misery prevails in the parish of marylebone as i am informed by an inhabitant of that district seven hundred and fifty families no one of which ever received charity before were obliged to claim relief from the contributions set on foot there during one week in january last now if this is not an instance of growing misery and calamity i should be glad to know what is nor is the evil of a partial nature let any old man who has been used to view the state of society for years call to his recollection the very different appearance which the children of labourers and mechanics wear now from what they did in former times let me send you for example to the east end of the town—to the neighbourhood of spitalfields even in my short remembrance barefoot ragged children loitering about in that part of the town were very rare and i had some opportunities of observation having been in my boyish days intended for a trade connected with the manufacture carried on in that part of the town citizens this wretchedness is not confined to children only for to the honour of human nature be it spoken for one instance of an inhuman unfeeling parent you have at least ten who will debar themselves of the common necessaries of life that their children may have such comfort as their scanty lot will afford them i remember the time myself when a man who was a tolerable workman in the fields had generally besides the apartment in which he carried on his vocation a small summer house and a narrow slip of a garden at the outskirts of the town where he spent his monday either in flying his pidgeons or raising his tulips but those gardens are now fallen into decay the little summerhouse and the mondays recreation are no more and you will find the poor weavers and their families crowded together in vile filthy and unwholesome chambers destitute of the most common comforts     and even of the common necessaries of life this it is true is in part to be attributed to the caprices of fashion and the decline in the consumption of silk goods but it arises still more eminently from there being no set of men in the representative branch of the legislature who feel it their interest and particularly duty to look to the condition of the common people and preserve a just proportion between the price of their wages and the price of the necessaries of life they are languishing in misery want and distress but methinks i hear some great and mighty ruler or some friend of these great and mighty rulers demand what business have these wretches to make holiday every monday i answer just as much as those who put the question have to make holiday every day in the week—i know very well that there must be gradations in society but the more imperceptible those gradations the better and certainly i could wish to see none so low so lost in the depths of misery and oppression that no comfort or enjoyment is left to them even the consequence of their amelioration should be that none should be lifted so high as to be out of the reach of responsibility or justice i wish not to impress any ideas of equalizing property but i wish every man to feel that the blush of shame and conscious guilt should rise on his cheek when he wallows in luxury at the expence of those but for whose labour neither luxury nor abundance could exist citizens i shall not dwell upon details at this time nor delineate the pictures of misery i have witnessed let me employ the few minutes during which i shall detain you in removing from your minds some of those prejudices which are so frequently played upon in order to prevent the humane and benevolent from exerting themselves with generous enthusiasm in behalf of this oppressed and injured part of the community we are told forsooth that the miseries and calamities of the lower orders arise from their own untoward dispositions—that their profligacy drunkenness and luxury are such that amendment is impossible oh citizens citizens can this charge possibly be examined for a moment and be believed are you really so lost in prejudice as to suppose that there exists any difference between man and man but that which springs from the accident that lifts one on high and depresses another could the poor labourer have been put to his own free choice he would perhaps rather have been the offspring of some of those high and wealthy potentates who now look down upon him with contempt but he was born to a situation which made labour     necessary for his subsistence and if he has fallen upon times that make labour dishonourable—if he has fallen upon times when misery is the portion of the labourer these are his misfortunes not his faults citizens that there are particular vices which belong to the lower orders of society for the sake of argument i will for a moment admit but if it be so whence does it proceed does not the very statement point out their degradation and depression as the cause of these vices—remove then the cause and the effect will cease but this depravity it is said is constantly increasing and the present generation so loud in their cry for reform are more depraved as individuals than any that have gone before if it be really so—if we are really to consider the laborious classes of the present generation as more profligate than those of preceding ages let us ascribe the phenomenon to its real cause—to the corruption among those who direct the government of the country and the consequent increase of misery among the people and let us remember that this instead of an objection is an additional argument in favour of immediate reform but citizens let us compare these classes with the higher orders of society and i believe the labouring poor will find no occasion to blush at the comparison look first of all below you citizens and then look above nay look as high as you please cast your eyes to the very top of the ladder and tell me what reason you have to believe that those who stand upon the very highest spokes have any original advantages either of intellect or virtue over those who hold all safe at the bottom if no evidence of such original difference exist the immediate conclusion is that any subsequent difference if real must spring from the neglect and depression we are endeavouring to rectify and consequently that we ought to lend all our efforts heart and hand to prevent mankind from being thrust below as we now behold them let us then citizens disdain that narrowminded prejudice which first of all reduces men to misery and then reproaches them with crimes which that misery produced remember that it is our duty to promote the happiness of our fellow beings and to give them the opportunity of living in more comfort of receiving more information and that thus we shall improve at once their individual happiness and those moral feelings from which the happiness of others may be improved no man makes use of the argument i have just attempted to controvert but he thereby confesses that the only way to prevent mankind from being profligate and depraved   0 is to mend their condition in society and this amendment can i believe only be effected by a reformation of the political abuses that have crept into our constitution and restoring to the people their unalienable and constitutional rights of annual parliaments and universal suffrage the state coach the following article appeared in the morning chronicle   th sept it is not now

the   d december    0 and the turkish garrison who so nobly defended it and whose bravery merited a better fate were massacred in cold blood to the amount of upwards of thirty thousand men by the command of that trusty servant of the amiable catherine the renowned general suwarrow—the town was given up to the unrestrained fury of the russian soldiery and the most horrid outrages were perpetrated on the defenceless inhabitants by that hord of savages who took upwards of three days and nights to complete their work of cruelty and blood † of the storming of this place by the russian monsters and the horrible massacre that ensued some of the newspapers gave the following tragical account the suburbs of praga separated from warsaw by the vistula was defended by more than a hundred cannon disposed upon thirtythree batteries it was under the fire of this terrible artillery that general suwarrow made his troops mount to the assault in the same manner as he had done at the taking

without distinction of age sex or quality  this is literally true of the russian language as i am informed by a gentleman who resided many years in russia and who is well acquainted with the language
