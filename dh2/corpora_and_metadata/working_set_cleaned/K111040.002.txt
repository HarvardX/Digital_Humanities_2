new scene i proceed i got as far as chester but as it was winter the stage coach set out but once a week namely on monday and as i did not land till tuesday i had near a week to stay at an inn an expense my poor pocket could not well afford but providence sent me a timely relief for as i was sitting with my landlady by her kitchen fire a gentleman came in who knew me he was going to ireland and the wind proving contrary he was a fellow prisoner as i may call it with me and a very agreeable one he proved for he never permitted me to pay a farthing my landlady who was really a gentlewoman and he and i diverted away the time with ombre reading and prattling very tolerably and as the gentleman knew my misfortunes and had known all my family he very generously and not without many apologies gave me three guineas a very seasonable assistance thus we may see that each good the virtuous soul itself denies the watchful care of providence supplies by this i was enabled to travel i learned with great pleasure that a member of parliament and two gentlemen of the law had taken places in the coach and hoped for an agreeable journey but sadly disappointed i was for certainly three such brutes i never saw they affronted me every moment because i was born in ireland and i believe they had not the cholick for they made themselves very easy but the worst circumstance of all was that they used to sit up drinking all night and forced me to pay my club for their wine though i never even saw it  they were great walpolians and many a trick in the elections did they relate before me taking it for granted that i was a fool at last they very civilly demanded of me what business i had to london so resolving to divert myself i told them i was going there in hopes sir robert would marry me this made them very merry they laughed at my folly and i at theirs at length we picked up a welsh parson of whom i had the honor of making a conquest which afforded us great entertainment for about fifty miles i always permitted him to pay my club but like a true levite he began to offer a little more of his civility than i was willing to accept of so finding that would not do he made me a present of a gingerbreadnut curiously wrapped up in white paper and after making me give him a promise to write to him he left us  as my fellowtravellers had observed his amorous behavior and saw him deliver his present they earnestly requested to know what it was so to oblige them i showed it when we came to st albans we were met by a gentleman in a coach and six whom they styled the great mr mid  ton of chirkcastle in denbighshire who was related to them all so they went into his coach and i got two female companions however we all baited at the same inn at barnet and this prodigious man insisted on having the ladies for his guests and laying hold of my hand he swore that little hibernian nymph should dine with him so up stairs we all went where he entertained us with an account of his ample estate saying it was much larger than the duke of bedfords but how unworthy he was to possess it the sequel will show  my adventures with the welsh parson made him laugh very heartily and he insisted on my keeping my promise in writing to him assuring me he would take care the letter should go safe so by way of amusement i scribbled as follows sir your gingerbread unbroken remains a true love token  i am assured by your honorable countrymen that you pass for a wit in wales it is therefore my sincere advice to you never to quit it lest the rest of the world should be malicious enough to refuse you your due praise as for the favor you offered to me why you offered it like a priest and i refused it like a fool if you write to me direct to the right honorable the lady w  lp  le in downingstreet westminster i will endeavor to prevail on my spouse elect to send you a fiddle and a hogshead of good october to entertain your parishioners every sunday  i am sweet sir crape yours     mr mid  ton said he thought i could read men as well as sir robert but now came the reckoning when the feast was over the dreadful reckoning and we smiled no more for our grandee made us pay our club it is true indeed he writ something to make me amends which was this my charmer if you will leave a line for me at brownjohns coffeehouse in ormond street and give me a direction where to find you you shall find a friend in  j m  n     but really i never did so we parted and i never saw him more the sample he had given of the narrowness of his heart was sufficient to disgust me and though i am not fond of making national reflections yet i would of all things never trust a welchman lest as falstaff says of the welsh fairy he should transform me into a piece of toasted cheese  at length i got to london where after having paid all demands i had three guineas left with which the next day i took a lodging in berrystreet st jamess  i wrote to ireland to no purpose it seemed for i never got any answer so in a very short time i was in great distress and knew not what to do having heard mr ed  d w  p  le was a very humane gentleman i wrote to him and he sent me a letter in return wherein he promised to wait on me the next evening and accordingly came nay and sat with me three hours at the end of which time he told me he did not know how he could possibly be of any service to me i told him i had some poems which i intended to print by subscription and if he would do me the honor of promoting it it was all the favor i desired  he answered if he undertook it he should certainly neglect it but however he would give me some money so he pulled out his purse and took out five guineas would not any person have then thought themselves sure of them but according to the old proverb many a thing falls out between the lip and the cup the gentleman took a second thought and put the guineas in his purse again assuring me it was not convenient for him to part with them  and indeed i believe he is a beast without a heart for this is his constant answer to every person as i have frequently observed when those whom he chose for friends and companions wanted but the smallest assistance from him so he for poets open table kept but never considered where they slept himself as rich as fifty jews was easy though they wanted shoes swift  on this i arose and told him as i perceived it was not in his inclination to do me any service i would no longer take up his important time and civilly dismissed him  mr dodsley ventured to print the trial of constancy by which i got about five guineas and a much greater happiness the favor and friendship of the poet laureat i was advised to enclose one of them to him which i did in as genteel a letter as i knew how to write the good gentleman came to visit me and did me every act of friendship in his power it is to his unwearied zeal in my behalf that i owe that i yet live to thank him for had i not been by him supplied i must a thousand times have died   i must not here omit that when the poem was published i enclosed two of them to mr w  lp  le who wrote me a letter of thanks and that was all mem he owes me two shillings  as i wanted to make interest with the great i took a lodging in st jamess street exactly opposite to whites chocolatehouse where happening to see capt meade go in i wrote over to him and he was so kind to give me an invitation to his house which was within a small mile from hampton court a delightful walk through bushypark leading to it this saved me a great deal of expense for as the parliament was now broke up london was quite empty and mr cibber being gone to tunbridge i could not till the return of winter hope to gain any subscribers so i went into the country with great pleasure  the captain had a very sweet dwelling a pretty wife and four lovely children we went to church the following sunday dr hales was minister of the parish and it was customary with him whenever he saw a stranger in his congregation to pay them a visit so after evening prayer we were honored with his company capt meade told him i was his sister parson and sister writer a merry sort of an introduction the doctor asked me what i wrote and the captain answered for me that i was going to publish a volume of poems by subscription i told the doctor my writings might amuse but his made the world the wiser and the better as i had had the pleasure of reading them i turned the discourse to natural philosphy on which the doctor gave us an invitation to a course of experiments the next day though nothing i then saw was new to me yet his reflections on every object were as by them he demonstrated the divinity and wrapped in holy ecstasy he soared above this little terrene spot and like a true high priest led his auditors up to the holiest of holies  after this sacred banquet with which my soul was so elevated that i could not avoid paying him my acknowledgments in i believe an enthusiastic strain we walked into the garden where we were entertained with some fine fruit cream wine etc a rural collation  the doctor asked me if i had any printed proposals for my poems to which he promised not only to subscribe himself but also to use his interest for me i told him i had and that i would give him some when i came to prayers the next morning  but i could not sleep all night so at daybreak i arose and walked into bushypark i sat down by the side of a fine cascade and listened to the tunefullyfallling waters so long that methought they became vocal and uttered articulate sounds till lulled by them i fell insensibly asleep when suddenly i imagined the waternymph to whom this spring belonged arose before me with a lovely countenance and a transparent azure robe and putting a paper into my hand disappeared i thought i read it and as i presently awoke i remembered all the lines so having a pencil and sheet of paper in my pocket i wrote them down to the reverend dr hales hail holy sage whose comprehensive mind not to this narrow spot of earth confined through numerous worlds can natures laws explore where none but newton ever trod before and guided by philosophy divine see through his works the almighty maker shine whether you trace him through yon rolling spheres where crowned with boundless glory he appears or in the orient suns resplendent rays his setting luster or his noontide blaze new wonders still thy curious search attend begun on earth in highest heaven to end o while thou do those godlike works pursue what thanks from humankind to thee are due whose error doubt and darkness you remove and charm down knowledge from her throne above nature to thee her choicest secrets yields unlocks her springs and opens all her fields shows the rich treasure that her breast contains in azure fountains or enameled plains each healing stream each plant of virtuous use to thee their medicinal powers produce pining disease and anguish wing their flight and rosy health renews us to delight when you with art the animal dissect and with the microscopic aid inspect where from the heart unnumberd rivers glide and faithful back return their purple tide how fine the mechanism by thee displayed how wonderful is every creature made vessels too small for sight the fluids strain concoct digest assimilate sustain in deep attention and surprise we gaze and to lifes author raptured pour out praise what beauties do thou open to the sight untwisting all the golden threads of light each parent color tracing to its source distinct they live obedient to thy force naught from thy penetration is concealed and light himself shines to thy soul revealed so when the sacred writings you display and on the mental eye shed purer day in radiant colors truth arrayed we see confess her charms and guided up by thee soaring sublime on contemplations wings the fountain seek whence truth eternal springs fain would i wake the consecrated lyre and sing the sentiments thou did inspire but find my strength unequal to a theme which asks a miltons or a seraphs flame if through weak words one ray of reason shine thine was the thought the errors only mine yet may these numbers to thy soul impart the humble incense of a grateful heart trifles with god himself acceptance find if offered with sincerity of mind then like the deity indulgence show thou most like him of all his works below   after this pleasing reverie i returned home and had sufficient time to transcribe the lines fair and dress myself ere the bell rung for morning prayer as we were coming out of church i gave the poem and some proposals made up in a packet to the doctor who came in the evening to visit us and brought another clergyman with him who was the minister of henley upon thames they both subscribed to me and took a good many of the proposals which they disposed of to persons of distinction  so having got a little money and capt meade being commanded on duty to the tower for six months we all came to london where finding my lodging empty i once more returned to st jamess  my good friend mr cibber was my first visitor he had got about four guineas for me and told me he was assured by a gentleman of ireland who frequented whites that my husband was a poet and that all i had to publish were only some trifles i had stolen from him which had greatly injured me but said he to set that right you must take some subject that has never yet been touched upon dress it poetically and send the lines to whites this was really a hard task but as my credit was now at stake i was obliged to exert myself and the next day sent him the following lines to mr cibber when you advised me sir to choose some odd new subject for the muse from thought to thought unpleasd i changed through nature art and science ranged yet still could naught discover new till happily i fixed on you your stoic turn and cheerful mind have marked you out of all mankind the oddest theme my muse can find like other men you nothing do the worlds one round of joy to you the wise the weak the sot the sage your hours can equally engage though sense and merit are your choice you can with gayest fops rejoice can taste them all in season fit and match their follies or their wit truth has in you so fixed her seat not all your converse with the great has yet misled you to deceit your breast so bare so free from blame why sure your heart and tongues the same most hearts the harder grow with years but yours yet lends the afflicted tears has merit pined in want and grief your bounteous hand has brought relief to you where frailty shades the soul one shining grace commends the whole can no experience make you wiser nor age convert you to a miser new too in other points i find you where modern wits are thrown behind you some praise a patton and reveal him you paint so true you cannot conceal him their gaudy praise undue but shames him while yours by likeness only names him not wit that libels makes you grave at what you smile my sense would rave while jealous bards by dunces stung with verse provoked avenged the wrong with an uncommon candor you such bards more humanely subdue calm and composed your conscious spirit can celebrate with praise their merit thus yielding conquer for sure nature must feel such praise sting worse than satyr still am i warmed to sing your oddness your singularity in goodness when to the wealthy and the great adorned with honors and estate my muse forlorn has sent her prayer shunned were the accents of despair till your excited pity sped her and with collected bounties fed her cheered her sad thoughts like genial spring and tuned once more her voice to sing bear then her grateful notes and be yourself her theme and harmony could she like yours exalt her lays polite artificer of praise from the sweet song you would jealous grow and guard the laurel on your brow if which i know these facts are true confess at least the verse is new that publicly speaks well of you   this met with a very favorable reception and mr cibber showed it to all the noblemen at whites as a means to engage them to subscribe to me which to oblige him many of them did and to make it public mr cibber inserted it in a pamphlet of his own called the egotist or colley upon cibber  the next day a pleasant droll gentleman who was so old that he had been page to king james when he was duke of york insisted on mr cibbers introducing him to me which accordingly he did this gentleman who was a colonel in the first regiment of foot guards had by nature all that education gives to others neither had his years in the least deprest the vivacity or gallantry of his spirit he said a thousand witty things in half an hour and at last with as great gravity as his comic face would admit of said that he wished i would take him into keeping i answered i had really never seen any person with whom i was better entertained and therefore if he would make over all his real and personal estate to me and dispose of his regiment and give me the money i would keep him  out of it he swore a good oath he believed me and liked me for my sincerity  i could relate a number of pleasant stories of this old gentleman but as his wit generally bordered on indecency and sometimes on profaneness they are not proper for a female pen  he used to hire me to write love letters to him which as a proof of his being a young man he showed at whites lord w  m  th was curious to see the writer upon which he brought his lordship and lord aug  stus f  tz r  y since dead to visit me they bantered me on my taste in writing so many fine things to an old fellow when so many young ones themselves in particular would be proud of them  i assured their lordships i would oblige them on the same terms i did the colonel who always paid me handsomely for my compliments  this turned all their raillery on the colonel who with great good humor confessed the truth why colonel said lord f  z r  y you told us you supported this lady  ay returned he but you know i am an old liar  the noblemen insisted on my telling them how much a piece the colonel gave me for writing billetdoux to him the colonel answered that his money had been fatal to my family for that he had lent my uncle colonel mead twenty guineas one night at the groom porters who died the next morning of an apoplectic fit and so said he out of pure affection to my dear little one here i am very cautious how i give her any besides added he very archly i could not be convinced of the sincerity of her passion for me if she made any demands on my pocket  lord w  m  th asked me how i approved of this doctrine i answered the colonel had so genteel and witty a manner of excusing his avarice that should he ever grow generous we should lose a thousand pleasantries  each of the noblemen gave me a guinea by way of subscription to my poems they pressed hard on the colonel for his contribution which for the reasons aforesaid he absolutely refused  this gave occasion to the following lines which lest the colonel should not communicate i enclosed to lord f  zr  y to the hon colonel d  nc  be since so often to the great of my favors you boast when you know you enjoyed but some kisses at most and those as you say never ought to be sold for loves too divine to be bartered for gold since this is your maxim i beg a receipt to know how without it a lover can eat for though the fine heroes we read in romances subsisted whole weeks upon amorous fancies and yet were so strong if those writers say true that dragons and giants some thousands they slew those chiefs were of origin surely divine and descended from jove as direct as a line but in our corrupted degenerate days we find neither heroes nor lovers like these our men have scarce courage to speak to a lass till they have had a full meal and a chirrupping glass and so much in myself of the mortal i find that my body wants diet as well as my mind now pray sir consider the case of your mistress who neither can kiss nor write verses in distress for bacchus and ceres we frequently prove are friends to the muses as well as to love   lord a  stus did not fail to show the lines to all the noblemen at whites who heartily bantered the colonel on his generosity to his mistress  the next day as i was sprinkling some flowerpots which stood on very broad leads under the dining room window colonel d  nc  be the duke of b  lt  n and the earl of w  nch  ea stood filling out wine and drinking to me so i took up the pen and ink full in their view and as i was not acquainted with any of them except the colonel i sent over to him these lines your rosy wine looks bright and fine but yet it does not cheer me the cause i guess is surely this the bottle is not near me you show that sight to give delight if i may truly judge ye but would ye move my wit or love i beg sir i may pledge ye   lord w  nch  ea bid the colonel send me all the wine in the house ah said the colonel that might injure her health but i will send her one bottle of burgundy to cheer her spirits accordingly the waiter brought it the noblemen all gathered to the window so he filled me out a glass which making them a low reverence i drank and retired  but the colonel resolving to have share quickly followed his bottle he came in a desperate ill temper cursed the k  g d  of c  l  d the whole m  y and me into the bargain i asked him whether giving me a bottle of wine had grieved him so much he said no but that he had been fifty years in the army and was but lieutenant colonel and that the d  of c  l  d had put a young fellow over his head he pulled down his stocking and showed me where he had been shot through the leg at the siege of lisle then he opened his bosom on which he had several honorable scars and swore heartily that were it not in a time of war he would throw up his commission i could not but agree that his resentment had but too just a foundation but dear sir i had no hand in all this no said he but i did not know any person to whom i could speak my mind freely or who would bear my peevishness but you well sir said i an you were as peevish as an emperor i will bear it all since you please to bestow it on me  but i believe we had as good drink our burgundy and we will new model the government according to our fancies he sat very pensive said his head aked then rose in a surly sort of a manner and went over to whites  whether any thing he had met with there pleased him i know not but about nine at night as i sat writing i heard his voice on the stairs crying poke after me my lord poke after me so i bid my maid light the colonel up he brought with him his grace of m  lb  gh a lovely gentleman he presented him to me by his title which was honored by his wearing it the d  saluted me but what shall i now say i think my boasted constancy of mind quite forsook me i trembled at his touch and though i knew not why was more disordered at sight of him than ever i had been before in my life the colonel asked me what was the matter i said i believed i had drank too much tea which joined to the unexpected honor he had now conferred on me put me into a little flutter  his grace laid hold of my hand and kissed it saying it was the sweetest thing in nature to put a lady into a little hurry of spirits and so said he colonel i shall meet you at whites either tonight or tomorrow morning for i have a mind to have a little chat with this lady alone the colonel knew his duty too well to disobey a m  lb  gh and left us wishing his grace success  now indeed for the first time i was afraid of myself but was infinitely more so when his grace told me he had learned from the colonel that i was in some distress and opening his pocketbook presented me with a bank note on sir francis child for fifty pounds  this was the ordeal or fiery trial youth beauty nobility of birth and unsought generosity attacking at once the most desolate person in the world his grace i believe guessed at my apprehensions by the concern which was but too visible in my countenance and generously assured me that he was above making any hard conditions that i might look up with cheerfulness and not rivet my eyes to the floor but consider him as a sincere and disinterested friend  this quite revived me and gave me an unusual flow of spirits which highly pleased my illustrious benefactor he desired i would write something merry to the colonel who at his departure charged me not to wrong his bed so to please his grace and also to convince him i could write i gave him in about ten minutes the following lines strephon tonight his chloe told he had the headache and grew old though well she knew her artful swain but counterfeited age and pain to hide his cold declining passion his want of love and inclination for chloes face so often seen put her poor strephon in the spleen nor could her wit or neatness please him or all her smiles or prattle raise him he left the pensive nymph alone his painful absence to bemoan strephon beware lest in return with a new flame your chloe burn consider i have sp  n  r seen and quickly lay aside your spleen or by the god of verse i vow with antlers i will adorn your brow no city knight shall boast a pair more large more branching or more fair their horns are gilt but yours shall be as naked as a blasted tree so sir no more of your deception for i am blessed with quick perception phoebus has given me piercing eyes to look through falsehood and disguise then lay aside this little art i have and i will keep your heart   his grace was very well pleased with my gaity and undertook to deliver the letter himself so we parted each of us i believe satisfied with ourselves and our own conduct  i know at least i was for upon calling my heart to account for the trouble it had given me i found by the symptoms there was something very like love had seized it  the colonel came in the morning and brought with him mr tr  v  r brother to the d  ss of m  lb  gh whom he introduced to me and then merrily asked me if i was going to reward his constant tender flame with a great staring pair of horns i told him he deserved them for his ill temper but however as he made me full amends by the honor of making me known to so great and good a man as he had recommended me to i would take some time to consider of the matter  mr tr  v  r desired to know which of the sp  n  rs it was i threatened the colonel with i told him i wrote any thing by way of amusement but either of them would serve my turn  the colonel called me a merry madcap mr tr  v  r assured me he was at my service and would hornisy the colonel whenever i pleased i told him i was obliged to him for his kind offer and would certainly apply to him if i found myself in any distress and in the mean time i hoped as an earnest of his future favor he would be so kind as to subscribe to my poems which accordingly he did  my readers may now imagine i was in a fair way of growing rich but indeed it was far otherwise as i paid a guinea a week for my lodging kept a servant was under a necessity of being always dressed and had besides so many distressed persons of my own country who did me the honor to take a dinner with me and in return for my easiness said every thing of me which they thought could injure or expose me that being naturally liberal and till i heartily suffered for my folly no very great oeconomist i rather ran out than saved  and as i have thrown some sort of reflection on the english i must beg leave to be equally free with my own country folks take notice i except the nobility and gentry of each kingdom who i really believe in honor valor or generosity of spirit are not be matched in any part of the habitable globe yet partial as i may be to my native country the english and irish seem to have different characteristics the lower part of the people of england are blunt and honest the lower part of the people of ireland civil and deceitful nor did i ever suffer in england either in point of fortune or reputation but either by the thefts or the tongues of the irish  my landlady came up one morning very cheerful and told me her daughters husband dr t  rn  ll who had not been to see her for two years on account of some difference they had told her he would as he was to preach at st jamess chapel next day being one of the chaplains to his royal highness the prince of wales take up his lodging in her house that night i congratulated hereupon it but observing by her looks that she was under some uneasiness i asked her the cause of it after some hesitation and a number of apologies she told me she had no accommodation for him but by giving him her own bed and begged i would for a night give her leave to sleep with me and my maid to which i readily consented but recollecting what a miserable bed she had in a dark closet very unfit for a gentleman to lie in i told her i would with great pleasure leave my apartment for the doctor which was as may be presumed by the price a genteel one and for a night take up my residence with her she seemed overjoyed at the proposal and as i had some little trifle to buy i went out and did not return till about six in the evening so not meeting any body in the way below stairs i went up to my own apartment where i found the doctor reading and the old gentlewoman fast asleep  i begged pardon for my intrusion and the old dame told him how much he was indebted to my complaisance in quitting my apartment to oblige him with it i could have wished she had been silent in this particular for as she had not apprized him of it before he was too polite to suffer it nor could any entreaties of mine prevail on him to accept my offer  presently after being gone down stairs he sent his compliments up and begged i would lend him a book to amuse himself till bedtime so being willing to cultivate the good opinion he seemed to have conceived of me i sent him my own poems in manuscript which pardon my vanity did not fail to confirm it  the next day which was sunday as soon as afternoon service was over he very kindly paid me a visit and seemed so well pleased with my prattle that it was midnight before either of us thought of repose but i do assure my readers his motherinlaw kept us company  he entertained me with an account of whatever he had met with curious in his travels his remarks on every subject were delivered with modesty and judgment in a flowing and elegant style he was so kind to promise me the favor of taking a dish of coffee with me in the morning which produced a merry adventure  the noblemen at whites having heard that i was married to a clergyman and seeing one walking to and fro in my dining room supposed it must be the very identical parson and that he was come to make up matters with me so none of them would venture over lest it should incur his displeasure against me but colonel d  nc  be whose curiosity was up resolved at a distance to reconnoitre the ground and bring them a faithful account of the enemys situation for so he styled the parson  there was a very grand milliners shop next door to my lodging from whence i received a message that a lady just come from ireland desired to speak with me upon which i immediately went full of hope to receive some account of my children i there found the colonel who told me he was the lady and with his usual gaity added that if i questioned his sex i need but permit him to be my bedfellow for a week and i should never know any thing to the contrary  i answered i really believed him inasmuch as i had known a gentleman young enough to be his grandson who had lived with me in all the peacable innocence of a man of threescore like a civil careless husband as he was  as the colonel was acquainted with my history he laughed heartily and said he must be some damned parson for nobody said he but one belonging to the church could have had half that continency but my dear little one for that was the name he always called me i have some news to tell you i desire you may brush up your countenance your fire and yourself because you are likely to have some very grand visitors tomorrow no less than mr st  h  e the earl of w  nch  ea and his brother mr f  ch  the colonel then told me the reason of his sending for me in that manner was that he had observed a pason walking in my room and asked who it was i told him it was dr t  bull no way related to me  as this adventure with the clergyman afforded great matter of diversion at whites i cannot help here relating another i was in very great distress and was advised to apply to the then lord archbishop of york now by the grace of god lord archbishop of canterbury i say by the grace of god because i believe he never was yet excelled by any of the primitive bishops a person in whom the beauty of holiness fully appears i went to his house in kensingtonsquare and to my infinite surprise had free access to his grace without even a question being asked i presented him with the following lines  this poem was written just at the beginning of the rebellion in which his grace like a true son of the church militant had nobly taken up arms in the defense of liberty property and the protestant religion  having been obliged to the right honorable henry pelham i thought it not improper to include two such great and eminent persons in one poem which was as follows to his grace the lord archbishop of york as god who now does as in times of old his high behests to righteous men unfold and from thick mists purging the visual ray beams on his chosen sons celestial day late to the pious prelate york revealed what from the sons of belial lay concealed the many flown with insolence and wine unfit such ears to hear of things divine behold oh chosen messenger of grace said god the wickedness of human race britain behold my oncelovd favorite isle lo all

withstand see him like nile diffusing bounty round to bless a barren an ungrateful ground through various channels pleasure to impart to raise the fallen to cheer the dying heart too often alas in the translucent wave do crocodiles and wily serpents lave studious to poison the delightful stream which unpollute flows on  and mindful whence it came conscious of thee it is sacred hidden source to reunite thy bounty bends it is force wisely thou speak the living lord replied nor be thou righteous advocate denied superior worth arrests the lifted rod so dear is virtue in the sight of god nor will i vengeance on the guilty take but england spare for york and pelhams sake   i told the servant when i delivered them it was not a petition he said if it were his grace never refused one and showed me into a handsome drawing room in a few minutes his grace entered with a sweet and placid air but looked so young that i never once imagined him to be the archbishop having joined the associate idea of wrinkles avarice and pride to that title  in which i found myself happily for once mistaken as it was early in the morning he said he was sure i had not breakfasted and bid one of the servants bring some tea and desire his cousin to come and keep the lady company as it was near half an hour before i saw her his grace asked me who i was i answered which was truth i was a gentlemans daughter of the kingdom of ireland that i had when i was very young been married to a clergyman that i had three children living his grace taking it for granted that i was a widow which mistake it was by no means my interest to clear up demanded of me what i had to support us i answered nothing but poetry he said that was a pity because let it be ever so excellent genius was seldom rewarded or encouraged i very gayly repeated the deans lines what hope of custom in the fair when not a soul demands the ware when you have nothing to produce for private life or public use swifts rhapsody his grace could not avoid smiling as he plainly perceived by the cheerfulness and freedom of my behavior and by my only saying sir to him that i was ignorant of his dignity but the entrance of his relation a wellbred lady of about fifty years of age who as his grace is a bachelor managed his domestic affairs threw me into inconceivable confusion as i then plainly perceived i had been very familiarly chatting with so great a man  i made my apology in the best manner i could and as he was truly sensible that i neither intended or meant disrespect to him he easily pardoned me but as we drank tea said he wished my mistake had but continued a little longer that he might have had the pleasure of hearing me unawed and uncontrolled i own i was quite abashed at so odd a circumstance for while i imagined his grace to be perhaps a chaplain to the lord archbishop of york i said any thing without reserve but of a sudden found my spirits fail which brought shakespeares lines into my mind and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony general ceremony and what are thou thou idol ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers what are thy rents what are thy comings in oh ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating fear and awe in other men wherein thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing thee his grace was so humane to make me a handsome present at my departure and assured me he would always be a friend to me  however i did not make a second application to him till such time as the royal bounty is to be petitioned for is at christmas though it is not distributed till easter as i knew at that season of the year it was impossible for me to be at kensington ever his grace would be at westminster i waited at the door of the robingroom till i was almost frozen holding a petition enclosed in a letter in my hand a gentleman who is doorkeeper to the house of lords taking compassion on me told me i had better come into the lobby an offer i readily accepted of and sat down in a window there were several noblemen most of whom knew me by sight walking in it as the house was not yet met the first prelate who entered was the lord bishop of norwich a venerable gentleman whose graceful gray hairs the hand of time had silvered as he past by i made him a courtesy on which he stopped and with great civility asked me if that letter was for him i answered it was for his grace of york on which he very kindly wished me success his grace next entered and with his wonted goodness asked me where i had been adding that it had been a great loss to me that he did not know where to find me and accepting of my letter said he hoped i had there given him a proper direction so bowing as fast as i courtesied he went to take his seat at the right hand of that power he had so nobly supported and no doubt will at the last great day having truly approved himself christs faithful soldier and champion fighting under the sacred banners of the captain of his salvation hear those comfortable words well done thou good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy lord  as the earl of ch  ster  ld heard every word his grace spoke to me he made himself very merry at whites telling mr cibber and colonel d  nc  be that i was true to the gown and delivered a billetdoux to the handsomest politest and bravest prelate in europe that i had given him a direction where to find me and highly applauded my choice  but no virtue is above the reach of a little pleasant raillery and as some of the noblemen demanded an explanation of this affair i with my usual sincerity told them the truth on which they all agreed in praising his beneficence and affability and the handsome manner in which he bestowed his bounties  i hope if these memoirs should ever fall into his graces hands who is an universal reader he will pardon me for using his name which i shall never do but with the utmost respect and gratitude  as i had imagined his grace to be lord high almoner i addressed him as such and waited on him again at westminster his grace told me the b  p of s  y had been so kind to accept of my petition and that i must wait on him the next morning at his house in the temple so accordingly i went in full spirits imagining on the recommendation of so excellent a person i should both have a civil reception and also my desire answered  it snowed very fast and i knocked several times ever i could gain admission at length an old porter ventured to turn the unoiled hinges a little which grated very harshly and seemed to partake of the spirit of their unhospitable master who according to my countrymans bull opened the door to keep the people out for this was fully verified here he asked me what i knocked so often for and being i suppose doubtful that i might steal one of the oak chairs in the hall shut it again in my face the inclemency of the air and the vexation of my mind made me give a thundering rap the door was once more opened and i assured the porter if he would be so kind as to deliver that letter for me to his lord to whom i was recommended by his grace of york i would give him half a crown which promise of a perquisite softened him into consent for as mr gay observes this reason with all is prevailing   he took the letter into the parlour when presently an old man with a most unprelatical countenance for it was full of carbunckles and knobs and flames of fire came out with my letter in his hand and with an imperious voice demanded of me whether i wrote it as the times were full of violence and blood it being as i observed at the beginning of the late rebellion i stood confounded and knew not what answer to make which he observing asked me was my name meade to which answering in the affirmative he cried you are a foreigner and we have beggars enough of our own no my lord returned i i was born in ireland which is not a foreign country but equally a part of his majestys dominions with great britain why said he very politely you lie but as you say you are in distress there is half a crown for you i thanked his lordship and turning to the porter told him as i had given him some trouble i hoped he would accept of that part of the royal bounty which had been promised to me his lordship was pleased to tell me i was a saucy proud impertinent person which having neither any farther hopes or fears about him i little regarded  all the way home as cold as it was and as much vexed as i was at the old br  tes behavior i could not avoid laughing at his odd figure so much resembling that of the spanish friar where his great belly swaggered in state before him and his little gouty legs came limping after oh he is a huge tun of divinity and were he any way given to holiness i would swear by his face my oath should be by this fire but he is indeed but for the fire in his face the son of utter darkness oh he is a perpetual triumph an everlasting bonsire  then again i thought of dr swifts lines g  d d  n me they bid us reform and repent but z  ds by their looks they never keep lent   i hope the reader will pardon me for inserting oaths as i have so great an authority to quote for them  as the parliament did not sit during the holydays i waited on his grace of york who immediately gave me audience he asked me what success i had with the lord almoner and as i had sped mavelous illfavouredly i related every circumstance as near as i could remember of our conversation one in particular which i before omitted and was that he said would the lord archbishop of york speak to you woman his grace smiled and said it was the first time he ever learned it was beneath the dignity of a bishop to speak even to a beggar as humliity was their best ornament  well what more not much my lord only he demanded if i knew no other person besides your grace to recommend me to him and as i really was convinced i had brought him my credentials from the highest i did not use any other name by this time the lady beforementioned came to breakfast and i was obliged to relate the story to her they both laughed  and his grace assured me the b  p of s  y was a very honest man  i told him i did not suspect him to be a pickpocket but that i looked on that to be but a very moderate praise where every other social and christian virtue was required he said i made nice distinctions but he himself would take care of the affair and so he put a couple of guineas into my hand on which i said god almighty bless your grace which again made him smile and myself also on reflection that instead of imploring his blessing i had given him mine i returned to london as i ought also from this long digression to relate what passed between me and the noblemen whom colonel d  nc  be said would come and visit me  when i expected three but one came a very old gouty gentleman whose name i do not think proper to insert the rest had intended me the same favor but he insisted it seems on coming alone which after a little raillery they permitted him to do but protested that if he stayed long they would follow him  though our conversation was entirely about indifferent matters during an hour he stayed with me yet he and i were as heartily btered and i had as many exminations about his behavior to me as if he had been a young gay gallant gentleman the reason of which was that he used to reprove others for their intemperance or indecency so they took it into their heads he was a sly sinner and would have bribed me highly to tell a lie of him i assured them provided they would but give me leave to inform him of it i would say what they pleased for i was fully of opinion that if a lie would do me grace he would permit me to gild it with the happiest terms i had  they told my story to the good old gentleman who kindly sent me over three guineas by the hand of my honored benefactor mr cibber  i was at this time applied to by mr v  ct  r to write an ode on the princess of waless birth day which as he kept a teawarehouse in pall mall near her court would he said at least gain him her royal highnesss custom so to oblige him as i had really done when he was in very low circumstances in ireland some years before i wrote as follows an ode on the birthday of her royal highness the princess of wales intended for music light of the world with purest beams adorn the front of heaven and gild the sacred morn come from thy chamber in the east in richest gold and purple dressed bright as the royal fair who on this day was born say in all thy glorious round have thou so much beauty found though nature spreads for thee her charms her fairest store of finished forms the radiant gem the flowery race have thou beheld such perfect grace as great augustas looks display blooming as rosy spring and fair as early day air glad zephyrs on your downy pinions bear the joyful tidings through the balmy air that heaven indulgent to britannias isle created for her loved her godlike heir this matchless virgin this illustrious fair in whom the virtues and the graces smile what joy oh royal youth was thine when you beheld the nymph divine like venus rising from the sea while round officious cupids play neptune confessed his breast before so rich a treasure never bore he hushed the noisy winds to sleep and smoothed the surface of the deep hymen quick thy taper light join whom love before had joined and in blissful bonds unite heart to heart and mind to mind the noblest pair that ever yet in sweet connubial transports met air as when the sun awakes the year and bids the blooms their sweets disclose in vernal luster robbed appear the lilly and the newblown rose so from this pure this hallowed flame behold the numerous offspring rise of future bards the blissful theme and rapture of a nations eyes let hymns of praise to heaven ascend for this propitious store oh still the royal race defend and britain asks no more   what success this met i know not but mr v  ct  r soon after applied to me for a lilliputian ode on the birthday of his royal highness prince george which i gave him as follows nature wake muses speak clothe the spring touch the string cupids sport round the court like the prince charms dispense whose early ray gives britain promise of resplendent day the flowery prime delights a time the hopeful bloom sheds rich perfume then fruits appear to crown the year so lovely boy thy spring employ that thy sweet youth be crowned with fruits of wisdom virtue truth ye to whose care britannias heir is now consigned to form his mind o to your trust be firmly just let flattery never infect his ear so shall he be worthy to rule a people brave and free often let him trace his godlike race their noble story inspiring glory his parents eyes with glad surprise shall view a son worthy their throne and albion bless the royal progenys desired increase   i know not what reward the gentleman got for these but he gave me five shillings and as since my return to ireland he was twice so civil to write me word i was a fool i must insist on it he was a much greater to apply to a fool for wit  and if he disputes these facts let him but finish the comedy of le paisan parvenu in the same style i wrote the first act for him and i will own myself to be the dunce he so freely calls me  i must here observe that the following poem written when i first went to london which he undertook to have printed for me he

the heavenly flame dispel our fears rekindle hope and dry britannias tears   and since from the great i have digressed to the vulgar i cannot forget dr ow  ns whom at the end of my first volume i promised to record and scorn to deal in lies as he did this pious divine who was an intimate acquaintance of my fathers gave himself the trouble of coming to my landlord mr r  ly an officer of mace in michaelslane a little while after i was parted from my husband together with his curate mr r  b  ns  n and with great humanity insisted on his turning me out of the house otherwise they would present it tne landlord asked what i had done they answered i was an excommunicated person  a lie that i had run away from my husband another lie  that since i had left him i had seven bastards  which was pretty quick as we had been but seven months asunder  another lie  but when a churchman is in for it he will outlye the devil at length these parsons descended so low as to threaten to inform that my landlords wife was a roman which i believe was another lie but whether true or false it was very unbecoming their characters either as gentlemen or christians to say  but i was to be insulted at any rate for the clergy hang together and if some did it would be no great loss  for when a swinging sin is to be committed there is nothing like a gown and a cassock to cover it  but once more to return to albion i had laid out a couple of guineas on a little curious picture which i bought to sell again but was advised to present it to the lord almoner who they said had a taste for painting he generously acceepted of my favor but neither made me any return from his own bounty nor his majestys so i had no great reason to say he deserved the character of an honest man  on the change of the ministry i wrote the following lines to the rt hon henry pelham esquire amidst contending parties strife for sway eager to rule reluctant to obey how just how noble must his conduct seem whom all unite to honor and esteem this blissful fate this happiness divine has heaven reserved to crown a life like thine this the reward sublimer virtues claim unenvied honors and unspotted fame integrity in fairest light confessed lives in the sacred center of thy breast oh never never from her laws depart so reign confessed the friend of every heart fixed on her solid base thy worth shall stand and britons bless thy delegated hand even restless faction shall ensure thy peace and only heaven thy happiness increase   i showed these lines to mr cibber who liked them so well that he undertook to deliver them for me  the next morning early he did so and then called upon me and giving me five guineas asked me whether i thought them a sufficient reward for my poetry i told him i readily did well then said he mr pelham distinguished thus there are five guineas for the ladys numbers and five more for the good advice they contain and tell her i hope god will always give me grace to follow it there was a statesman when comes such another   not seeing mr cibber for a fortnight after this instance of his friendship and humanity i wrote to him the following lines to mr cibber since you became so great a stranger my muse and life have been in danger consider both on you depend as their inspiring faithful friend and should your guardian care decrease their animating fires must cease since novelties alone delight you i have found a method to excite you a scheme untried before to move you it is plainly to confess i love you now look not with surprise or coldness nor call this declaration boldness for mine is a flame divinely pure for ever fitted to endure from every grosser thought refined a love for your accomplished mind   mr cibber sent me word he was going to the masquerade but would see me next day which gave rise to the following lines to colley cibber esquire can now a masquerade delight you what are it is charms that can invite you have not your eyes to age surveyed the medley world in masquerade where friendships masque conceals the knave and cowards wear the masque of brave the masque of love we frail ones find worn when our ruin is designed the patriots masque conceals sedition and soft humilitys ambition even you sometimes the masque will wear and what you are not often appear rally your faults with wit and spirit and make your folly masque your merit come undisguisd then come revealed to me and truth let folly yield and leave the masque to fools concealed   mr cibber received these lines with his usual partiality to me and my performances  and here it may not be amiss to give a particular character of this gentleman as no man has ever been more satyrized or less deserved it  and i think i cannot do it in a better manner than i have used in describing dr swift  that is to give him to my readers in his words and actions as near as i can recollect them during the time i had the honor of being known to him and if the petty scribblers should say that i never knew him any more than i did the dean of st patricks  why they only take away merit from me with one hand to give it to me with the other and must at least afford me the praise of inventing with probability that i have not drawn bears in water dolphins in the trees but am uniform in my characters and paint achilles as achilles was   as i have mentioned a poetical introduction to this gentlemans favor i must give a particular account of his first visit he ran up stairs with the vivacity of a youth of fifteen and making me a courtly bow said he was sure i did not known him i answered not to know him would argue myself unknown   and prithee said he why did not you come to my house the moment you came to london upon my word sir that would have been a modest proof of irish assurance how could i hope for a reception pshaw said he merit is a sufficient recommendation to me i courtesied and as we both stood sit down said he be less ceremonious to be better bred come show me your writings i obeyed and upon his reading the poem called sorrow he burst into tears and was not assumed to give the flowing virtue manly way he desired a copy of it  which i gave him and now his curiosity was raised to know who i was i told him mine was a long and mournful story unfit for a soul so humanized as his where dwelt the pitying pang the tender tear the sigh for suffering worth the wish preferred for humankind the joy to see them blessed and all the social offspring of the heart mr cibber assured me my fine compliment should not excuse me for he was fully determined to have my history from my own lips and desired i might come and breakfast with him next morning and begin  accordingly i waited on him and wonderfully was he delighted with my account of dr swift he had the patience to listen to me three hours without ever once interrupting me a most uncommon instance of good breeding especially from a person of his years who usually dictate to the company and engross all the talk to themselves for as dr young observes a dearth of words a woman need not fear but it is a task indeed to learn to hear in that the skill of conversation lies it is that must prove you both polite and wise and i do assure my readers the gentleman neither yawned scratched his head beat tatoo with his foot nor used any such ambiguous givingout to note that he was weary  so far from it that though he was engaged to dine with the duke of gr  ft  n he had forgot it till his servant came in to dress him he strictly charged me to come to him the next morning and set my spout a going for so he merrily called my mouth  i obeyed his most kind command and by way of introduction told him a story dr swift related to me which was as follows  a gentleman met a friend in the street whom he had not seen for some years he began to give him an account of what had befallen him since their separation from each other a care happened to intervene upon which they took different streets seven years past and it so befell they met just in the same place when without the least ceremony he proceeded in his story and as i was telling you said he etc  i was going to proceed when mr cibber interrupted me i was said he at the duke of r  chm  nds last summer when his daughter a most accomplished young lady and a very early riser sat reading in a beautiful portico about six in the morning i accosted the fair creature and asked her the subject of her contemplation so in a most elegant and agreeable style she related to me part of a very entertaining novel she held in her hand and i believe in better words than the author wrote it a summons to breakfast broke off her most agreeable narration  the next morning i saw the charmer in the same portico who took up the story at the very word she had broke off and concluded it  as ireland is now graced with this illustrious fair one in whom virtue beauty modesty taste and every excellence unite i hope for her pardon for presuming to mention her  and though as she will soon see her noble father was a beneficent patron to me i hate flattery so much that i would not on that account pay her a compliment beyond what was due to her elevated station did not her superior virtues command it  never yet were seen a more tender or a more lovely pair than the duke and duchess of richmond with their blooming progeny like newblown roses smiling around them an instance wedlock may be happy even among the great when mutual love and mutual honor join here love his golden shafts employs here lights his constant lamp and waves his purple wings reigns here and revels   and it is with infinite pleasure i learn that lord and lady kildare are as great an example in conjugal fidelity piety and generosity as their noble parents  this digression i am certain will be excused  i went on with my story to mr cibber who at last in flowing spirits cried z  ds write it out just as you relate it and i will engage it will fell  every poem as i occasionally introduced them he made me give him a copy of and communicated them to the earl of chesterfield who positively insisted on it that i must understand greek and latin otherwise i never could write english so well mr cibber said he had not enquired but that he would that moment and accordingly came and told me what my lord had said i assured him i was ignorant of every language except my mother tongue but that if he would be so kind to present my respects to his lordship and let him know that dr swift had taught me english i was certain he would allow i had an excellent tutor to which his lordship readily acquiesced  but alas though my honors were very great my profits were very small the dismal return of summer for so it was to me robbed me of every friend and as i could not take up with mean company i was as solitary in london as the pelican in the wilderness i acquainted dr t  rnbull with my melancholy situation and prevailed on him to write to mr p  n to remit to me what was due on the agreement between us about ten days after the postman brought a letter marked from dublin to the doctor he happened to be at kensington so i paid for it and knowing he had no acquaintance in ireland i ventured to open it it was wrote in a texthand the contents of it were as follow sir in the absence of my client mr p  i received your letter and he would have you to know the woman you mention is not his wife nor has he any thing to say to the infamous wretch she fled from ireland where she ought to have been executed for killing her father three of her bastards and poisoning her husband it does not become a clergyman to countenance a common prostitute if she owes you any money you may put her in jail for i do assure you it will never be paid by mr p  n  i am sir yours j walsh     could one believe that any thing less than infernal malice could have forged such an accusation against an innocent person my very blood thrilled with horror to think there could be such a monster of my species i am sure he should never pray more abandon all remorse on horrors head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing can he to damnation add greater than this   though i was far from the least appresion that the evil facts i was charged with as to killing all my family would meet with any credit yet mr p  ns denying me to be his wife and the declaration that i was not entitled to any thing from him might hurt mine i suppressed the letter for a day or two till learning by accident that the lord bishop of kilmore now lord archbishop of tuam to whose family my father had the honor of being physician and to whose humanity i am infinitely indebted which with the utmost respect and gratitude i take this public opportunity of acknowledging was in london i took the liberty of addressing myself to him as the daughter of a gentleman whom i was sensible his lordship regarded my application was not in vain for though he that day set out for ireland he not only sent me a handsome present but gave it in so genteel so polite a manner with his compliments that it added tenfold weight to his favor  when my lords gentleman came to me providence so ordered that dr t  bull was drinking coffee with me and upon this encouragement of a prelates taking compassion on my lost estate i ventured to communicate to him mr walshs letter the doctor lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven and seemed as much shocked at the perfidiousness of the wretch as i had been for whoever wrote the letter it was certainly done by mr p  ns direction but no wonder when he had sworn i was dead and was actually married to another he tried every method to destroy me and to convince the world i do not wrong him i here present them with a letter i received from ireland and communicated to the present primate who knows it was not a forged but a genuine one  madam i beg pardon for giving you this trouble though whether it can be any to you i know not having been so often assured by him who ought to have the best cause of knowledge that you were long since dead but to my great surprise i was informed by a gentleman of distinction lately come from london that he saw you that you were very well and lived in st jamess street  the cause of my writing to you may seem odd but this it is  mr p  n has for some time past paid his addresses to a young lady who is the daughter of my most intimate friend to whom i have often heard him with repeated oaths not only confirm your death but that also of his two younger children  the latter is already found to be a base falsehood and should it appear that he has attempted to impose a greater on us there is no penalty the law can inflict which he shall not suffer nor shall my resentment ever lessen or abate as he has justly merited it  i beg madam if you yet exist you will favor me with an answer and let me know whether there were any terms of agreement between you and mr p  n on your separation and be assured neither money nor friends shall be wanting to support your interest and though i have not the pleasure of being known to you you will find a real friend in  david lambert direct to me at the globe coffeehouse dublin     i answered this letter the moment i received it which was three weeks after the date and never heard of the gentleman more nor know i whether he exists or not  and as mr p  n has since my return to ireland accused me of attempting to injure him with the primates as he styles them i fairly own i sent mr walshs letter to the late lord primate hoadly and mr lamberts letter to the present lord primate who as he says in his most stupid epistle scorned to countenance me and gave him my letter and my list of subscribers also with full power to do to them what he pleased and truly mr parson so do i but if neither the lord lieutenant nor any of the principal persons of distinction in this kingdom who have honored me with their regard should be willing to bear an insult from you how can you help yourself why man we are in a protestant country and disdain to be priestridden  finding myself unable to pay so high a rent as i stood at i discharged my lodging and servant and went to board and lodge at a very genteel house in greenstreet grosvenorsquare my landlord was valet de chamber to the earl of stair and his wife a top laundress which in london is a very profitable employment  as she washed for several persons of distinction she used on a sunday to invite the headservants of noblemens families to dinner at which i never took umbrage for you are sure from them to learn every circumstance relating to their lords and ladies and many entertaining stories of their particular humors and gallantries did i learn so true is it that either good or evil fame proceeds from our domestics and no wonder as they have a better opportunity than the rest of the world to watch our unguarded hours and comment on our frailties  amongst others sir john ligoniers gentleman as they styled him which name his generous master soon after entitled him to by giving him a commission dined with us he looked very attentively at me and put me into confusion by telling my landlady she had to his knowledge a gentlewoman lodger  after dinner my landlord brought in a large bowl of punch pipes and tobacco upon which i made my exit  i had not long been in my dressing room which opened into a very sweet garden when mr parkinson for so was this person called followed me he told me he hated drink and tobacco and would be infinitely obliged to me for a dish of tea which as my curiosity was raised by the words he had let drop at dinner i readily consented to give him  he had he told me frequently seen me in stephensgreen and was in dublin at the time of my separation from my husband and that numbers of people lamented my hard fate i told him i had not found it so for that i could not even get what was due to me from thence nor an answer to any letter i ever wrote  he then asked me how i got any support especially as he had learned from the family that i lived very retired i ingenuously told him i had no other fortune than my pen and at his request showed him some of my writings he told me his master delighted in poetry and was one of the most generous gentlemen living and that he was certain if i applied to him he would be a friend to me i was easily prevailed on to write to him to beg he would do me the honor of subscribing to me and sent him such of my rhymes as i myself had the best opinion of the general wrote me a very polite answer and as he lived but a few doors from my lodging gave me the next evening the honor of a visit  this gentleman is so universally known beloved honored and esteemed that i dare not attempt his character being assured my best painting would fall infinitely short of the excellent original nor was i at all surprised that he should be a favorite of the fair who was adorned with honor generosity valor and yet even female softness and complacency added to the charms of a most graceful and majestic person  and if in an advanced age he shone so brightly what must he have done in his first bloom when his kindling cheeks with purple beauties glowed his lovely sparkling eyes shot martial fires dreadful as mars and as his venus charming i dare say half the ladies would have cried out with phoedra o godlike form o ecstasy and transport   this worthy gentleman subscribed to me for twelve books and also engaged the late duke of argyle the earl of stair the lord cobham and several other english noblemen to do me the same honor  so the almighty raised me friends even in a strange land and proved my husband though a priest no prophet who declared i should starve to which indeed his best endeavors have not been wanting  but he should have remembered the words of holy david i have been young and now am old yet never saw i the righteous man forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  my dear father had by his many good works entailed a blessing on my honest endeavors and as mr cibber used to say when i wrote any thing that pleased him the gift of the great god to you preserves you which as i never sold nor prostituted it to unworthy ends i humbly hope his mercy will afford to me as long as i have any being  this timely assistance enabled me not only to live but to pursue my writing which no person can ever do well while their minds are like marthas troubled with many things  a few days after this a very genteel pretty woman took a lodging in the same house with me she was with child and her husband was as she said a lawyer and was gone the circuit so finding the city not agree with her she moved to better air as she had very good furniture my landlady made no scruple to accept of her without farther enquiry and i was well pleased to think i should have an agreeable companion  her manner of life greatly surprised me for in two months time she never once went abroad nor did any human creature come to visit her  at length about two oclock one morning a gentleman came who she she said was her husband she let him in herself and he left her early in the morning so that none of the family saw him he repeated his nocturnal visits several times after the same manner in the dead still and middle of the night which appeared to me rather to wear the face of an amor than lawful matrimony  at length the gentleman failed in his attendance and the lady said he was gone into the country the nightly knocking at the door did cease the noiseless hammer rusted there in peace some weeks past over without either a message or a letter coming from the supposed husband upon which she fell into a deep melancholy which though she seemed to attribute to her apprehension of the approaching hour i could easily perceive had some more secret and latent cause  and as in my life i had never seen a more retired or modest person i had the utmost compassion for her and judged if she was among the number of the unfortunate some uncommon villainy had been practiced against her  as we were very intimate i frequently surprised her in tears and at last i ventured to beg her to acquaint me with the cause of her affliction assuring her it was not an impertinent female curiosity which urged me on but a real desire to be serviceable to her which perhaps by some means or other providence might point out  she burst into tears and fondly embracing me told me she wanted a friend to unbosom herself to and added that if i would be her bedfellow that night she would relate to me her unhappy story  wished for night came and my fair friend kept her promise  i am said she the daughter of an eminent merchant who by his extraordinary good nature in being surety for others hospitable spirit and very great losses at sea was obliged to live in a more narrow compass than suited the generosity of his mind my mother dying when i was but twelve years of age my father made me mistress of the house which he said would teach me to be an oeconomist and to know how to govern one of my own when i was about fourteen years of age a wealthy packer a very handsome man courted me my father ingenuously told him he could give him but five hundred pounds with which if he was satisfied and that i had no objection to it he should be very glad to have him for a soninlaw  mr h  rn  l for so was he called assured him he would gladly take me without a portion but my father insisted on his acceptance of it as it would help to furnish a house  whatever may be thought at st jamess these who converse with the traders of london will find they neither want sense nor politeness and i liked mr h  l so well that i was very glad of being so happily disposed of  my husband took a house commodious for his business and for four years during which time i had four children we lived in great harmony  but in the mean time i had the misfortune of losing my dear father who lest the little remainder of his fortune as a portion for my younger sister and appointed my husband to be her guardian  one day he told me he was afraid he should not be able to keep such good hours as he had done being chosen a member of the philosophic club in which were many gentlemen of distinction whose acquaintance it was greatly his interest to cultivate and to whom it was an honor to be known so he hoped it would not give me any uneasiness i answered he had always been so indulgent to me i must be ungrateful indeed to take offense or be uneasy at any thing he was pleased to do he seemed transported with my answer kissed me and said i was the best wife living little did i think what villainy he was perpetrating against me  he now stayed out several nights entirely and if he came at all it was not till four or five in the morning which being unacquainted with jealousy gave me no other concern than the fear that irregularities might prejudice his health but i have often been surprised at his coming home so sober and that he did not appear drowsy after such long watching  one morning in particular he no sooner entered but he called for his riding dress and told me he was going with a gentleman into the country for a few days so giving me his purse in which were forty guineas he desired i would carefully observe his business in which i was now a pretty good proficient  three months time elapsed and though i wrote to him according to his own direction i never received an answer  i was now filled with the most gloomy apprehensions one time concluding he had been murdered a thousand fears presented themselves to my imagination till lost and bewildered i could fix on nothing my friends persuaded me to advertise him which accordingly i did  some days after a very well dressed young gentleman desired to see me i showed him into the parlour where he demanded of me whether i was mr h  ls wife i said yes upon which to my great surprise he asked me could i prove it i assured him i could that is all i want madam i begged he would explain those dark speeches inasmuch as they quite terrified me madam said he my name is l  ck  y i have a good estate and am newly called to the bar your husband has inveigled away my sister and married her she is under age and has fifteen thousand pounds to her fortune she shall prove her marriage and if you do not prove your prior one what can the world think of you  i was so astonished at this account that i fainted away  the gentleman called the servants to my assistance and stayed by me till i came to myself the agonies i felt are only known to those who have truly and tenderly loved dreadful alternative either to prosecute a beloved husband to death or be myself deemed an infamous woman  here the poor creature had so renewed her own anguish and so awakened all my woes that our eyes streamed social and mingled their sympathetic waters till insensibly the dewyfeathered sleep closed up our eyelids  i longed as much for the next night as the sultan in the arabian nights entertainment did to hear the charming scherazades fine stories at length it came and the lady proceeded  i begged a day or two to consider on so important an affair and also to consult with my friends what was most advisable for me to do and then i would return a positive answer so having an uncle in bondstreet i sent my household furniture there dear madam said i what did you do with your children oh returned she i never had one that lived above a few days that said i was happy i think so now said she though i did not then i told my uncle all my mournful story who advised me bv all means to vindicate myself and not fall a prey to so consummate a villain  i stayed with my uncle who was a widower my sister married and mr h  would not pay her her fortune as she had not asked his consent my uncle would not permit either a letter or a message to be delivered to me but kept me a perfect prisoner however there was a young lady in the neighborhood whom he had some inclination to marry and whom he frequently brought as a companion to relieve my solitary hours  one evening she insisted on my coming to drink tea with her my uncle urged me to it i went judge of my surprise when i found there my husbands mother and sister all drowned in tears they told me he was confined in newgate  had taken the prisonfever and declared he could not die in peace unless he saw me  i loved too well to refuse his request upon which they immediately hurried me into a coach and there indeed he was the lawyer had arraigned him for his life and he must take his trial  he looked so dejected and seemed so sincerely penitent and i alas so sincerely loved him that i even consented to stay with him in his confinement he acknowledged his fault but very artfully insinuated that it did not proceed from any change in his affection but that his circumstances were so distressed that he had no other means to retrieve them that his death could be of no service to me  that i knew myself to be his lawful wife that he would always support me in short he used every tender and prevailing argument to keep me from appearing against him and heaven knows i had no inclination to do it  when his trialday came his second wife fully proved her marriage to him but like the real mother i chose to give her all sooner than divide him so she triumphed over me and as i had given up the cause none of my friends would give me any assistance i am now in the oddest situation imaginable even a kept mistress to my own husband for upon no other terms would he give me any relief nor do i know whether to style myself innocent or guilty for my condescension to him  as my tenderness for him made me appear in a bad light to the world ever ready to censure even our best actions i dare not in my present condition let any person who knows me see me lest they should think of me worse than i deserve  i have had no supply from him for a considerable time he has prohibited my writing to him at his house and now dear madam advise me what to do  there was something so peculiarly unhappy in this poor creatures fate that it might puzzle a wiser head than mine to comply with her request i considered it every way without being able to form any scheme for her relief  at length she told me he kept an office on ludgate hill where he was always to be found at nine in the morning as his second wife was too fine a lady to bear one in the house she imagined if i could see him i might work on his compassion i readily consented to do any thing which might be serviceable to her and rising early next morning she gave me a letter to him which i promised not to deliver but into his own hand  accordingly i set out on my embassy and found the gentleman such as she had described him a polite handsome man of above thirty years of age he was alone and received me very civilly i presented the letter but seemed ignorant of the contents i could easily perceive he was much disturbed however with a mavelous assurance he said he could not give charity to every body that he had often assisted that unfortunate person that she ought to work for her bread as many of her betters did and a number of such inhuman speeches common on those occasions i told him her present conditions did not enable her to perform any but needle work and that he who put her into it should support her he asked me what i meant nothing but honesty if a man gets a child he ought to take care of it what said he would you have me father a bastard she could not i am sure have one by you and would not i am convinced have one by any body else he bade me explain myself i told him he perfectly understood me and therefore it was not necessary but that if he pleased i would tell mrs h  l the second of his midnight visits to his wife the wretch seemed confounded and seeing i knew him so well thought he had best be quiet especially as a gentleman came in before whom he did not care to be exposed so he called me to the staircase and putting a couple of guineas into my hand said aloud madam i shall take care and mind your directions i begged he would and so we parted but i am well convinced it was fear not love that made him send her even that trifle  this unhappy lady died a few hours after she was brought to bed the infant also died and i hope though her husband by her lenity once escaped a halter justly due to him he has by this time inherited it for i would have such offenders so cut off  i grew so melancholy at the loss of my companion that i did not even care for writing but amused myself entirely with reading and my not having a library of my own made me a constant customer to a shop in the neighborhood where they hired out books by the quarter this brought me into an acquaintance with the persons who kept it sensible wellbred people one day i received a letter from mrs ryves for that was their name that she had some very agreeable friends with her and that they wanted a hand at quadrille so she hoped i would be of their party i was very glad of any recreation and as they lived but in brookstreet directly went i was shown into a parlour where sat an old man whom i knew to be a grubstreet writer and a young gentleman in a very plain dress whom i also supposed to be in the same class they were playing cribbage for a farthing a game and instead of counters scored with chalk they had also an alehouse pot with some porter in it standing by them and the room smelled strong of tobacco from these appearances i conceived a very contemptible opinion of the company and would have retired had i known how to do it civilly but as at my entrance i had told mrs ryves i was entirely disengaged that evening i could by no means get off and could only hope for some little amusement by hearing what those underlings in arts and sciences might have to say for every object of creation may furnish hints for contemplation the scene however was changed the disagreeable part of the decoration removed and a quadrille table introduced  the younger gentleman proposed our playing for nothing pshaw said i then we shall all cheat i would no more do that said he than give a vote against my country  this surprised me told him i hoped as he expressed such a spirit of patriotism he had a seat in the house he said he had the honor of representing the ancient city of canterbury that his father was admiral rock and that he was married to the sister of the lord guilford dudley a lady unmatched in wit and beauty i told him i was glad to find one person of distinction who was not ashamed to do justice to the merits of his lady i should be a scoundrel said he to refuse it she gave me the preference to a man of a much larger fortune to whom her friends had destined her an obligation never to be forgot by a grateful spirit this gentleman had such an uncommon generous way of thinking that instead of minding the game i was quite attentive to him which he observing said take away the cards they are only fit to amuse such as are incapable of tasting a more rational entertainment  i was very glad of this  the old scribbler walked into the shop to recreate himself with tobacco and porter and mrs ryves went to get us some chatinspiring liquor green tea  i told mr rooke if i had been any way wanting in respect to him i hoped he would attribute it to my ignorance of his station and the company and situation i found him in  he assured me i had committed no offense nor did he believe it was in my nature but said he as you have remarked on the company you must know my wife and lord s  thw  lls sisters went this morning to greenwich i had some business which prevented my waiting on them when that was over i went to mountstreet coffeehouse in order to pick up some company to dine with me and finding none i asked the old man who refused me as mrs ryves had engaged him i told him i would go dine with him  as i had in the shop read your apology for the minister i was greatly surprised to hear it was the product of a ladys pen when i seemed to question it they proposed sending for you which being very agreeable to me was immediately done so madam this is the history of the day  i thanked the gentleman for his complaisance in relating it  the tea put him into such high spirits that he finding me a sort of a politician told me many entertaining stories about sir rob  t w  ls various schemes to have always the majority of the house on his side of which as many as i can recollect that were humorous i present my readers with  the first was this one sir cl  die m  cd  l a scots baronet without a foot of estate was returned duly elected for what shire i have forgot however he came to london took a hackneycoach and drove to sir rob  ts the servants said he was engaged but sir cl  die insisted on his carrying up his name and lest he should forget it he jumped out of the coach and running up stairs after him delivered his embassy himself sir rob  t welcomed him and like a courtier told him he should be glad to serve him nay nay mon returned he i came na here for compliments i ha ne siller to get a lodging so i will even stay here till you give me some so sir rob  t chose to give him his purse rather than be plagued with his impertinence  the earl of p  rb  h a pensioner told sir rob  t he was always at a loss how to vote inasmuch as he did not understand the debates  and was so near sighted that when the house divided he knew not of which side to go  sir rob  t bade him always follow the bishops it happened on the convention scheme three or four of the bishops rose and the earl seeing them move he according to his masters direction followed them and voted point blank against his his interest  mr rooke seeing how much i was pleased proceeded  a scots peer who was also a pensioner and a remarkable fat man came one morning according to custom to sir rob  ts levee and without the least ceremony laid hold of his ribbon sir rob  t could not readily disengage himself and the nobleman lugged him to the window in which sousing himself down he happened to have an escape which carried with it so loud a report that it threw the whole company into laughter  very well my lord said the minister pray what have you farther to say  why this it is sir rob  t i owe fifteen hundred pounds and by g  d if you dont give it to me i will go tomorrow to the house and vote according to conscience it is to be presumed his demand was complied with in private though laughed at in public as he always voted with sir rob  t  mr rock finding me attentive proceeded the late duke of wh  ton was a man of infinite variety and humor at the time of the discovery of atterburys plot as they called it which was proved by decyphering letters and torturing the harmless alphabet into treason the duke saw a man at the door of the parliament house selling hornbooks sir rob  ts equipage stopped and the duke laying hold of him as he alight told him he was surprised he did not send that fellow to newgate who was selling such a libel on the ministry why said sir rob  t my lord those are hornbooks treason by g  replied the duke as i will convince you so holding him he ran on a stands for an army and b for a bench c stands for a court and d for a drench e i will not interpret that f stands for gay france which we hope will not swerve and g stands for george  whom god long preserve p stands for the p  x the pretender the pope and r stands for robin and ribbon and rope said he pulling him by the blue string the minister could not help himself and being naturally of a pacific temper took this as quietly as he did gnrl ch  ch  lls lying with his wfe  as i had never heard the story i begged he would relate it why said he sir rbrt went out very early one morning to the house but having forgot some paper of importance to the dirty work of the day  he returned home for it and passing through his wifes apartment to his closet what should he see but his serene spouse and the general in amorous dalliance  the general allhero as he was jumped out of bed and besought mercy from as he supposed his incensed rival but the good man resembling cato in one point who if a friend or so should chance to need her would recommend her as a special breeder said carelessly prithee what does the fool mean you look very warm get into bed again or you will catch cold  mr rooke seeing me so well diverted with this story proceeded to another as i have said he mentioned the duke of wh  rt  n  you are to know he had an intrigue with mrs p  now c  tess of b  one morning as they were in bed together he recollected that he had promised to write a letter to a friend  so he called for a pen ink and paper but being at a loss for a writingdesk made the lady turn up her post  s and dated his letter from sweet p  ggy p  lt  ys etc etc etc  here entered our kind host and brought us in a paper called the champion in which was a very humorous piece of advice to all who went to c  t to wear shields on their bu  s this was so mal a propos that it raised out mirth said mr rooke his m  s own was in danger the other night as how sir why said he sir rob  t not choosing to hurt the kingdom by the k  s using foreign commodities when we had so much cheaper and better at home recommended to him miss sk  rr  t as an handmaiden his m  liked her so well that he invited her to sup with him in the c  tess of y  hs apartment where growing a little more fond of his young mistress than the old one could bear she arose and as the k  leaned over the table drew the chair from under him and let m  come souse to the ground oh what a fallingoff was there he all enraged rose again kicked first the c  ss next his hat and retired to his apartment marvelously distempered with choler  well sir said i surely sir r  t was a most necessary servant that would even sir pandarus of troy become and that for his own daughter to oblige his m  but an able politician will turn his hand to any thing where profits may accrue and mr gay observes that in pimps and politicians the genius is the same and yet who could suspect a man of his reverence and station for the most vile and servile of all employments  oh sy said he dont disgrace so noble an occupation i assure you the knights complaisance to the general proved the means of saving his own life for on the excise scheme the people were so incensed that they determined to put him to death and yet make it seem chance medley accordingly as he was going down to st stephens steps into our illustrious s  tehouse one man pushed him so hard that he tumbled on his face and a number of persons determined to run over him and trample him to death but the general who was with him drew his sword and swore the first who advanced should die on point of fox  no body ventured to encounter a ch  ll so the prime m  ster escaped  ah said i that was gods mercy and ten thousand pities faith said he and so it was  mr rooke now began to be a little inquisitive who i was i told him my name was meade for by that i always went in london so that the numerous stories of mrs p  ns being in taverns bagnios etc which my husband says be can prove  mem he lies never appertained to me but to his own c  sin n  y p  n whose father lives in pilllane  and who is herself as common a prostitute as ever traversed the hundreds of drury  i do this to convince him i scorn to rob any of his illustrious family of their noble achievements and according to the old proverb  it is but proper to set the saddle on the right horse or rather mare for i think she much resembles one  but to return  mr rooke asked me if i was related to capt meade i told him he was my uncles son he said he was a worthy little fellow that he knew him very well and had made him his confidant in his amor with his lady  time stole insensibly away with such agreeable amusement we sat till the small hours without drowsiness nor did we desire the aid of bacchus to keep up our spirits  i humbly hope no body will attempt to decypher my initials for i do assure them the great m  is an innocent letter and does not like mitching mallicho mean mischief  i told mr rooke i was going to publish a book by subscription he said he was sure it must be good so he gave me a guinea and promised to use his interest for me  he told me he would come and visit me the first hour he had to spare i anwered i hoped he would soon find one well then said he i will tell you how i pass the day and do you find one  i rise about nine drink coffee not that i like it but that it gives a man the air of a politician for the same reason always read the news  then i dress and about twelve go to the cocoatree where i talk treason from thence to st jamess coffeehouse where i praise the ministry then to whites where i talk gallantry so by three i return home to dinner after that i read about an hour and digest the book and the dinner together  then i go the opera or play vauxhall or ranelagh according to the season of the year from thence home to supper and about twelve to bed  i smiled at the gentlemans whimsical description of his passing the day and told him he had by his own account three or four hours to bestow on me as the hour he talked treason the hour he was loyal or the hour in which he read ay said he very gaily or what think you of the last flour wherein i go to bed oh sir you are so much better engaged it would not only be wickedness but folly also to think of that at all  well depend on it said he i will see you tomorrow so we took leave forever for the very first news i heard next morning was that mr rooke a little while after he arose fell down in an apoplectic fit and instantly expired  i never was more shocked than at his untimely fate heavens all wit life and gaiety at night and dead in the morning i wept for him as a friend and such i am sure he would have been to me had he lived i found by these two melancholy events there was nothing serious in mortality all was but toys i frequently recollected dr delanys beautiful lines on seeing himself in the glass when i revolve this evanescent state of short duration and uncertain date my being and my stay dependent still not on my own but on anothers will i ask myself as i my form review which is the real shadow of the two   mrs ryves was also much touched for the loss of this gentleman and indeed so was every body who knew him she and i went one afternoon to walk in st jamess park but finding myself weary she proposed going to a physicians house in westminster a widower and her relation where we could get a dish of tea and rest ourselves i agreed the doctor was at home and a very polite gentleman i found by the furniture of the room he was a virtuoso it being adorned with books medals paintings dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry  the dean mentions it as a praise to vanessa that she witb address each genius held to that wherein they most excelled so making others wisdom known she pleased them and improved her own for no sooner did the doctor perceive that i knew mark anthony from julius caesar and brutus from both but he related a great part of the roman history to me even from the first punic war to the death of julius  my readers may venture to believe it was not new to me who had from my childhood been if i may use the word a perfect devourer of books and i found them both sweet to the palate and nourishing food to the mind  it has been observed as a piece of refined policy in gondamore the spaniard that he used to talk bad latin to king james i who being a pedant rather than a prince had so much pleasure in as he thought setting this machiavel right that to oblige his pupil he complimented him with the head of that learned and brave man sir walter raleigh  i have often successfully practiced the same art and gained many friends by seeming to take their instruction with pleasure to acknowledge their superiority of understanding on which even fools pride themselves is i believe the most delicate way of flattering ever yet thought of as cassius says of caesar and when i tell him he hates flattery he says he does being then most flattered very few people are virtue proof there all like achilles have a mortal heel and though it is an old maxim in the schools that flatterys the food of fools yet now and then your men of wit will condescend to taste a bit swift  i found the good doctor fallible here to my great happiness as it made him my friend and under god his skill and care soon after saved my life  the gentleman made us stay to supper finding when the wind was in one particular point i was as wise as hamlet and knew a hawk from a handsaw  at supper i told him i was an amicus akin to the faculty being a physicians daughter upon which he arose and said he must salute his niece and that if ever i should fall sick he claimed the honor of attending me we stayed together till twelve very cheerfully and then parted in peace  i have observed if my life had any sunshine it was but a faint and watery gleam too soon overcast for in a very few days i was seized with a violent fever it took me with cold shivering fits and remembering the doctors claim i sent for him he had me bled and ordered me to go to bed i did not see him till next morning by which time i was quite lightheaded and crying out for my children when the doctor came i told him he had stolen them from me and carried them to mr p  n on this he opened my bosom for which i also quarrelled and said he was a very impudent fellow he smiling said i had a very fair skin but that he was under a necessity of making free with it otherwise he could not answer for my life and as it seems it was full of purple spots he ordered a large blister for my back and one for each arm what past for some days in which they were renewed i know not being quite insensible even to pain but when the fever abated and reason once more reassumed her throne what frail machines are we when sickness can displace her they assured me i raved incessantly for my dear little ones and fell into such fits of crying and lamentation for them that it put them in mind of rachel mourning for the loss of her children who refused to be comforted because they were not  so as it has been often observed that there is truth in wine i found there was truth in madness the cause that hurts the brain or the reigning passion of the soul then manifests itself and as my beloved were evermore present to my imagination it was no wonder that their names dwelt ever on my tongue  when these things were told me i as one newly awakened from sleep remembered some wild disjointed incoherent ideas which had possessed my soul even during it is lethargic state such as that mr p  n was going to offer some violent injury to our children but of what kind i knew not it was fled like the remembrance of a guest which tarrieth but a day i might have as well have endeavored to find out the path which the light bird had with his wings beat in the buxom air or the track of a ship when with it is crooked keel it divides the briny waves which immediately unite again or seize old time and bid him bring me back one moment past as hope to recollect what was for ever lost in oblivion  indeed i have frequently had these supernatural sollicitings or a kind of indication of whatever was to befall me before it happened nay what is more surprising i have read a history to me quite new and it has occurred to me that i myself had been some way principally concerned in the most material transactions of it though they were past a thousand years  had i lived in the days of pythagoras i believe i should have been of his opinion and have imagined that all things are but altered nothing dies and here and there the unbodyd spirit flies nay i should have been afraid to kill a woodcock lest i should disinherit the soul of my granddame  if my reader thinks me whimsical let him judge by the event  a woman in whose garden i had once walked in ireland the first day i was able to sit up and very weak i was after so long sickness even while my kind physician was rubbing my temples with hungary water to recover me out of a fainting fit rushed into the room and without the least ceremony cried out do you know what that villain has done as i neither knew her nor who she spoke of i was quite startled and asked her who she talked about or what she meant that villain p  n says she who has sold your two younger children for slaves to new york this was such a monstrous crime i could scarce give any credit to it for even admitting what he had so cruelly charged me with in regard to his bed was truth how had their helpless innocence offended him i observed to the doctor my ravings were ominous and portended some dire calamity  the doctor apprehending this shock might make me relapse begged of the person who gave it to retire which after several asseverations that what she said was fact as indeed it was and that she had brought it out in that manner to haste me if possible to prevent their unhappy fate she did  as the doctor was not only a man of excellent understanding but also of great humanity i told him as he had been so kind to administer to the health of my body he must now if possible administer to a mind diseased and as it was impossible for him to prescribe remedies without knowing the distemper and it is original i gave him my story in a few words and he advised me to write to ireland to the rulers and bishops which i did that very night and providentially the letters were delivered time enough to prevent the children being sold to slavery  the affair was enquired into and mr p  n was obliged to refund to the master of the kidship the golden earnest he had received as the price of the innocent  what to me was most surprising was that mr p  ns mother was one of the contrivers of this infernal plot grandmothers being usually more indulgent to their grandchildren than even their mothers but as she who would have made a prey of them is not long since dead even of the disease that herod peter the cruel and other malignant wretches fell by i can only bid her adieu and charitably hope she has escaped the judgment of the next world as it fell on her in this  these facts are so publicly known that for the evidence of them i could produce even a cloud of witnesses were it necessary  and yet who that beheld this man clad in holy vesture at the altar appearing like whiterobed innocence with eyes upturned to heaven could believe him capable of all manner of crimes perjury perjury in the highest degree cruelty cruelty in the sternest degree he may indeed like richard iii prove himself by these to be a man who when his mother upbraids him with his manifold acts of savage tyranny she says no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity rich but i know none and therefore am no beast   and indeed mr p  n may again say with him that he has nothing but the plain devil and dissembling looks to back his cause oh that ithuriels heavenly tempered spear would make the fiend in his own shape appear or pluck the holy furr from off his back and let the world for once see what the inside of a wicked priest is made of  as i received no account from ireland i knew not what to think sometimes i flattered myself that the woman had belied him at other times reflecting on his intolerable barbarity to the poor creatures whom distress alone made me leave immured within his inhospitable walls too rough a cradle for my pretty ones my very heart died within me and i am as well assured as that i live that it was not the fear of god but the fear of a halter hindered him from embruing his own hands in their vital blood  but enough of the wretch who if he can disprove me ought to do it he attributes his silence to contempt of me but it is well known he neither wants wit nor words nor impudence to bring him off it is strong conviction with proof as full and evident as day against him ties up his guilty tongue  at length i thought of writing to w  rs  le as i had learned he was in dublin he wrote me word that the children were all well that he had given an apprenticefee with my daughter to a milliner and had taken my youngest son to himself that old mr p  n and my mother were dead and my last child which being but an infant i could not carry to london with me that he had got a famous ossified man and was going to carry him to paris for a show to which place he earnestly invited me to accompany him  i hoped by this letter that mr p  n had been wronged with regard to the children under his care and though some humane tears fell for the loss of my mother and my child yet considering how desolate they both were i envied rather than deplored their fate  the child here mentioned was that which mr p  n disclaimed and advised me to leave upon the parish  and now i do assure my readers i was also sincerely sorry for the death of old mr p  n inasmuch as he always treated me with a fatherly tenderness was excessively fond of my children was a man of a great uncultivated genius and though i have mentioned his keeping an alehouse i did not mean it in any disrespect to his memory for he was the son of a gentleman though by various misfortunes he was reduced to take up so low an occupation but nothing can be justly deemed scandalous which is not dishonest and i am well convinced had he lived he never would have consented to the inhuman barbarity of his son adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven   so many melancholy incidents had befallen me in this solitary place that i determined to change my lodging and was recommended by a stationers wife to a single gentlewoman who kept a milliners shop in fleet street she was a jolly likely dame of about forty very gay we liked each other so well that we soon made a bargain and for a few days i was very well pleased with the change as the variety of that busy part of london amused my mind but i soon found that i was got into very bad hands and that my new landlady was neither better nor worse than a mercenary town jilt who being pretty well known herself and consequently despised wanted something new to produce to her customers  i think i never saw any person in my life who did not possess one good quality except this creature for woman is a term too gentle for her who had not even decency to hide her shame  to give my reader a taste of her cleanliness she told me herself she had not combed her head for three years which i believe was true because she was not mistress of a comb except when she made free with mine than which nothing could be more offensive to me so that her hair though naturally fine being quite matted on a filthy haircap seemed to be a composition of raw silk and moss such as i remember to have stolen a lock of from the had of good duke humphrey at st albans three hundred years after his death shifts she had two as yellow as canvas but they were sleeveless no matter for thar she sold readymade cambrick sleeves and could easily pin on a pair for she never took any farther trouble about them i think i must for the rest refer my reader to the ladys dressing room for in such a case few words are best and strephon bids us guess the rest   i really till i saw this wretch imagined the dean had only mustered up all the dirty ideas in the world in one piece on purpose to affront the fair sex as he used humorously to style old beggarwomen and cinderpickers  this makes me digress to relate a compliment of his to some ladies who supped with him of which i had the honor to be one the dean was giving us an account of some woman who he told us was the nastiest filthiest most stinking old b  ch that ever was yet seen except the company ladies except the company for that you know is but civil we all bowed could we do less  from the time i had the misfortune of being her tenant she invited every person she had any acquaintance with to see me as though i had been some outlandish monster or wonderful curiosity amongst the rest she prevailed on the now l  d ch  f j  st  ce e  e then a student in grays inn a fine gentleman poetically turned and somewhat too much upon the effeminate or delicate order to bear whatever was not quite refined to venture into her dining room where i sat scribbling i was for retiring but that was not permitted the gentleman who was dressed in black velvet and had the air of a person of distinction said he hoped as his visit was intended entirely to me i would not be so unkind as to refuse it  i said i did not know how i was entitled to such an honor but since he was pleased to bestow it on me i should with gratitude accept of it my hostess for that name by her bulk far above the common size of females she seemed to deserve prudently left the stranger and i to ourselves under pretense that she must attend her shop mr e  e seeing my table covered with written papers told me my room resembled that of a lawyer and asked me leave to read my contemplations to which i agreeing he had the complaisance to seem entertained when to my unspeakable confusion the brute returned and cried what will you treat the lady with any thing she chooses returned he and seemed as much confounded as i was pray madam what do you like nothing at present sir but what i have ordered some coffee as it was but five oclock in the afternoon and as the gentleman was remarkable for sobriety he approved of my taste he offered to pay for it i told him i did not sell it and that he could not more highly aggrieve me  my landlady sent it up but did not think proper to partake of our repast of which i was very glad he looked on me with eyes of great compassion especially as he observed the tears springing from mine for indeed i was quite shocked he asked me how i became acquainted with a person so very unlike myself i told him i was a stranger and knew very little of her as he gave credit to my words he advised me to quit her house assuring me she was a procuress and as he said kept a shop only to disguise her real occupation  he had scarce finished his friendly caution when madam entered again with two very large lobsters in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other she laid a very foul table cloth dressed her fish and invited us to partake which we refusing she eat them all herself drank the bottle of wine and very modestly desired the gentleman to pay for them to which he acquiesced  this scene made us laugh heartily for she fed with such keen dispatch and drank so often that she seemed like a starved pierot devouring all before her  her rage of hunger being now as we hoped suppressed she once more left us and mr e  e said i hope you are now convinced madam that at least your reputation will be undone if you continue here i answered it was but too true but that at present i saw no method of relief as she owed me money which she never was bashful in borrowing by which means i was ill provided to remove and had agreed to take it out in board and lodging  here madam once more rushed in when to my great surprise she asked mr e  e would he give her a roasted fowl and sausages for supper he told her after so plentiful a meal as she had just made he was sure she did but jest she affirmed she was in earnest and that if he would not there was a gentleman below that would  mr e  e who had a mind to hold more talk with me asked me what part of the house belonged to me she answered with matchless impudence a very good bedchamber which she supposed we should have no objection to as we liked each other so well  i seemed not to take the meaning of her speech and not having the least apprehension of any incivility being offered to me by a person of good breeding and humanity i told the gentleman he should be very welcome if he pleased to walk into it  as it was on the same floor he said i did him great honor and that he would wait on me  however to avoid the evil comments which wicked persons judging others by themselves are ever ready to make i left the door wide open to the no small mortification of my landlady and her new guest as they were obliged to pass by it  and what should he be but some drunken swabber or boatswain whose tarpaulin compliments of which we heard every word distinctly for some time diverted us till at last their talk became so offensive that as i had left the door open in point of decency i was now on the same account obliged to shut it  the gentleman once more urged the necessity of my departure from this villainous woman assuring me if i would but change my lodging and send a line to him with a direction where to find me he would do every thing in his power to serve distressed merit as he was please to term it  and that nothing might be wanting to enable me to do it he in a very polite manner obliged me to accept of two guineas as a subscription to my writings  this ingenious gentleman entertained me with the recital of several beautiful poetical compositions of his own and finding i was not quite tasteless but at least endeavored to give them due praise he stayed with me till ten oclock no unseasonable hour as it was in the month of june when either being hungry himself or willing to entertain me he insisted on my permission to send to the devil tavern for some supper a meal i never choose but in complaisance to my benefactor and also as a means of engaging his further conversation which was truly elegant i with some reluctance submitted to our one maid being gone for the other bowl of punch for the sailor the gentleman went and bespoke it himself  i could not in his absence but reflect how much the unhappy part of women disappoint even their own ends for when they throw off the appearance of modesty and show the mercenary prostitute unveiled no man of common understanding can have the least regard for them mr addison observes of some woman who kept a noted house of civil reception that she said no girl was fit even for her who was past blushing well said the dean in the following lines o decency celestial maid descend from heaven to beautys aid though beauty may beget desire it is thou must fan the lovers fire to hold him in delusion still and make him fancy what you will and i do assure my reader i did not forget to return thanks to the almighty who had enabled me to live by his gifts to me for sure i am that i could raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart for gold and drop my blood for drams shakespeare  mr e  es return broke off my contemplation he had ordered a slight but elegant repast with a flask of champaigne we supped together with great pleasure and except the dissonant and unharmonious noise made by our neighbors who were now got so merry that they did what they called sing we had no interruption but talked of history poetry and every muselike theme called all the mighty dead before us rejudged their acts commented on the works of milton shakespeare spencer and all the british classics refined delight and fitted to endure but what can human happiness secure delany  the star that ushers in the rosy dawn began to reassume her empire over the dusk and drowsy world the bell tolled one a signal of departure to my amiable guest whose kind injunctions in regard to my removal i promised to obey  the maid whom her mistress half starved and though she was really her betters used so ill that she downright hated her told me that the sailor and she were gone to bed together both dead drunk  and yet this creature would talk of virtue nay go to church but to say the truth she only went there to pick up a gallant  as i was not in the least sleepy i dismissed the servant and revolving in my clouded soul the various turns of things below now and then a sigh i stole and tears began to flow i opened the window looked at the moon riding near her highest noon like one who had been led astray through the heavens wide pathless way and often as if her head she bowed stooping through a fleecy cloud in short i was wrapped in a pleasing fit of melancholy and had i been in the country midst vernal airs and blooms should have attuned my rural minstrelsy to some high theme but alas ease and retirement those friends to the muse ever were denied to me being in a populous city pent amidst the busy hum of men obliged to work for daily bread and often not obtaining even that poor pittance  oh that i could now retire that some charitable hand would bestow on my poor remains of life even but a clay habitation in some sequestered scene where on every thorn delightful wisdom grows in every rill a sweet instruction flows how happy should i think myself  my readers will i hope acknowledge i deal heartily with them when i not only acquaint them with my actions but reveal to them even the inmost recesses of my soul as freely as to heaven  at length remembering that nature requires a time of rest i thought it but meet to indulge the pleasing heaviness or in plainer language i went to bed and enjoyed the honeydew of sleep till it was very late in the day  it seems the maid had on purpose to mortify her mistress told her how genteely mr e  e had entertained me which though she herself had been guilty of such foul intemperance and swinish gluttony raised her indignation to such a height that she downright affronted me telling me i had no business with her gallant why said i sure you had him all to yourself i did not interfere for i supposed she meant honest tar but it seems i was mistaken for it was mr e  e whom she had so politely dismissed and whom now she had called a hundred scrubs assuring me she could never make any thing of him and really i believed her and by what i then saw of her temper i am certain had she known he had made me a present i should not have escaped without a good beating  well said she at last i warrant i had a better chap than your fine beau this was speaking pretty plain my man gave me a crown and victuals and liquor enough now be sincere what did that mr maiden give you for what said i i have nothing to sell you who keep a shop and are in the way of trade may easily dispose of five shillings worth of goods  the wretch knew not what answer to make to me to acknowledge herself a prostitute as i did not seem to think her one was too vile even for her and to have given but the most remote hint that she suspected any evil correspondence between mr e  e and me laid her absolutely at our mercy  however she turned off the discourse with what mr addison terms a horselaugh an excellent expedient to supply the lack of brains and which whoever can secure on their side are sure of victory for who can stand it let it be ever so injudiciously bestowed  this i have very lately experienced when one w  dw  rd a player got the laugh against me who never vied with his superior excellence only by saying what shall a tumbler set me thus adrift i the successor of immortal swift oh that his words had been true that he had bequeathed to me the precious legacy of his wit and learning or that when all sublimed he rose to heaven i had inherited his sacred mantle then midst the prophets might i in strains such as delight the ear of god pour forth unfettered harmony   but to descend to this terrene spot i dressed and wandered forth in quest of a new lodging not well knowing this part of the town i past through a very clean court all inhabited by jewellers and just opposite to the end of it saw on the window of what they in london call a twist shop a bill up to let the first floor the woman of the house showed me the apartment the furniture was not only new but rich and i concluded the price would be too high for me but to my great surprise the woman of the house agreed not only to furnish me with linen but also with plate and china for five shillings a week there was but one inconvenience which was that there was no passage into the house but through the shop to which if they did not object i had no cause it so fortuned that the countess of essexs woman whom i had known at the laundresss beforementioned came in and gave me so high a character that we agreed on my taking possession of my new apartment the next day  i went from this to a friends to dinner and did not return home till ten at night but never in my life was i more highly provoked for lo my landlady and some fellow or other were in my bed the maid never apprized me of it being willing to expose her brutal mistress to the utmost but showed me into the chamber  i am certain i was infinitely more ashamed than she was for she called to me to sit down on the bed side but i hastened out and as i could not take up with her bed i was obliged to sit up all night  pretty soon in the morning a woman came to see me she and i packed up my clothes called a porter and made him carry them to my new abode and as i hoped never to see the wretch again i did not bid her adieu  my landlord was a mastertaylor in very good circumstances and his wife a very sober modest woman  i past a week over very calmly when remembering my promise to mr e  e i wrote a line to him but as i did not know what street i was in i enquired of my landlady who with very great reluctance told me it was drury lane i was extremely concerned at this piece of information which she observed and assured me i might enquire into her own and her husbands character that they had kept their lodgings empty sooner than let them to any idle person though they could have had a good price for them and a great deal more to the same effect all which though i did most steadfastly believe yet i held it no proper place for me of all persons in the world to reside in  women whose characters are unblemished or who have their husbands with them as guardians to it may do a thousand things which those who have fallen on evil days and evil tongues in prudence must avoid  i did not directly tell my landlady that i must leave her being resolved if possible not to remove till i could find a place where i could be fixed  accordingly i once more took my way to st jamess and called upon my old landlady there her first floor was let but the second being tolerably genteel we as we had always been on very friendterms soon made a bargain for it and i was to enter on it as soon as my week for the other was up the very air of st jamess always pleased me and indeed i received so many favors from the nobility that i had just cause to prefer it to any other part of london  this happened to be some public festival which as i did not recollect i sat with the good old gentlewoman till evening when on my return home there was a large bonfire and a great crowd at the templegate i stopped a little being startled and not well knowing how to pass by when an old gentleman very well dressed asked me where i was going i told him which was truth i had mistaken my way being a stranger he said if i would let him know where i lived he would wait on me home i was almost ashamed to do it yet considering they were creditable people where i lodged i ventured to inform him my landlord happened to be his tailor so he readily conducted me to his house the people saluted him and asked him for his lady and family why said he this is one of them she is a near relation to my wife i was surprised at this new kindred and could not tell whether the old gentleman spoke truth or not though i could not recollect i had ever seen him before yet as the landlord treated him with the highest respect i thought it not convenient to contradict him so i invited him in and wondered where this would end  my landlady lighted us up to my dining room he told her i had dined at his house and that after so long a walk i must needs be dry and therefore desired her to get him a bottle of wine and a plate of scotch collops from some particular tavern he directed her to  as i found the old gentleman did not stick at telling one lie i concluded all he said was false as it really was  she no sooner departed but he asked me whether he was not an able politician i said he was a merry gentleman and i hoped as i had the honor of being his cousin he would let me know who he was lest i should be asked any cross questions and our accounts should vary  he told me his name and where he lived that he had a considerable estate and also a good employment under the government all of which did not make him happy because heaven had not blessed him with a child  he then asked me who i was for he said he was sure i had had a good education as i had no reason to doubt of his sincerity i told him my story with which he seemed much affected and in conclusion i assured him i was more unhappy in having children from whom in all probability i was for ever separated than he could be who never had one  here my landlady brought in supper to which he invited her to stay our conversation turned on general topics it grew pretty late when to my great astonishment the gentleman said cousin i think you told me you wanted money i have a good deal of yours in my hands though not much about me at present however here are a couple of guineas when you want fifty you know where to come would i did thought i but it was no time for me to refuse them  when he went away i knew not what to think of this odd adventure sometimes i fancied it was a dream and dreaded to wake lest the gold should vanish then i began to flatter myself that perhaps some relation had left me a legacy but having never since my distress received the smallest favor from one of them i could hardly hope they should now feel any compunctuous visitings of nature who were all to me remorseless as the sea  in short the more i thought the more i was perplexed and could only humbly hope that the protecting hand of him who  does the raven feed yea providentially catereth for the sparrow assisted me to live for some good end best to his wisdom known so recommending myself to his paternal care who had compassion on my sorrows i went to my repose  early next morning the woman of the house told me there was a lady waiting for me in the dining room so i arose and who should it be but my late odious landlady  my reader may judge how welcome she was she told me there was a gentlewoman waiting for me at her house who had business of the utmost consequence and very much to my advantage to impart to me though i scarce gave credit to her yet curiosity made me accompany her home where i beheld a mavelous illfavored old woman her chin which had on it a comely black beard almost met her nose there not being a tooth in the way to bar their union i am sure had don quixote seen her he would have endeavored to disenchant her mustachios her eyes were black and fierce her back nobly prominent her dress tawdry and take her for all in all i hope i never shall look upon her like again i was doubtful whether it was not a man in womans clothes but if it were a creature of the feminine gender i concluded it must be a witch and that the study of the black art had made her so hairy about the face that she had need of a barber but to proceed she accosted me very civilly in a deep connaught brogue told me she knew all my good family and lived in the same parish with me in dublin i soon grew tired of her fulsome flattery to me and them and desired to know her commands she told me my lord g  lw  y had a great regard for my father and was very desirous of seeing me  and would be a friend to me and if i would dine with her next day he would meet me i now began to guess at my ladys occupation and gave her a point blank denial not but that i should have been glad to see his lordship as i knew he had a regard for my father but a woman must appear in a comtemptible light when introduced to a nobleman by one of the devils agents so i left madam to her meditations and departed to her no small discomfort for it was a golden guinea out of her way as it seems my lords price was two one of which he presented to madam procuress and the other to the lady who granted him a favor  this infernal embassadress had taken on her the name of cunningham being as she said ruined by a gentleman of that name who had recommended her to several of the irish noblemen as a very necessary person oh how detestable it is to feed a maw or clothe a back by such a filthy vice  well at the appointed time i returned to st jamess and the first day i was there i was honored with a letter from lord g  lw  y as follows madam i thought i had had the honor of being known to you but find i have been imposed upon if you will permit me to pay my respects to you this evening i will unfold this mystery to you and am very sincerely  madam your most obedient servant g     i returned my compliments to his lordship and gladly excepted of the honor of his company  about six he came and related to me the trick mrs cunningham had put on him he told me he had employed her to find me out having a curiosity to see a person he had so often heard of both at whites and in ireland that the appointment was made and a lady introduced to him whom by his description of her i knew to be the odious mrs smith my shocking landlady  he said he was much disappointed when he saw her but the lady was very kind nay so kind that he could not resist her  as you stood at your window this morning colonel d  ne  be asked me knowing i was one of the commissioners of ireland whether i knew you i answered no  why said he that is a little irish muse a physicians daughter and a parsons wife an eloped one i have been told but she will not confess that on this i asked your name the colonel said it was pilkington but you were usually called mrs meade i then found i had been deceived and wrote immediately to you  i told his lordship i had the honor of having many representatives which had been of very great disadvantage to my character inasmuch as they were pretty liberal of their favors which were placed to my account though i knew nothing of the matter my lord said that was hard but he hoped now he had found the real mrs pilkington she would not be inexorable to turn off this sort of discourse i talked of public affairs which put my lord in the head of making me packet commissioner th  mps  n then candidate in the election for the city of y  rk with old english rhymes after the manner of mother shiptons prophecies to inform him of the defeat he was to meet with in that year i had the good fortune to divert him with my comical stuff so well that he left me a task which was to translate a french chanson a boire he gave me a couple of guineas and promising to be a frequent visitor he took his leave  i do assure my readers i was very glad to be retained as his lordships muse and secretary  an employment both of honor and profit  i continued in favor some time and we bantered half the nobility either about their loveintrigues or parliamentary affairs all of which were well known to his lordship who honored me with his confidence and instruction  but as all happiness fades away an unforeseen accident blasted mine  my lord was seized with a fever which confined him some days the first time he was able to go abroad he wrote me word he would pass the evening with me about his appointed hour somebody tapped at the dining room door which i opened when instead of my lord entered colonel d  nc  be and mr sp  nc  r whom the colonel presented to me and made his exit  this nobleman was no more like his brother than i to hercules  for the first thing he did was to doublelock the door put the key in his pocket and by main strength oblige me to sit on his knee i told him i expected lord g  lw  y but that had no effect for he swore he should not have admittance he said he was as well entitled to a ladys favor as any lord it was to no purpose for me to assure him my lord never asked any but what were consistent with honor he gave no credit to my words and seeing he had set me weeping he said my lord was very happy in my love but that he was not worthy of it being an inconstant but as for me added he i do not come to pay you one visit but to make you mine for ever to raise such merit above distress and to make you as happy as i can  sir returned i your goodness deserves my acknowledgment but your meaning seems doubtful on what terms am i to receive those advantages on the easiest and sweetest in the world said he give me your love in return it is all i wish and running on with lord hastingss speech in his midnight visit to poor jane shore he cried be kind my charming mistress to my wishes and satisfy my panting heart with beauty   it was in vain for me to remonstrate that he had a fine young lady of his own that i was not worth the pains he took that i was not handsome he said i pleased him and that to him was beauty which he was resolutely determined to possess if not by consent he would make use of force  and truly the gentleman would soon have convinced me he was the stronger had not lord g  lw  y knocked at the door he swore i should not open it my lord called to me and said he would break the door open i begged of mr sp  nc  r to permit me to let him in and that if he would stay a moment i would frame some handsome excuse to dismiss him  he gave me the key and went into the bedchamber i opened the door for lord g  lw  y who brought with him the earl of m  dd  x a fine gentleman lord g  lw  y was either very angry or affected to appear so and really i knew not what apology to make only to say i had been asleep the noblemen seated themselves to the no small vexation of mr sp  nc  r lord g  lw  y asked me who was in the bedchamber i said nobody  well madam said he i know you are a lady of veracity but for once i presume to doubt it so saying he made to the door which stood open and mr sp  nc  r clapped it in his face doubledlocked it withinside and to my great happiness went out of another door down stairs this i was very glad of being apprehensive of a quarrel  lord g  lw  y was in a violent passion and insisted on my telling him what fellow as he called him affronted him so to satisfy him i very ingenuously told him the whole story to the infinite mirth of lord m  dd  x who i thought would have died with laughter for amongst other accidents i had in the fray lost a little paris cap i wore and as my hair was very thick never missed it  but whatever i could say would by no means pacify lord g  lw  y he called me twenty ungrateful devils and jilts and i know not what which surprised me the more as i never in my life imagined he loved me and consequently could not form any idea of his being jealous but i suppose his pride was piqued at being locked out which was the real cause of his resentment  lord m  dd  x in vain pleaded my cause till at last an odd whim of his turned our tragedy to a farce  lord m  dd  x it seems liked an italian singer on whom lord r  ym  d a very small gentleman with a mind in proportion to his diminutive figure had wrote a very stupid satire he begged of me to write a loveletter to him for he was it seems a man of gallantry and his answer i was to communicate at whites  as i was a perfect stranger to his character the nobleman dictated a fine encomium on his learning wit poetry beauty etc all of which united had it seems made a conquest of me unheard unseen and made me extremely ambitious of being known to so accomplished a nobleman we also gave him some poetry and a direction where to find his most enamoured nymph this done the letter was dispatched away to bondstreet and the messenger brought word i should have an answer in the morning  i know whoever reads this may very possibly censure me but all who are dependant on the favors of the great must comply with their whimsies it is enough if we are so conscientious as not to be made a slave to their vices as r  b  t n  g  t esquire civilly asked me to be  now as i have mentioned this fellow for such is the term his behavior to me merits who am in this in the same mind with pope i do not mean a fellow of t c d  that worth makes the man and want of it the fellow the rest is all but leather and prunella i hope my reader will allow me to give them a short sketch of him with regard to me and also of the mortification i had the happiness of giving him  my father attended his first wife lady e  ll  a p  k  t and i had i believe passed twenty evenings in his company in dublin he had published a poem written by the rev mr sterling called happiness as his own and another on his conversion from popery inscribed to w  m p  y now earl of b  h to whose piety he was indebted for his being drawn out of error this gave me a fine opportunity of paying him a compliment which i sent to whites he sent me word he would wait on me that evening accordingly he came  after his first salutation he very politely asked me if i could help him to a w  telling me he had married an ugly old devil for money whom he hated and wanted a girl to take into keeping which he depended on my skill to choose for him i thanked him for the honorable employment he recommended to me but assured him it was not in my power to serve him as i never conversed with women he told me he would not be a friend to me on any other terms i said i was sorry for it so making him a reverence i left the room he stayed in it some time hoping i suppose i was gone of his errand but finding i did not return he went away but to do him justice he left half a guinea on the table as a recompense for the affront he had given me  he wanted it seems to be admitted as a member of the club at whites their way of election is by ballotting and one black bean is sufficient to overturn any mans pretension to that honor i told my story so effectually that they all concluded him unfit for society and as many friends as he imagined he had amongst three hundred nobles and as vast a fortune as his wife had brought him he had but one white bean in the whole draught  however i return him thanks for his ten and sixpence to show my gratitude  but to return to my little lord r  ym  d early next morning as i was drinking tea his valet de chamber said he must speak to me i desired he might come in he was a frenchman who contrary to the rest of his country was as boorish as an english farmer he threw down a letter on the table dear my lord send a you dat i opened it and read as follows madam by your style you ought to be a gentlewoman but i have met with things of this kind which did not answer expectation i have sent my man to see you whom i always trust and so may you if he likes you and you will come where i appoint for i never venture to visit any woman i will meet you  i am madam yours r  ym  d     while i was perusing this gallant epistle the frenchman looked sharp about he even opened the corner cupboard then he demanded of me what did i want with his lord i could not resist my inclination to laugh at which he grew choleric and swore garzoon he should never come which i being quite easy about he went away muttering something  i sent his letter which was wrote in a very bad hand and almost every word misspelt to lord m  dd  x who showed it to the company at whites on whom it took the same effect it had done on me for they all laughed heartily at jackadandy a nickname lord m  x had bestowed on him  these two merry noblemen who had set me on this scheme would fain have prevailed on me to send another letter to jackadandy but i told them i did not approve of a man governed by his man and one who seemed to be a coward into the bargain lord m  dd  x then me lord r  ym  d had some reason to be fearful how he made an assignation as he had once the misfortune to be taken in by a billetdoux and when he went to the appointed place instead of a fine lady found a couple of sturdy fellows who gave him a very good cudgelling  this put me in mind of a merry story told me in london of col c  nn  m who took delight in paying his addresses to young ladies merely for amusement and no sooner did he perceive he had gained their affection but he despised his conquest  as the noblemen knew him i related one story to them out of many of a pleasant revenge a forsaken nymph took on him  this lady was of exceeding good birth very well accomplished and of unblemished reputation but not of fortune equal to his however he seemed so fond that she supposed that would be no obstacle and entirely devoted herself to the pleasure of loving him which he no sooner perceived but he grew cold civil and respectful and at last went to london without so much as bidding her farewell  her stepfather brigadier v  s  y having some call there took his lady and her children with him where though miss a  t for that was the ladys name frequently saw the colonel at court he never took the least notice of her but seemed as never acquainted this as we may presume sufficiently grieved her she made her complaint to a female confidante a lady of quality and a woman of spirit between them they contrived at least to give his vanity a terrible mortification  they wrote to him a letter as from a married duchess who was fallen in love with him at court the chairman had directions to wait for his answer but they took care that he should not be able to guess who sent it  all that the colonel could discover was that it was given to him in the street and he was ordered to leave the answer at a mercers where it would be safe delivered to the person who wrote the letter  this secrecy made him quite sure he had gained the heart of some highborn fair he failed not to send a passionate and tender return for so great an honor as the unknown charmer had done him the ladies received it and were glad to find the gudgeon swallow the bait so greedily next night he took care to dress himself with the utmost magnificence and as he is really a graceful person he made no doubt but the lady would by some favorable glance discover herself to him to this end he went to court and strictly examined the countenance of every lady of quality there to no purpose which only made him suppose the lady extremely discreet and careful of her reputation  his imaginary mistress made several appointments with him then sent him word her lord was come to town or some apology till at last tired with their sport they resolved to finish it  to this end he received a letter that the lady could not find out any place where she could without danger of discovery meet him except at his own house but begged that he might not let any of his servants be in the way that she would come in a chair exactly at ten one small tap at the door being the signal for happiness  never did knight errant propose to himself more glory in the finishing of an adventure than did our happy colonel at his near approaching bliss he had framed to himself an idea of a perfect beauty kind tender and formed for love his answer was all rapture and acknowledgment  his apartments were filled with wax lights himself curled perfumed and dressed to such advantage who could resist that beheld him he punctually obeyed the ladies commands in dismissing all the servants with orders not to appear and waited the happy minute with the impatience of a real lover every moment he looked at his watch and thought the hours ages  at length the long wished for signal was given he flew to receive the fairone when a porter delivered a bandbox into his hand and without speaking a word to him vanished never was any man in greater confusion than he at opening it he there found not only all his own soft epistles but also a little doll in a chair with a letter in her hand directed to him the purport of which was to let him know he was a conceited coxcomb to suppose any woman of quality had the least regard for him and that the lady who held that was a mistress good enough for him  the noblemen thanked me for my narration and wished the trick had been put on jackadandy such a lady being a much more suitable match for him than the colonel however we all agreed that this was no tax on the gentlemans understanding since let a man be never so wise he may be caught with sober lies and that his appearance might captivate a lady without any miracle  lord m  dd  x did me the honor to subscribe and assured me he would prevail on as many of his friends as he could to do me the same favor  next day colonel duncombe asked me did i know such a gentleman of ireland as l  ft  s h  e esquire i said i did particularly well as my brother and he were inseparable companions in the college he told me there was a parcel of letters freed by the earl thomond then just dead lying for him at whites and that he should be very glad to see him to learn some account of the particulars of lord thomonds death with whom he had for many years a strict friendship  as i had learned by accident where mr h  e lived i wrote to let him know what the colonel said he sent me a letter of thanks and that he would do himself the honor of meeting the colonel the next evening at my apartment  it so fortuned that my kind benefactor mr cibber came over with the colonel and a little after came mr h  e his politeness and the many pleasing incidents of our younger days gave me infinite delight as it was a proof that i was not an impostor and convinced the auditors i had once been in esteem even in my own country  after a good deal of agreeable chat wherein mr h  e took an opportunity of mentioning his having when he was in the college spent his whole years allowance in making one grand ball and that as on this occasion he was in disgrace with his own father he quartered himself on mine praising his elegant manner of living and the kind reception he always received from him which as he said he must ever acknowledge to his family mr cibber said he hoped as i was the only desolate person belonging to it he would be so good as to assist me he asked how it was in his power why returned he this poor lady is obliged to publish her writings by subscription and i dare say a gentleman of her own country who has so fine a fortune and knows her so many years will at least be as kind as strangers have been to her without doubt sir said mr h  e it is the duty of every gentleman to do it so rising he told me he was very sorry he was under an engagement to the duke of devonshire but that he would take another opportunity of paying his respects to me which same opportunity as he never found in london i hope he will in ireland and have such a dependence on his honor that i am certain he will keep it in being my friend  as i had the honor of being once a kind of a favorite to alderman barber i judged him a very proper person both as he had been a printer and was also a man of considerable interest to apply to both to increase my subscription and to put me into a method of getting my writings printed as cheap as i could to this end i wrote him a very respectful letter but received no answer i followed it with a second still he was silent at length i found a method to make him speak to me for recollecting the best part of a very severe satyr mr p  n had wrote on him i let him know i had it on which he invited me to his house received me very kindly apologized for his silence being ill of the gout which had hindered him from answering me and assured me as soon as he was able to go abroad he would present me as a companion to the duchess of buckingham who had promised to take one of his recommendation and who he said being in the decline of life and having no children would he was certain if i had the good fortune to please her remember me in her will but unhappily for me the alderman died a few days after nor did the duchess long survive him  so vanished my hopes  a short time after this disappointment which sensibly affected me my landlady told me there was an ugly squinting old fellow who said he had business of the utmost consequence and must speak to me i bid her show him up and found he answered her description he asked me was my name meade i said yes why then said he i am come to inform you that there is a legacy of five hundred pounds left you by one mr clark who died last week at st edmondsbury but the lady i was ordered to inquire for is mr p  ns wife are you the person i told him the direction was very right but that i neither was related to nor even acquainted with any person of the name of clark from whom i had the smallest reason to hope for such a favor nay madam returned he as you have changed your name why may not he upon this he showed me a letter to my fancy authentic wherein i was desired if living to wait on counselor clark in essexstreet in the strand who had orders to pay me the money on proof i was mrs pilkington  i knew not what to make of all this i was in hopes the fickle goddess who is well represented standing on a wheel was for once in a good humor with me and was resolved to make me amends for her former caprice or to speak more seriously that the supreme almighty being that power who builds life on death on change duration founds and gives the eternal wheels to know their rounds had taken compassion on my sufferings  while i was lost in musing on this odd adventure the old fellow asked me very gaily if i would give him my company to richmond and take a dinner with him i told him i never went abroad with persons i did not know especially men he told me he was very capable of being serviceable to me and that it was also in my power to be so to him in what sir why i have received from ireland from your husband the life of alderman barber wherein there is an account of the amors of cadenus and vanessa to which the alderman was privy and related them to mr p  n now i have been informed you have some letters of the deans which may embellish the work and also a true character of the alderman written by his chaplain i will make you a handsome consideration for them if you will give them to me to publish  this discourse surprised me almost as much as the first i therefore begged he would not hold me any longer in suspense but let me know who i conversed with he answered his name was edmund curl upon which in spite of vexation and the disappointment of my newborn hope i could not forbear laughing at the fine scheme he had laid to trick me out of any valuable manuscripts i might possibly possess so making him a courtesy i said farewell legacy  i should not trouble the reader with this story but that i have been charged with writing the life of the alderman and as i shall answer it to god i never even saw it in my life not but curiosity would have engaged me to read it especially as i heard it was very well wrote but at the time it was published i was a prisoner in the marshalsea and really had not a crown to spare for a book  as mr curl swore heartily that his letter with regard to the legacy was genuine i went the next day to counselor clark there was indeed an old gentleman of his name newly dead at st edmonsbury who had children and grandchildren heirs at law sufficient to inherit his fortune and as it happened he died intestate  however i comforted myself that mr curl had not made a fool of me as he has done of many a better writer and secured me a prisoner in his poetical garret which the ingenious mr fielding charmingly ridicules  but oh the dismal summer which ever was attended with want and all it is gloomy train not only to me but many persons who seem in good circumstances left me quite desolate and obliged me to take a cheaper lodging which i did in the house of one mrs trifoli in dukestreet st jamess a most extraordinary painted up bedizenedout old woman whose husband was a german quack not then in england from which it seems his wife had obliged him to fly for robbing her of a deed of settlement he had made to her at marriage but to say the truth i think that was a blessing to the poor man for she was a very devil incarnate unmerciful and cruel to the last degree i dare say she never in her life gave even a cup of water or a morsel of bread to keep a poor creature from starving  her custom was to live upon her lodgers even when she knew they were desolately poor inasmuch that if one of them sent but for a pint of smallbeer she would intercept it in the way and drink half of it but indeed she was very civil for she always sent them word she drank their healths and so she did in reality by depriving them of the means of preserving it  being sadly distressed by this avaritious wretch i was advised to apply to dr mead who was a man of taste and had sixty thousand pounds left him to give in such charities as he thought proper accordingly i wrote him a moving tale of my distress which had so good an effect that he sent me word he would wait on me himself the next day but not keeping his word i addressed him in the following lines to doctor mead scarce was the heavenly virgin higher blessed when visited by a celestial guest hailed by the glorious messenger of grace and honored high above the human race scarce stronger rapture could his words impart than those which lately extasyd my heart when you gods noblest image here below your honored presence promised to bestow my hope revived i waked the silent string the muse once more attund her voice to sing pleased that though long deprest by adverse fate she yet found favor with the good and great and that her melancholy flowing strain to generous mead was not addressed in vain oh thou the muses judge the muses friend say must those hopes in disappointment end must every beauteous bright idea fade and death enwrap me in his silent shade death the poor suffering wretchs last relief led in by paleeyd want and pining grief would heaven but one assisting friend supply how quickly might he bid those sorrows fly whose wisdom could my industry direct and as that merited his aid protect not thus with endless application grieved and though so often supported never relieved pardon the bold presumption of my prayer courage is often extracted from despair the drowning wretch struggles for life awhile nor god nor man condemns his anxious toil but if tempestuous billows round him rise and heaven all pity all relief denies lost in the ocean he forgotten dies   i sent these rhymes to the doctor and in return was desired to come to his house in ormondstreet at four oclock that afternoon  now were my hopes high raised high as the spring tide to which the ebb quickly succeeds as it did with me i fancied vainly fancied at least ten guineas in my pocket and had like the man with his basket of glasses turned them into trade and purchased in my mind an easy subsistence for life but i was a little mistaken in the matter as the sequel will show i dressed myself very neatly and waited on the doctor when i knocked at his door a footman with his mouth very full and a bone in his hand opened it and in an irish accent demanded my business i told him i wanted to speak to the doctor by my own shoul said he my maishter will not be spoke to by nobody well then friend if you please to let him know mrs meade is here i believe he will speak to me mishtrish maid replied he arah are you vanting charity and taakes up my maishters name to claim kin with him well stay there i will tell him so he went into a back parlour but was quite confounded when the doctor instantly came out and gave him a severe reprimand for letting me stand in the hall and i am very certain had i thought it worth my while to have acquainted the docter with his insolence he would have been discharged a proper caution to liverywearing fellows to speak with civility to every body  the doctor showed me into a handsome streetparlour adorned with several curiosities of which here needs no account he asked me for sir john meade whom because he remembered he expected i should though he died two years before i was born when i told him so he seemed displeased and really i remember that good mr cibber in his pleasant way scolded me once for not remembering king charles ii though my father was born in the reign of king william  as my answers to the doctor with relation to the whole family of the meades were sufficient to convince him i was not an impostor he asked me how he could serve me i told him i had some poems to publish but for want of a little money to pay for the printing of them i could not proceed poems returned he why did you ever know any person get money by poetry yes sir several mr pope in particular oh lud lud said he grinning horribly and squinting hideously what vanity thou have can you write like him i was quite abashed and really knew not what to say for some moments for my reader may easily perceive i could not but be sensible i had made a foolish speech unaware to myself however upon recollection i assured him i did not presume to put myself in any degree of comparison with so justly an admired writer but that perhaps on account of my sex i might find a little favor  well said he there are a couple of guineas for you this though far short of my expectations was a little present relief and as the gentleman was under no obligation to reward or encourage me i very gratefully accepted of them and yet proud was the muse i served unbred to wait a willing stranger at a great mans gate   and here gentle reader give me leave to trespass a moment on your patience to make one remark which is that amongst all the persons who are celebrated for being charitable i never met one really so and the most humane and beneficent are those whose characters have been so attacked for their humanity that at last they have even been ashamed of welldoing  i remember dr swift told me he saw a beggar attack at bishop who charitably from his abundance spared him a halfpenny and said god bless you presently after he attacked brigadier groves who threw half a crown to him and bade g  d d  m him which said he do you think the beggar prayed for at night  but as i have mentioned dr meade who was so much in love with mr pope for saying and books for meade and rarities for sloane i think i must give them also a sketch of sir ha  s to whom the doctor advised me to apply as an encourager of arts i traveled down to chelsea to wait upon him it snowed violently insomuch that i who had only a chintz gown on was wet to the skin the porter memorandum better bred than his master to whom i had sent up a compliment which as he did not deserve i shall not do him the honor to insert invited me into his lodge where after about two hours attendance i was at length permitted to enter to his supreme majesty but sure the pope himself in all his pontifical robes never was half so proud i was conducted by an escort through six or seven rooms one of which was entirely wainscotted if i may so term it with china but like the idol to whom a stately temple was consecrated which a traveller attracted by it is outward magnificence thought to find an adorable deity in and on search found a ridiculous monkey so i saw an old fellow whom i am very well convinced never saw me for he did not even vouchsafe to turn his eyes off a paper he was writing to see who came in till at last a beggarwoman entered with a sore eyed child the inside of whose eyelids he very charitably tore out with a beard of corn under which cruel operation the girl fainted but he said that was good for her it may be so for by twoheaded janus nature has framed strange doctors in her time some who will bid us live on pulse and water and others of such vinegar aspect they would not wag their jaws in way of smile though nestor swore the jest were laughable of this latter sort was sir h  ns though i had sent him up a letter which lay before him he asked me what i wanted if i had bad eyes he said he would brush them up for charity but as they happened to be tolerably good i excused myself by telling him i had brought him that letter and indeed i was quicksighted enough to find out that his honor as the beggarwoman called him was a conceited ridiculous imperious old fool  he then considered my letter over and finding by the contents dr mead had recommended me to him said poor creature i suppose you want charity there is half a crown for you i could hardly resist a strong inclination i had to quoit it as falstaff says into his face like a threepenny shovelgroat and was only constrained by the consideration that i had never a shilling in my pocket and that little as it was i could eat for it  i have here done with the great sir h  ns sl  ne b  r  of o  k  m and return to dr meade  i had forgot to tell my readers that rejuicing at my success when i returned from his house i threw the two guineas up and had the misfortune to lose one in a chink of the room the board my landlady would never permit me to remove lest as she said i should spoil her floor this trivial accident gave me a great deal of uneasiness as it put me out of power of paying and quitting her according to my intention  however as i was obliged to live by my wits which indeed were almost at an end i formed a scheme to write a panegyric on p  p lord h  k then newly created l  d h  h c  r of e  d i did not address him in the manner i had done a great many of the nobility that is with my one poem which i sent all round like the bishops pastoral letter it was as swift says  in another reign change but the name twill do again i wrote a fire new one for himself which was really paying him a higher compliment than he deserved as my readers may perceive hereafter i had completed the poem and sent it to him he desired me to come to him on sunday that being his only leisure time   accordingly i waited on him at eight oclock on sunday morning the house had rather the appearance of desolation and poverty than that of the l  d ch  ll  r of br  n he had complaisance enough to send his macebearer to keep me company till such time as a pair of foldingdoors flew open and my lord appeared in his robes ready to go to church he bowed down to the ground to me and asked me if i would drink a dish of chocolate with him which you may not doubt i accepted of and was surprised to find myself though sunk in the most abject poverty sitting with so great a man  so for my labor i got a dish of mem chocolate a word used by a very eminent comedian one mr foot for satire chocolate which i now return with the utmost humility to his l  d  p again  so my lord went to church where i also went i there saw doctor meade who perceiving his lordship made me a low bow made one four times as low and i could very hardly refrain laughing at them both and thinking  that all this worlds a stage and all the men and women merely actors and that if every just man that now pines with want had but a moderate and beseeming share of that which lewdly pampered luxury now heaps upon some few with vast excess natures full blessings would be well dispensed in unsuperfluous even proportion and she no whit encumbered by her store and then the giver would be better thanked his praise due paid for swinish gluttony never looks to heaven amidst his gorgeous feast but with besotted base ingratitude crams and blasphemes his feeder miltons comus  well i could find no remedy for the consumption of my purse nor borrow to linger out the disease any where but from the pawnbroker but he was always charitable  however i concealed my distress with the utmost care from my landlady called every morning for the teakettle though i had no tea  then i said i was engaged to dine abroad and took a solitary walk to westminsterabby  and ranged the solemn isles alone envying those who rested in peace from their labors till at last having been three days and three nights without food of any kind heaven pardon me a melancholy thought came into my head that it was better to die at once than die daily and that as i could not fardles bear it was best to make my own quietus and no longer strive to keep up a frail and feverish being and here indeed i own i had been unmindful of the crown which virtue gives after this mortal coil to her true servants despair vanquished me quite nay so artful was the enemy as even to persuade me i had a right to dispose of my own life especially when there did not seem even a possibility of preserving it filled with gloomy ideas i took my usual walk and took notice of the corner between the monuments of shakespeare and row where i wished to be interred and that mr popes lines how loved bow honored once avails me not to whom related or by whom begot an heap of dust alone remains of me it is all i am it is all the proud shall be might be my epitaph i really found room for meditation even to madness  in this temper i went into st jamess park and seated myself by rosamonds pond the moon apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and i waited in the silent shade resolved to execute my dreadful purpose as soon as i could do it without observation when a young lady and an old one both very well dressed seated themselves by me they in an elegant style began to praise the sweet and solemn beauties of the moonlight scene the winds gently whispered through the fragrant limetrees just then in full flower and indeed though they were not vernal airs they might have dissipated all anguish but despair finding that notwithstanding my taciturnity the ladies would enter into conversation with me i could not in point of good breeding refuse to return them answers with as much politeness as i was mistress of till at length we were so pleased with each other that time insensibly flying we found we were locked into the park but the ladies whose garden opened into it insisted on my accompanying them to supper  we were let in at a backdoor by a servant in livery to a very genteel house where on a sopha sat a very handsome man in a gold brocade nightgown to whom the young lady presented me and said he was her spouse the cloth was ready laid and a cold supper on the table i would very fain have prevailed on the lady to permit me to go through her house home for i could easily perceive the gentlemans civility was quite forced and that he was impatient to revenge on his wife the liberty she had taken of inviting a stranger in which indeed i believe she did on no other account but that she thought decency would prevent him from giving her a beating of which it seems he was very liberal though he was but a footman when the lady married him and threw herself and twenty thousand pounds away upon him as i afterward learned  but as the late earl of pembroke observed when he was told a maid of honor who was very handsome was in love with him notwithstanding he was an old humpbackd man but one of infinite wit said faith it may be so women have strange fancies  i though foodless never spent three hours more disagreeably especially as this house brought back to my mind the fear and terror i always felt in mr p  ns to which if my father mother or any friend came it threw me into agonies being well assured they would never depart without receiving some gross affront such as the two following stories trivial as they are may serve to illustrate  one alhallows eve a night of pleasure and disport in ireland among the young maidens and batchelors my brother and sister who had invited some persons agreeable to their own age to celebrate it with them very fairly begged of us old folks to go abroad to oblige them and myself also i begged of doctor delany who dined with us and my father and mother to come home with me and try if we could not be as cheerful as they i no sooner proposed the scheme than they all agreed to it as my father was no supperman i had ordered a custard to be made for him and having a barnstable oven it was put into it to bake  while we were amusing ourselves in agreeable chat entered mr p  n like the description of winter striding the gloomy blast and observing a smoke occasioned by the lighting of the oven he descended to examine the contents thereof found the custard eat most part of it and sent the remainder out of doors telling us to our faces we should not liquor our chops at his expense though memorandum my dear father always sent his supper and wine before him whenever he vouchsafed us the honor of a visit  the second instance of my spouses goodnature was that though he had no less than thirteen hens he knowing i liked a newlaid egg for my supper watched the henroost close and every egg was in a basket sent to the widow w  rr  n covered with a damask napkin of which she got no less than eighteen given to me by brigadier meade at length one evening when my husband was abroad my brother and sister came to visit me when the clock struck ten i concluded mr p  n would not come home to supper and i had the impudence to eat two eggs they were scarce down when he came in my brother had sent for a bottle of wine and invited his reverence to drink a glass but mem he says in one of his letters that the nobility scorned me and my vile insinuations and impudence he scorned us and our vile insinuations and as he always kept an exact reckoning for his poultry he very magisterially ordered his eggs to be got ready this was a thunderclap to me however as it was in vain to attempt to hide my guilt i was forced to confess the horrid fact upon which he stood aghast as though he had seen churchyards yawn and hell itself breathe forth contagion to the world  what said he did you eat my black hens egg could not any other satisfy your dirty guts i wish the devil was in the egg and that it had choked you  i answered he had preferred his charitable wish too late and lest it should take any effect i drank a glass of my brothers wine that i might digest all together  oh let the world judge how happy i was but to return  though my park adventure had diverted the execution of my sad scheme for one evening yet as it had brought me no relief i still kept my purpose and resolved to fulfill it the next to this end i came and sat in the same place i made several attempts to throw myself in and still when i came near the water the fear of something after death puzzled the will i examined my heart strictly to know what gross offense i had ever committed that it should please heaven to try me with afflictions to steep me in poverty up to the very lips give to captivity me and my utmost hopes for had i ever refused my morsel to the hungry or ever filled the widows eyes with tears i should not wonder at it quite lost in these melancholy reflections i was waked as from a dream by a very well dressed gentleman who tapped me on the shoulder and said lord can this be mrs pilkington i looked at him earnestly and recollecting i had seen his face before answered it was all the remains of her that was mrs pilkington may i presume madam to ask on what intention you are sitting her i fancy he perceived by my looks the disorder of my soul which i believe was strongly pictured there i begged he would leave me to myself  but he insisted on my going along with him to the royal vineyard which was not far off  it was in vain to refuse him he would take no denial when we were got about half way i very seriously demanded of him who he was he answered he was capt hamilton who had once the honor of seeing me at my uncle van lewens in cork and who should think himself very happy if it was any way in his power to serve me we got a cold fowl and some ham of which i eat a little and took a glass or two of champaigne and i found it revive me very much we then fell into discourse and i very sincerely related to him my unhappy situation and the peril his appearance had delivered me from my story affected him so much that it drew tears from him  after we had regaled ourselves it growing late we left the park and he was so kind to see me to my lodging where putting a couple of guineas into my hand we parted and he promised to see me next morning but i saw him no more  i am sure when mr p  n comes to this part of my story he will wish the gentleman had been buried sooner than he should do him so ill an office as that of saving my life but i among other things was born to let the world see what the inside of a priest is made of prompt or to stab or saint to save or damn heavens swiss who fight for any god or man pope take notice i always except the good and valuable part of the clergy whom nobody more highly respects and honors than i sincerely do for when they possess like berkley every virtue under heaven who can refuse it  i once more began to believe myself under the favor and protection of the almighty as his hand though to me invisible visibly led me through various mazes perplexed with error and determined whatever sufferings he was pleased to inflict to bear them with resignation and never permit them to triumph over a christian faith  and a severe and cruel trial of my constancy i quickly experienced there was a young woman who lodged in the garret whom i not only to the utmost of my power supported as she was my countrywoman and in great distress but also as she said she was related to the lord powerscourt her maiden name as she told me was craggs his lordship may better know whether this was true or false than i can presume to do however i had often made her a confidante to my distress which she as constantly revealed to my inexorable landlady who one day pretending great compassion told me what a snake i harbored in my bosom and said as she had learned from her that i had several valuable things in pawn she would release them and keep them in her own hands till such time as i could pay her the trifle i owed her i thought this a kind offer and with great acknowledgment accepted of it oh what a fool was i to suspect such a jew of any remorse i gave her a line to the pawnbroker empowering her to receive whatever he had of mine and out of my two guineas paid her one she laid out two guineas took the goods into her own hands and ever she came home took out a writ against me for the money she had paid for them  this was on a friday it rained excescessively all day to which i attributed both her staying and the extreme lowness and dejection of spirit i labored under i called to mrs craggs to bear me company but as she had told my christian name to my landlady in order to have me properly arrested she did not think convenient to come to me  at length the old beldam returned and in a merry way asked me did not i think she had run away with my things i answered no  they were not worth her while she complained of being very dry upon which i was weak enough to treat her with some porter  my reader will please to observe i was at this time employed in writing a tragedy called the roman father from the story of virginius and virginia two acts of which i had finished but as at the same time there were two bad plays wrote on that subject i did not think proper to go on with it it was lying on my window and after some chat with the old woman being very much depressed in spirit i went to bed  early next morning to my no small surprise entered a couple of illfavored fellows the sight of whom struck terror to my soul i demanded their business one of them answered get up you irish papist bitch and come along with us the other who had employed himself in looking over my papers cried ay the irish whore here is something about some roman father that is the pope and be damned to you is it i was for some time quite speechless but when i recovered strength enough to speak i begged of them to leave the room till i put on my clothes but my landlady coming in at that instant cried youre damned modest  dont quit the place the fellows who had more decency than she looked out at the window while i dressed myself in which time my agony was inconceivable they called a coach and thrusting me into it conveyed me to the house of an officer of mace at charing cross as i happened to have a guinea in my pocket i called for a room and a pint of wine and then considered if i had one friend i could apply to my dear mr cibber was out of town as were likewise most of the nobility however i saw young mr cibber go by the window and sent to him but like all the world when he heard my condition he would not come near me my whole debt was forty shillings o what could i do but give my tears vent which was my only relief and next day after paying twenty shillings i was conveyed to the marshalsea prison i sat withinside of the lodge for some minutes quite stupefied till at length a man came and asked me if i was a prisoner which it seems he did not before know i told him i was upon which he brought me into a room where a parcel of wretches seized me and sung a long song about garnish and were going to pull my clothes off till a servant who had seen me before said for gods sake dont use dr meades wife ill upon this a most ugly woman came up and said g  d d  n you you b  h do you pretend to be dr meades wife  i am his wife i begged to be heard which was granted i told her my name was meade and my husband a clergyman in ireland oh that is a different case said she going off they were kind enough to take my word for some drink and a good decent woman said she would accept of me for a chum as they call it she brought me into a little dirty apartment where without examining any thing i in despair threw myself down on a bed i saw there and resolved never to rise again three days and nights past during which time i never tasted food of any sort at length the companion of my misery pressed me to take a little refreshment which i was persuaded do and seeing so many people in my own condition at length reconciled me to think of making myself as easy as possible and leave myself to the disposition of divine providence one morning a friend came to visit me by whom i sent a letter to dr m  de telling him my distress and among other things these lines can alas the plaintive prayer dictated by grief sincere hope to reach a friendly ear will thy kind and bounteous heart sympathize while i impart such affliction as before never hapless woman bore   i made no doubt but i should be relieved and waited impatiently for the answer which was as follows to mrs meade in the marshalsea ormondstreet october         madam i have so many applications for charity that it is impossible for me to relieve all those from your country alone are very numerous the family of the meades there are very rich and should take care of their needy branches i have for the last time sent you a guinea  i am your humble servant r m     i kept the original of this by me with a resolution when i should these unlucky deeds relate not to omit it this was soon gone i had many to satisfy i then wrote to henry furnese esquire who in a polite manner sent me a guinea which doubled the obligation for oh believe me it is a dreadful task to generous minds to be compelled to ask more dreadful still to have a suit denied or take a niggard alms given with contempt and pride i was by this supported till my dear mr cibber came to town who was no sooner acquainted with my misfortune than he sent me a guinea all changed into sixpences lest it should tempt some one to pick my pocket this was an instance of singular humanity but he has often said when he did good to people in distress it was only to ease his own mind which would otherwise have been on the rack oh heavens what innate goodness must dwell in that breast  seeing the woman that accused me for being the doctors wife lying dead drunk in the puddle i asked my companion who she was madam i will tell you said she she was a servant to dr m  de who had a child by her and supported her in his house for some time at length they parted and he was to allow her five guineas a week but the doctor marrying his present lady began to be remiss in his payments which enraged madam to such a degree that forgetting decency she went to his house and in presence of all his servants abused and exposed him to the utmost of her power  upon this the doctor stepped into his chariot and ordered it to drive to her lodging where finding she was indebted to her landlord one mr bradst  t famous for being a spy for the d  of c  he desired him to arrest and put her in jail this artful fellow alleged it would be very expensive but the doctor having charitymoney enough to supply such exigencies said he valued not the expense so she was secured upon this the poor wretch was arrested and thrown into jail and from time to time bradst  t got three hundred pounds of the doctor for keeping her there till at length the doctor growing weary of the expense consented to her releasement but she had so entirely devoted herself to drinking that she died a few days after she obtained her liberty  and so let this be booked among other of his good works such as combing the ladies heads etc etc  i think it is a great pity that every charitably disposed person is not his own almoner since it is a thousand to one whether that which was intended to help the distressed and innocent is not applied to the service of luxury and vice i am sure to my own knowledge in several instances it has been so by the dctr who has many affairs of the same nature on his hands and to quote his favorite mr pope now in such exigencies not to need upon my word you must be rich indeed a noble superfluity it craves not for yourself but for your whores and knaves   i remember twenty years ago to have heard dr delany say from the pulpit it was a glorious thing for a man to be his own executor i dare say he never preached but what he practiced and except that eternal treasure which he has wisely laid up in store where neither moth nor rust can corrupt nor thieves break through and steal whenever he comes to pay his mortal debt  which hour be far away  all he will have left on this side of a blessed and glorious immortality will be a shower of orphans and of widows tears to bedew the consecrated earth where his honored remains shall rest in peace till summoned to partake of that bliss prepared by the almighty before all worlds for souls like his  as i have frequently observed to my readers that i was glad to run away from such a disagreeable theme as my misfortunes i hope for their pardon though i am obliged to return to them again and give them an account even of so dismal a place as a jail  our headturnkey happened to have been a servant to alderman barber and like joseph i found favor in the sight of my keeper as he had seen me in better days for certes i had looked on better days and had with holy bell been knolld to church and sat at good mens feasts and wiped the eye of drops which sacred pity had engendered this man took great compassion on me and as on every friday which is courtday the prisoners are all locked up in their respective apartments lest when the gates are thrown open for the admission of the judge and lawyers any of them should make their escape i was always indulged in the liberty of hearing the trials which as a court of judicature was a scene i had never before beheld greatly amused me  and indeed i quickly perceived sir richard steel was not mistaken when he said the first second and third excellence of a lawyer was tautology  yet this was but a transitory relaxation once in a week the horror of my condition returned with double violence the moment i heard the key turn for my confinement  if mr p  n should allege that i have been severe on him in my writings let him but consider the extremity that he drove a worthy gentlemans daughter to nurtured in ease and plenty and if he does not acquit me i am sure the rest of the world will  we had a sort of a chapel belonging to the jail where dr friend a clergyman brother to dr friend the physician obliged us with divine service every sunday this gentleman was himself a prisoner in the kings bench and after all the grandeur he had once lived in was now so low reduced as even to be beholden to such an unfortunate creature as i for sixpence which unfortunate as i was i could not refuse to so fine an orator a gntleman and by all accounts only undone by boundless generosity and hospitalty  the first day i heard him preach i was charmed with his elocution but the rest of the congregation mad and drunk bade him hold his tongue  he indeed like orpheus played to wolves and bears nor were they half so obliging to him as the storms were to arion neither could he though uttering dulcet and harmonious sounds make the rude crowd grow civil with his song  this fine gentleman i often invited to my lonely mansion  he was not a little surprised to hear my mournful story  and indeed it somewhat alleviated my sorrow to find such a companion  poor gentleman death has released him i am sure i should have done it had the almighty given me a power equal to my inclination to serve him  however i may praise god that i was under him the happy instrument of good to numbers of my wretched fellow creatures since by one pathetic memorial i wrote for them the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners reached the hearts of the legislative powers and obtained an act of grace for them  but as it was now near christmas and the act was not to take place till the june following i used my utmost endeavors to procure my own liberty for oh what anxious moments must have passed between that dreadful interval of time on a second application to mr cibber he used all his power with the great for me and as he had been used to move their passions did it effectually on my behalf insomuch than no less than sixteen dukes contributed a guinea apiece toward my enlargement  when i read over these words discharge from your custody the body of etc as i was by nine weeks confinement sickness and fasting rendered quite weak the joyful surprise made me faint away several times and indeed my kind benefactor had like to have frustrated his own generous design of preserving me  however after all debts extortions and dues were paid i had just thirteen shillings left with which sum i was once more permitted to breathe the open air  and go where i pleased  as soon as i got as far as london bridge i found my head turn quite giddy and my legs fail me insomuch that i went into a jewellers shop who perceiving my weak condition permitted me to sit down in it i begged of him to let some of his servants call a coach for me which he civilly complied with when i was got into it i was at a loss where to bid the coachman drive me till at last recollecting that all my writings all the little all which might make my future fortune were in the possession of mrs trifoli the woman who had cast me into misery unspeakable which not to teize my readers i have slightly passed over for what entertainment can it possibly give to the curious learned or polite reader to hear from me what every person who has ever been in a jail can relate as well as i  well i was carried to her house where as i told her i did not know where to lodge that night she kindly accepted of me for a bedfellow but a very bad one i found for she as my spirits were quite fatigued no sooner found i was fast asleep but she picked my pocket  when i awoke in the morning she asked me to give her some tea on which taking up my pocket to give her money to go for it i found i had none when i complained of this usage she told me she was too charitable to permit me to sleep with her and now this was her reward so she insisted on my turning out of her doors and truly i knew not where to  inform my unacquainted feet through the blind mazes of a tangled world so i went dirty as i came out of jail to mr cibber for i ought before to have observed that this wretch not only secured my person but my clothes also insomuch that i had not a shift to change me till out of what charity was sent me i bought a second one in the jail  however he received me with as much regard and kindness as though i had been ever so well dressed but he charged me not to give him thanks for any thing he had done to serve me but to praise god who as he said had given me merit for child said he were you stupid insensible or wicked i should never have had the smallest compassion for you  he asked me what i now intended to do i assured him i did not know for that i neither had a lodging nor what was yet worse a shilling to get one well said he i have a little money in store for you i told your melancholy story to the duke of richmond and he gave me five guineas for you there they are  this was a lottery prize to one in my unhappy situation i could not though prohibited forbear the warmest expressions of gratitude both to his grace and mr cibber to the duke i wrote a letter of acknowledgment and provided myself with a lodging in westminster and as it was on christmas eve i obtained my liberty on new years day i published in the gazette the following lines to colley cibber esquire lost in a prisons joyless gloom chearless and dreary as the tomb where on the bed of care i lay and wept the lonely hours away when every hope and wish was fled but to be numbered with the dead you like a messenger of grace spoke my despairing soul to peace wiped off the tear from sorrows eye bid bars and bolts strong warded fly bounty the angelmen revere wrought miracles of mercy there say shall those deeds forgotten die or lost in cold oblivion lie may heaven no longer guard that breath you rescued from untimely death than gratitude attunes my lays in sweetest notes to hymn your praise nor can the song offend the ear thus offered from a soul sincere enlarged once more with joy i view the circling sun his course renew may he whose wisdom guides the spheres proportion blessings to thy years to thee may rosybosomd spring pleasure and health and plenty bring till time with gentle steps convey thy soul to realms of endless day where cherubims for thee with care unenvied deathless wreaths prepare those modest virtues you conceal shall heavenborn charity reveal and mortal goodness to improve unite you can immortal love oh let your gaiety excuse my serious melancholy muse this world appears a dream to me afflictions teach philosophy and thus alone a christian heart it is grateful raptures can impart   my dear old friend was pleased with my sense of his goodness to me only he told me my lines were more proper to be addressed to an archbishop than to him who had nothing to boast of more than a little common humanity  well being now free  and with five guineas in my pocket in flowing circumstances i began to consider in what manner i should improve them so i wrote to his grace of m  h who like lord kingsborough knows not how to give one guinea by way of relief he immediately sent me ten sealed up in a very genteel letter with his best wishes and compliments to me who was now so rich as i  but as shakespeare observes there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the height is prosperous but slighted the residue of their lives is bound in shallows and in miscry so i just then heard a clergyman was in england who was a near and intimate friend of my fathers him i addressed and was ordered to go to mr richardson a printer in salisburycourt for an answer to my letter  as i had never formed any great idea of a mem not our present set of printers who are many of them gentlemen and persons in good circumstances prrticularly my own printer by those i had seen in ireland i was very negligent of my dress any more than making myself clean but was extremely surprised when i was directed to a house of a very grand outward appearance and had it been a palace the beneficent master deserved it  i met a very civil reception from him and he not only made me breakfast but also dine with him and his agreeable wife and children after dinner he called me into his study and showed me an order he had received to pay me twelve guineas which he immediately took out of his escrutore and put it into my hand but when i went to tell them over i found i had fourteen and supposing the gentleman had made a mistake i was for returning two of them but he with a sweetness and modesty almost peculiar to himself said he hoped i would not take it ill that he had presumed to add a trifle to the bounty of my friend  i really was confounded till recollecting that i had read pamela and been told it was written by one mr richardson i asked him whether he was not the author of it he said he was the editor i told him my surprise was now over as i found he had only given to the incomparable pamela the virtues of his own worthy heart  when he reads these lines as read them i am certain he will even for the writers sake let him reflect that at least his bread was not scattered on the water but that though i have no other way of showing my gratitude for his boundless and repeated acts of humanity to me and my children but words mere words yet if every word of mine could charm down blessings on him then never should misfortune cross his foot but peace should be within his walls and plenty health and happiness his constant attendants   and now that i might if possible avoid the misery of extreme want i resolved to turn my stock into trade and after long consideration thought nothing would suit my inclination so well as a pamphletshop nor no place was so proper for my purpose as st jamess street where i should be in the center of my noble benefactors to this end i walked through it and finding one to be let which answered my purpose i directly agreed to give the landlord twentyone pounds a year for a shop parlour and kitchen but the landlord insisted upon my paying a quarters rent beforehand which though a little hard upon me as i not only had the shop to stock but furniture of all kinds to buy i complied with  so reader here was a new scene and i for the first of my family took my place behind a counter  having met with a very great bargain of prints which were sold under distress and having some knowledge in that way i resolved also to deal in them so having decorated out my windows with them to the best advantage early on monday morning i entered on my new employ  the first person who entered was lord p  st  n dressed a la mode de paris with long sloped double ruffles such as the ladies wear he took down the print of shakespeares monument and though it was marked price eighteenpence he bade me a groat for it which as it had cost me a shilling i could by no means take so he went away very much displeased and truly i began to be out of conceit with my occupation  as my dear mr cibber had made me a present of fifty of his last answer to mr pope i sat down to read it and found it so full of spirit and humor that just as it had thrown me into a hearty fit of laughter a clergyman entered who asked me what i had got new i told him my present situation he looked earnestly on me and said he was very sure of that but madam said he all are not born to be happy in this world however they may merit it which plainly demonstrates a future state where rewards and punishments will be impartially distributed but why should i tell this to mrs pilkington who may better instruct her teacher  i begged of the gentleman to inform me where i had had the honor of seeing him he told me he was son to colonel stuart who lived next door to my father before i was married and when he himself was in the college i then recollected that he used every day to send me some poetical praise and as i never before had an opportunity of thanking him for his elegant compliments i took it now  as he was desirous of giving me hansel as they call it i recommended mr cibbers letter to him as a cure for the spleen a distemper most studious and learned persons are apt to fall into he took the ghosts word for the excellence of the performance and gave me a guinea i was going to give him change but he would not accept of it so promising to be a constant customer for whatever i sold and wishing me all success he departed mem the clergyman infinitely more generous than the peer  as my obligations to mr cibber were ever present to my mind i wrote to him the following kind of paraphrase on an ode of horace to mr cibber donarem pateras hor did fortune wait upon my hand could i her various gifts command her noblest offering would i give to him whose bounty bade me live a golden goblet richly chased close by a mantling vine embraced whose fruitage round the brim should shine and seem to yield the sparkling wine or radiant gems of value rare should speak my gratitude sincere for thy far nobler gift to me inestimable liberty though poets boast a fair estate they seldom deal in gems or plate for yet in all parnassus mold there never appeared one vein of gold we toil and labor all our days for a few sprigs of barren bays they thunderproof its rage defy yet touched by envy blasted die yet verse can consecrate a name and worthy deeds consign to fame oh could i raise a song sublime triumphant over fate and time thy virtue in the lays divine should with immortal luster shine let others place phantastic joys in orient trinkets splendid toys while your exalted soul refined like heaven accepts the grateful mind   i sent these lines to my dear gentleman who presently came to me as i was once more in his neighborhood  and in his cheerful way said faith child you have praised me so that i think it is the least i can do to make you eat for a fortnight  so he gave me three guineas  as my mind was now a little at peace i began to think of my dear children whom nothing but my incapacity of doing them service and a supposition that their father took proper care of them could ever divert my thoughts from even a moment so strong is maternal love at least if every mother loves like me for really and i hope it is a pardonable frailty my very life is treasured in him whom i may properly style my only child and were he to die i should not long survive him  i know not of what impenetrable stuff his fathers heart was made of that could let such a son not only want the advantages of education which had it not been in his power to pay for it it was in his own power to bestow on him so far as instructing him in the knowledge of latin and greek which cato would not permit his son to be indebted to a slave for  and yet cato was at least as good and a much greater man than the parson surely this he might have done  no on the contrary he chose to expose him at nine years of age to every calamity in life and that he did not turn thief or pickpocket was due to gods restraining grace and providential care of him  and here i must in vindication of my child declare he never was undutiful or disrespectful to me as his father has falsely and cruelly reported he is like all persons of his age so full of mirth and overflowing spirits that i am certain the dullness his father brings as an excuse for taking him from school never was his fault  for he is  all my mirth my exercise my matter he makes my julys days short as december and with his varying playfulness kills in me thoughts which would thick my blood though i am sure only that he has too much respect for his father to throw any reflection on him yet he might properly say he let me feed with his hinds debarred me of a place in his love and as much as was in him mined my gentility by base education and i may say with truth the boy is gentle though never schooled learned full of noble device and of all sorts enchantingly beloved shakespeare as you like it  but to return i wrote to ireland to my eldest son who either through fear of his fathers anger or an illnatured spirit derived from him did not think me worth an answer however he showed the letter to his sister who in her low style sent me an affectionate letter before it reached me i heard mr ar  e was come to london and having been told my child was bound apprentice to him i did not doubt but i should find him with him so i went to wait on him he received me very politely and told me my son had left him and was gone to scotland when i demanded how they came to part he said he had pawned some of his music books and that he had complained to his father of him who asked what they might be worth it is to be presumed that they were valued to the utmost they cost upon which mr p  n ever tender said he was glad to hear that the theft as he termed it amounted to death entreating mr ar  e to prosecute the child for such he then was and declaring that nothing in the world would give him greater satisfaction than to hear that the dog was hanged  mr ar  e said mr p  ns inhumanity quite shocked him  so he corrected the boy very severely upon which he ran away from him that he had since received a letter from him which he showed to me and from thence i got a direction where to write to him i was as may be supposed infinitely disturbed at this account of my son i wrote to him that very night and informed him of what mr a  e had said i begged of him to come to me and that as his master had highly commended his musical talents i hoped by mr cibbers interest to get him engaged at one of the theaters  about ten days after having just paid my rent and bought some shopgoods on which i had laid out every penny i was worth  as i had stuck up on my shop window letters written here on any subject except the law price twelvepence petitions also drawn at the same rate mem ready money no trust  a man came in very badly dressed with a greasy leather apron before him he looked over some prints when the postman brought me a large packet marked edinburgh as i had no money i was in terrible confusion especially as the fellow cried come mistress dont keep me waiting i said i must send out for change oh said he i never go without it where is your piece upon this the leatheraprond gentleman for such he was drew out a handful of gold and throwing down a guinea said there take your money and what was yet more surprising he insisted on my taking the change for he determined he said to have me his debtor  upon this i began to have a very different opinion of my new customer than what his first appearance gave me and therefore civilly entreated his permission to peruse my letter to which he agreeing i had not read above ten lines when i burst into tears so the gentleman insisted on my laying it aside while he stayed telling me i must so far oblige him as to write a loveletter for him  upon this i invited him into the parlour and told him he must make me his confidant he said he had never mentioned love to the lady that as to her person she was very agreeable but that her mind far surpassed it so having my instructions i quickly finished my task greatly to his satisfaction insomuch that he protested i must give him leave to send for a flask of champaigne to raise my spirits which indeed were greatly oppressed  by the time he had drank a glass or two he began to talk of homer horace milton and all the poets sung an italian song and soon convinced me that dress was put on merely to disguise a fine gentleman which it was no way in his power to do i told him so and asked him why he walked in masquerade  he smiled at my question but assured me he was neither better or worse than a housepainter and that his name was tom brush  this put me in mind of an adventure i once had in ireland when one of the finest gentlemen in it came to visit me in a graziers coat and told me his name was tom long the carrier though he happened to be an english baronet with a large estate and a great employment  but i have been a lady of adventure and almost every day of my life produces some new one i am sure i ought to thank my loving husband for the opportunity he has afforded me of seeing the world from the palace to the prison for had he but permitted me to be what nature certainly intended me for a harmless household dove in all human probability i should have rested contented with my humble situation and instead of using a pen been employed with a needle to work for the little ones we might by this time have had  now after all my strange vicissitudes of good and evil fortune i sincerely declare that were i to have my wish though i should not now in the decline of life be able to struggle through misfortunes as in it is first sprightly career yet as by the bounty compassion and kindness of all my noble and honored benefactors i have the unspeakable happiness of being set above the low distresses of life now pleased remembrance builds delight on woe popes homer i think i am glad that there has been such strong proof made of my constancy without which i had scarce known how duly to praise that eternal goodness who evermore gave me strength adequate to the severe afflictions he was pleased to try me with be then all praise to him who from seeming evil still educes good and better still from thence and better still to infinite perfection   well when mr brush departed i read my dear childs letter which was as follows edinburgh sept         my dear dear mother no tongue can express the joy which the receipt of your kind letter inspired me with to find a long lost treasure for i was so positively assured you were dead that i can hardly believe my eyes when i see your dear and wellknown hand and read your beloved name which i have kissed a thousand times if it be delusion may i never be undeceived  you desire me to give you a particular account of whatever has befallen me since i had the misfortune of loosing you my dearest and only friend for i with all duty and gratitude remember your fond affection to me it is to you i am indebted that i can either read or write or know any part of my duty either to god or man for i do assure you my father neither instructed me himself nor though mr baldrick whom my grandfather put me to school to when the good old man was dead would have taught for me nothing would he permit me to go school because one day a boy threw a stone at me and i throwing another at him happened to break a pane of glass in an alehouse window for which the people followed me home and made my father pay a groat for it  upon this i received a most inhuman correction from him which was repeated every morning and night for six days together he stripped off all my clothes though in the depth of winter and locked them up leaving me without any covering but my shirt in the dark back kitchen which as you may remember was in the winter overflowed with water charging the servants not to give me a morsel of food and that i am alive is due to gods providence who i hope preserved me to be a comfort to you  however the servants though they had but a groat a day allowed them to live upon used to give me share of their bread and buttermilk and when my father was abroad would permit me to warm my body at the kitchen fire nay and as my father said it was too much indulgence for me to sleep with his footman the poor fellow used to let me lie down in the day where i spent most of my time and was neither allowed pen ink or book to amuse me  i will in some time give you a full history but at present shall confine myself to mr a  es affair i lived with him some time before i was bound apprentice in which i was used very well but as soon as that was done the scene was changed mrs a  e who was prodigiously fond of gin used to take so much of it that she seldom knew what she did and would often persuade her husband to believe well or ill of me just as she was drunk or sober it was in one of these fits she was when tommy l  e landed who is really a worthless conceited fellow and because he thought i did not sufficiently admire his fine singing used by way of fun to set mrs a  e on to abuse me and mr a  e who is really a goodnatured man i was discharged from fetching halfquarterns to my mistress and there being an old box in the garret in which mr a  e kept some musickbooks she went up to examine it and said there were some of them stole he who did not know what number of books there was in it said there was none gone upon which without the least ceremony she struck him in the face swearing by the great god if he did not correct me she would do it herself i who was not far off and heard this discourse made the best of my way out of the house which mrs a  e taking as a proof of guilt and a villainous maid she had joining with her she searched the house and swore she had lost many things as brass candlesticks bottles etc all this poor mr a  e was obliged to agree to for quietness sake when i had staid a day away i wrote to him telling him i was surprised at his suspicions of me and that i was willing to return he came directly with the messenger and brought me home i stayed there till night when mr l  e coming in and hearing i was there called for his horsewhip and mr a  e his wife and l  e were beating me for three hours to make me confess what i had done with the books swearing they would cut me to death if i did not own i was forced one time to say that i sold them another that i gave them away to get a little respite so when they had made me confess to what they pleased i was put to bed and locked in in order to be sent to newgate next day  i stayed all night never slept and all the next day did not eat a morsel in the evening they were rehearsing comus when i shot back the lock of my prison and finding the other door open i took off my shoes and crept down stairs got to the street and run five streets length in my stockings what advantage the maid might make of finding the door open and me gone i know not as mrs a  e said she had lost some of her jewels things the poor woman never had in her life and so far i was from a thought of taking any thing of theirs that i did not take my hat a shirt or any thing else with me now all the reason i can ever devise for her using me so was i believe because i once saw her and l  e toying on the bed together so now my dear mother as i fear i have taken up too much of your time already i shall conclude with assuring you  i am with the greatest tenderness respect and duty your affectionate son j pilkington     this account of my poor childs sufferings threw me into what they call an histerick cholick under which i languished many days but my hour was not yet come nor had my sorrows reached their summit but of that in due place  but to return to my seat behind the counter where i was tolerably content with my situation except for the concern i felt for my children from whom i could seldom disengage my thoughts although the sad remembrance grieves my soul i must proceed i went to indulge a pleasing fit of melancholy into westminsterabbey where breathing paint and speaking marbles show what worthies form the hallowed mold below i wandered through the cloisters reading the inscriptions till it grew duskish i hastened to the great gate but was infinitely shocked to find i was locked into the solitary mansions of the dead i called aloud to no purpose except to fright myself with my own voice reverborated through long sounding isles and intermingled graves it is scarce in the power of imagination to paint the horror which possessed me especially as by the glimpses of the moon the statues which had before been subjects of amusement to me now looked dreadful when each molehill ant swelled to a huge olympus i knew not what to do but if possible take sanctuary at the altar  i went up to the iron wicket which opens into that part of the abbey where divine service is performed and to my unspeakable happiness pulled it open i thought to sit down in one of the pews till morning till recollecting the church was full of rats my terrors were again renewed and i had inclination to go into the isles yet how strong a passion is fear the very look of them terrified me till at length gathering courage even from despair i went to the communion table took off from thence a carpet which covered it and thinking i could no where be so secure from those vermin as in the pulpit i with great difficulty dragged it up where finding also a velvet cushion i seated myself and laid the cushion under my head wrapping even my face up with the carpet  i endeavored all in my power by the force of reason and religion to conquer the terrors which seized me i reflected that god was every where and able to defend me that he was not slow to hear nor impotent to save and also that the church was peculiarly under his care as consecrated to acts of holiness and both relying on his providence and committing to his protection i found my mind as tranquil and composed as if i had been at home in my bed and fell into a deep sleep and here though i may be thought whimsical or superstitious for it i cannot avoid relating my dream produced no doubt by the same set of ideas which had possessed my waking thoughts and still held their place in sleep  i imagined myself to be exactly where i was and that suddenly the graves gave up their mighty dead who walked in martial array before me i thought by some secret intuitive knowledge i became acquainted not only with their names but also with their aspects many crowned heads and sceptered hands stalked by me in venerable majesty henry v clad in armor drew in a particular manner my attention insomuch that i could not forbear blessing him i thought he smiled and with a placid air returned my salutation and said i should have been great if when i had conquered france i had not married the perfidious daughter of it who at the age of thirtyfour poisoned me this crime of hers has been truly visited on all our unhappy race who are now quite extinct  i said thanks gracious monarch he disappeared and two persons struggling for a diadem next approached death desolation and ruin were spread around them till at length a surlylooking fellow destroyed them both and all their friends  i mourned at this sad scene when lo a hero appeared who held in one hand red roses and white so blended that they looked lovely to the eye he seemed once or twice to smell to them when instantly the flowers faded and died while in their place appeared a large bag of money  next came a squat squarefaced king who held in his right hand four bloody heads one of whom i thought i knew to be that of anna bullen and the other that of the marquis of surrey  a sweetly blooming youth whose portrait was just at my back in the pulpit appeared and vanished like my dream out of which i startled by the chimes finding the bell tolled four and knowing the early service did not begin till six i once more endeavored to compose myself to rest  i must reassume my dream just where it broke off as it really occurred to me a lovely lady made her entrance holding plato in one hand and the bible in the other two men by force put a crown on her head at which she seemed terrified when immediately came a woman with a countenance like maegara attended by a train of fellows with cords axes and hatchets wheels and other implements of death and torture waited on again by persons who by their holy vestments i hoped would be at least humane but alas instead of comforting the lovely lady they forced the abovesaid fury who seemed for once inclined to pity her to permit those savage and inhuman butchers to cut off the loveliest the most learned head that ever from the prime creation adorned a woman  but to the unspeakable happiness of great britain this detestable wretch told me as i thought that philip of spain poisoned her in hopes of marrying her sister elizabeth then a prisoner in the tower  i was tired with these shadowy crowned heads passing by me like those in macbeth and wished to see the sweetly inspired laurelwreathed poets advance my wish was immediately gratified and a merry old fellow appeared who was as it were in jest lashing a whole swarm of friars piecd patched and pyebald linseywoolsey brothers bareheaded sleeveless some and shirtless others pope and though the blows were dealt pretty smart they affected to smile at them  next appeared a queen to whom a gentleman with a sweet but melancholy countenance humbly presented a volume of inimitable poetry as he was the prince of poets in his time his gloriana received it graciously and putting her hand in her pocket gave him a large bag i supposed it had been filled with gold but the poet opening it found nothing in it but grains such as they feed the hogs with of which he put a large handful into his mouth and instantly dropped down  the concern i felt for him awaked me the bell tolling for morning prayer and the sexton missing the carpet and supposing the church had been robbed was almost beside himself till i called to him and bade him not be frighted there was nothing gone the man stared at me i begged him to come and help me down for i found myself so weak i could scarce move  i then told him by what odd accident i came there he seemed amazed that i outlived it and swore heartily he would not have been in my place for all the world i begged of him to get somebody to call me a chair he went himself for one and with great goodnature brought from his own house a small phial with some cherrybrandy in it and a teacup in his pocket i am sure i wanted a cordial and therefore took a little of it though not without obliging him to accept of payment for it  when i returned home my servant who had sat up for me all night was amazed to see me so pale and dirty for the old carpet had sufficiently soiled my apparel but lest she should conceive a bad opinion of me i told her where i had been and went to bed i slept for two hours and awoke extremely ill notwithstanding which i cleaned myself and went into my shop  a young gentleman but very gravely dressed was my first customer he asked me the price of an old print in the window and seemed surprised at my asking half a crown for it assuring me it was not worth a groat i said i was sure he was too good a judge not to know the value of any print taken out of montfaucons antiquities he said he wondered why since i knew the value of the author i should be so tasteless as to cut one of them out of the work which in many places served to illustrate it particularly in the medals i assured him i had not done it but had bought them amongst a number of others the gentleman perceiving i spoke very faintly said he believed i was not well i assured him i was so ill it was with infinite difficulty i spoke at all he demanded of me who was my physician i said i had none since my dear father died who was one of the faculty then madam said he allow me to have that honor so feeling my pulse he ordered me to be bled which greatly relieved my poor head which with the agitation of spirit i had suffered over night aked ready to split as this gentleman gave me his attendance as long as i had the least complaint i should i think be highly ungrateful not to acknowledge my obligation to dr lawson  and indeed i must here say i never met with more learned more generous or more humane gentlemen than physicians yet as no general rule is without an exception dr w  lk  r refused me a subscription although every other physician had on my dear fathers account relieved his unhappy family but he alleged it would disoblige mr p  n i know not but it might yet how he came to fear him more than the rest of the world did that i know not but any excuse will serve a man to save five shillings perhaps he could not spare them as it is more than probable were he seed according to his skill he might not be worth a single marvedi and for many reasons he ought not to be severe on any womans character let him amend the females of his own family first a task i fear he will never be able to perform  i might also give the same advice to dr o  ns whose two sisters took a solitary walk over essexbridge every evening perhaps to say their prayers  but to return to albion i had one evening been invited abroad and at my return my servant told me there had been two very fine gentlemen to visit me who would not leave their names but said they would come the next morning accordingly they did one of whom i knew to be lieutenant southwel since dead and the other the l  d v  t d  le mr southwel who had been many years acquainted with me seemed rejoiced to see me but my lord looked on me with the utmost contempt nay with such an air as i had never before met with from any gentleman and cried prithee come away i thought you were to take me to a girl of sixteen though mem he was at that time married to his present lady who is by all accounts a very great beauty i assured his lordship i had been once sixteen but as it happened sixteen years had rolled over since that blooming season and that to my great mortification i could not arrest old father time mr southwel very politely said i should be always young but my lord urging his departure he whispered me that he would come and pass the evening with me  he kept his word and gave me a long detail of the calamities he had suffered on board a manofwar where because some saucy fellow called him a bastard and he in return broke his head the captain confined him sixteen weeks to his cabin but learning that he was very ill he permitted him to come upon deck he was supported by two men weak cold and trembling as he assured me and ready to faint so that he was obliged to sit down upon which the captain demanded how he dare to sit down in his presence or to wear his hat so he first knocked it off and then threw it into the sea  these indignities said he so highly provoked me that i retired to my cabin resolved if ever i set my foot on shore to call the captain to an account for them accordingly as soon as we were on english ground i challenged him for which offense i was mulcted eighteen months pay so here is the history of poor dick for you  i was sensibly touched with his narration and could not help reflecting how terribly it must be to gentlemen of family and education to bear with insults from wretches so far beneath them as those marine commanders frequently are who are perhaps advanced for being abject and no sooner are they advanced but they become insolent tyrants  and indeed i believe this is eternally the case for it is a constant remark that the worst masters and mistresses are those who have been servants themselves they know what frauds they have committed when in the like situation and consequently pry into such low affairs as persons of genteel birth and generous education could never think of and even if they were informed of them would choose to overlook  mr southwel then told me lord d  le had abused me all day though for what cause i know not but with blunt ben in love for love i merrily told my sea officer that as for my lords love or liking i valued it not of a ropes end and that mayhap i liked him as little as he did me  i almost forced him to drink a pint of wine with me and would have also forced half a guinea on him but his spirit would not admit of that  i was so highly provoked at lord d  les insolence and pride so little becoming the character of a nobleman that i could not forbear writing some lines on so proper a subject for satire which mr southwel had snatched from me and directly carried to his lordship  i went next morning to wait on admiral anson with a petition from the sister of his valet de chamber who happened to be the first man shot in his first sea engagement to whom beside a part of the prize then taken there was seven years wages due i was shown into the back parlour of a small house in hanoversquare it was well adorned with books in glass cases even from the ceiling to the floor and on this occasion as i had a thousand pounds worth of jewels left with me by mr fisher whose father kept a shop in castlestreet dublin to dispose off for him knowing how much dress commands respect i put a pair of diamond earrings into my ears tied on a diamond solitaire and as for lace and every other appurtenance to suit those ornaments i had them of my own  my glittering appearance and being in a chair soon bought the admiral down in a rich undress as he supposed by the account delivered of me i must be a woman of quality my eyes were fast engaged to the books when he entered he begged my pardon for his dishabille i turned and said i was glad for once to see learning and valor so happily united  but no sooner did he find that i had only a petition to deliver but his countenance changed to the severe and he told me he believed people thought he had brought home the wealth of the indies whereas he had not a single shilling to command no more than the meanest sailor aboard the money being all as he said paid into the treasury from whence no man without the utmost difficulty could extract one single farthing of it and having the word of so great a man i really believed it a sad discouragement to all sailors to venture their lives when even their very admirals are not rewarded  however as i told the admiral the woman was actually starving he gave me a guinea for her  when i returned home i found in my shop lord d  le mr skeffington since dead and another gentleman waiting for me lord d  le asked what he had done to provoke me to write with so much bitterness against him nay my lord what had i done to disoblige you or occasion your bestowing on me such gross abuse as mr southwel assured me you did my lord said upon his honor it was false and taking me by the hand assured me he would be a friend to me provided i gave him no more of my pen but as from that hour to this he never did me any kind of service i think the obligation void on my side and therefore present my readers with the following sketch of his inimitable character to the right honorable the l  d v  t d  le satyric muse let me prevail on thee to picture d  le fierce as the surly northern gale is proud contemptuous d  le what makes the artist rot in jail trusting the baseborn d  le the rosecheekd nymph turns wan and pale touched by infectious d  le light gossamer would turn the scale weighed against the wit of d  le nay were thy virtues put to sale a mite oerrates them d  le honor and equity shall fail ever practiced once by d  le for hell may charon hoist his sail over styx to waft cursed d  le in short my subject now grows stale i am tired with rhymes to d  le so were each fault and vice combined that ever debased the human mind to sum up all the black detail i would name the scoundrel d  le   and now my l  d as i believe i am the first poet who ever celebrated the illustrious name of st l  dg  r which name by your supposed noble and rightwell remembered fathers account you are as much entitled to as i am to that of plantagenet i hope you will according to your true nobility give me a handsome reward for this extraordinary panegyric  and here i cannot avoid relating that i believe the true cause of his l  d  ps aversion to me was this a little time after i was separated from my husband as it was quite the mode to attack me he employed one of his infernal agents to inform me he should be glad to drink a dish of tea with me i told the wretch i did not know his l  d  p and therefore hoped he would excuse me  but the harridan being resolved not to lose her reward told my l  d i would meet him somewhere indeed i do not know the place and introduced to him a great lusty masculine woman dressed in a calimanco cap and cloak or long ridinghood i believe his l  d  p wondered that such a creature had made any noise in the world so telling her he was sorry he had given her the trouble of coming there he gave her a guinea and hastly departed  a few nights after this w  rsd  le had the cure for a scold altered from shakespeares taming of a shrew into a ballad opera by mr p  n played for his own benefit i wrote a flaming prologue to it in honor of my fair countrywomen and w  rsd  le insisted on my going to see it assuring me he would have a lettice secured entirely for me or any friends i should please to bring and would himself take care of placing me and also guarding me safe out for really i was very much afraid of receiving some insult  on these promises i ventured to go when behold the lettice was full but that was no matter the ladies though my intimate friends quickly decamped and mrs dub  g the fidlers wife declared she had like to faint at the sight of the odious creature the rev mr gr  n also took to his heels so i had indeed the whole lettice for me and my company which were two young misses daughters to my landlady  my gorgon face instead of turning my enemies into stone clapped wings to their feet and made them fly down stairs like so many feathered mercuries parson and all though he was bulky and tipsy and dull and so forth though indeed those qualities might make him descend with the greater velocity and give him a natural alacrity in sinking  however by their precipitant flight i got the front row  when the play began i forgot to keep up my fan and two gentlemen of distinction in the pit bowed to me presently after the orange girl came up and said a gentleman desired i would accept of half a dozen oranges i asked who it was and she showed me a person dressed in scarlet trimmed with black as i did not know him i told her it was a mistake and a young girl who followed her in said that was l  d d  le and that the compliment was intended for her but the orange girl calling her very familiarly by her name which was nancy raymond swore to the contrary for said she you know how you used my l  d they talked to one another in the vulgar tongue being exceedingly well known to each other having both followed the same occupation of orange and oyster selling and both came up stairs into the world  to compose the animosity i bought some fruit and though i really paid for it i doubt not but his l  d  p did also  when the play was over to which i most heartily repented that i went w  rsd  le came to put me into a chair said he would sup with me and kept his word  i related to him the playhouse adventure and asked him what kind of a man l  d d  le was he told me he was both a very loose and a very ungenerous man qualities which no way recommended him to me so being honored with a second message from him i with an absolute sir not i dismissed me back the cloudy messenger  but to return  the next day a most ugly squinting mean looking fellow whose good clothes made his awkwardness but the more conspicuous came in to buy some prints his mind was portrayed in his countenance where impudence and ignorance seemed to vie for preeminence however he spoke to me with great civility and perceiving by his accent that he was an hibernian i asked him how long he had been in london curiosity lead me into a great deal of chat with him and as he knew every great family in ireland their servants at least he was able to give me a good deal of intelligence i then enquired whether business or pleasure had brought him to london he said both and pulling out his pocketbook told me he would surprise me i cannot say indeed but he did for he showed me dr swifts head engraven in vellum not in size much larger than a small locket such as they wear in rings yet so extremely like the original that there was no occasion to write the name under it several more pieces of the same curious work he showed to me and said he hoped to make his fortune by them in london  i told him i was afraid he would be disappointed as painting and statuary were the taste of the english nobility beside this is work more suited to a woman than a man if i could do it it might turn to account to me upon which of his own accord he begged i would pass his works for mine and that he would give me a third part of the profit arising from the sale of them he gave me to understand he very well knew who i was and that our united interest might be serviceable to each other an offer i did not reject  as he had many fine mantlings cut he could very quickly insert the arms so i desired he would finish one for general ch  h  l he obeyed me and i waited on the old gentleman with it and a few complimentary lines which i have now forgot i sent in my presents and the general desired i might be shown in he was in a very magnificent drawingroom adorned with stucco work the opposite door opened into a garden full blown  the general was seated on a rich sopha at a table adorned with dressingplate he desired i might sit down on a sopha opposite to him and ordered his servant to remove the table there were several vases filled with flowers sweetly smelling round the chamber and for my part i rather imagined i was in some asian palace than a house in grosvenorstreet  he thanked me for my present but madam said he it is to me quite useless as all my house is stucco work however if you will be so kind as to come up stairs with me we may perhaps find some place where a nail may be driven without injury  as the old gentleman doubted i might possibly mistake his meaning he was going to explain himself upon which i took up the picture and in very great confusion made the best speed out of his house  i had not walked above twenty yards when one of the generals footmen overtook me who told me his master was afraid i might fall in a fever if i walked in the heat of so warm a day and therefore desired i would accept of a guinea to pay my chair i took it and returned my compliments  as there was something humorous in the generals behavior i addressed him the next day in the following lines to the hon genesis ch  h  l five weeks great ch  ll to my cost cutting your coat of my arms i lost i pord my eyes i soiled my raiment not doubting of a generous payment when well i wot your whole design was bent to quarter yours with mine curse on your plaguey stucco work sure twas invented hy some turk to bid to christian art defiance and overturn each beautous science no nail forsooth their paste must enter would one were stuck in the inventor but will a chief of marlboroughs strain the offering of the muse disdain or give her reason to complain should i be seized by bailiffs setter what must i say that youre my debtor why if they threat me with a jail i will surely send to you for bail the muse and hero never should quarrel our bays thrives best beneath your laurel your province is to shine in fight but ours your noble acts to write achilles deeds had lost their glory till famous made by homers story nor can you eternize your name till we consign your praise to fame want damps the poets genial fire bounty can thoughts sublime inspire so crusted over with flint and clay the dimond scarce emits a ray till disencumberd of the mold polished with art and set in gold resplendent glory it displays and rivals phoebus noontide blaze   i never received any answer to these lines but in a very short time after i heard the general was dead  i gave the young man both his coat of arms and the guinea so we resolved next to address the earl of stair then veldt marshal  it is a very great loss to me that by the ignorance of my daughter half of my writings were burned for she never scrupled if even the fire was bad to take a whole bundle of them to enliven it but whether this may be any loss to the world i must leave to their judgment  i can recollect but very few lines of the poem to his excellency which were as follows to his excellency the earl of stair arma virumque cano virg aen in rome when all was happiness and ease in the full splendour of voluptuous days their chiefs neglected sought the silent shade till loudly summoned to their countrys aid for when tempestuous ills assault a realm they call their ablest pilot to the helm to guard their freedom to preserve their fame so godlike stair so cincinnatus came alike illustrious in their countrys cause guardians of dying liberty and laws accept my lord this offering nor refuse the varied labors of an artless muse no hrald can add luster to thy birth no poet justly praise thy noble worth yet let the fair attempt acceptance find and my weak sex plead to thy generous mind what wonders then may i hereafter do at once protected and inspired by you   a very fine young gentleman undertook to deliver my present to the earl and a servant showed me into a parlour in a few minutes the gentleman returned and said my lord desired to see me so he handed me up into a full levee of stars and different colored ribbons as i had never before been in so august an assembly i was ready to die with shame especially as there was not one of my own sex to keep me in countenance my lord in a most polite manner thanked me for the honor as he termed it i had done him and the noblemen after his example seemed to contend who should praise me most to which i could make no other return than courtesies and blushes  at length the earl of stair said there was a defect in the placing the swords which go through the veldt marshals arms which he would willingly have altered and brought me out a print of the noblemens arms who held the same dignity in france as a pattern i told his lordship i could easily alter it pray then do madam returned he for i admire your work so much that i would willingly have it quite complete accordingly it was finished and the next morning i waited on his excellency with it when to my great surprise i had no admission to him but a footman brought down five guineas to me  i was not a little surprised at this sudden alteration in his lordships mind but what had the fool who did the work done truly told major elliotson that i made a hand of his performances he told my lord  who vexed at being imposed upon sent me the trifle abovementioned which was not by any means a payment for the labor and curiosity of the work and what from a person of his station i should not have thought an extraordinary reward even for the lines  so finding the folly of the man i would not undertake to dispose of any more cut vellum but left him to make his most of it  i should never have thought this fellow worth speaking of only that my husband has said he was my gllant not that i owe any reverence or honor to him or regard what he can say any more than the idle wind but that i would not have such an imputation laid on my understanding to say i made choice of a lowborn ugly illiterate scoundrel no no mr p  n may rest assured that if i would have done him the honor to exalt his horn like that of an unicorn it should at least have been to me a cornucopia  but alas poor i have been for many years a noun substantive obliged to stand alone which praise to the eternal goodness i have done notwithstanding the various efforts of my enemies to destroy me many of whom i have lived to triumph over though they encompassed me on every side like so many bulls of basan and though they should now kick up their heels like so many wild asses in the valley of geohron though the dunces should make songs of me and though envy should my fairest deeds belie i think it would not afflict me but that i should be able to convince them i had at least patience hope and charity sufficient to make them ashamed of the injuries they have been weak and wicked enough to offer  because i would now fairly challenge my most malicious foes to answer from the tribunal of their own conscience what provocation i ever gave them to use me ill  whom have i defrauded or belyed nay indeed of whom have i spoke half the evil which it was in my power to do there are few characters immaculate and had i an inclination to retaliate injuries i am i believe able enough to do it  and sometimes one has so strong an inclination to it that it is hard to resist especially when a lady of quality that is by marriage for her grandfather was a smith at g  n and kept the sign of the horseshoe there as i have frequently heard the late lord montgarret relate could because i presumed to beg she would do me the honor of being a subscriber to me a privilege i thought a long acquaintance might have entitled me to take order my maid to be kicked and as i am really ashamed to use her ladyships words on the occasion being much too indecent for a repetition methinks she might have spared them especially to one who knew her too when she was a maid if she ever was a maid when afraid of a man if she ever was afraid   heaven knows poor  had but the leavings of half the town but he botched up a broken reputation with matrimony an admirable salve  as she was pleased to say my life could be nothing but a continued series of  i am ashamed to speak the word  i dare say had it been so she would have purchased my book sooner than the bible to indulge her private meditations especially if i had the wicked art of painting up vice in attractive colors as too many of our female writers have done to the destruction of thousands amongst whom mrs manly and mrs haywood deserve the foremost rank  but what extraordinary passions these ladies may have experienced i know not far be such knowledge from a modest woman indeed mrs haywood seems to have dropped her former luscious style and for variety presents us with the insipid her female spectators are a collection of trite stories delivered to us in stale and wornout phrases blessed revolution yet of the two less dangerous is the offense to tire the patience than mislead the sense   and here give me leave to observe that amongst the ladies who have taken up the pen i never met with but two who deserved the name of a writer the first is madam dacier whose learning mr pope while he is indebted to her for all the notes on homer endeavors to depreciate the second is mrs catherine philips the matchless orinda celebrated by mr cowly lord orrery and all the men of genius who lived in her time  i think this incomparable lady was one of the first refiners of the english numbers mr cowlys though full of wit have somewhat harsh and uncouth in them while her sentiments are great and virtuous her diction natural easy flowing and harmonious  love she wrote upon with warmth but then it was such as angels might share in without injuring their original purity her elegy on her husbands daughter is a proof of the excellency and tenderness of her own heart rarely met with in a stepmother nor could i ever read it without tears a proof it was wrote from her heart  and dear orinda gentle shade sweet poet honor of thy sex oh if thou have power to do it inspire me for sure thou art in the happy bowers of bliss praising that eternal goodness who to the loss of this world took thee early away to adorn the holiest of holies where in songs of love not illessayd below great saint thou continuest to celebrate thy maker oh pour thy spirit over my lays celestial melody inspire sweet as the royal psalmists lyre that i with thee may hymn his praise   i cannot except my own countrywoman mrs grierson find out another female writer whose works are worth reading she indeed had a happy and wellimproved genius i remember she wrote a very fine poem on bishop berkleys bermudian scheme the plan of it was this she supposes that the night before st paul suffered an angel appeared to comfort him with the future prospect of the church and the growth of christianity the angel informs him that in such a year there shall be born in the western island a great apostle who shall be known by this token it is he from words first rids philosophy and lays the dull material system by affrights the daring libertine to find naught round him but the pure allholy mind the blushing sinner from his covert draws of matters various forms and motions laws his only fortress from the atheist takes and his atomic world at once unmakes i am sorry that i cannot recollect any more of this poem or that the prophecy contained in it of the bishops converting the indians was by the avarice of some in power frustrated for surely he was well fitted for that holy mission having learning and innocence in perfection nor do i at all doubt that had this true ambassador of christ been enabled to pursue the sacred purpose of his soul but the power of working miracles would have been added to his other heavenly gifts  i have been accused of writing bitterly against the clergy i never did but when they forgot their own high calling one b  in particular says that i alexander the coppersmith have done him much wrong in talking about pence and farthings and such small coin whereas he has within these two and twenty years given me the sum total of sixteen pounds irish in hard gold out of which had i been industrious i might have made a comfortable livelihood but i am afraid had he been in my case he would have starved happy for him his father was born before him and happy is the son whose father is gone to the devil is an old proverb but indeed now my l  i take it a little unkindly that you should declare in public that you had me as well as my maid sur la tapis methinks though you are a conjurer you need not be a blab oh fie is it thus you return my generous passion for by your own account you did not pay me well why juggy mackshane the chairmans wife had a better price from you and you made her son a parson while you quarrelled with mine for having his buton holes worked in the best taste and told him he must be very wicked to be guilty of such extravagance were not you a little censorious think you why you though in the vauward of your youth have yet a strong dash of the cox  b and might excuse it in a boy well but as these said sixteen pounds are so insisted on i acknowledge to have received them and should have thanked you but that you sent me word in london you did not know who i was and that it was very impudent in me to apply to you for charity but lest you should again forget me i am willing to be your sweet remembrancer and oh by our chaste love i conjure you to make my husband a dean sure this you ought to do when you say you made him a cuckhold besides you know it was in that sweet hope i yielded up my heart then be a gentle mediator between us plead for me as you did for the fair mrs pilkington quaker though historians relate that your lady would have been as well pleased had you been less assiduous in that affair  and now i confess i am a little spiteful but it is only jealousy send me an hundred pounds to cure the anguish your infidelity has given me and i will try to conquer my hopeless illstard passion  your l  s poetry in my praise i never can forget and as it would be a loss to the world if any part of so justly an admired authors works should be buried in oblivion take oh world the following lines i scorn to drag about a flame for any she that thinks my love blame i will take a resolution to be free without return i scorn to burn and oh i will be free   your second poem is i confess a little obscure yet no doubt may have much meaning in it oh thou jow jow bow wough   and indeed i remember another r  r  author who entertained some very polite company with the following epitaph written as he assured us by himself it is very laconic here lies major brady and st comeen sure such a saint and such a major never were seen if the curious reader cannot digest this heavenborn verse why let him be graminivercus and chew the cud  but pray my l  do not you think it was a little ill judged of you to attack my character at the expense of your own and to describe yourself as such a cormorant in love that you must have two females at once why turk gregory never did such feats in arms oh ravenous hell kite would thou have maid and mistress at one fell this word admits of various readings some call it swoop some souse some swop which latter i choose swop truth is i am afraid this is apocryphal and will win no credit especially as it was after your expedition to the south of france when you were ill of the  etc etc etc  but prithee now for i think i am entitled to talk a little familiarly to you do not boast of abilities either of mind or body which you never had no person living will believe you any more than they would me if i should tell them i had been a great beauty when they could see no remains of it  but you are as the good man said of nero a very wag  hang it why should you and i go to loggerheads order your equipage to drive here tomorrow morning and let us buss as we used to do and be friends  otherwise i have two or three pieces of the same stuff of which i have given you samples at your service  lord it is a strange thing that all b  will needs be authors now would they avoid manifesting their dullness we the illiterate might conclude they were men of profound erudition and that on that account they were advanced to their high stations but the devil owes some of them a shame and is when they do his work an excellent paymaster yet it is strange this same dullness is not confined to them it descends to their sons witness our celebrated comedy the suspicious husband which but for it is neither having one character well drawn any plot any thing like a sentiment and wrote too in a gallimawfry style might be a good performance but as long as it is stamped with a name it passes current though sterling nosense  but my l  d b  though i have digressed from you yet see my love i return again ah it was well i did not even from scripture pick up an unsavory simile i am much offended that you should say when i was last at shrift with your holiness that we had no better accommodation for our feast of love but a carpet whereas i insist on it that the penance you enjoined me was as easy as a downbed could make it so here i invalidate your evidence in one point and the rest of your accusation naturally falls to the ground  but being now tired at laughing at you i will tell you an arabian tale there was a really generous man who built a fine pavilion to which were an hundred openings as the poor had free access to it they were relieved by him at every opening and avenue they blessed his goodness and his fame flew far  there was in his neighborhood the son of an old miser who was left immensely rich he was of a sordid temper yet emulous of praise so he built such another pavilion and in like manner distributed alms it so fortuned that one old man attacked him seven times in the same morning at seven of the entrances he met him again at the eighth and asked for an alms at this he lost all patience and cried did not i seven times relieve you ah quoth the poor man lord bless my lord aboulcasem i have walked three hundred times round his pavilion been three hundred times relieved and yet i am certain he does not know my face  so to apply the story god bless my dear loved lord kingsborough who gives hundreds without blowing a trumpet before his good deeds or defaming the characters of those whom his bounty blesses  i have often been surprised at one of our c  s which to show my charity i will insert o lord who alone workest great marvels send down upon our b  and c  the healthful spirit of thy grace mavelous would it be indeed if they had either health spirit or grace no doubt but the learned compilers of the liturgy had their own reasons for this supernatural invocation but why nothing less than a miracle should bless these any more than any other order of men i leave to some future commentators and hope they will oblige us with annotations on this extraordinary ejaculation  i would not incur the censure of the cl  so far as to give a hint that they are not sound no no many of them are but then it is so sound as things that are hollow impiety has made a feast of them and now that their bones are marrowless their blood is cold and speculation dwells not in their eyes they hate us youth gorbellied k  bacon fed ah would we had the shaking of their bags i knew one of them who without the least study wrote the following two elegant and learned lines yon slanting mountains glow with blue marine and yon cornuted moons two horns give shine i know the gentlemen had too much modesty and diffidence of their own superior talents to give their works to the press but i hope as they are charitable they will not be displeased as they are above making money of their performances that i should since they though but little serve to swell my volume and no doubt will edify my readers i think i have nothing to boast of as a writer but a great memory for if i could not have retained shakespeare milton etc and the great authors i have last mentioned to give a taste of their wit when i was myself at a loss i do not know how i could ever have compassed three volumes of memoirs  indeed if i had printed all the poetry that has been sent me for that purpose since i came to this kingdom it would have proved as odd a medley as any thing ever yet exhibited to public view i suppose every one who fancied they had wit had a mind to see how it would look in print but i must beg to be excused though the learned mr timothy ticklepitcher pressed very hard for a place it would be a strong proof of my vanity to insert his anti sublime compliments to me  another poetical gentleman wrote me a long letter in a text hand which put me into a palpitation of the heart as i was about that time threatened for certain scandalous truths i have been guilty of relating with some law and truly i hate that as much as sir john falstaff did security when i in plain english set down undeniable facts they menace me with law i would as lieve they would stop my mouth with ratsbane but i find i am like sir john not only witty myself but am also the occasion that wit is in others there is not an halfpenny paper can peep its head out but presently my name must be dragged in by head and shoulders to grace it but to the letter having recovered my spirits i read it over and found a great many compliments with a promise that the profound author would wait on me at four oclock i never thought of it till the time appointed when the punctual devil kept his word i own i supposed he came to see if he could convey out of my box of hints by a trick sincerely believing he dealt with old nick and i always suspect falsehood to lurk under a full peruke he just came in with a huge fat man as fat as butter with him but would not stay for which reason i will not print his fond letter so i think i am even with him if i were any way given to be proud i think i have a great deal of reason to be so since i cannot go any where as i am not very well known but i hear some piece of my own history quite new i am seen in this place and the other place and say something mighty witty to be sure  i do not wonder that persons of fortune and distinction of this kingdom go to england to spend their time and estates since here be you as chaste as ice or pure as snow thou shall not escape calumny especially among your halfbred halfwitted gentry but let my unhappy tale be falsely told by the rash young or the illnatured old let every tongue it is various censures choose absolve with coldness or with spite accuse fair truth at last her radiant beams shall raise and malice vanquished heightened virtues prior praise   in london almost every one in the middling state of life has some employment or diversion to kill their time and here it is the reverse we are all gentry wherefore the females have no amusement but that of slander  where rufa with her comb of lead whispers that sapphos hair is red   i should be very glad ever they look for the mote in my eye they would be pleased to pull the beam out of their own i could mention numbers of these scandalmongers who have said oh lord may be she will put us down in her memorials but goon incorrigible dunces too contemptible for my notice all i shall beg of the men is never to believe any thing that is said of me by a woman as it is more than four to one it is a lie  but as the great miltons genius could even descend to hell so i think i must mention one mrs ir  d  ll who hearing i got money for my work a thing she could never do exclaimed bitterly against me nay even kept her bed for a week on account of it and wrote two or three very stupid papers against me and though she could not show her wit at least showed envy malice and all uncharitableness  i know a very ingenious gentleman who whenever he sees a parcel of females seated at their tea names the chamber pandaemonium and dr young in one of his satires says tea how i tremble at the dreadful stream as lethe fatal to the love of fame what devastations on thy banks are seen what shades of mighty names that once have been   and i really cannot remember ever to have seen a set of ladies tippling this liquor but scandal strait ensued ay even amongst our new teachers commonly called moravians amongst whom i had in london the misfortune to live and whom though they took themselves to be inspired i really always believed to be under the delusion of satan  one of the holy sisters once told me the devil inspired milton ay and me into the bargain truly she did his infernal majesty the greatest honor he ever yet received and i could not avoid thinking her either very ignorant or very wicked but i comforted myself with hoping that the former was her fault and that she did not know how heinous a sin she committed when she robbed the maker of his glory and attributed his best gifts and graces to the common enemy of man i think i might justly apply to these sectaries mr popes lines it is yours a bacon and a lock to blame a newtons genius and a seraphs flame but oh with one immortal one dispense the source of newtons light and bacons sense content each emanation of his fires that beams on earth each science he inspires each art he prompts each charm he can create whatever he gives is given for you to hate go on by all divine in man unawed but learn ye dunces not to mock your god   i believe these wretches would be very proud of being persecuted but our governors of the same mind with the witty and gallant emperor julian vulgarly called the apostate will neither hinder them to assemble nor preach any more than he did the galileans unless they preach sedition and then they come under the penalty of the law  poor julian the christians murdered him for not permitting them to murder each other st gregory the younger preaching old st gregorys funeral sermon forty years after the death of julian when one would have thought resentment might be also dead if he had any cause for it has these remarkable words and now says he here lies my uncle dead who delivered you from the persecution of that old bullburning tyrant julian now who had a greater hand in his death than my uncle for once when he and his captain of the archers came in to hear mass had he not suddenly gone away my uncle would have kicked him the translator says he had more difficulty with this passage than all the rest of the work for he would fain have had the kicking intended for the captain of the archers not being able to conceive that the emperor of the world should be afraid that an old priest should kick him  but the old priest prophesied that such a day this apostate should die and truly he took especial care that his prophecy should be fulfilled by hiring one of the emperors own soldiers to put him to death  i could say something more why should i not nay out it must i believe if my favorite apostle st paul had not behaved himself with more good manners than our modern new lighters he would not have almost persuaded his auditors to be christians how noble is his answer on the occasion  but he was as remarkably a fine gentleman as he was a saint a martyr and a christian like dr delany whose preaching goes even to the dividing of the blood and spirit and let me here dear sir beg you will fulfill a promise you gave me many years ago that you would attend my last moments if i send to you will you refuse to cheer a dying sinner with hope of peace and pardon for the doctrine of damnation is now so universally received that half the world are cast into despair  these poor enthusiasts used in london to steal every thing they could lay their hands on from me insomuch that at last they stole my one pair of shoes and yet they brought scripture authority for theft for they said the children of israel borrowed jewels of gold and silver of the egyptians which they ran away with and they spoiled the egyptians i remember i once mentioned this passage to dr delany who understanding hebrew perfectly turned over to it to there where it is very differrently related for the egyptians finding so many plagues brought on them and particularly the leprosy with which these people were all infected ordered them to depart but they declared they would not go unless their hire was paid to them and also so many changes of apparel and jewels of gold given to support them in their pilgrimage how they behaved themselves in the wilderness is so well set forth in the old testament that it would puzzle a wiser head than mine to know how they became the peculiar favorites of an impartial and unprejudiced deity  indeed it were to be wished that either this learned and excellent divine or some other of equal abilities if such may be found would oblige the world with a new translation of the old testament since as we now have it it seems filled with incongruities indecencies and shocking absurdities such as the holy spirit could never have dictated whose body is light and whose shadow truth  i beg pardon for this rambling digression and hope the divines will not censure me for it as i only presume to give them hints which their superior knowledge may improve upon and justify the ways of god to man   for i intend not this address to the ignorant part of the clergy who would many of them be more fit to till the earth than plant or water the gospel but to the learned just and pious that they may remove scruples from weak minds raise up those that are fallen and finally beat down satan under our feet which god of his infinite mercy enable them to do through the merits and mediation of our lord jesus christ  but once more to return to my shop one afternoon two young gentlemen came into it one of whom asked me for some tea i told him i did not sell any but that there was a coffeehouse next door where he might be supplied he asked me would not i give a dish of tea to a friend and relation i said yes with pleasure why then said he this gentleman is dean mades son of cor and my name is bl  nd  n as his father was married to brigadier meades widow i gave them an invitation into the parlour and ordered some tea to be got ready i was really very glad to see any person from ireland particularly those i was allied to nor could i conceive that they came in that manner only to insult a woman who never offended either of them indeed as for the deans son i must acquit him for he did not affront me but i took it ill he should bring with him a fellow he knew designed it  there was nothing gross indecent abusive or unmannerly which this wretch did not without the least provocation say to me till at length though i am not really of a passionate disposition i lost all patience and thinking myself very much his betters i asked him whether his father continued to sell buttermilk to the poor at a penny a quart with his own hand in a hard season when every other person gave theirs away  upon this he very politely threatened to kick me but as he was then at a great distance from his own dunghill and i am sure i give castlebl  nd  n its proper title when i style it one i was not in the least intimidated and only bade him go show his slaves how choleric he was and make his bondmen tremble   and here excuse me sir if i give your picture to the world when you make love if any but the leadendarted cupid ever touched your unworthy grovelling base heart your argument is that of a highwaymans you bring a laden pistol clap it to the fairones bosom and say deliver your treasure or you are dead  could not you have taken your ancient father the old stick pickers advice and have coaxed the girl and have given her a cherrycoloured topknot but you were like the haughty hotbrained spaniard instead of love you brought a poignard   and filthy as your rotten leg and more corrupted soul must have been every thing you could produce for thou art the quintessence of filth and i am weary of writing when every thing base every thing low every thing insolent is the theme and all comprised in pretty master jacky bl  nd  n  as i have mentioned an attempt to write a play which  is a bold pretense to learning genius wit and eloquence i present my readers with an act of it and would with great pleasure finish it but that i am certain our present manager would never permit it to be played mly because it was mine for since his prejudice against me though how i incurred his displeasure i know not carried him him so far as to say a prologue i wrote for the kings birthnight was blasphemy i dont know but he may be ingenious enough to prove the play to be high treason but lest my readers should believe me capable of writing any thing like it i present them with the lines prologue while foreign climes are rent with dire alarms the shout of battle and the clang of arms britannia happy in her monarchs care enjoys at once the fruits of peace and war and while her thunders over the ocean roll and spread her rising fame from pole to pole sees her victorious fleets the sea command and plenty wealth and pleasure bless the land fair science joyful lifts her laurelld head the muses in the groves delighted tread or near the azure fount or haunted spring their great inspirer and protector sing the woods the vales resound augustus name his glorious actions and immortal fame should heaven the inimitable shakespeare raise to breathe historic truth in tuneful lays how would the poet in sublimer strains with georges virtue elevate his scenes transmit his wisdom to the future age the noblest theme that ever adorned a stage not the great ruler of the genial year whose radiant beams the whole creation cheer inspires such joy such rapture such delight as swells each bosom at their monarchs sight oh may our loyalty this bliss deserve and heaven the hero to our hopes preserve   i believe none but such a conjurer as mr sherridan would have found out blasphemy in these lines and i am sorry he did not say they were as flat burglary too as ever was committed but he is a judge a gentleman his father was an author ay and a parson and for the signal favors he has bestowed on me i return him these my acknowledgments  however at all hazards i will venture to stand the test of publishing the following because mr cibber approved it  the roman father a tragedy

and scoth thy gentle soul to love and peace exeunt end of the act one day as i was in my shop a gentleman very richly dressed told me he had a letter for me i received it very respectfully but could not help smiling when i found it was the letter i wrote for tom brush neatly copied and directed to me and that lest it should miscarry he had brought it himself  i said it was a very genteel piece of gallantry and quite now he told me he was going to his seat in the county of surrey the next day and gave me a very kind invitation to pass the remainder of the summer there but as he was a young gay single gentleman i did not hold it convenient  pray madam said he do you never go to the opera no really sir not but that i love music but it happens to be too expensive an entertainment for me well then madam returned he i must insist on having the honor of treating you to it on which he downright forced a couple of guineas on me and making me promise to correspond with him till his return to london we parted  unfortunately i lost his direction and so had it not in my power to keep my word  and i do assure my readers i did not go to the opera wisely considering that two pound two would be of infinitely more service to me than it could possibly be to mr heydeigger  but alas before the return of winter i had neither shop nor almost an habitation by what strange reverse of fortune i was again reduced to the utmost calamity and by what unexpected and signal mercy delivered from it must as it is impossible for me to get it into the compass of this volume be the subject of a third  i should be highly ungrateful not to acknowledge the favor and bounty of the whole body of the nobility clergy and gentry of this kingdom whose goodness as it is my highest pride to own so it shall ever be my utmost ambition to merit and if their poor servant can in the least contribute to their entertainment she shall think herself overpaid or to use my dear mr cibbers words as for what is left of life if yet twill do it is at your service pleased while pleasing you but then mistake me not when you have enough one thin subscription shows all parties off or truth in homely proverb to advance i pipe no longer than you care to dance   but oh my loved honored and excellent lord kingsborough where shall i find words adequate to the sense i have of your goodness your unlimited generosity thou kind preserver of mine and my sons life did eloquence divine adorn my speaking though every muse and every grace should crown me why then even then i should fall short of my souls meaning   but as with you my muse began with you also she must end yet not till i relate the following story  i saw in london the truly elegant and beautiful speech of a certain great man not long since our supreme governor here i was really so charmed with it that i wrote the following lines which i showed to mr cibber as his excellency was returned to england mr cibber was so well pleased with them that as he was particularly intimate with him he undertook to deliver them and said he did not doubt but he would give me a handsome reward to give this thesis plainer proof i put it to the test to his excellency the earl of chesterfield o thou to bind whose awful brow triumphant laurels joy to grow to whom the sons of science bend as to the great inspiring soul that brightens and informs the whole the muses patron judge and friend never did britains king before a substitute so noble find nor ever yet deputed power with such transcendent luster shined for when to grace hibernias throne the godlike chesterfield was given how did the joyful people own their monarchs love the care of heaven on thy exalted his speech to both houses of parliament in dublin speech their senates hung and blessed the elocation of thy tongue it is stanhope can alone untie the gordian knot of policy he every kingdoms interest knows were to his care the world consigned the almightys everlasting mind might there secure his trust repose thy genius for all stations fit the reins of empire knows to guide nor less the sacred realms of wit acknowledge thee their boast and pride so phoebus rules the chariot of the day and charms the groves with his melodious lay how did of late the nations fear sickness the messenger of fate would take thee to thy native sphere midst throned gods to hold thy state we feared a soul so eminently wise was called to grace the synod of the skies but soon the roselipd cherub health commissioned by the power divine restored britannias dearest wealth the glory of her patriot line oh may thou long from better worlds be spad and late receive thy virtues full reward even i whom many griefs oppress enraptured with thy flowing strain a while forget my own distress and anguish ceases to complain such charms to heavenborn eloquence belong and such the magic force of sacred song   i ought to have premised that just as i had finished this poem w  rsd  le came in and snatched it from me saying he would send it himself to his old friend philp i could not get it from him but as i remembered every syllable of it i wrote it in a better hand than that rough draught i had given to mr cibber and having the honor of his correction who is a fair and candid critic sent it again to him  w  sd  le came in the evening told me that the earl sent him many thanks and would be glad to see his old friend  upon this i asked w  rsd  le to lend me half a crown to buy a pair of shoes which he absolutely refusing when he had convinced me he had fifty guineas in his pocket i though illshod was obliged to rest contented  early next morning i received from mr cibber the following short epistle madam the poetry of poor people however it may rise in value always sinks in the price what might in happier hours have brought you ten guineas for it is intrinsic worth is now reduced to two which i desire you will come and receive from the hand of  your old humble servant colley cibber     by this i found mr w  rsd  le had boasted of an interest in his excellency which he certainly never had for who would have even given me that small reward that had received the poem before from another hand would they not have laughed at me  i waited on mr cibber who told me he had given my poem to his excellency with these words that if he had not thought it beautiful he would not have taken the liberty of presenting it to him  as dinner said he was just brought up my lord put it into his pocket in the evening i reminded him of it he told me he was attacked by all the world with paultry rhimes which his l  d always best rewarded  the next day mr cibber attacked his excellency again and asked him how he liked the lines upon which he said oh i had forgot there is two guineas for her but dont put them into your silver pocket lest you should make a mistake and pay your chair with them so here madam are the two guineas for you as i was entirely indebted to mr cibber for this bounty i return my acknowledgements to him  my dear lord kingsborough i never should have related this story except by way of contrast to your amiable virtues for i may justly say with swift  my favorite lord is none of those who owe their virtue to their stations or characters to dedications his worth although a poet said it before a play would lose no credit nor swift would dare deny him wit although to praise it i have writ   just as i was writing about w  rsd  le a gentleman brought me a pamphlet entitled a parallel between mrs pilkington and mrs phillips written by an oxford scholar as he tells us himself starving in a garret pray mr scholar deal ingenously did not w  rsd  le hire you to write it because he was indolent dull i suppose you mean if he can write so much better than i let him give the world a proof of his abilities but it seems he is discontented that i have not sufficiently exposed him why let him have but a little patience and my life on it he shall have no cause of complaint on that head but i cannot break in on the order of time so far as to give the world a second act of him yet  unity of time and place you know mr critic must be observed otherwise we must renounce the stagyrite  if you intend your performance for a satire on me truly your words are so clerkly couched that i cannot find any sting in them  you say i admired the dean for being a brute  n b you lie and none but a villain would call him one i admired his charity wit sense taste etc and to say he had passions which obscured for a while his shining and uncommon excellencies is no more than saying he was human and consequently liable to error  then you ask me how i dare mention mr pope why truly like drawcansir all this i can do because i dare  i never refused doing justice to his poetical merits but all your art can never persuade the world that he was not an envious defamer of other mens good parts and intolerably vain of his own how does he boast of his acquaintance with the great even to childish folly the late earl of peterborough could not divert himself with pruning a tree in his garden but presently we are told of it in these highsounding unharmonious words and he whose thunder stormed the iberian lines now forms my quincunx and now prues my vines why one would have thought he had hired the earl for a gardener  and as for his gratitude let that appear by his poem called taste wherein he abuses the late duke of chandos for his munificence to writers whereof take the following sample his wealth lord timon gloriously confounds asked for a groat he gives an hundred pounds or if three ladies like a luckless play takes the whole house upon the authors day was this any defect in his graces character especialy in a poetical eye no surely but i suppose mr pope was angry as he was not a dramatick writer that his grace should bestow any favor on them  he then proceeds to ridicule his graces library and the grandeur and magnificence of his improvements and when up ten steep slopes you have dragged your thighs just at his studydoor he will bless your eyes his study with what authors is it stored in books not authors curious is my lord to all their lettered backs he turns you round these aldus printed these de sewel bound these sir are elzivers and those as good for all his lordship knows they are but wood for lock or milton it is in vain to look these shelves admit not any modern book i suppose because he did not find his own works there he resolved at all hazards to depreciate his betters shall i proceed or have i said enough to thee who have not ear nor eye nor soul to comprehend it  and now how dare you to abuse my husband why thou poor paultry garretteer thou starveling bard if i have a mind to do it myself what is that to you the distant trojan never injured thee popes homer and suppose i have a mind for to drub whose bones is it sir i must lick at whose expense is it you scrub you are not to find me a stick poor creature and as you say you are in necessity i hope you will be relieved even by putting together figures illpaird and similies unlike letty and conny pious precious pair i suppose this this is an allusion to nisus and euryalus but prithee learn more wit than to make illcoupled hounds drag different ways in miry grounds for i am certain i never was a match for mrs philips either in beauty or in art in both of which she reigns unrivalled and i as in duty bound give her the preeminence but i imagine this oxonian sitting on his bed one greasy stocking round his head while the other he sits down to darn with threads of different colored yarn the remnants of his last nights pot on embers placed to make it hot but now if w  dale deign to drop a slice of bread or muttonchop mounting he writes and writing sings while from beneath all grubstreet rings swift  ha have i guessed right thou wicked scribbler that praisest the worst best and best worst thou art just fit to nurture fools and chronicle smallbeer  now to criticize on your wonderful work in the first place you say all my characters are well drawn easy natural and picturesque and yet after this high compliment that i even made a dull story entertaining by the force of a sparkling wit and retentive memory why presently after i dwindle by the force of your pen into a mere dunce and so though you promised us a parallel you give us a contrast you are a very witty fellow i assure you and deal much in the surprising and so you do not like my poetry there was no thought of pleasing you when it was writ but go to my treasurer tell him i order him to give you three hundred kicks in private and the lord send you a btter taste  heyday the devil rides on a fiddlestick fresh news arrived all my letters to w  rsd  le to be published oh terrible well i hope he will publish every poem that was enclosed in them that i may come by my own again let him return to me three operas twentyfive odes the letters i wrote for him the poem which begins to distant climes while fond cleora flies and then he has my full leave to publish every letter of mine that he thinks will serve his purpose but remember that if you and he should sit down and out of your own loggerheads write nonsense and offer it to the world as mine i enter my caveat and will not adopt the spurious issue so here i quit ye and upon mature deliberation am sorry i wasted so much time paper and ink on so contemptible a subject as either of ye  my lord i beg pardon for so long digressing from my darling theme but it was almost impossible for me not to bestow those libellers a lash for though it is hopeless to reclaim them scorpion rods perhaps may tame them swift  and though it is not in reality worth while to pursue grasshoppers who die in a season yet while their noise offends me i cannot forbear it  and now my lord and oh since you permit me to call you by that tender name my friend and let me add my guardian angel for surely very excellent has thy favor been to me far surpassing that of kindred as you generously bid me name my wish to you and obtain it and as i broken with the storms of fortune for i may truly say with holy david to my creator even from my youth up thy terrors have i suffered with a troubled mind and thou have vexed me with all thy storms have little to hope for on this side dissolution and have no other concern about parting with a life which has been but a continual scene of sorrow except that of leaving my son unprovided for let your favor extend to him as your station and virtue must ever give you a powerful interest use a portion of it to get him some little employment or place which may give him bread when i no more want it  i flatter myself he will not be entirely unworthy of your goodness as he is of a generous humane and grateful disposition  i must beg your lordships pardon for praising my son which indeed i should not do but that both his father and mr a  e endeavored all in their power to injure his character the latter of whom is since convinced he wronged him  and here i must apologize for so long deferring the publication of this second volume and as no reason is so good as the true one take it as follows  when i came to ireland i took a house near bowbridge as well for the pleasure of a fine art as to keep retired from busy tongues but finding it was highly inconvenient to be at such a distance from printers stationers etc i took a firstfloor in abbeystreet and having my own furniture sent it there with orders to the men to put up the beds which accordingly was done when i came in the evening to take possession of my new habitation behold all my furniture was torn down and lying in heaps in the passage when i demanded the cause of this i was told the reverend dr j  n v  ey who it seems lodged in the house had by his own special authority commanded the goods should be thrown into the street but the landlord knowing himself liable to be called to an account for what he had received did not choose to obey him in that article  well as my house was empty i knew not where i or my child could sleep that night but as i was not illbeloved in the neighborhood i left i went back to it where a good woman gave me part of her bed and her husband my son and two little children of theirs lay together  early next morning my son took a lodging for me in bigbutterlane my goods damaged as they were were carried there but wot you well the parson followed them dr v  ey i mean told the people i was a very bad woman and they were again left in the passage so when i came there was no entrance for me and i was obliged to return to the place from whence i came mem i was forty shillings out of pocket by this pious divine i wish he would pay me  next day my son took a lodging for me in gol enlane where the woman no sooner understood i was dr van lewins daughter who as she said saved her life but she gladly accepted of me for a lodger but what with the vexation of my mind and the cold i had got i fell into a violent fever and was for many weeks confined to my bed till by the care and skill of dr old i was once more enabled to pursue my work and as i am much indebted to his humanity i take this opportunity of acknowledging it  and now do i expect an army of critics to attack my poor work and to save them the trouble i will even do it myself although i own the task to be a little ungrateful but mrs pilkington notwithstanding the regard and affection which i really have for you i must tell you what the world says of you but however i will give you fair play and allow you to make the best defense you can for yourself suppose you and i enter into a dialogue i being the accuser begin madam your story has nothing in it either new or entertaining the occurrences are common trivial and such as happen every day your vanity is intolerable your style borrowed from milton shakespeare and swift whom you pretend to describe though you never knew him you tell us a story of his beef being overroasted and another of a mangy dog fine themes truly for my part i wonder you ever got a shilling for your curious performance i am sure it is a proof of the stupidity of the boeotians who though they have still done you the honor to advertise in every paper that you were not a dunce proved themselves to be little better for taking so much notice of you  myself hold hold you charge me so fast you do not give me leave to reply to your first article i plead guilty my story is dull enough it was therefore i strove to embellish it with such poetical ornaments as i could beg borrow or steal i have known a gentleman write a latin poem and every line of it was borrowed from the classicks yet this was esteemed a beauty in him why then should it be deemed a fault in your humble servant had i not an equal right to make free with milton swift and shakespeare as he had with virgil and horace  i o lud lud why the best part of your first volume is that which you wrote from yourself without these auxiliaries  myself oh upon my word you compliment now  i truly i did not intend it but we would rather have some of your own stuff  myself why i must bring you a simile from what i do not much deal in that is needle work do not ladies buy coarse canvass and work thereon fruits flowers trees all summer and all autumns pride and should we say the canvas would have been better without the artists curious embroidery the same will hold in painting  i o come do not think to put us off at this rate you give us quotation on quotation why we know the works of other writers and expected something entirely new from your superior pen  myself i am sorry it is not in my power to oblige you but kings and prophets who lived before me have declared there was nothing new under the sun  i but you show no reverence either to ermin crape or lawn  myself o i really do when the wearers deserve them but i hope you would not have me pay homage to the things themselves why then i may go and kneel down to all the goods in the shops because as the author of the tale of a tub says in them we live move and have our being  i but have you no farther regard to station is your licentious pen to lash all orders and degrees of people are you to indulge your laughing and lashing humor at every bodies expense  myself why sure i have a right to it have they not laughed and lashed me round this is but a retaliation they were the first aggressors no person who did not deserve a stripe ever got one from me is station a privilege for doing every thing evil with impunity if so let satan on his burning throne be honored  i well upon my word mrs pilkington i am weary of your arguments you seem resolved to get the better of me and that my readers may always be assured i will do when i am both plaintiff and defendant  and i assure my readers that if my third volume is not filled with more surprising events and ifinitely more entertaining than either of the foregoing i will for ever quit my magic art and deeper than did ever plummet sound i will drown my book shakespeare  end of the second volume
