the present uncertainty in the knowledge of medicines in a letter to the physicians in the commission for sick and wounded seamen  with a postscript to physicians showing the necessity of a true theory of diseases  by w corkburn m d a fellow of the royal society and of the college of physicians of london  qualitates ignoramus in physicis and illud vocabulum qualitas ne quidem nominandum est quippe res evidentes majoribus difficultatibus involvit  hann meth cogn veget simp london printed by r j for benj barker at the whitehart in westminster hall and sold by j nutt near stationers hall   0   the preface to the physicians in the commission for sick and wounded seamen gentlemen the world i know will admire what merit of yours should obtain you this address but their curiosity will be satisfied when they are told that your pretenses on this head are very great and singular you pretend to be complete masters of all the qualities that ever were found about a medicine and that you never fail to determine all its possible actions by this infallible light if this proves not a sufficient apology for me you your selves must find a better  indeed the former disappointments that sedulous inquirers have met with already in this way were enough to discredit my assertion but especially that such abstruse methods are possessed by people who are as unknown as they have endeavored to be otherwise but in that you must give them further satisfaction it is enough for me to have made this part of the discovery but you must tell them more  for this trial i do not give you the mystery of a nostrum to resolve neither have i put stranger drugs into your hands nor some foreign root that came but lately from the east indies no i have first given you a bark that is the most excellent of any medicine for the disease it is to cure which owes its discovery to wild indians its use in europe to churchmen and its reestablishment after the malice of physicians to destroy it to an empyrick and which now triumphs in this next age with the great applause of physicians though their predecessors would never submit to the conquest nay its native strength equals at least the best preparations of it on purpose to show how it raised its reputation in spite of the fathers and will have no farther to do with the sons than to receive their submission and i am ashamed to think how little thanks men owe us that have hindered them so long from the benefit of so great a good but the following story does prove how well we are satisfied with the thing and how still we have neglected such discoveries that might assist us to give it to more advantage but it is this you put us in hope of being instructed in by you  the preface  i shall say no more of the other two instances i give than that they are of an older date than to bear any exception against our opportunity of making experiment about em  yet while i clear my examples from objections that may be brought against their propriety of being such i am sensible how ready some people may be to object against my thus exposing the uncertainty of medicines but one answer may be that it is in order to our arriving at a greater certainty but next who but such pretenders ever would have the world think that our knowledge of them is infallible dont the frequent attempts and as frequent disappointments of worthy physicians prove this very uncertainty some indeed have attempted medicines by their qualities and have all miscarried in the enterprise but these gentlemen who promise nw to attempt and i wish they do not fail in that other physicians have tried to dissect bodies for the very parts of their composition but a noble gentleman well skilled in all these trials has sufficiently destroyed that pretense in his skeptical chemist and it was only this gentleman who was the best able as well as the most proper person to do it  but if the strength of this objection is concealed under the fear of discovering so much of our weakness to the world the argument is as weak as the defense of it is unworthy of a man a cheat has the worst grace upon a gentleman of any thing and i am convinced that both physic and physicians have really suffered more by the modest conniving at such tricks of pretenders than ever they can suffer by this frank declaration of mine this is the foundation for quacks and mountebanks who know no better where to set up for a character men of learning go quite another way to work they do not apprehend their being esteemed to know nothing except they pretend to know every thing their reasoning is quite the reverse of this they say that there are some things of which they know nothing at all and these are these first qualities or physical causes these gentlemen know so perfectly wel some things they know but probably and among them may be the doctrine of medicines but some other things they know demonstratively and among them are some things about the theory of diseases  from all which i shall observe first that the knowledge by qualities is as vain as it is an ignorant pretense  and  dly that they who set up on this foot know nothing at all not so much as where to lodge their pretense and they are a people who commonly practice physic with a contempt of all theories of diseases and you see they do it with an absolute ignorance about medicines  the present uncertainty in the knowledge of medicines before i come to prove the charge of uncertainty on our knowledge of medicines twill be necessary to lay down some rules that may be useful in examining the matter of fact and these shall be taken from the descriptions of the two different sorts of knowledge a physician is said to have viz experimental and scientifical or a knowledge of experience and science by knowing the virtues or powers of medicines in the first way we know that such and such medicines are recommended for and are good or bad in particular diseases and different circumstances of the distemper when either they have good success no success or an ill one this is the lowest piece of knowledge that can be expected from physicians  or secondly if by many such experiments we should discover what action it is in any medicine whereby it produces its proper effects so as to be able to deduce the good or bad effects it will have as so many corollaries from the knowledge of the action that would be as noble a piece of science as physic can be supposed to admit of and would contain all that is necessary  having premised the descriptions which are the rules in the ensuing trial i shall begin with all the distinctness and brevity imaginable  but since the bounds of a letter will not allow me to try every single medicine by it self or indeed every class of medicines in general yet twill be more to your satisfaction if i prove it by two or three examples of medicines that are either most in use or that produce most constantly the same effects when the least caution is had about em and are in every ones hands and if i can prove our knowledge of them to be just nothing and that it does not so much as arrive at the first description or experience i may presume to conclude the like imperfection to be at least as great in our knowledge of medicines that are not near so frequently used nor that have not by far so certain and constant effects nay whose effects are most unconstant in the best hands  the first instance of this imperfection shall be of the jesuits powder a medicine that every one must own to be the best for curing intermitting fevers and with that certainty that no other known medicine can do the like in this or any other disease for it generally cures not only in the hands of physicians but even in those of quacks and nurses by whom it is given with no manner of judgment or discretion  yet even this powder has been wanting in its success and agues have been known sometimes to stand their ground against many charges of it this is evident sometimes here but too often in virginie  it is known that by the taking of it safe intermitting fevers have been changed into those that are continual which are far more dangerous and whose event is often very doubtful  and it is very surprising that this turn of the disease is not always in the same manner for by jesuits powder agues have degenerated into unweildy rheumatisms or a lazy jaundice nay sometimes it has terminated in a sudden death  these are strange and unconstant effects of jesuits powder it cures an ague the best of any thing it turns the patient sometimes out of one disease into another and sometimes it kills him  but this is not all it will sometimes make him costive it purges him it sweats him yet it never has been ranked among medicines of these sorts but once to disparage it  and this is the rare medicine which cures us so suddenly that it seems to operate almost like a charm that yet has such strange though seldom ill effects in the cure of the same disease but since different conditions and circumstances make all the variety in this affair as well as in every thing else physicians ought to be very industrious to find out what are the conditions in this case where we find such considerable turns in administering this excellent medicine for perhaps if they were known they might be avoided at least if a cure is to be had by any other medicine that rather is to be tried and it is at worst better not to attempt a cure than certainly to kill  it is to be thought that if all or any of these ill accidents that happen by using the bark had often been observed that no rhetoric could induce the world to persist in taking it yet since they have happened they may happen again and indeed every day it may therefore be thought very expedient to know how either to give it so as to avoid danger and mischief or else to know when the proper time is when we are not to give it at all  it was for want of this knowledge the bark lost its good name when sir  underwood mayor of london died by taking of it whose untimely death did so terrify his relations that no friezing or fryings of an ague can ever be strong enough to force them to take it  now since there is so manifest uncertainty in the practice of this excellent medicine besides the danger of being killed it must be owned that there ought to be a good deal of discretion had when we use it and he who is possessed of this discretionary knowledge must be able to know not only that it is uncertain but this must be warranted by my first rule he is obliged to know what appearances what conditions there were in the disease when the bark cured and when it did not cure as also when one got a jaundice by it and a third died but if he has no knowledge of those times he is under a vast uncertainty in every patient neither does he know whose cure or death he is carrying on with the greatest assurance though he practice with the best medicine  i would advise those who think they can answer for this sort of knowledge to try their strength by the second rule i proposed but it is time enough to do that when i find my first request answered indeed by this rule we have the most delightful as well as the most useful piece of knowledge imaginable for by it we might know what the uniform action of the bark is in it self whereby it cures an ague and we should be able to deduce these mischiefs that are already observed as so many corollaries from the condition of the disease nay by it are we made capable to suspect all the probable dangers that can be or perhaps have been though they have escaped the caution of the observer  these related misfortunes that have happened by taking the bark are not the calumnies it stands charged with by its bigoted enemies there are many more but these i have named have happened to many candid practitioners and the most of em recorded by that excellent physician dr sydenham  but what can be said to the pother had among many authors about its under actions of purging sweating etc when they have industriously past by so considerable effects of this medicine  all the use i make of this argument for the present is to show you that the knowledge of medicines is as obscure and difficult as any thing else in physic notwithstanding of a common opinion we entertain about their certainty and this i think is very manifest by this first instance because our knowledge of the best medicine which answers expectation most constantly and is more used than any one medicine is very obscure and just nothing at all  this argument might be pursued as successfully in every one of the medicines that are most familiar to us in all evacuating medicines as well as in those that produce no evacuation but are considerable for some great effect of another kind but so particular an aggravation is by no means necessary neither does the present occasion require it i shall content my self with an instance or two more which will be sufficient to prove my argument about the real uncertainty of medicines    moreover opium is observed to give a check to all sorts of evacuations yet great evacuations have been known to be made by it  it is noted for either relieving us of pain or at least giving an agreeable respite from it though great and torturing pains have sometimes been felt upon its account i mean not only those headachs and pain at stomach it often occasions and that are felt after its sleeping force is over but even some that come at first taking and that beyond all patience and almost to distraction yea these pains are also produced by every thing that makes sleep as well as by opium or any preparation of it and the more obstinately we persist in that quieting design to greater degrees we augment the torture  besides all this opium is not like other medicines so easily dosd and an exceeding quantity has worse consequences than any other medicine whatever nay sometimes when we would give it to good purpose it is necessary to give three or four grains at once withour our coming cautiously and by degrees to that quantity or that it is given to people who have been long accustomed to take it all which considerations alter the case perfectly yet there is nothing more certain than that three grains have laid people of a proper age into an eternal oblivion of this world though the world should not forget him that gave it  now who would not purchase at any rate a good nights rest after watching many nights and a long vigilia who would not rid themselves of troublesome pains and uneasy evacuations by taking opium but if the danger that possibly may come by it was ever imagined how equal might the dispute prove about taking of it on any of the mentioned designs but especially if the operation of this medicine should fall short of it nay if the contrary effects were ever supposed to happen we ought to suppose at least that a very extraordinary pilot ought to be made choice of to guide us where such hazards and things of so great a value are and more where our persons may be fatally concerned  and therefore let any one who pretends to be familiarly acquainted with this pacifick medicine examine himself thoroughly by the rules i have laid down and rest satisfied with nothing less than his being qualified by the first  i confess it is strange enough to hear men boast of a certainty in medicines such as requires no direction from reason to manage beyond their skill and yet such considerable doubts to remain at this day about a medicine of so manifest effects and of so great and ancient a standing wherefore it is manifest how proper an example this is to prove our imperfection about the knowledge of medicines  but no less an imperfection may perhaps be found in another ancient method of curing which commonly is the utmost skill and last resort of a doctor after other experience and medicines have been practiced to no purpose and after so honorable a mention made of a method every body must think it is only proper to the bath as indeed i intend it i must not be thought to depretiate either the bathing or drinking of waters at bath which i do by no means on the contrary i have a valuable and just esteem of em  only i do say that this useful and ancient method is far from being so sufficiently known that we are able to reap all the benefit of it or to avoid all its mischiefs as shall be made appear immediately by particulars  britain yet if we compare what has been said of em either as to their warmth or medicinal effects by ancient or modern writers we shall find how little these have improved what the former asserted cambden informs us how old necham has conceived the observations of his time about these waters for their use  confcto profunt balnea nostra seni prosunt astritis collisis invalidisque et qurum morbis frigida causa subest then he and most moderns after him assign this reason for the heat of these waters  sd quid sulphurcum novimus esse locum at present i am not bound to make all proper inquiries about the bath but in general i will first observe how disproportionable the fame of the cures it has worked are to its long standing and great character given it by some men and  dly the extreme changes its reputation has suffered in that tract of time thas often been esteemed a panacea and too frequently thought good for nothing at all and from both these observations i conclude that if a moderate knowledge of this method had been joined with half the good uses of these waters they never could have had so great ebbings in their fame  but to be more particular it is certain that though sulphur impregnating those waters is told us to be the cause of their heat yet our knowledge of this method of nature is so very obscure that we can neither imitate her in medicating waters after that manner nor by any means make other waters serviceable to like purposes wherefore it is also manifest how insignificant our boasted knowledge is and to how little purpose our trials of em have been  i know that there are authors that prove and sufficiently enough that those waters contain more substances than sulphur but the difficulty remains the same mutatis mutandis viz by taking the known compositum as i took sulphur singly in the argument  but further if i should suppose that either the single ingredient of these waters if there is but one or a determined quantity of ingredients if more were known yet it is certain we should be still ignorant of their operations if we know not the effects of these simple substances which being mixed with the waters give em their medicinal qualities and the difficulty would always increase when we were to account for their combination this is manifest from the affair of jesuits powder ie it is manifest that if the particular ingredients of these waters were in substance and quantity as evident to us as the substance and quantity of jesuits powder yet our difficulties shall still remain unsatisfied except we knew more of the nature of these substances that are the composita of the waters than we know of jesuits powder and i think we know less and by consequence less also of the waters even supposing we knew their composition  but let us suppose that the bath is good for decayed old age for people that are lame and those who labor under a disease from a cold cause yet our knowledge about the bath must remain uncertain if we are not able to justify our sending people thither on other accounts for reasons not yet assigned and if we cannot show that effects quite contrary to those it is noted for have not happened with the particular circumstances of the case  instances of the last sort are adduced in a good number by bath doctors and though possibly the crutches that hang there may not be the martyrology of the bath as doctor willis would have it yet they are confessed not to be the trophies of its constant success but it is most certain that we have not conveyed to us the failings and cross successes which are absolutely necessary for the smallest degree of certainty in this affair  perhaps the sending people for all diseases may be alleged for its great use and i do concur with them who say so though i think very meanly of the judgment of the physicians who do so and am positive that how soever excellent the bath may be that it neither is infallible nor a panacea but that it will always want a suitable direction which will be the more infallible the greater our knowledge is  but the weakness of our understandings in this particular is but too manifest by some facts i shall adduce  for we know that many people who have been forsaken in the jaundice by their physicians have yet found their health at bath though the bath is accused for bringing the jaundice upon a great many  it has been the common complaint especially for these two or three last years that a vast number of people have got rheumatisms at bath it is notwithstanding most incontestably true that great numbers have got rid of rheumatisms there  many more examples of other diseases might be brought to prove this thing besides the sudden deaths that have happened there and yet i am apt to believe that it is very hard to account for these accidents even by my rule of experience which but too sufficiently proves the great imperfection our knowledge lies under in this very matter of the most ancient and useful method of the bath  but i am ashamed to think that this ancient and useful manner of bathing should begin to be so much neglected as if it neither wanted or did not deserve our improving no manner of consideration is had about making it have its best use which is so little known that some great physicians are scandalously nice by giving the waters by spoonfuls as if old experience was to be laid aside to make way for such as they would call new  what considerations are raised about bathing what inquiries are made about our being immergd in water what questions are asked about its entering or not entering our vessels and what effects it may produce by mixing with the liquors in em and lastly what may the difference be in being immerged in hot and cold water  these considerations are not only fine but useful and would soon make us masters of all that affair it is sure a masterpiece of impudence to pretend to a knowledge very particular of any bath and to remain ignorant of these particulars i have just mentioned nothing can be more strange except the setting no value upon such inquiries as those pretenders are very ready to do  but not to press this argument any farther i may be apt to think that there can be no manner of doubt about the great imperfection of our knowledge in respect of medicines and how inestimable a good it would be to be brought out of this infirmity  but gentlemen to put an end to this matter i have not only given you medicines of most ancient and common use but i have but just named such of their effects as are recorded by the best authors and which consequently cannot probably be false it is therefore your business to give satisfaction to these examples i have adducd and that by your qualitymethod of hot and cold red and yellow acid and alkaly by taste and smell etc or because you love high flights by the causes of these qualities yet if you have any regard to my condescending to give you a lower method i challenge you to give such proofs in point of experience that may assist our administering them in practice  but while i speak to your method of qualities i must inform you how ignorant your pretense is in this particular you pretend to determine the power any medicine has to cure a disease only by knowing some of its notable qualities which is manifestly false because there is scarcely one disease that has not medicines of opposite qualities found useful in its cure and recommended to us by our forefathers as such  this is a digression but not an improper one yet to proceed is the previous knowledge of a medcine or of medicines by its or their qualities necessary before we administer them and have you this kind of knowledge if you have show it us for it is much wanting if you have not then require no more of others than you your selves are masters of and order as few medicines for the public as you do to patients and none to either of em till you have satisfied us that you can do it in the mentioned way  but if you have any tolerating method whereby you would justify your administering medicines in your probation time do as you would be done by share your freedom to others of your brethren who are at least in no lower a form of knowing than you be  and if you have a special rule whereby you can prefer the use of one medicine to that of another for the cure of the same disease if you have viz any method for which you would rather give jesuits powder for the cure of an ague than any of the other medicines recommended for the same let us have this your method of reasoning for it may be so extensive as to comprehend more medicines in this and other distempers  i know the trite and common methods among philosophers and all mankind is first to know if a thing is so and then how it is so if we are able to compass it but if they should not get this length you must reckon those little better than madmen that deny the actual existence of a thing because we do not know the way of its being and but justly because it would have us disbelieve our senses and the senses of all mankind because we cannot answer some questions that are or that happen not to be the objects of our senses and are too fine for our understanding so that in the trial if a man or a thing is or does such an action or produces such an effect we must judge of these changes by our eyes and other senses or take them upon the testimony of honest capable people that relate them if we were not there our selves this is the way of the world and i shall not enlarge upon it to avoid scandal though so much i must say because you and your friend have so boldly unhinged all these common ways of judging of past actions that i am not able to go further with you till you have informed us more in those new methods yet whether you will do it or not depend upon it a time may come wherein the world shall be informed how you use their old ones in matters of the greatest importance  thus i bid you farewell knowing to how little purpose it would be to invite you to the following discourse for you never once dreamt of any such thing and your proper talent is to snarl in a corner at so generous attempts  a postscript to physicians about the necessity of a true theory of diseases i continue the discourse to you on this subject not but that i am sensible how seriously many of you think of this matter and that even they who calumniate you on this score do themselves pretend sometimes to reason about this affair though at the same time they endeavor to persuade the world that all reasonings of this nature are vain and but so much time lost to the improving of practice you are sensible how they assume the quantity of blood in a mans body given and then do determine the numbers of its circulations in a certain time so you find that howsoever they depreciate reasoning in your case about things of physic they are very fond of the character of men of reason for themselves nay you find they apply arithmetic too and therefore it is not reasoning they are angry with but that your reason and arithmetic is better than theirs  after the same manner they being told how barbarous indians cure yaws with guaiacum do immediately extend its use to the european pox and from that to leprosies etc this is in the nature of man to do but it is the highest ingratitude to calumniate people that offer them more of such medicines or that would teach them more natural and righter methods whereby this extending of their knowledge may be more usefully brought on  and therefore it is that i would persuade you to bear up against the calumnies of these ill men and continue to do good to mankind by improving your profession be diligent in your enquiries about a true theory of diseases for it is even by that you shall be greatly assisted in ascertaining your knowledge of medicines and by that you shall be brought beyond what chance has put into your hands  besides if medicines were as certain in their effects as our hearts could wish they can do but little good without a true theory of diseases but especially in respect of the good they do when assisted with it and therefore i shall take leave to press this argument a little farther to you than it is commonly done  the first of these is very manifest to those who have thought the least on that subject and i believe some time or other i may be able to give some light into this abstruse affair  as to the  d particular we find the whole world on our side in the main for to what purpose should an infallible medicine serve if we knew not the disease it cures when it appears upon us or our neighbor supposing viz it were as great a difficulty to know an ague in general as it is to know it in all its circumstances it is certain that this excellent medicine the jesuits powder should be of very little use to us  so far i may be thought in the right but next no general description that is almost possible to be made of a disease can be of sufficient use to us in administering our infallible medicines because we are not always improperly sick but as a distemper at one time may kill us yet it may cure us of some other disease at another and if this is possible it is evident to every common understanding that the more surely any medicine did promise the overthrow of a disease with the same certainty it brought along the impending fate of the sick person if diseases thus sometimes cure others that afflict us and if we only want to have them described in order to apply our trusty remedy as it is supposed it is most manifest that we do really hinder and obstruct a perfect cure of a disease that should be dismissed by some other if we did not endeavor to remove this curing disease by a faithful medicine and yet perhaps we rid our patients of neither of them nay the more powerful and infallible the medicine is that we employ the more do we put it out of the power of nature or the strength of constitution to conquer the afflicting distemper and the more noxious remedy so that here appears a mighty paradox that one disease should prove a cure for another and yet we never shall be able to know when one disease will be the cure of another but by a true theory of diseases which by most is ridiculed and neglected by too many  hippocrates and all ancient physicians especially have fully proved this paradox by their repeated observations and neither have they failed in their truth among more modern physicians who have thought observing of any use it will not be amiss i presume to give some examples of this matter and those shall be of that nature that the diseases i shall name do most especially require the quickest aid and the most certain ways of curing yet if even they are the cures of other diseases this whole matter must be true without exception fevers dysenteries dropsies etc are of this kind and who would not wish for an unerring specific for their cure yet hipp says that if a fever comes upon one afflicted with convulsions it cures him of that distemper and therefore whosoever does attempt to banish this fever with his trusty medicine must according to his success either entail this disease on his patient or destroy him altogether if nature is not able to baffle both the curer and the disease  the same hippocrates exhorts us not to despair of a maniacal mad person when he begins to have a dysentery or a dropsy but to hope the better of his recovery and therefore if any one observing the approach of any such disease should turn to his receipt book for a cure and should be happy enough to have an excellent medicine for either of em must be the more mistaken in the success by the sinistrous application for he does with great certainty confirm the madness on his patient  moreover great vomitings which are not only of fatal consequence but at once cut off all hopes of succouring languishing nature do require the speediest care of the best physician and the most infallible methods yet these are sometimes of great benefit when they come in the latter end of a lcoseness of a long continuance as the same hippocrates assures us and constant experience does vouch and therefore though dysenteries fevers dropsies vomiting etc be diseases that can of themselves bring life to its final period and do justly require our utmost study to discover their nature and to find out the best methods and medicines for curing em yet they come sometimes as the best and most speedy remedies for some other distempers which perhaps have already baffled all other methods already besides these diseases that thus cure and there being no other means left to shake off the distemper it must still continue to be dangerous if the unhappy curer has success enough to baffle that healing disease and thereis no possibility of knowing a fatal distemper from the same when it is to prove a cure but by knowing the necessary productions of diseases and the particular conditions of human bodies in which they are produced ie by having a true theory of diseases wherefore a true and an accurate theory of diseases is the most necessary thing for advancing a physicians knowledge for curing diseases  but  dly this argument holds very strong in respect of idiopathical and sympathical diseases for most frequently the distemper that makes the greatest figure is most taken notice of and frightens us the most is very dependent and is supported by a very small cause and yet it will continue frightful and threatening so long as all our applications are for this fearful part and its inconsiderable cause remains unregarded except in midst of this bustle the miute occasion passes off of it self very much to the reputation of the malignant curer though little is added to the stock of physic there be thousands of instances to prove this thing but i shall be satisfied to adduce one because it is evident and of great use when extended to all its length and that it fully proves all i have said on this head the example is this case of one who having a wound there may be a very moderate pain and a generation of pus and with this there will be a fever more or less to the causes this fever may be improved by a feaverdoctor that the suppuration shall miscarry and the fatal fever get a mighty strength whereas if he is less frightened with this common fever and has patience or art to suffer the suppuration to proceed or to promote it by various methods his fears will vanish with the fever which assuredly goes off in that order that the pus does take place  this argument holds evidently in every thing that relates to the cure of diseases for diseases are not only the cures of diseases and not only great discretion is to be used in discovering an idiopathical one neither do we only administer infallible remedies in undue and unseasonable times having no better guides than a general description of diseases but also for not having a true theory of diseases we do not know when it is time to put a stop to our successful method and but too frequently carry on a needless practice to the great detriment and hazard of the sick person there may be sundry examples brought for proving of this but i shall again content my self with one in the jaundice viz whose pathognomonical sign is most commonly the yellowness as its very name imports yet this yellowness is not always attending the indisposition but does sometimes continue when the sick person is free of the distemper and past all danger from the ill accidents that succeed it nay frequently the yellowness is augmented by some methods that cure the disease by which means the cure is still managed to the charge abhorrence and danger of the patient and still with the good intention of an ignorant curer  whereas by a true theory of diseases it is not only easy to determine when one is yellow and has the jaundice and when one is yellow and cured of the jaundice but understanding the reason of both he can destroy the yellowness when no consideration is hald to the first disease  i think this does very manifestly convince us that there is something else necessary besides infallible medicines for the cure of distempers though at the same time the best theories will cure no disease without proper remedies and the more excellent they are of their kind the more valuable they are  lastly this matter will appear manifestly and at once to our view if we do but reflect on the various and opposite sorts of medicines that the faithful observations of all former ages have sent us for the cure of the same disease for the variety shows the defect as well as the necessity of trying about for more and more certain medicines and the opposite sorts point out to us the variety of circumstances of the distemper so that my former gentleman a  s is scarcely initiated in these matters when he talks of a medicine of one quality to cure the same disease this in passing an example of this is every disease but i shall instance in the case of a consumption for which experience has recommended a very notable variety of medicines and these very opposite are we not told of milk and brimstone balsams and attenuating medicines and a great abundance of more jarring things but to give a fuller example in this particular i refer you to what i have said on this subject in my alvi profluvia by all which it is very plain how insufficient the greatest stock of the best medicines is without a true theory of diseases even for the cure of diseases  let me therefore persuade candid and honest physicians to set about a sedulous inquiry for a true theory of diseases and a more exact method for discovering the directest and most advantageous uses of good medicines that we may do the most good to mankind and show that the medicines chance have put into our hands may even have some improvement from us neither let us in this inquiry be discouraged with the impudence of pretenders nor by the small advances we can hope to make for they only hate you for your doing better than themselves and no body can tell what attempting in this matter does produce but they that have once tried it  finis
