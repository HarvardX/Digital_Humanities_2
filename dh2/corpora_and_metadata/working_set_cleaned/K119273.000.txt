the remarkable effects of fixed air in mortifications of the extremities to which is added the history of some wormcases  by john harrison surgeon of epson surry  london printed by baker and galabin ingramcourt fenchurch street  mdcclxxxv  price one shilling  the remarkable effects of fixed air in mortifications of the extremities mrs budworth a midwife of epsom aged  0 was seized on the   th of january    0 with a violent inflammation on the calf of the leg attended with excruciating pain it came out upon enquiry that she had been subject for five or six months before to occasional chills or shiverings which were attributed to her years but upon the whole she had been as well as people commonly are at so advanced an age she had frequently experienced erratic pains in the lower extremities for many years preceding and latterly her legs and feet would occasionally become oedematous but she had never been attacked by any complaint of consequence which probably was owing to a very regular or rather abstemious mode of living notwithstanding there was a very considerable inflammation of the part the pulse was neither hard nor very quick indeed the degree of fever was by no means so strongly marked in the pulse as it was in the tongue which was dry rough and discolored i applied the saturnine poultice to the leg and directed four spoonfuls of the following mixture to be taken every six hours  take of decoction of the bark   oz and a half huxhams tincture of bark one ounce thebaic tincture one dram and a half cordial confection one dram solutive syrup two drachms mix them together  the next day the pain and inflammation were much the same and the poultice and mixture were continued as before    st the medicines had not been regularly given the inflammation was extended as low down as the heel with a livid appearance and vesications here and there with a blackness underneath denoted the mortification to be begun i applied a poultice of linseedflour with elderointment over the whole leg and heel renewing it twice a day and continued the mixture her diet was sago salop and water gruel with the addition of a little brandy cinnamon and nutmeg  from this time to february the  0th the mortification spread slowly and at length reached the heel the medicines were taken very irregularly but when she did take them it was observed they relieved the pain the body was occasionally kept open by an infusion of sena and sometimes an emollient clyster was thrown up she took brandy and wine freely with her gruel and sago and sometimes would get down a bit of veal or chicken  she now february  0 refused medicine altogether i therefore resolved to try the effects of a fermenting poultice i applied a composition of flour yest and honey in the act of fermentation laying it on thick over the whole affected part upon taking it off at the end of thirtysix hours i must acknowledge i was surprised to see the alteration there was a free discharge of thin matter the lividness was abated and the painful twitchings which for some days past had been very troublesome were considerably lessened  february          the cataplasm was renewed daily and the sloughs which were abouthalf an inch deep separated fast the twitchings less painful and less frequent  march the  st the sloughs were quite separated and the ulcer began to cicatrise the pain was gone and her health visibly improved  march the  d a spot upon the os sacrum was shown me this day of the size of a halfcrown black and mortified i directed some of the same poultice to be made stiffer than the former and applied upon leather by the  th a digestion was effected and the part put on the appearance of healing in the mean time the sore in the leg continued to heal  march the  th she was taken with a faintingfit from which she was recovered with some difficulty i directed a cordial mixture but she could take but little of it and refusing all nourishment sunk gradually and expired the next day  the day before she died i examined the leg the sore looked very pale and rather dry but there was not the least appearance that threatened a return of the mortification the sore had contracted about a fifth part  the fermenting cataplasm i made use of in this case was made thus take of honey two parts yest one part wheatflour a sufficient quantity to form a consistence neither stiff nor soft set it before the fire and apply it when it begins to rise  it was mr buckles particular request that his case should be published christopher buckle esquire of banstead near this place aged  0 was attacked with a mortification of the great toe january the   th    0 without any preceding illness it appeared in the form of a black speck at the top of the toe close to the nail and the ball of the toe was livid and emphysematous i directed him to make use of the following fomentation twice or three times a day an hour at a time  take of crude salt of ammoniac an ounce camphorated spirits of wine two pints mix them together  after somenting the toe was dressed with balsam of copaiba warm and a large poultice was applied of linseed flour with a little lard a dram of the bark in powder was given every four hours and he was to keep his body open with the scotch pills  january the   th the toe was very flaccid which induced me to make an incision into it when i discharged without pain a pale watery fluid i now wished him to try opium in conjunction with the bark but as i could not persuade him to take opium internally i contented myself with dissolving two ounces of it in the fomentation  by january the   d the mortification was spread and vesications appeared on the second third and fourth toes i now prevailed upon mr buckle to allow the addition of thebaic tincture of which he took   0 drops every twentyfour hours and an ounce of bark in substance in the same space of time  january the   th the mortification was stopped but the event being still very dubious i requested farther assistance a gentleman of the first eminence mr pott in surgery was sent for from london who approved of what had been done and directed the continuation of the same applications and medicines  january the   th some faint signs of digestion appeared but to cut the history short it was not until the   th of february that the sloughs were all separated in the mean time my patient was repeatedly brought to the brink of the grave by a violent heartburn cardialgia and looseness diarrhoea at first and afterward by an accumulation of excrement in the straight gut rectum which i with great difficulty unloaded by means of a large marrowspoon  april the   th the sore was healed and i took my leave but july the  st mr buckle relapsed on the side of the the bone of the foot which sustains the little toe metatarsal bone of the little toe a blister had arisen which being snipped it formed an eschar as black as ink at his request i applied the fermenting poultice mentioned in the first case for he was determined to die rather than submit to the former course of medicine  august the  d he was completely cured without any internal medicine whatsoever mr sanxay of this neighborhood paid three visits during the cure and faw the progress of it with admiration  november the  0th he relapsed again a large vesication arose on the inside of the heel which being snipped formed an eschar as before the fermenting poultice was applied this eschar was rather larger than a crownpiece and almost as deep as the heelbone it was healed with great difficulty on the   th day of october      when it was firmly cicatrised without any other application save that of daily washing the ulcer with tincture of myrrh before the poultice was applied  mr buckle from october the   th      to the  d of december      had no return of his mortification but received a stroke of the palsy on that day for which on the  th two blisters were applied to the calves of the legs they were prevented from mortifying by the timely application of the fermenting poultice  december the   th the blisters were healed and on the  0th of january      this worthy gentleman after having supported himself with great fortitude and patience sunk under the disease and i cannot forbear adding to the great regret of all those who were acquainted with his excellent character  the history of some wormcases with an introduction the frequent instances i saw of the most deplorable effects from worms both in infants and adults during my residence at charlestown in south carolina induced me to make many trials of various remedies recommended to me in that country for their wormdestroying anthelmintic virtues i had very early opportunities in life of becoming acquainted with the medicines commonly employed in such cases and had often reason to lament the inefficacy of some of them and the dangerous roughness of others the tender age and reduced state of those who are the greatest martyrs to this disease seem evidently to point out the mildest remedies as most desirable whilst at the same time the common obstinacy of the complaints as loudly calls for the most powerful assistance those therefore who have trusted to rhubarb aethiops mineral wormseed powder of tin and the expressed oils have frequently had the mortification to be spectators of the daily progress of the disease and the bolder practitioner who has scoured the stomach and bowels with antimonials mercurials and the violent drastic purges has had but little reason to boast of the superior efficacy of his medicines when the original complaints have been succeeded by a lingering and fatal hectic  the remedies which i hereby recommend to the patronage of the public are the result of ten years experience during which time i have never known an instance of their failing but efficacious as they are they operate with the greatest mildness and are subject to no ill consequences whatever afterward they may be taken at any time requiring not the least confinement on the contrary gentle exercise assists the medicine as well as the patient it is not only in the more evident and marked wormcases that they are of use they are equally serviceable in that slow fever which is so frequent in the metropolis and which is commonly called the wormfever though oftentimes the patient is cured without the discharge of actual worms in short in all foul bowels attended with costiveness shortness of breath and sallow countenance i can most conscientiously recommend these medicines as they never fail to remove the symptoms gradually clearing the skin and restoring health  notwithstanding these medicines may be given without any risk from cold they nevertheless require to be altered and proportioned to the strength age habit and other circumstances of the patient which renders it absolutely necessary that he should be attended both before and during the time of taking them otherwise it will not be possible to administer them with any degree of certainty  i cannot conclude without attempting an apology for the intrusion of an unknown medicine upon the courtesy of the public but as i cannot at present reveal the secret and am perfectly satisfied that upon trial its own merits will sufficiently recommend it i shall only beg leave to add that no one who is acquainted with the virtues of jamess powder will think himself authorized to dispense with its use because he is ignorant of the precise form of the composition  i subjoin a cursory history of a few cases by way of adding weight to what i have advanced above  case the first      october  0 a boy aged about eleven years son of charles greenfield a laboring man who supplies the village of epsom with water was attacked with st vituss dance i gave him a mixture of liquid laudanum two drachms assafoetidatincture four drachms made into a sixounce mixture of which he took a large spoonful at a time often without relief  november   being of opinion that worms are the most common cause of convulsions in young people i gave him three wormpurges which brought away several worms and he gradually recovered       may    he relapsed and was cured by taking six doses       january  0 he relapsed again for which i made him continue the medicines once every three days for twentyfive days  october  0 he is stronger and heartier than ever and is at this time perfectly well  his friends would not permit him to take a few doses while he was well by way of prevention or in my opinion he would not have relapsed  case the second      june    the child of esau archer a laboring man aged between two and three years was brought to me in strong convulsions i gave her eight doses of the medicines she voided several worms and was perfectly cured  case the third      march    the reverend mr prices cookmaid a young woman aged twentythree was seized with violent convulsionfits for which being very full of blood plethoric she was bled and an emetic was prescribed with a nervous anodyne draught at bedtime and a purging mixture to take the next morning  march the  0th continuing almost in the same state a mixture of liquid laudanum and assafoetidatincture was prescribed without relief    st a purge of jalap and a few grains of prepared mercury were prescribed after the operation the mixture with laudanum and assafoetida was continued    d a physician of eminence was called he recommended half an ounce of the herb called ladiesmantle to be divided into eight doses of which one was to be taken three times a day    th at times she put on the appearance of being relieved the flowers of ladies mantle were continued until april the  th when she relapsed and was convulsed as severely as at the beginning an electary of valerian russia castor and conserve of rosemary with an infusion of rue and soottincture in a mixture after it was prescribed  april the  th extremely ill a perpetual blister was made between the shoulders    th from the  th to this day never entirely free from the convulsions an ounce of valerianpowder was divided into four doses one of which was taken every six hours in four spoonfuls of the ruemixture in the evening of this day she was so ill as to be scarcely able to swallow a muskdraught was directed to be taken every eight hours as it could be got down  april the   d no success having attended the medicines prescribed it made the doctor determine to try a nostrum which was two scruples of the lungs of a calf dried in an oven and powdered twice a day in three spoonfuls of strong rue tea after taking these powders a few days her complaint put on the appearance of mending and we hoped for success when to our great mortification on the  th of may she was attacked as violently as ever the blister was renewed  may the  th a box of pills composed of woodsoot and balsam of amber was directed three or four to be taken three times a day  may the   th the pills were continued but the doctor despaired of her getting the better of the fits as they generally lasted four or five hours without intermission  may the  0th a quackmedicine was recommended which had the appearance of sweet spirit of vitriol one phial was said to be a cure for all convulsions she took two phials with no apparent success  june the  th the doctor gave her over declaring it was not possible for her to live this being the case i informed her friends of a wormmedicine which i gave with great success and recommended it to her to which they consented i sent eight doses one to be taken morning and evening before she had taken all several worms were voided and once more her complaint put on the appearance of mending  may the   th the powders were continued and she discharged an amazing large quantity of worms knotted she was much altered for the better    th her countenance began to assume the appearance of returning health the convulsions had entirely left her appetite good strength increasing daily voiding worms    th almost able to do her business nevertheless as she had voided so large a quantity of worms i continued the medicines once a day by way of security and left them off in three days  june the  0th perfectly recovered  july the  d i thought it necessary to give her three doses more of the medicines to secure her health    th gave her three doses for the same reason       june    gave her three doses by way of prevention  october the  0th she is in good health and better than she had been for years before  case the fourth      july  0  graham esquire m p requested me to see his son an infant aged two years ill as i was informed of a wormfever i found his belly very large and swelled his countenance sallow a slow fever pulse quick and small his mouth full of little ulcers and costive the first dose of the wormmedicine gave him a large foetid slimy stool very loose which afforded him great relief    st the medicine was repeated which gave him another stool he was much better    d the medicine was repeated again    th the gentleman who attended wrote that the child was recovering fast and needed no more of the medicine  case the fifth august the  th stephen caleb of banstead a village near epsom brought his son to me a boy about eight or nine years old he had for several months past languished under a slow fever pain of the stomach and now and then was thrown into a convulsionfit he was much emaciated could hardly walk alone i gave three doses of the medicines which brought away several long worms he had less fever and was much better    th repeated the medicines he voided more worms his pain in the stomach and fits entirely left him  september the  0th recovered  case the sixth      august  0 james edes a shoemaker at banstead brought his son to me a boy aged nine years who had been very ill several months with a wormfever pain in the stomach a cough and enflamed eyes i cured him with eleven doses of the medicines he voided many worms  case the seventh      april    mrs foremans footman at epsom aged twentytwo or twentythree applied to me he complained of a fixed pain in the pupils of his eyes which seemed remarkably dejected a florid countenance flushing often pain of the right side and stomach a tickling cough a small thready unequal pulse hectic heats and nightsweats an emetic was administered and the next morning a cooling purge he was advised to eat little flesh to take buttermilk for breakfast and supper or whey or milkporridge and to eat freely of sallad and other vegetables  april the   th a blister was applied between the shoulders and made perpetual for several weeks and as he grew worse he was directed to abstain from animal food to shorten the history he continued in this state until the seventh of august following when he was advised to go and try his native air in sussex  september the  th he returned much in the same state excepting that the pain was fixed in the stomach constant and severe always after eating ever so little to use his own words it had the feel of something striking gently against his stomach    th daily growing weaker i recommended him to take the wormdestroyer anthelmintic apprehending that worms might be the cause of his complaint  october the  st he had taken eight doses and voided several knotted worms of various sizes    th from the   th of september to this day he took morning and evening a dose of the medicine and every day voided some worms his pain in the stomach cough hectic heats etc have all
