agrarian justice opposed to agrarian law and to agrarian monopoly being a plan for meliorating the condition of man by creating in every nation a national fund  to pay to every person when arrived at the age of twentyone years the sum of fifteen pounds sterling to enable him or her to begin the world and also ten pounds sterling per annum during life to every person now living of the age of fifty years and to all others when they shall arrive at that age to enable them to live in old age without wretchedness and go decently out of the world  by thomas pain author of common sense rights of man etc etc  paris printed by w adlard rue menilmontant london reprinted and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster  price sixpence  preface the following little piece was written in the winter of      and    and as i had not determined whether to publish it during the present war or to wait till the commencement of a peace it has lain by me without alteration or addition from the time it was written  what has determined me to publish it now is a sermon preached by watson bishop of landaff some of my readers will recollect that this bishop wrote a book entitled an apology for the bible in answer to my second part of the age of reason i procured a copy of his book and he may depend upon hearing from me on that subject  at the end of the bishops book is a list of the works he has written among which is the sermon alluded to it is entitled the wisdom and goodness of god in having made both rich and poor with an appendix containing reflections on the present state of england and france  the error contained in the title of this sermon determined me to publish my agrarian justice it is wrong to say that god made rich and poor he made only male and female and he gave them the earth for their inheritance                 instead of preaching to encourage one part of mankind in insolence        it would be better that priests employed their time to render the general condition of man less miserable than it is practical religion consists in doing good and the only way of serving god is that of endeavoring to make his creation happy  all preaching that has not this for its object is nonsense and hypocrisy  thomas pain  agrarian justice opposed to agrarian law and to agrarian monopoly being a plan for meliorating the condition of man etc to preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life and to remedy at the same time the evils it has produced ought to be considered as one of the first objects of reformed legislation  whether that state that is proudly perhaps erroneously called civilization has most promoted or most injured the general happiness of man is a question that may be strongly contested on one side the spectator is dazzled by splendid appearances on the other he is shocked by extremes of wretchedness both of which he has erected the most affluent and the most miserable of the human race are to be found in the countries that are called civilized  to understand what the state of society ought to be it is necessary to have some idea of the natural and primitive state of man such as it is at this day among the indians of north america there is not in that state any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want present to our eyes in all the towns and streets in europe poverty therefore is a thing created by that which is called civilized life it exists not in the natural state on the other hand the natural state is without those advantages which flow from agriculture arts science and manufactures  the life of an indian is a continual holiday compared with the poor of europe and on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared with the rich civilization therefore or that which is so called has operated two ways to make one part of society more affluent and the other part more wretched than would have been the lot of either in a natural state  it is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state but it is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state the reason is that man in a natural state subsisting by hunting requires ten times the quantity of land to range over to procure himself sustenance than would support him in a civilized state where the earth is cultivated when therefore a country becomes populous by the additional aids of cultivation arts and science there is a necessity of preserving things in that state because without it there cannot be sustenance for more perhaps than a tenth part of its inhabitants the thing therefore now to be done is to remedy the evils and preserve the benefits that have arisen to society by passing from the natural to that which is called the civilized state  taking then the matter upon this ground the first principle of civilization ought to have been and ought still to be that the condition of every person born into the world after a state of civilization commences ought not to be worse than if he had been born before that period but the fact is that the condition of millions in every country in europe is far worse than if they had been born before civilization began or had been born among the indians of north america of the present day i will show how this fact has happened  it is a position not to be controverted that the earth in its natural uncultivated state was and ever would have continued to be the common property of the human race in that state every man would have been born to property he would have been a joint lifeproprietor with the rest in the property of the soil and in all its natural productions vegetable and animal  but the earth in its natural state as before said is capable of supporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doing in a cultivated state and as it is impossible to separate the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself upon which that improvement is made the idea of landed property arose from that inseparable connection but it is nevertheless true that it is the value of the improvement only and not the earth itself that is individual property every proprietor therefore of cultivated land owes to the community a groundrent for i know no better term to express the idea by for the land which he holds and it is from this groundrent that the fund proposed in this plan is to issue  it is deducible as well from the nature of the thing as from all the histories transmitted to us that the idea of landed property commenced with cultivation and that there was no such thing as landed property before that time it could not exist in the first state of man that of hunters it did not exist in the second state that of shepherds neither abraham isaac jacob or job so far as the history of the bible may be credited in probable things were owners of land their property consisted as is always enumerated in flocks and herds and they traveled with them from place to place the frequent contentions at that time about the use of a well in the dry country of arabia where those people lived show also there was no landed property it was not admitted that land could be located as property  there could be no such thing as landed property originally man did not make the earth and though he had a natural right to occupy it he had no right to locate as his property in perpetuity any part of it neither did the creator of the earth open a landoffice from whence the first titledeeds should issue  from whence then arose the idea of landed property i answer as before that when cultivation began the idea of landed property began with it from the impossibility of separating the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself upon which that improvement was made the value of the improvement so far exceeded the value of the natural earth at that time as to absorb it till in the end the common right of all became confounded into the cultivated right of the individual but they are nevertheless distinct species of rights and will continue to be so as long as the world endures  it is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful ideas of them and it is by gaining such ideas that we discover the boundary that divides right from wrong and which teaches every man to know his own i have entitled this tract agrarian justice to distinguish it from agrarian law nothing could be more unjust than agrarian law in a country improved by cultivation for though every man as an inhabitant of the earth is a joint proprietor of it in its natural state it does not follow that he is a joint proprietor of cultivated earth the additional value made by cultivation after the system was admitted became the property of those who did it or who inherited it from them or who purchased it it had originally an owner whilst therefore i advocate the right and interest myself in the hard case of all those who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property i equally defend the right of the possessor to the part which is his  cultivation is at least one of the greatest improvements ever made by human invention it has given to created earth a tenfold value but the landed monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest evil it has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their natural inheritance without providing for them as ought to have been done as an indemnification for that loss and has thereby created a species of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist before  in advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed it is a right and not a charity that i am pleading for but it is that kind of right which being neglected at first could not be brought forward afterward till heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system of government let us then do honor to revolutions by justice and give currency to their principles by blessings  having thus in a few words opened the merits of the case i proceed to the plan i have to propose which is  to create a national fund out of which there shall be paid to every person when arrived at the age of twentyone years the sum of fifteen pounds sterling as a compensation in part for the loss of his or her natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property and also the sum of ten pounds per annum during life to every person now living of the age of fifty years and to all others as they shall arrive at that age  means by which the fund is to be created  i have already established the principle namely that the earth in its natural uncultivated state was and ever would have continued to be the common property of the human race  that in that state every person would have been born to property  and that the system of landed property by its inseparable connection with cultivation and with what is called civilized life has absorbed the property of all those whom it dispossessed without providing as ought to have been done an indemnification for that loss  the fault however is not in the present possessors no complaint is intended or ought to be alleged against them unless they adopt the crime by opposing justice the fault is in the system and it has stolen imperceptibly upon the world aided afterward by the agrarian law of the sword but the fault can be made to reform itself by successive generations without diminishing or deranging the property of any of the present possessors and yet the operation of the fund can commence and be in full activity the first year of its establishment or soon after as i shall show  it is proposed that the payments as already stated be made to every person rich or poor it is best to make it so to prevent invidious distinctions it is also right it should be so because it is in lieu of the natural inheritance which as a right belongs to every man over and above the property he may have created or inherited from those who did such persons as do not choose to receive it can throw it into the common fund  taking it then for granted that no person ought to be in a worse condition when born under what is called a state of civilization than he would have been had he been born in a state of nature and that civilization ought to have made and ought still to make provision for that purpose it can only be done by subtracting from property a portion equal in value to the natural inheritance it has absorbed  various methods may be proposed for this purpose but that which appears to be the best not only because it will operate without deranging any present possessions or without interfering with the collection of taxes or emprunts necessary for the purpose of government and the revolution but because it will be the least troublesome and the most effectual and also because the subtraction will be made at a time that best admits it which is at the moment that property is passing by the death of one person to the possession of another in this case the bequeather gives nothing the receiver pays nothing the only matter to him is that the monopoly of natural inheritance to which there never was a right begins to cease in his person a generous man would wish it not to continue and a just man will rejoice to see it abolished  my state of health prevents my making sufficient enquiries with respect to the doctrine of probabilities whereon to found calculations with such degrees of certainty as they are capable of what therefore i offer on this head is more the result of observation and reflection than of received information but i believe it will be found to agree sufficiently enough with fact  in the first place taking twentyone years as the epoch of maturity all the property of a nation real and personal is always in the possession of persons above that age it is then necessary to know as a datum of calculation the average of years which persons above that age will be live i take this average to be about thirty years for though many persons will live forty fifty or sixty years after the age of twentyone years others will die much sooner and some in every year of that time  taking then thirty years as the average of time it will give without any material variation one way or other the average of time in which the whole property or capital of a nation or a sum equal thereto will have passed through one entire revolution in descent that is will have gone by deaths to new possessors for though in many instances some parts of this capital will remain forty fifty or sixty years in the possession of one person other parts will have revolved two or three times before that thirty years expire which will bring it to that average for were one half of the capital of a nation to revolve twice in thirty years it would produce the same fund as if the whole revolved once  taking then thirty years as the average of time in which the whole capital of a nation or a sum equal thereto will revolve once the thirtieth part thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year that is will go by deaths to new possessors and this last sum being thus known and the ratio per cent to be subtracted from it being determined will give the annual amount or income of the proposed fund to be applied as already mentioned  in looking over the discourse of the english minister pit in his opening of what is called in england the budget the scheme of finance for the year      i find an estimate of the national capital of that country as this estimate of a national capital is prepared ready to my hand i take it as a datum to act upon when a calculation is made upon the known capital of any nation combined with its population it will serve as a scale for any other nation in proportion as its capital and population be more or less i am the more disposed to take this estimate of mr pit for the purpose of showing to that minister upon his own calculation how much better money may be employed than in wasting it as he has done on the wild project of setting up bourbon kings what in the name of heaven are bourbon kings to the people of england it is better that the people of england have bread  mr pit states the national capital of england real and personal to be one thousand three hundred millions sterling which is about one fourth part of the national capital of france including belgia the event of the last harvest in each country proves that the soil of france is more productive than that of england and that it can better support twentyfour or twentyfive millions of inhabitants than that of england can seven or seven and an half  the thirtieth part of this capital of l  00000000 is l         which is the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that country to new possessors and the sum that will annually revolve in france in the proportion of four to one will be about one hundred and seventythree millions sterling from this sum of l         annually revolving is to be subtracted the value of the natural inheritance absorbed in it which perhaps in fair justice cannot be taken at less and ought not to be taken at more than a tenth part  it will always happen that of the property thus revolving by deaths every year part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters and the other part collaterally and the proportion will be found to be about three to one that is about thirty millions of the above sum will descend to direct heirs and the remaining sum of l         to more distant relations and part to strangers  considering then that man is always related to society that relationship will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next of kin is more distant it is therefore consistent with civilization to say that where there are no direct heirs society shall be heir to a part over and above the tenth part due to society if this additional part be from five or ten or twelve per cent in proportion as the next of kin be nearer or more remote so as to average with the escheats that may fall which ought always to go to society and not to the government an addition of ten per cent more the produce from the annual sum of  l         will be from  0000000  at ten per cent  000000 from           at ten per cent with the addition of ten per cent more         l         l         having thus arrived at the annual amount of the proposed fund i come in the next place to speak of the population proportioned to this fund and to compare it with uses to which the fund is to be applied  the population i mean that of england does not exceed seven millions and a half and the number of persons above the age of fifty will in that case be about four hundred thousand there would not however be more than that number that would accept the proposed ten pounds sterling per annum though they would be entitled to it i have no idea it would be accepted by many persons who had a yearly income of two or three hundred pounds sterling but as we often see instances of rich people falling into sudden poverty even at the age of sixty they would always have the right of drawing all the arrears due to them  four millions therefore of the above annual sum of l        will be required for four hundred thousand aged persons at ten pounds sterling each  i come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twentyone years of age if all the persons who died were above the age of twentyone years the number of persons annually arriving at that age must be equal to the annual number of deaths to keep the population stationary but the greater part die under the age of twentyone and therefore the number of persons annually arriving at twentyone will be less than half the number of deaths the whole number of deaths upon a population of seven millions and a half will be about   0000 annually the number at twentyone years of age will be about  00000 the whole number of these will not receive the proposed fifteen pounds for the reasons already mentioned though as in the former case they would be entitled to it admitting then that a tenth part declined receiving it the amount would stand thus fund annually l        to  00000 aged persons at  0l each l 000000 to  0000 persons of    years   l sterling each    0000    0000 remains l        there are in every country a number of blind and lame persons totally incapable of earning a livelihood but as it will happen that the greater number of blind persons will be among those who are above the age of fifty years they will be provided for in that class the remaining sum of l       will provide for the lame and blind under that age at the same rate of  0l annually for each person  having now gone through all the necessary calculations and stated the particulars of the plan i shall conclude with some observations  it is not charity but a right  not bounty but justice that i am pleading for the present state of what is called civilization is     it is the reverse of what it ought to be and     the contrast of affluence and wretchedness continually meeting and offending the eye is like dead and living bodies chained together though i care as little about riches as any man i am a friend to riches because they are capable of good i care not how affluent some may be provided that none be miserable in consequence of it  but it is impossible to enjoy affluence with the fecility it is capable of being enjoyed whilst so much misery is mingled in the scene the sight of the misery and the unpleasant sensations it suggests which though they may be suffocated cannot be extinguished are a greater drawback upon the felicity of affluence than the proposed  0 per cent upon property is worth he that would not give the one to get rid of the other has no charity even for himself  there are in every country some magnificent charities established by individuals it is however but little that any individual can do when the whole extent of the misery to be relieved be considered he may satisfy his conscience but not his heart he may give all that he has and that all will relieve but little it is only by organizing civilization upon such principles as to act like a system of pullies that the whole weight of misery can be removed  the plan here proposed will reach the whole it will immediately relieve and take out of view three classes of wretchedness  the blind the lame and the aged poor and it will furnish the rising generation with means to prevent their becoming poor and it will do this without deranging or interfering with any national measures to show that this will be the case it is sufficient to observe that the operation and effect of the plan will in all cases be the same as if every individual was voluntarily to make his will and dispose of his property in the manner here proposed  but it is justice and not charity that is the principle of the plan in all great cases it is necessary to have a principle more universally active than charity and with respect to justice it ought not to be left to the choice of detached individuals whether they will do justice or not considering then the plan on the ground of justice it ought to be the act of the whole growing spontaneously out of the principles of the revolution and the reputation of it to be national and not individual  a plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution by the energy that springs from the consciousness of justice it would multiply also the national resources for property like vegetation increases by offsets when a young couple begins the world the difference is exceedingly great whether they begin with nothing or with fifteen pounds apiece with this aid they could buy a cow and implements to cultivate a few acres of land and instead of becoming burdens upon society which is always the case where children are produced faster than they can be fed would be put in the way of becoming useful and profitable citizens the national domains also would sell the better if pecuniary aids were provided to cultivate them in small lots  it is the practice of what has unjustly obtained the name of civilization and the practice merits not to be called either charity or policy to make some provision for persons becoming poor and wretched only at the time they become so  would it not even as a matter of economy be far better to devise means to prevent their becoming poor this can best be done by making every person when arrived at the age of twentyone years an inheritor of something to begin with the rugged face of society checquered with the extremes of affluence and of want proves that some extraordinary violence has been committed upon it and calls on justice for redress the great mass of the poor in all countries are become an hereditary race and it is next to impossible for them to get out of that state of themselves it ought also to be observed that this mass increase in all the countries that are called civilized more persons fall annually into it than get out of it  though in a plan in which justice and humanity are the foundation principles interest ought not to be admitted into the calculation yet it is always of advantage to the establishment of any plan to show that it is beneficial as a matter of interest the success of any proposed plan submitted to public consideration must finally depend on the numbers interested in supporting it united with the justice of its principles  the plan here proposed will benefit all without injuring any it will consolidate the interest of the republic with that of the individual to the numerous class dispossessed of their natural inheritance by the system of landed property it will be an act of national justice to persons dying possessed of moderate fortunes it will operate as a tontine to their children more beneficial than the sum of money paid into the fund and it will give to the accumulation of riches a degree of security that none of the old governments of europe now tottering on their foundations can give  i do not suppose that more than one family in ten in any of the countries of europe has when the head of the family dies a clear property left of five hundred pounds sterling to all such the plan is advantageous that property would pay fifty pounds into the fund and if there were only two children under age they would receive fifteen pounds each thirty pounds on coming of age and be entitled to ten pounds a year after fifty it is from the overgrown acquisition of property that the fund will support itself and i know that the possessors of such property in england though they would eventually be benefited by the protection of nine tenths of it will exclaim against the plan but without entering into any enquiry how they came by that property let them recollect that they have been the advocates of this war and that mr pit has already laid on more new taxes to be raised annually upon the people of england and that for supporting the despotism of austria and the bourbons against the liberties of france than would annually pay all the sums proposed in this plan  i have made the calculations stated in this plan upon what is called personal as well as upon landed property the reason for making it upon land is already explained and the reason for taking personal property into the calculation is equally well founded though on a different principle land as before said is the free gift of the creator in common to the human race personal property is the effect of society and it is as impossible for an individual to acquire personal property without the aid of society as it is for him to make land originally separate an individual from society and give him an island or a continent to possess and he cannot acquire personal property he cannot become rich so inseparably are the means connected with the end in all cases that where the former do not exist the latter cannot be obtained all accumulation therefore of personal property beyond what a mans own hands produce is derived to him by living in society and he owes on every principle of justice of gratitude and of civilization a part of that accumulation back again to society from whence the whole came this is putting the matter on a general principle and perhaps it is best to do so for if we examine the case minutely it will be found that the accumulation of personal property is in many instances the effects of paying too little for the labor that produced it the consequence of which is that the working hand perishes in old age and the employer abounds in affluence it is perhaps impossible to proportion exactly the price of labor to the profits it produces and it will also be said as an apology for injustice that were a workman to receive an increase of wages daily he would not save it against old age nor be much the better for it in the interim make then society the treasurer to guard it for him in a common fund for it is no reason that because he might not make a good use of it for himself that another shall take it  the state of civilization that has prevailed throughout europe is as unjust in its principle as it is horrid in its effects and it is the consciousness of this and the apprehension that such a state cannot continue when once investigation begins in any country that makes the possessors of property dread every idea of a revolution it is the hazard and not the principles of a revolution that retards their progress this being the case it is necessary as well for the protection of property as for the sake of justice and humanity to form a system that whilst it preserves one part of society from wretchedness shall secure the other from depredation  the superstitious awe the enslaven reverence that formerly surrounded affluence is passing away in all countries and leaving the possessor of property to the convulsion of accidents when wealth and splendor instead of fascinating the multitude excite emotions of disgust when instead of drawing forth admiration it is beheld as an insult upon wretchedness when the ostentatious appearance it makes serves to call the right of it in question the case of property becomes critical and it is only in a system of justice that the possessor can contemplate security  to remove the danger it is necessary to remove the antipathies and this can only be done by making property productive of a national blessing extending to every individual when the riches of one man above another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion when it shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity of individuals when the more riches a man acquires the better it shall be for the general mass it is then that antipathies will cease and property be placed on the permanent basis of national interest and protection  i have no property in france to become subject to the plan i propose what i have which is not much is in the united states of america but i will pay one hundred pounds sterling toward this fund in france the instant it shall be established and i will pay the same sum in england whenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country  a revolution in the state of civilization is the necessary companion of revolutions in the system of government if a revolution in any country be from bad to good or from good to bad the state of what is called civilization in that country must be made conformable thereto to give that revolution effect despotic government supports itself by abject civilization in which debasement of the human mind and wretchedness in the mass of the people are the chief criterions such governments consider man merely as an animal that the exercise of intellectual faculty is not his privilege that he has nothing to do with the laws but to obey them expression of horsley an english bishop in the english parliament and they politically depend more upon breaking the spirit of the people by poverty than they fear enraging it by desperation  it is a revolution in the state of civilization that will give perfection to the revolution of france already the conviction that government by representation is the true system of government is spreading itself fast in the world the reasonableness of it can be seen by all the justness of it makes itself felt even by its opposers but when a system of civilization growing out of that system of government shall be so organized that not a man or woman born in the republic but shall inherit some means of beginning the world and see before them the certainty of escaping the miseries that under other governments accompany old age the revolution of france will have an advocate and an ally in the heart of all nations  an army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot  it will succeed where diplomatic management would fail  it is neither the rhine the channel nor the ocean that can arrest its progress  it will march on the horizon of the world and it will conquer  thomas pain  means for carrying the proposed plan into execution and to render it at the same time conducive to the public interest i each canton shall elect in its primary assemblies three persons as commissioners for that canton who shall take cognizance and keep a register of all matters happening in that canton conformable to the charter that shall be established by law for carrying this plan into execution ii the law shall fix the manner in which the property of deceased persons shall be ascertained iii when the amount of the property of any deceased person shall be ascertained the principal heir to that property or the eldest of the coheirs if of lawful age or if under age the person authorized by the will of the deceased to represent him or them shall give bond to the commissioners of the canton to pay the said tenth part thereof within the space of one year in four equal quarterly payments or sooner at the choice of the payers one half of the whole property shall remain as security until the bond be paid off iv the bonds shall be registered in the office of the commissioners of the canton and the original bonds shall be deposited in the national bank at paris the bank shall publish every quarter of a year the amount of the bonds in its possession and also the bonds that shall have been paid off or what parts thereof since the last quarterly publication v the national bank shall issue bank notes upon the security of the bonds in its possession the notes so issued shall be applied to pay the pensions of aged persons and the compensation of persons arriving at twentyone years of age it is both reasonable and generous to suppose that persons not under immediate necessity will suspend their right of drawing on the fund until it acquire as it will do a greater degree of ability in this case it is proposed that an honorary register be kept in each canton of the names of the persons thus suspending that right at least during the present war vi as the inheritors of property must always take up their bonds in four quarterly payments or sooner if they choose there will always be numeraire arriving at the bank after the expiration of the first quarter to exchange for the bank notes that shall be brought in vii the bank notes being thus got into circulation upon the best of all possible security that of actual property to more than four times the amount of the bonds upon which the notes are issued and with numeraire continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay them off whenever they shall be presented for that purpose they will acquire a permanent value in all parts of the republic they can therefore be received in payment of taxes or emprunts equal to numeraire because the government can always receive numeraire for them at the bank viii it will be necessary that the payments of the ten per cent be made in numeraire for the first year from the establishment of the plan but after the expiration of the first year the inheritors of property may pay the ten per cent either in bank notes issued upon the fund or in numeraire it will lie as a deposit at the bank to be exchanged for a quantity of notes equal to that amount and if in notes issued upon the fund it will cause a demand upon the fund equal thereto and thus the operation of the plan will create means to carry itself into execution finis
