messiah  advertisement in reading several passages of the prophet isaiah which foretell the coming of christ and the felicities attending it i could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts and those in the pollio of virgil this will not seem surprising when we reflect that the eclogue was taken from a sibylline prophecy on the same subject one may judge that virgil did not copy it line by line but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece i have endeavored the same in this imitation of him though without admitting any thing of my own since it was written with this particular view that the reader by comparing the several thoughts might see how for the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet but as i fear i have prejudiced them by my management i shall subjoin the passages of isaiah and those of virgil under the same

p  remarks ver    ye heavens from high the dewy nectar pour and in soft silence shed the kindly shower his original says drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together  this is a very noble description of divine grace shed abroad in the hearts of the faithful under the gospel dispensation and the poet understood all its force as appears from the two lines preceding these  the ethereal spirit etc the prophet describes this under the image of rain which chiefly fits the first age of the gospel the poet under the idea of dew which extends it to every age and as it was his purpose it should be o understood as appears from this expression of soft silence which agrees with the common not the extraordinary effusions of the holy spirit the figurative term is wonderfully happy he who would moralize the ancient mythology in the manner of bacn must say that by the poetical nectar is meant theological grace  ver    ancient fraud i e the fraud of the serpent  ver    he from thick films shall purge the visual ray the sense and language show that by visual ray the poet meant the sight or as milton calls it indeed something less boldly visual nerve and no critic would quarrel with the figure which calls the instrument of vision by the name of the cause but though the term be just nay noble and even sublime yet the expression of thick films is faulty and he fell into it by a common neglect of the following rule of good writing that when a figurative word is used whatsoever is predicated of it ought not only to agree in terms to the thing to which the figure is applied but likewise to that from which the figure is taken thick films agree only with the thing to which it is applied namely to the sight or eve and not to that from which it is taken namely a ray of light coming to the eye he should have said thick clouds which would have agreed with both but these inaccuracies are not to be found in his later poems
