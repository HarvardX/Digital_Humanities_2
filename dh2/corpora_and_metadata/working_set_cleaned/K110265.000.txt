the poetical works of richard west   simplex nec despice carmen nec vatem non illa leves primordia motus quanquam parva dabunt gray de princip cogit just heaven what sin ere life begins to bloom devotes my head untimely to the tomb did ever this hand against a brothers life drug the dire bowl or point the murderous knife did ever this tongue the slandrers tale proclaim or madly violate my makers name did ever this heart betray a friend or foe or know a thought but all the world might know  but why repine does life deserve my sigh few will lament my loss whenever i die  yet some there are ere spent my vital days within whose breasts my tomb i wish to raise loved in my life lamented in my end their praise would crown me as their precepts mend to them may these fond lines my name endear not from the poet but the friend sincere ad amicos edinburg at the apollo press by the martins anno       miscellanies advertisement the life of mr west was so short and the events of it so few that it was judged better to insert the anecdotes which remain of this hopeful youth in the preceding account of his friend than to reserve them for a detached article mr walpole wished to see their works united in one volume the only objection of mr gray to this wish no longer now remains had he complied with mr walpoles desire it is the opinion of mr mason that he would have given only the poems which follow  ad amicos imitated from tibullus book iii elegy   and mr popes letter in sickness to mr steel yes happy youths on camus sedgy side you feel each joy that friendship can divide each realm of science and of art explore and with the ancient blend the modern lore studious alone to learn whatever may tend to raise the genius or the heart to mend now pleased along the cloistered walks you rove and trace the verdant mazes of the grove where social often and often alone ye choose to catch the zephir and to court the muse meantime at me while all devoid of art these lines give back the image of my heart at me the power that comes or soon or late or aims or seems to aim the dart of fate from you remote methinks alone i stand like some sad exile in a desert land around no friends their lenient care to join in mutual warmth and mix their heart with mine or real pains or those which fancy raise for ever blot the sunshine of my days to sickness still and still to grief a prey health turns from me her rosy face away just heaven what sin ere life begins to bloom devotes my head untimely to the tomb did ever this hand against a brothers life drug the dire bowl or point the murderous knife did ever this tongue the slandrers tale proclaim or madly violate my makers name did ever this heart betray a friend or foe or know a thought but all the world might know as yet just started from the lists of time my growing years have scarcely told their prime useless as yet through life iave idly run no pleasures tasted and few duties done ah who ere autumns mellowing suns appear would pluck the promise of the vernal year or ere the grapes their purple hue betray tear the crude cluster from the mourning spray stern power of fate whose ebon scepter rules the stygian deserts and cimmerian pools forbear nor rashly smite my youthful heart a victim yet unworthy of thy dart ah stay till age shall blast my withering face shake in my head and falter in my pace then aim the shaft then meditate the blow and to the dead my willing shade shall go how weak is man to reasons judging eye born in this moment in the next we die part mortal clay and part ethereal fire too proud to creep too humble to aspire in vain our plans of happiness we raise pain is our lot and patience is our praise wealth lineage honors conquest or a throne are what the wise would fear to call their own health is at best a vain precarious thing and fairfacd youth youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age it is like the stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret pope is ever on the wing it is like the stream side whose watery bed some blooming plant exalts his flowery head nursed by the wave the spreading branches rise shade all the ground and flourish to the skies the waves the while beneath in secret flow and undermine the hollow bank below wide and more wide the waters urge their way bare all the roots and on their fibers prey too late the plant bewails his foolish pride and sinks untimely in the whelming tide but why repine does life deserve my sigh few will lament my loss whenever i die for those the wretches i am not at all uneasy at the thought that many men whom i never had any esteem for are likely to enjoy this world after me pope i despise or hate i neither envy nor regard their fate for me whenever allconqring death shall spread his wings around my unrepining head i care not the morning after my exit the sun will rise as bright as ever the flowers smell as sweet the plants spring as green people will laugh etc pope  though this face be seen no more the world will pass as cheerful as before bright as before the day star will appear the fields as verdant and the skies as clear nor storms nor comets will my doom declare nor signs on earth nor portents in the air unknown and silent will depart my breath nor nature ever take notice of my death yet some there are ere spent my vital days within whose breasts my tomb i wish to raise loved in my life lamented in my end their praise would crown me as their precepts mend to them may these fond lines my name endear not from the poet but the friend sincere this epistle was written from christchurch oxford july  th
