of his leisure hours to the study of the oriental languages the persian tongue being the most polite and learned as well as the most universally understood in asia engaged his principal attention  the intimate connection which the british nation now have with a part of hindostan renders the knowledge of the country languages of great importance to the servants of the public in that part of the world the translator who had extended his views in the way of his profession thought it so capital a point for him that he persevered for some years in that dry and difficult study and incurred a very considerable expense in retaining masters and in procuring manuscripts  though to qualify himself for action and negotiation in india was the primary object of the translator yet in proportion as he advanced in his studies other motives for his continuing them arose he found that however different the manner of the eastern writers may be from the correct taste of europe there are many things in their works worthy of the attention of literary men their poetry it is true is too turgid and florid and the diction of their historians too diffuse and verbose yet in the first we meet with some passages truly elegant and sublime and amidst the redundancy of the latter there appears sometimes a nervousness of expression and a manliness of sentiment which might do honor to any historical genius in the west  locked up in the difficulties of the persian tongue the literature of asia has been hitherto little known in europe from an ignorance so unpardonable in this investigating age a very unfavourable idea has prevailed concerning the learning as well as history of the eastern nations full of prejudices so natural to an european the translator entered upon the study of the oriental languages whatever aid a knowledge of them might give to his private views he little hoped to be able to convert his studies to the amusement or instruction of the public to translate some piece of history was by his teachers recommended to him as a proper exercise in the persian the works of mahummud casim ferishta of delhi who flourished in the reign of jehangire about the beginning of the seventeenth century was put into his hands for that purpose as he advanced a greater field gradually opened before him he found with some degree of astonishment the minute and authentic history of a great empire the name of which had scarcely ever traveled to europe  to open a door to the literary treasures which lay concealed in the obscurity of the persian the translator resolved to proceed in his version of ferishtas history and to give it to the public as a small specimen of what men of greater abilities may hereafter meet with in that language but before he had fully accomplished this design injuries in rank and other motives forced him to quit the companys service and to return to england being at his departure from india possessed only of one volume of the original he has been obliged to confine himself to it and to leave the second volume which contains the particular histories of the decan bengal guzerat and cashmire to a more favorable opportunity or to the employment of some other hand this circumstance has occasioned some chasms in that part of the history which is now given to the public and many material transactions of those nations of whom ferishta in his second volume treats are only slightly mentioned  the reigns of the mogul emperors from akbar with whom our author concludes his general history have been written by different historians but so voluminous are those works that to attempt a translation would be a laborious and very tedious task since the days of ferishta no writer that has come to our knowledge has abridged the history of india and therefore the translator had formed a design to compile from various authors that very essential part of the history of the mogul empire which is not comprehended in the following translation  with a view to accomplish this undertaking the translator who had been honored with the particular friendship of the present mogul applied in person to that prince for such books and authentic records as were necessary to complete the history of hindostan the king approved very much of his design and gave orders to his secretary to grant his request but in the mean time the translator quitted the service and retired to calcutta to revive however his majestys memory upon that subject he wrote to him and as the manner of writing to eastern princes may afford matter of some curiosity to the public we shall here give a literal translation of the letter  to the audience of the admitted into the presence of the treasury of liberality and beneficence to the sage director of the ways of truth the kibla the point to which the mahommedans turn their faces when they pray of the world and the asylum of the inhabitants of the universe whose kingdom and renown last for ever it is most humbly presented  that a servant nourished by their it is an invariable custom among the eastern nations to address crowned heads in the third person plural while the writer himself always uses the third person in the singular number bounty having from their splendid presence obtained leave of departure has now reached the city of calcutta where retired from the noise of public affairs he prays for their majestys welfare  moved by a grateful remembrance of their royal favor warmed by the fame justice and glorious exploits and conquests of the emperors of the paradisiacal regions of hindostan but more particularly excited by the renown of the imperial house of timur timur who in europe is by corruption called tamerlane has always conferred upon him the title of saib kirren or lord of the periods kirren of which kiran is the plural signifies a period of thirty years the long reign of timur gave rise to his title  lord of ages and also by a desire to gratify the curiosity of distant nations with the great actions of a splendid dynasty of kings he has dared to aspire to translate the history of hindostan from the best and most authentic persian authors into the english language now strong learned and universal  from the first rising of the star of the faith upon these paradisiacal plains unto the end of the glorious reign of arsh astani mahummud akbar king the history of empire has been already penned but from that period to the present time materials have been wanting to their majestys servant he therefore breathes in hope that their sublime majesty will signify their royal pleasure to the rai raian chief secretary of the illustrious presence to supply their servant with such books and authentic records as are necessary to accomplish his great design thus shall the glory of their renown shine forth to european eyes with that splendour which from the firmament of empire has hitherto enlightened the east  the government of the presidency of bengal have of late in some particulars imbibed the political principles of the east for all private correspondence with any of the country powers is strictly prohibited the above letter was dispatched by the translator to a friend at allahabad the present residence of the emperor with a request to deliver it in person to that prince but whether afraid of his superiors or guilty of an unaccountable neglect that gentleman returned to calcutta without presenting the letter to the mogul the translator forwarded it a second time to allahabad but before an answer could be received from so great a distance he was obliged after having waited for the last ship in the season to embark for europe  though our author mahummud casim ferishta has given the title of the history of hindostan to his work yet it is rather that of the mahommedan empire in india than a general account of the affairs of the hindoos what he says concerning india prior to the first invasion of the afgan mussulmen is very far from being satisfactory he collected his accounts from persian authors being altogether unacquainted with the shanscrita or learned language of the brahmins in which the internal history of india is comprehended we must not therefore with ferishta consider the hindoos as destitute of genuine domestic annals or that those voluminous records they possess are mere legends framed by the brahmins  the prejudices of the mahommedans against the followers of the brahmin religion seldom permits them to speak with common candor of the hindoos it swayed very much with ferishta when he affirmed that there is no history among the hindoos of better authority than the mahabarit that work is a poem and not a history it was translated into persian by the brother of the great abul fazil rather as a performance of fancy than as an authentic account of the ancient dynasties of the kings of india but that there are many hundred volumes in prose in the shanscrita language which treat of the ancient indians the translator can from his own knowledge aver and he has great reason to believe that the hindoos carry their authentic history farther back into antiquity than any other nation now existing  the mahommedans know nothing of the hindoo learning and had they even any knowledge of the history of the followers of brimha their prejudices in favor of the jewish fictions contained in the koran would make them reject accounts which tend to subvert the system of their own faith the shanscrita records contain accounts of the affairs of the western asia very different from what any tribe of the arabians have transmitted to posterity and it is more than probable that upon examination the former will appear to bear the marks of more authenticity and of greater antiquity than the latter  but whether the hindoos possess any true history of greater antiquity than other nations must altogether rest upon the authority of the brahmins till we shall become better acquainted with their records their pretensions however are very high and they confidently affirm that the jewish and mahommedan religions are heresies from what is contained in the bedas they give a very particular account of the origin of the jewish religion in records of undoubted antiquity raja tura say they who is placed in the first ages of the call jug had a son who apostatized from the hindoo faith for which he was banished by his father to the west the apostate fixed his residence in a country called mohgod and propagated the jewish religion which the impostor mahommed further corrupted the call jug commenced about      years ago and whether the whole story may not relate to terah and his son abraham is a point which we will leave to others to determine  there is one circumstance which goes far to prove that there is some connection between the brahmin bedas and the doctrines contained in the old testament ever since the promulgation of the religion of mahommed which is founded upon moses and the prophets the brahmins have totally rejected their fourth beda called the obatar bah as the schism of mahommed according to them has been founded upon that book however extraordinary this reason is for rejecting the fourth part of their religious records it can scarcely be doubted as it is in the mouth of every brahmin  feizi the brother of abul fazil the historian was the only mussulman we ever heard of who understood the shanscrita the fraudulent means by which he acquired it will be shown in another place he never translated any of the indian histories excepting the mahabarit which at best is but an historical poem in which a great deal of fable is blended with a little truth we upon the whole cannot much depend upon the accounts which the followers of mahommed give of the religion and ancient history of the hindoos their prejudice makes them misrepresent the former and their ignorance in the shanscrita language has totally excluded them from any knowledge of the latter  the history of casim ferishta being an abridgment of a variety of authors who wrote distinct accounts of the different reigns of the mahommedan emperors of hindostan he with a view to comprehend in a small compass every material transaction has crowded the events too much together without interspersing them with those reflections which give spirit and elegance to works of this kind this defect seems however to have proceeded more from a studied brevity than from a narrowness of genius in ferishta upon some occasions especially in the characters of the princes he shows a strength of judgment and a nervousness and conciseness of expression which would do no dishonor to the best writers in the west what is really remarkable in this writer is that he seems as much divested of religious prejudices as he is of political flattery or fear he never passes a good action without conferring upon it its due reward of praise nor a bad one let the villainous actor be never so high without stigmatizing it with infamy in short if he does not arrive at the character of a good writer he certainly deserves that of a good man  the brevity which we censure in ferishta is by no means a common fault in the writers of asia redundant and verbose in their diction they often regard more the cadence and turn of their sentences than the propriety and elegance of their thoughts leading frequently the reader into a labyrinth to which he can find no end this is too much the manner of the learned abul fazil himself he wrote the history of the reign of akbar in two large volumes in folio the intrigues of the court and all the secret motives to action are investigated with the utmost exactness but the diction is too diffuse and the language too florid for the correct taste of europe  it ought here to be remarked that all the oriental historians write in what they call in europe poetical prose this false taste only commenced about five centuries ago when literature declined in asia with the power of the caliphs the translator has now in his possession books written in the persian before that period the diction of which is as concise and manly as that which descended from greece and rome to the writers of modern europe the learned and celebrated abul fazil instead of correcting this vicious taste encouraged it greatly by his florid manner in his history of the reign of akbar but this great writer has notwithstanding his circumlocutions clothed his expressions with such beauty and pomp of eloquence that he seems to come down upon the astonished reader like the ganges in the rainy season  the small progress which correctness and elegance of sentiment and diction has made in the east did not proceed from a want of encouragement to literature we shall find in the course of this history that no princes in the world patronised men of letters with more generosity and respect than the mahommedan emperors of hindostan a literary genius was not only the certain means to acquire a degree of wealth which must astonish europeans but an infallible road for rising to the first offices of the state the character of the learned was at the same time so sacred that tyrants who made a pastime of embruing their hands in the blood of their other subjects not only abstained from offering violence to men of genius but stood in fear of their pens it is a proverb in the east that the monarchs of asia were more afraid of the pen of abul fazil than they were of the sword of akbar and however amazing it may seem in absolute governments it is certain that the historians of that division of the world have wrote with more freedom concerning persons and things than writers have ever dared to do in the west  the translator however being sensible of the impropriety of poetical diction in the grave narration of historical facts has in many places clipped the wings of ferishtas turgid expressions and reduced his metaphors into common language without however swerving in the least from the original meaning of the author  a frequent repetition of proper names is unavoidable in a work of such brevity and so much crowded with action this will perhaps appear the most glaring defect in the work but to use the pronouns too often would have rendered the sense more perplexed and the narration less elegant and distinct the translator in short chose to give the faults of his author to the public as they stood rather than by an attempt to amend them to substitute perhaps some of his own in their place  our author with great propriety begins the history of the patan empire in hindostan from the commencement of the kingdom of ghizni the mahommedan government which afterward extended itself to hindostan rose originally from very small beginnings among the mountains which divide persia from india the afgans or patans a warlike race of men who had been subjects of the vast empire of bochara revolted under their governor abistagi in the fourth century of the higera and laid the foundation of the empire of ghizni known commonly in europe by the name of gazna under a succession of warlike princes this empire rose to a surprising magnitude we find that in the reign of musaood in the beginning of the fifth century of the higera it extended from ispahan to bengal and from the mouths of the indus to the banks of the jaxartes which comprehends near half of the great continent of asia  soon after the death of musaood the charizmian empire arose on the confines of persia and great tartary it extended itself over tartary and the greatest part of the persian provinces the kings of the ghiznian patans were obliged to relinquish their dominions in the north and to transfer the seat of their empire to lahore and afterward to delhi  when the great conqueror of asia zingis chan invaded and subverted the charizmian empire under mahummud shaw the patan dominions were entirely confined within the limits of hindostan they possessed however power sufficient to repel the generals of that great man though flushed with victory and the spoils of the east the whole force of zingis it is true was never bent against hindostan otherwise it is probable it would have shared the fate of the western asia which was almost depopulated by his sword  the uncommon strength of the patan empire in hindostan at this period may be easily accounted for it was the policy of the adopted turkish slaves of the family of ghor who then held the kingdom of delhi to keep standing armies of the mountain afgans under their respective chiefs who were invariably created omrahs of the empire this hardy race whatever domestic confusions and revolutions they might occasion in india were to use ferishtas words a wall of iron against foreign enemies  our author has not been careful to mark the extent of the empire in every reign we can only form a general idea of it from the transactions which he records the empire we find sometimes reduced to a few districts round the capital and at other times extending itself from the bay of bengal to persia and from the carnatic to the great mountains of sewalic in short the boundaries of the patan imperial dominions varied in proportion to the abilities of those princes who possessed the throne when the monarchs discovered great parts the governors of provinces shrunk back from their independance into their former submission but when a weak prince sat on the musnud his lieutenants started up into kings around him  the history now given to the public presents us with a striking picture of the deplorable condition of a people subjected to arbitrary sway and of the instability of empire itself when it is founded neither upon laws nor upon the opinions and attachments of mankind hindostan in every age was an ample field for private ambition and for public tyranny at one time we see a petty omrah starting forth and wading through an ocean of blood to the crown or involving many thousands of indigent adventurers in the ruin which he draws upon his own head at another time we meet with kings from a lust of power which defeats itself destroying those subjects over whom they only wished to tyrannize  in a government like that of india public spirit is never seen and loyalty is a thing unknown the people permit themselves to be transferred from one tyrant to another without murmuring and individuals look with unconcern upon the miseries of others if they are capable to screen themselves from the general misfortune this however is a picture of hindostan in bad times and under the worst kings as arbitrary government can inflict the most sudden miseries so when in the hands of good men it can administer the most expeditious relief to the subject we accordingly find in this history that the misfortunes of half an age of tyranny are removed in a few years under the mild administration of a virtuous prince  it may not be improper in this place to lay before the public a short sketch of the constitution of hindostan the emperor is absolute and sole arbiter in every thing and is controlled by no law the lives and properties of the greatest omrahs are as much at his disposal as those of the meanest subjects the former however are often too powerful to be punished while the latter are not only slaves to the king but to the provincial governors these governors distinguished by the name of nabobs have in their respective jurisdictions the power of life and death and are in every particular invested with regal authority  all the lands in india are considered as the property of the king except some hereditary districts possessed by hindoo princes for which when the empire was in its vigor they paid annual tributes but retained an absolute jurisdiction in their own hands the king is the general heir of all his subjects but when there are children to inherit they are seldom deprived of their fathers estate without the fortune is enormous and has been amassed in the oppressive government of a province in a case of this kind the children or nearest relations are allowed a certain proportion for their subsistence at the discretion of the casy or judge the fortunes of merchants tradesmen and mechanics are never confiscated by the crown if any children or relations remain  the king has the extraordinary power of nominating his successor by will this part of royal prerogative is not peculiar to the monarchs of hindostan we find that our own nation so remarkable for their political freedom were not above two centuries ago made over like a private estate and that with their own consent by the will of a prince who neither deserved to be beloved nor admired according to the opinion of the indians the right of succession is vested in the male heir but the last will of the king very often supersedes this idea of justice notwithstanding this prejudice in favor of the first born there is no distinction made between natural children and those born in lawful wedlock for every child brought forth in the haram whether by wives or concubines are equally legitimate  the vizier is generally first minister of state all edicts and public deeds must pass under his seal after the royal signet is affixed to them the viziers office consists of various departments in every one of which all commissions patents for honorary titles and grants for jagiers are carefully registered he superintends the royal exchequer and in that capacity keeps accounts with the dewans of the several provinces in every thing which regards the finances  a vakiel mutuluck is sometimes appointed by the king the power of this officer is superior to that of the vizier for he not only has the superintendency of civil but also of all military affairs this last is never any part of the viziers office the amir ul omrah or buxshi being independent captain general and paymaster of the forces it is not easy to explain to europeans the full extent of authority conferred upon the vakiel mutuluck he seems to be an officer to whom the king for a time delegates his whole power reserving only for himself the imperial title and ensigns of royalty  the emperor of hindostan gives public audience twice a day from the throne all petitioners without distinction are after having gone through the usual ceremonies admitted they are permitted to present their written complaints to the ariz beg or lord of the requests who attends in order to present them to the king the king reads them all himself and superscribes his pleasure in a few words with his own hand should any thing in the petition appear doubtful it is immediately referred to the sidder ul suddur whose office answers to that of our chief justice to be examined and determined according to law  the mahommedans of hindostan have no written laws but those contained in the koran there are certain usages founded upon reason and immemorial custom which are also committed to writing by the latter some causes are determined and there are officers appointed by the crown under the name of canongoes who for a certain fee explain the written usages to the people in every district or pergunnah there is a cutchery or court of justice established these courts are extremely venal and even the legal fees for determining a cause concerning property is one fourth of the value of the matter in dispute their decisions were however very expeditious and through fear of the displeasure of the king who invariably punished with the utmost severity corrupt judges the casys were pretty equitable in their determinations  in the declining state of the empire the provinces were submitted to the management of nabobs or military governors who farmed the revenues at a certain sum and reserved the overplus for their own use originally the nabobs were only commanders of the forces who receiving their orders from court through the medium of the dewan a civil officer who collected all the revenues for the king paid the just expenses of the government of the province and remitted the surplus to the exchequer but the nabobs having the military power in their hands despised the authority of the dewans and purposely fomented divisions factions and insurrections that they might be indulged with great standing armies to make more money pass through their own hands and to favor their schemes of independence  the imbecility of the empire daily increasing the nominal authority vested in the dewan was not sufficient to contend with the real force in the hands of the nabob continual altercations subsisted between these officers in the province and frequent complaints were transmitted to court ministers who preferred present ease to the future interest of the empire curtailed the power of the dewan and from being in a manner the commander in chief of the province he fell into the simple superintendency of the collections he had it is true the power to prevent new imposts and innovations in the law  when the king took the field the provincial nabobs with their troops were obliged to repair to the imperial standard each nabob erected his own standard and formed a separate camp subject only to his own orders the nabobs every morning attended at the royal pavilion and received their orders from the amir ul omrah the captain general  who received his immediately from the king himself if we except the army of the great sultan baber there are few traces of real discipline to be met with among those myriads with whom the emperors of hindostan often took the field the forces of baber were formed on a very regular and masterly plan the dispositions of his battles were excellent and the surprising victories he obtained with a handful of men over immense armies are sufficient to convince us that military discipline has not always been unknown in asia  it may to an european furnish matter of some surprise how eastern armies of two or three hundred thousand horse and triple that number of soldiers and followers could be supplied with provisions and forage upon their march and in their standing camps to account for this it is to be observed that every provincial nabob upon his taking the field appoints an officer called the cutwal whose business it is to superintend the bazars or markets which may belong to his camp every commander of a body of troops obtains at the same time permission to hoist a slag for a bazar and to appoint a cutwal of his own under the direction of the cutwalgeneral these cutwals grant licenses to chapmen sutlers and corn dealers who gladly pay a certain tax for permission to dispose of their various commodities under the protection of the different flags  the sutlers and dealers in corn being provided with a sufficient number of camels and oxen collect provisions from all the countries in their rear and supply the wants of the camp the pay of soldiers in hindostan is very great being from  0 to  00 rupees per month to every single trooper this enables them to give such high prices for provisions that the countries round run all hazards for such a great prospect of gain the fertility of hindostan itself is the great source of this ready and plentiful supply to the armies for that country produces in most parts two and sometimes three crops of corn every year the indians sometimes feed their horses with a kind of vetch called gram which they boil in want of that they make a shift with the roots of grass which they dig up and wash in water this they reckon better than hay they are by this means never in want for forage in a country so remarkable for vegetation the horses always belong to the riders which renders them more assiduous to keep them in proper order as their pay depends entirely on the goodness of their horses but this is attended with a bad consequence a soldier of fortune who has nothing but his horse to depend upon is often afraid to expose him where he would perhaps risque his own life   it may perhaps be expected that something concerning the language of the translation should be said in this place employed from his youth in a profession very different from that of letters the translator aspires not to the character of a fine writer to express his authors meaning in a plain and unaffected diction was all his design and he expects the public will the more readily overlook any errors he may have committed that he neither hopes for much literary reputation nor wishes for any advantage from his work  a dissertation concerning the customs manners language religion and philosophy of the hindoos the learned of modern europe have with reason complained that the writers of greece and rome did not extend their enquiries to the religion and philosophy of the druids posterity will perhaps in the same manner find fault with the british for not investigating the learning and religious opinions which prevail in those countries in asia into which either their commerce or their arms have penetrated the brahmins of the east possessed in ancient times some reputation for knowledge but we have never had the curiosity to examine whether there was any truth in the reports of antiquity upon that head  excuses however may be formed for our ignorance concerning the learning religion and philosophy of the brahmins literary inquiries are by no means a capital object to many of our adventurers in asia the few who have a turn for researches of that kind are discouraged by the very great difficulty in acquiring that language in which the learning of the hindoos is contained or by that impenetrable veil of mystery with which the brahmins industriously cover their religious tenets and philosophy  these circumstances combining together have opened an ample field for fiction modern travelers have accordingly indulged their talent for fable upon the mysterious religion of hindostan whether the ridiculous tales they relate proceed from that common partiality which europeans as well as less enlightened nations entertain for the religion and philosophy of their own country or from a judgment formed upon some external ceremonies of the hindoos is very difficult to determine but they have prejudiced europe against the brahmins and by a very unfair account have thrown disgrace upon a system of religion and philosophy which they did by no means investigate  the author of this dissertation must own that he for a long time suffered himself to be carried down in this stream of popular prejudice the present decline of literature in hindostan served to confirm him in his belief of those legends which he read in europe concerning the brahmins but conversing by accident one day with a noble and learned brahmin he was not a little surprised to find him perfectly acquainted with those opinions which both in ancient and modern europe have employed the pens of the most celebrated moralists this circumstance did not fail to excite his curiosity and in the course of many subsequent conversations he found that philosophy and the sciences had in former ages made a very considerable progress in the east  having then no intention to quit india for some time he resolved to acquire some knowledge in the shanscrita language the grand repository of the religion philosophy and history of the hindoos with this view he prevailed upon his noble friend the brahmin to procure for him a pundit from the university of benaris well versed in the shanscrita and master of all the knowledge of that learned body but before he had made any considerable progress in his studies an unexpected change of affairs in bengal broke off all his literary schemes he found that the time he had to remain in india would be too short to acquire the shanscrita he determined therefore through the medium of the persian language and through the vulgar tongue of the hindoos to inform himself as much as possible concerning the mythology and philosophy of the brahmins he for this purpose procured some of the principal shasters and his pundit explained to him as many passages of those curious books as served to give him a general idea of the doctrine which they contain  it is but justice to the brahmins to confess that the author of this dissertation is very sensible of his own inability to illustrate with that fullness and perspicuity which it deserves that symbolical religion which they are at so much pains to conceal from foreigners he however can aver that he has not misrepresented one single circumstance or tenet though many may have escaped his observation  the books which contain the religion and philosophy of the hindoos are distinguished by the name of bedas they are four in number and like the sacred writings of other nations are said to have been penned by the divinity beda in the shanscrita literally signifies science for these books not only treat of religious and moral duties but of every branch of philosophical knowledge  the bedas are by the brahmins held so sacred that they permit no other sect to read them and such is the influence of superstition and priestcraft over the minds of the other casts in india that they would deem it an unpardonable sin to satisfy their curiosity in that respect were it even within the compass of their power the brahmins themselves are bound by such strong ties of religion to confine those writings to their own tribe that were any of them known to read them to others he would be immediately excommunicated this punishment is worse than even death itself among the hindoos the offender is not only thrown down from the noblest order to the most polluted cast but his posterity are rendered for ever incapable of being received into his former dignity  all these things considered we are not to wonder that the doctrine of the bedas is so little known in europe even the literary part of the mahomedans of asia reckon it an abstruse and mysterious subject and heartily confess that it is covered with a veil of darkness which they could never penetrate some have indeed supposed that the learned feizi brother to the celebrated abul fazil chief secretary to the emperor akbar had read the bedas and discovered the religious tenets contained in them to that renowned prince as the story of feizi made a good deal of noise in the east it may not be improper to give the particulars of it in this place  mahummud akbar being a prince of elevated and extensive ideas was totally divested of those prejudices for his own religion which men of inferior parts not only imbibe with their mothers milk but retain throughout their lives though bred in all the strictness of the mahommedan faith his great soul in his riper years broke those chains of superstition and credulity with which his tutors had in his early youth fettered his mind with a design to choose his own religion or rather from curiosity he made it his business to enquire minutely into all the systems of divinity which prevailed among mankind the story of his being instructed in the christian tenets by a missionary from portugal is too well known in europe to require a place in this dissertation as almost all religions admit of proselytes akbar had good success in his enquiries till he came to his own subjects the hindoos contrary to the practice of all other religious sects they admit of no converts but they allow that every one may go to heaven his own way though they perhaps suppose that theirs is the most expeditious method to obtain that important end they choose rather to make a mystery of their religion than impose it upon the world like the mahommedans with the sword or by means of the stake after the manner of some pious christians  not all the authority of akbar could prevail with the brahmins to reveal the principles of their faith he was therefore obliged to have recourse to artifice to obtain the information which he so much desired the emperor for this purpose concerted a plan with his chief secretary abul fazil to impose feizi then a boy upon the brahmins in the character of a poor orphan of their tribe feizi being instructed in his part was privately sent to benaris the principal seat of learning among the hindoos in that city the fraud was practiced on a learned brahmin who received the boy into his house and educated him as his own son  when feizi after ten years study had acquired the shanscrita language and all the knowledge of which the learned of benaris were possessed proper measures were taken by the emperor to secure his safe return feizi it seems during his residence with his patron the brahmin was smitten with the beauty of his only daughter and indeed the ladies of the brahmin race are the handsomest in hindostan the old brahmin saw the mutual passion of the young pair with pleasure and as he loved feizi for his uncommon abilities he offered him his daughter in marriage feizi perplexed between love and gratitude at length discovered himself to the good old man fell down at his feet and grasping his knees solicited with tears for forgiveness for the great crime he had committed against his indulgent benefactor the brahmin struck dumb with astonishment uttered not one word of reproach he drew a dagger which he always carried on his girdle and prepared to plunge it in his own breast feizi seized his hand and conjured him that if yet any atonement could be made for the injury he had done him he himself would swear to deny him nothing the brahmin bursting into tears told him that if feizi should grant him two requests he would forgive him and consent to live feizi without any hesitation consented and the brahmins requests were that he should never translate the bedas nor repeat the creed of the hindoos  how far feizi was bound by his oath not to reveal the doctrine of the bedas to akbar is uncertain but that neither he nor any other person ever translated those books is a truth beyond any dispute it is however well known that the emperor afterward greatly favored the hindoo faith and gave much offense to zealous mahommedans by practicing some indian customs which they thought savoured of idolatry but the dispassionate part of mankind have always allowed that akbar was equally divested of all the follies of both the religious superstitions which prevailed among his subjects  to return from this digression the brahmins maintain that the bedas are the divine laws which brimha at the creation of the world delivered for the instruction of mankind but they affirm that their meaning was perverted in the first age by the ignorance and wickedness of some princes whom they represent as evil spirits who then haunted the earth they call those evil genii dewtas and tell many strange allegorical legends concerning them such as that the bedas being lost were afterward recovered by bishen in the form of a fish who brought them up from the bottom of the ocean into which they were thrown by a deo or demon  the first credible account we have of the bedas is that about the commencement of the call jug of which era the present year      is the     th year they were written or rather collected by a great philosopher and reputed prophet called beass muni or beass the inspired this learned man is otherwise called krishen basdeo and is said to have lived in the reign of judishter in the city of histanapore upon the river jumna near the present city of delhi  the brahmins do not give to beass muni the merit of being the author of the bedas they however acknowledge that he reduced them into the present form dividing them into four distinct books after having collected the detached pieces of which they are composed from every part of india it is upon the whole probable that they are not the work of one man on account of their immense bulk  the mahomedans of asia as well as some of the learned of europe have mistaken brimha an allegorical person for some philosopher of repute in india whom they distinguish by the disfigured names of bruma burma and bramha whom they suppose to have been the writer of the religious books of the hindoos ferishta in the history now given to the public affirms that brimha was of the race of bang and flourished in the reign of krishen first monarch of hindostan but the brahmins deny that any such person ever existed which we have reason to believe is the truth as brimha in the shanscrita language allegorically signifies wisdom one of the principal attributes of the supreme divinity  the four bedas contain  00000 ashlogues or stanzas in verse each of which consists of four lines the first beda is called rug beda which signifies the science of divination concerning which it principally treats it also contains astrology astronomy natural philosophy and a very particular account of the creation of matter and the formation of the world  the second beda is distinguished by the name of sheham that word signifies piety or devotion and this book accordingly treats of all religious and moral duties it also contains many hymns in praise of the supreme being as well as verses in honor of subaltern intelligences  the third is the judger beda which as the word implies comprehends the whole science of religious rites and ceremonies such as fasts festivals purifications penances pilgrimages sacrifices prayers and offerings they give the appellation of obatar bah to the fourth beda obatar signifies in the shanscrita the being or the essence and bah good so that the obatar bah is literally the knowledge of the good being and accordingly this book comprehends the whole science of theology and metaphysical philosophy  the language of the obatar bah beda is now become obsolete so that very few brahmins pretend to read it with propriety whether this proceeds from its great antiquity or from its being wrote in an uncommon dialect of the shanscrita is hard to determine we are inclined to believe that the first is the truth for we can by no means agree with a late ingenious writer mr holwell the author of the dissertation finds himself obliged to differ almost in every particular concerning the religion of the hindoos from that gentleman  who affirms that the obatar bah was written in a period posterior to the rest of the bedas  it has been already observed that the bedas are written in the shanscrita tongue whether the shanscrita was in any period of antiquity the vulgar language of hindostan or was invented by the brahmins to be a mysterious repository for their religion and philosophy is difficult to determine all other languages it is true were casually invented by mankind to express their ideas and wants but the astonishing formation of the shanscrita seems to be beyond the power of chance in regularity of etymology and grammatical order it far exceeds the arabic it in short bears evident marks that it has been fixed upon rational principles by a body of learned men who studied regularity harmony and a wonderful simplicity and energy of expression  though the shanscrita is amazingly copious a very small grammar and vocabulary serve to illustrate the principles of the whole in a treatise of a few pages the roots and primitives are all comprehended and so uniform is the rules for derivations and inflections that the etymon of every word is with the greatest facility at once investigated the pronunciation is the greatest difficulty which attends the acquirement of the language to perfection this is so quick and forcible that a person even before the years of puberty must labor a long time before he can pronounce it with propriety but when once that is attained to perfection it strikes the ear with amazing boldness and harmony the alphabet of the shanscrita consists of fifty letters but one half of these carry combined sounds so that its characters in fact do not exceed ours in number some small idea of the shanscrita may be conveyed by the annexed plate which contains the alphabet and the measure of the four bedas  before we shall proceed to the religion and philosophy of the brahmins it may not be improper to premise something a specimen of the measure of the bedas feet rugh beda     joidippi nabatti hani     parakian chirritti basa bodat chan     assa mon jesso

shanscrita language signifies the moon for from that luminary and the sun they deduce their fabulous origin the author of the dissertation has in his possession a long list of a dynasty of kings called hindoobuns or chunderbuns both of which words mean the children of the moon he also has a catalogue of the suragebuns or the children of the sun from whom many of the rajas of hindostan pretend to derive their blood hindostan the domestic appellation of india is a composition of hindoo and stan a region and the great river indus takes its name from the people and not the people from the river as has been erroneously supposed in europe  the hindoos have from all antiquity been divided into four great tribes each of which comprehend a variety of inferior casts these tribes do not intermarry eat drink or in any manner associate with one another except when they worship at the temple of jagganat jagga not signifies lord of the creation this is one of the names of bishen and the obatar or being who is said to preside over the present period he is represented under the figure of a fat man sitting crosslegged with his arms hanging down by his side as if they had no strength this last circumstance alludes to the imbecility of this age his temple is in the greatest repute of any now in india in orissa where it is held a crime to make any distinction the first and most noble tribe are the brahmins who alone can officiate in the priesthood like the levites among the jews they are not however excluded from government trade or agriculture though they are strictly prohibited from all menial offices by their laws they derive their name from brimha who they allegorically say produced the brahmins from his head when he created the world  the second in order is the sittri tribe who are sometimes distinguished by the name of kittri or koytri they according to their original institution ought to be all military men but they frequently follow other professions brimha is said to have produced the kittri from his heart as an emblem of that courage which warriors should possess  the name of beise or bise is given to the third tribe they are for the most part merchants bankers and bunias or shopkeepers these are figuratively said to have sprung from the belly of brimha the word beish signifying a provider or nourisher the fourth tribe is that of sudder they ought to be menial servants and they are incapable to raise themselves to any superior rank they are said to have proceeded from the feet of brimha in allusion to their low degree but indeed it is contrary to the inviolable laws of the hindoos that any person should rise from an inferior cast into a higher tribe if any therefore should be excommunicated from any of the four tribes he and his posterity are forever shut out from society of every body in the nation excepting that of the harri cast who are held in utter detestation by all the other tribes and are employed only in the meanest and vilest offices this circumstance renders excommunication so dreadful that any hindoo will suffer the torture and even death itself rather than deviate from one article of his faith this severity prevented all intermixture of blood between the tribes so that in their appearance they seem rather four different nations than members of the same community  it is as we have already observed a principle peculiar to the hindoo religion not to admit of proselytes instead of being solicitous about gaining converts they always make a mystery of their faith heaven say they is like a palace with many doors and every one may enter in his own way but this charitable disposition never encouraged other sects to settle among them as they must have been excluded entirely from all the benefits of society  when a child is born some of the brahmins are called they pretend from the horoscope of his nativity to foretell his future fortune by means of some astrological tables of which they are possessed when this ceremony is over they burn incense and make an offering according to the circumstances of the parent and without ever consulting them tie the zinar a string which all the hindoos wear by way of charm or amulet round the infants neck and impose a name upon him according to their own fancy  between the age of seven and ten the children are by their parents given away in marriage the young pair are brought together in order to contract an intimacy with one another but when they approach to the years of puberty they carefully separate them till the female produces signs of womanhood she then is taken from her parents to cohabit with her husband nor is she ever after permitted to visit them it is not lawful among the hindoos to marry nearer than the eighth degree of kindred polygamy is permitted but seldom practiced for they very rationally think that one wife is sufficient for one man  the extraordinary custom of the women burning themselves with their deceased husbands has for the most part fallen into desuetude in india nor was it ever reckoned a religious duty as has been very erroneously supposed in the west this species of barbarity like many others rose originally from the foolish enthusiasm of feeble minds in a text in the bedas conjugal affection and fidelity are thus figuratively inculcated the woman in short who dies with her husband shall enjoy life eternal with him in heaven from this source the brahmins themselves deduce this ridiculous custom which is a more rational solution of it than the story which prevails in europe that it was a political institution made by one of the emperors to prevent wives from poisoning their husbands a practice in those days common in hindostan  people of rank and those of the higher casts burn their dead and throw some incense into the pile some throw the bodies of their friends into the ganges while others expose them on the high ways as a prey to vultures and wild beasts there is one cast in the kingdom of bengal who barbarously expose their sick by the rivers side to die there they even sometimes choke them with mud when they think them past hopes of recovery they defend this inhuman custom by saying that life is not an adequate recompense for the tortures of a lingering disease  the hindoos have a code of laws in the nea shaster treason incest sacrilege murder adultery with the wife of a brahmin and theft are capital crimes though the brahmins were the authors of those laws we do not find that they have exempted themselves from the punishment of death when guilty of those crimes this is one of those numerous fables which modern travelers imported from the east it is however certain that the influence of the brahmins is so great and their characters as priests so sacred that they escape in cases where no mercy would be shown to the other tribes  petty offenses are punished by temporary excommunications pilgrimages penances and fines according to the degree of the crime and the wealth of the guilty person but as the hindoos are now for the most part subject to the mahommedans they are governed by the laws of the koran or by the arbitrary will of the prince  the senasseys are a sect of mendicant philosophers commonly known by the name of fakiers which literally signifies poor people these idle and pretended devotees assemble sometimes in armies of ten or twelve thousand and under a pretext of making pilgrimages to certain temples lay whole countries under contribution these saints wear no clothes are generally very robust and convert the wives of the less holy part of mankind to their own use upon their religious progresses they admit any man of parts into their number and they take great care to instruct their disciples in every branch of knowledge to make the order the more revered among the vulgar  when this naked army of robust saints direct their march to any temple the men of the provinces through which their road lies very often fly before them notwithstanding of the sanctified character of the fakiers but the women are in general more resolute and not only remain in their dwellings but apply frequently for the prayers of those holy persons which are found to be most effectual in cases of sterility when a takier is at prayers with the lady of the house he leaves either his slipper or his staff at the door which if seen by the husband effectually prevents him from disturbing their devotion but should he be so unfortunate as not to mind those signals a sound drubbing is the inevitable consequence of his intrusion  though the fakiers enforce with their arms that reverence which the people of hindostan have naturally for their order they inflict voluntary penances of very extraordinary kinds upon themselves to gain more respect these fellows sometimes hold up one arm in a fixed position till it becomes stiff and remains in that situation during the rest of their lives some clench their fists very hard and keep them so till their nails grow into their palms and appear through the back of their hands others turn their faces over one shoulder and keep them in that situation till they fix for ever their heads looking backward many turn their eyes to the point of their nose till they have lost the power of looking in any other direction these last pretend sometimes to see what they call the sacred fire which vision no doubt proceeds from some disorder arising from the distortion of the optic nerves  it often appears to europeans in india a matter of some ridicule to converse with those distorted and naked philosophers though their knowledge and external appearance exhibit a very striking contrast some are really what they seem enthusiasts but others put on the character of sanctity as a cloak for their pleasures but what actually makes them a public nuisance and the aversion of poor husbands is that the women think they derive some holiness to themselves from an intimacy with a fakier  many other foolish customs besides those we have mentioned are peculiar to those religious mendicants but enthusiastic penances are not confined to them alone some of the vulgar on the fast of opposs suspend themselves on iron hooks by the flesh of the shoulder blade to the end of a beam this beam turns round with great velocity upon a pivot on the head of a high pole the enthusiast not only seems insensible of pain but very often blows a trumpet as he is whirled round above and at certain intervals sings a song to the gaping multitude below who very much admire his fortitude and devotion this ridiculous custom is kept up to commemorate the sufferings of a martyr who was in that manner tortured for his faith  to dwell longer upon the characteristical customs and manners of the hindoos would extend this dissertation too far some more particulars concerning that nation will naturally arise from an investigation of their religion and philosophy this last was the capital design of this introductory discourse and we hope to be able to throw a new if not a complete light on a subject hitherto little understood in the west some writers have very lately given to the world an unintelligible system of the brahmin religion and they affirm that they derived their information from the hindoos themselves this may be the case but they certainly conversed upon that subject only with the inferior tribes or with the unlearned part of the brahmins and it would be as ridiculous to hope for a true state of the religion and philosophy of the hindoos from those illiterate casts as it would be in a mahommedan in london to rely upon the accounts of a parish beadle concerning the most abstruse points of the christian faith or to form his opinion of the principles of the newtonian philosophy from a conversation with an english carman  the hindoos are divided into two great religious sects the followers of the doctrine of the bedang and those who adhere to the principles of the neadirsin as the first are esteemed the most orthodox as well as the most ancient we shall begin to explain their opinions by extracts literally translated from the original shaster shaster literally signifies knowledge but it is commonly understood to mean a book which treats of divinity and the sciences there are many shasters among the hindoos so that those writers who affirmed that there was but one shaster in india which like the bible of the christians or koran of the followers of mahommed contained the first principles of the brahmin says have deceived themselves and the public  which goes by the name of bedang  bedang the title of the shaster or commentary upon the bedas concerning which we are about to treat is a word compounded of beda science and ang body the name of this shaster therefore may be literally translated the body of science this book has in europe been erroneously called vedam and it is an exposition of the doctrine of the bedas by that great philosopher and prophet beass muni who according to the brahmins flourished about four thousand years ago the bedang is said to have been revised some ages after beass muni by one sirrider swami since which it has been reckoned sacred and not subject to any further alterations almost all the hindoos of the decan and those of the malabar and coromandel coasts are of the sect of the bedang  this commentary opens with a dialogue between brimha brimha is the genitive case of brimh which is a primitive signifying god he is called brimha or wisdom the first attribute of the supreme divinity the divine wisdom under the name of brimha is figuratively represented with one head having four faces looking to the four quarters alluding to his seeing all things upon the head of this figure is a crown an emblem of power and dominion he has four hands implying the omnipotence of divine wisdom in the first hand he holds the four bedas as a symbol of knowledge in the second a scepter as a token of authority and in the third a ring or complete circle as an emblem of eternity brimha holds nothing in the fourth hand which implies that the wisdom of god is always ready to lend his aid to his creatures he is represented riding upon a goose the emblem of simplicity among the hindoos the latter circumstance is intended to imply the simplicity of the operations of nature which is but another name for the wisdom of the divinity these explications of the insignia of brimha were given by the brahmin and are by no means conjectures of the author of this dissertation  the wisdom of the divinity and narud narud literally signifies reason emphatically called the son of the wisdom of god he is said to be the firstborn of the munis of whom hereafter or reason who is represented as the son of brimha narud desires to be instructed by his father and for that purpose puts the following questions to him  narud o father thou first of god brimh  thou art said to have created the world and thy son narud astonished at what he beholds is desirous to be instructed how all these things were made   brimha be not deceived my son do not imagine that i was the creator of the world independent of the divine mover the supreme divinity  who is the great original essence pirrim purrus from pir first and purrus essence or being  and creator of all things look therefore only upon me as the instrument of the great will ishbur from ish will and bur great commonly pronounced ishur this is one of the thousand names of god which have so much perplexed the writers of europe in the answer of brimha mention is made of the first three great deities of the hindoos which three however they by no means worship as distinct beings from god but only as his principal attributes  and a part of his being whom he called forth to execute his eternal designs   narud what shall we think of god   brimha being immaterial nidakar  he is above all conception being invisible oderissa  he can have no form sirbasirrup  but from what we behold in his works we may conclude that he is eternal nitteh  omnipotent geitcha  knowing all things subitteradirsi  and present every where surbabirsi these are the very terms used in the bedang in the definition of god which we have literally translated in the text whether we who profess christianity and call the hindoos by the detestable names of pagans and idolaters have higher ideas of the supreme divinity we shall leave to the unprejudiced roader to determine    narud how did god create the world   brimha affection maiah which signifies either affection or passion  dwelt with god from all eternity it was of three different kinds the creative redjogoon the creative quality  the preserving sittohgoon the preserving quality  and the destructive timmugoon the destructive quality  this first is represented by brimha the second by bishen the preserver providence is personified under the name of bishen  and the third by shibah shibah the foe of good  you o narud are taught to worship all the three in various shapes and likenesses as the creator naat  the preserver bishen  and the destroyer shibah the hindoos worship the destructive attribute of the divinity under the name of shibah but they do not mean evil by shibah for they affirm that there is no such thing but what proceeds from the free agency of man  the affection of god then produced power jotna  and power at a proper conjunction of time kaal and fate addaristo  embraced goodness pirkirti from pir good and kirti action gods attribute of goodness is worshipped as a goddess under the name of pirkirti and many other appellations which comprehend all the virtues it has been ridiculously supposed in europe that purrus and pirkirti were the first man and woman according to the system of the hindoos whereas by purrus is meant god or emphatically the being and by pirkirti his attribute of goodness  and produced matter mohat in other places of the bedang matter is distinguished by the name of mahatit the great substance  the three qualities then acting upon matter produced the universe in the following manner from the opposite actions of the creative and destructive quality in matter selfmotion ahankar the word literally signifies selfaction first arose selfmotion was of three kinds the first inclining to plasticity rajas  the second to discord tamas  and the third to rest satig  the discordant actions then produced the akash a kind of celestial element the bedang in another place speaks of akash as a pure impalpable element through which the planets move this element says the philosopher makes no resistance and therefore the planets continue their motion from the first impulse which they received from the hand of brimha or god nor will they stop says he till he shall seize them in the midst of their course  which invisible element possessed the quality of conveying sound it produced air baiow  a palpable element fire tege  a visible element water joal  a fluid element and earth prittavi  a solid element  the akash dispersed itself abroad air formed the atmosphere fire collecting itself blazed forth in the host of heaven dewta of which surage the sun is first in rank  water rose to the surface of the earth being forced from beneath by the gravity of the latter element thus broke forth the world from the veil of darkness in which it was formerly comprehended by god order rose over the universe the seven heavens were formed the names of the seven heavens are bu buba surg moha junnoh tapu and sutteh the seven worlds are ottal bittal suttal joal tallattal rissatal and pattal the author of the dissertation by a negligence which he very much regrets forgot to get the proper explanation of those names or the uses to which the seven heavens were converted  and the seven worlds were fixed in their places there to remain till the great dissolution mahpirly  when all things shall be absorbed mucht into god

the earth every herb bore the seed of its kind that the world might be clothed with verdure and all animals provided with food   narud what do thou mean o father by intellect   brimha it is a portion of the great soul purmattima literally signifies the great soul of the universe breathed into all creatures to animate them for a certain time   narud what becomes of it after death   brimha it animates other bodies or returns like a drop into that unbounded ocean from which it first arose   narud shall not then the souls of good men receive rewards nor the souls of the bad meet with punishment   brimha the souls of men are distinguished from those of other animals for the first are endued with reason upiman and with a consciousness of right and wrong if therefore man shall adhere to the first as far as his powers shall extend his soul when disengaged from the body by death shall be absorbed into the divine essence and shall never more reanimate flesh but the souls of those who do evil mund  are not at death disengaged from all the elements they are immediately clothed with a body of fire air and akash in which they are for a time punished in hell nirick the hindoos reckon above eighty kinds of hells each proportioned to the degree of the wickedness of the persons punished there the brahmins have no idea that all the sins that a man can commit in the short period of his life can deserve eternal punishment nor that all the virtues he can exercise can merit perpetual felicity in heaven  after the season of their grief is over they reanimate other bodies but till they shall arrive at a state of purity they can never be absorbed into god   narud what is the nature of that absorbed state muchti which the souls of good men enjoy after death   brimha it is a participation of the divine nature where all passions are utterly unknown and where consciousness is lost in bliss it is somewhat surprising that a state of unconsciousness which in fact is the same with annihilation should be esteemed by the hindoos as the supreme good yet so it is that they always represent the absorbed state as a situation of perfect insensibility equally destitute of pleasure and of pain but brimha seems here to imply that it is a kind of delirium of joy    narud thou say o father that unless the soul is perfectly pure it cannot be absorbed into god now as the actions of the generality of men are partly good and partly bad whither are their spirits sent immediately after death   brimha they must alone for their crimes in hell where they must remain for a space proportioned to the degree of their iniquities then they rise to heaven to be rewarded for a time for their virtues and from thence they will return to the world to reanimate other bodies   narud what is time kaal it may not be improper in this place to say something concerning the hindoo method of computing time their least subdivision of time is the nemish or twinkling of an eye three nemishs make one kaan fifty kaan one ligger ten liggers one dind two dinds one gurry equal to fortyfive of our minutes four gurries one par eight pars one dien or day fifteen diens one packa two packas one mash two mashes one ribbi three ribbis one aioon or year which only consists of   0 days but when the odd days hours and minutes wanting of a solar year amount to one revolution of the moon an additional month is made to that year to adjust the callendar a year of   0 days they reckon but one day to the dewtas or host of heaven and they say that twelve thousand of those planetary years make one revolution of the four jugs or periods into which they divide the ages of the world the sittoh jug or age of truth contained according to them four thousand planetary years the treta jug or age of three contained three thousand years the duapur jug or age of two contained two thousand and the kalle jug or age of pollution consists of only one thousand to these they add two other periods between the dissolution and renovation of the world which they call sundeh and sundass each of a thousand planetary years so that from one maperly or great dissolution of all things to another there are    0000 of our years    brimha time existed from all eternity with god but it can only be estimated since motion was produced and only be conceived by the mind from its own constant progress   narud how long shall this world remain   brimha until the four jugs shall have revolved then rudder the same with shibah the destroying quality of god with the ten spirits of dissolution shall roll a comet under the moon that shall involve all things in fire and reduce the world into ashes god shall then exist alone for matter will be totally annihilated nisht    here ends the first chapter of the bedang the second treats of providence and free will a subject so abstruse that it was impossible to understand it without a complete knowledge of the shanscrita the author of the bedang thinking perhaps that the philosophical catechism which we have translated above was too pure for narrow and superstitious minds has inserted into his work a strange allegorical account of the creation for the purposes of vulgar theology in this tale the attributes of god the human passions and faculties of the mind are personified and introduced upon the stage as this allegory may afford matter of some curiosity to the public we shall here translate it  brimh existed from all eternity in a form of infinite dimensions when it pleased him to create the world he said rise up o brimha the wisdom of god  immediately a spirit of the color of flame issued from his navel having four heads and four hands brimha gazing round and seeing nothing but the immense image out of which he had proceeded he traveled a thousand years to endeavor to comprehend its dimensions but after all his toil he found himself as much at a loss as before  lost in amazement brimha gave over his journey he fell prostrate and praised what he saw with his four mouths the almighty then with a voice like ten thousand thunders was pleased to say thou have done well o brimha for thou can not comprehend me  go and create the world  how can i create it  ask of me and power shall be given unto thee  o god said brimha thou art almighty in power   brimha forthwith perceived the idea of things as if floating before his eyes he said let them be and all that he saw became real before him then fear struck the frame of brimha lest those things should be annihilated o immortal brimh he cried who shall preserve those things which i behold in the instant a spirit of a blue color issued from brimhas mouth and said aloud i will then shall thy name be bishen the providence of god  because thou have undertaken to preserve all things  brimha then commanded bishen to go and create all animals with vegetables for their subsistence to possess that earth which he himself had made bishen forthwith created all manner of beasts fish foul insects and reptiles trees and grass rose also beneath his hands for brimha had invested him with power but man was still wanting to rule the whole and brimha commanded bishen to form him bishen began the work but the men he made were idiots with great bellies for he could not inspire them with knowledge so that in every thing but in shape they resembled the beasts of the field they had no passion but to satisfy their carnal appetites  brimha offended at the men destroyed them and produced four persons from his own breath whom he called by four different names the name of the first was sinnoc body  of the second sinnunda life  of the third sonnatin permanency  and of the fourth sonninkunar intellectual existence  these four persons were ordered by brimha to rule over the creatures and to possess for ever the world but they refused to do any thing but to praise god having nothing of the destructive quality timmugoon in their composition  brimha for this contempt of his orders became angry and lo a brown spirit started from between his eyes he sat down before brimha and began to weep then lifting up his eyes he asked him who am i and where shall be the place of my abode thy name shall be rudder the weeper because he was produced in tears one of the names of shibah the destructive attribute of the divinity  said brimha and all nature shall be the place of thine abode but rise up o rudder and form man to govern the world  rudder immediately obeyed the orders of brimha he began the work but the men he made were fiercer than tigers having nothing but the destructive quality in their compositions they however soon destroyed one another for anger was their only passion brimha bishen and rudder then joined their different powers they created ten men whose names were narud dico bashista birga kirku pulla pulista ongira otteri and murichi the significations of these ten names are in order these reason ingenuity emulation humility piety pride patience charity deceit mortality  the general appellation of the whole was the munies the inspired  brimha then produced dirmo fortune from his breast adirmo misfortune from his back loab appetite from his lip and kam love from his heart this last being a beautiful female brimha looked upon her with amorous eyes but the munies told him that she was his own daughter upon which he shrunk back and produced a blushing virgin called ludja shame  brimha thinking his body defiled by throwing his eyes upon kam changed it and produced ten women one of which was given to each of the munies  in this division of the bedang shaster there is a long list of the surage buns or children of the sun who it is said ruled the world in the first periods but as the whole is a mere dream of imagination and scarcely the belief of the hindoo children and women we shall not trespass further on the patience of the public with these allegories the brahmins of former ages wrote many volumes of romances upon the lives and actions of those pretended kings inculcating after their manner morality by fable this was the grand fountain from which the religion of the vulgar in india was corrupted if the vulgar of any country require any adventitious aid to corrupt their ideas upon so mysterious a subject  upon the whole the opinions of the author of the bedang upon the subject of religion are not unphilosophical he maintains that the world was created out of nothing by god and that it will be again annihilated the unity infinity and omnipotence of the supreme divinity are inculcated by him for though he presents us with a long list of inferior beings it is plain that they are merely allegorical and neither he nor the sensible part of his followers believe their actual existence the more ignorant hindoos it cannot be denied think that these subaltern divinities do exist in the same manner that christians believe in angels but the unity of god was always a fundamental tenet of the uncorrupted faith of the more learned brahmins  the opinion of this philosopher that the soul after death assumes a body of the purer elements is not peculiar to the brahmins it descended from the druids of europe to the greeks and was the same with the  of homer his idea of the manner of the transmigration of the human soul into various bodies is peculiar to himself as he holds it as a maxim that a portion of the great soul or god animates every living thing he thinks it no ways inconsistent that the same portion that gave life to man should afterward pass into the body of any other animal this transmigration does not in his opinion debase the quality of the soul for when it extricates itself from the fetters of the flesh it reassumes its original nature  the followers of the bedang shaster do not allow that any physical evil exists they maintain that god created all things perfectly good but that man being a free agent may be guilty of moral evil which however only respects himself and society but is of no detriment to the general system of nature god say they has no passion but benevolence and being possessed of no wrath he never punishes the wicked but by the pain and affliction which are the natural consequences of evil actions the more learned brahmins therefore affirm that the hell which is mentioned in the bedang was only intended as a mere bugbear to the vulgar to enforce upon their minds the duties of morality for that hell is no other than a consciousness of evil and those bad consequences which invariably follow wicked deeds  before we shall proceed to the doctrine of the neadirsen shaster it may not be improper to give a translation of the first chapter of the dirm shaster which throws a clear light upon the religious tenets common to both the grand sects of the hindoos it is a dialogue between brimha or the wisdom of god and narud or human reason  narud brimha as we have already observed is the genitive case of brimh as wisdom is by the brahmins reckoned the chief attribute of god o thou first of god who is the greatest of all beings   brimha brimh who is infinite and almighty   narud is he exempted from death   brimha he is being eternal and incorporeal   narud who created the world   brimha god by his power   narud who is the giver of bliss   brimha krishen and whosoever worshippeth him shall enjoy heaven krishen is derived from krish giving and ana joy it is one of the thousand names of god    narud what is his likeness   brimha he has no likeness but to stamp some idea of him upon the minds of men who cannot believe in an immaterial being he is represented under various symbolical forms   narud what image shall we conceive of him   brimha if your imagination cannot rise to devotion without an image suppose with yourself that his eyes are like the lotos his complexion like a cloud his clothing of the lightning of heaven and that he has four hands   narud why should we think of the almighty in this form   brimha his eyes may be compared to the lotos to show that they are always open like that flower which the greatest depth of water cannot surmount his complexion being like that of a cloud is an emblem of that darkness with which he veils himself from mortal eyes his clothing is of lightning to express that awful majesty which surrounds him and his four hands are symbols of his strength and almighty power   narud what things are proper to be offered unto him   brimha those things which are clean and offered with a grateful heart but all things which by the law are reckoned impure or have been defiled by the touch of a woman in her times things which have been coveted by your own soul seized by oppression or obtained by deceit or that have any natural blemish are offerings unworthy of god   narud we are commanded then to make offerings to god of such things as are pure and without blemish by which it would appear that god eats and drinks like mortal man or if he does not for what purpose are our offerings   brimha god neither eats nor drinks like mortal men but if you love not god your offerings will be unworthy of him for as all men covet the good things of this world god requires a free offering of their substance as the strongest testimony of their gratitude and inclinations toward him   narud how is god to be worshipped   brimha with no selfish view but for love of his beauties gratitude for his favors and for admiration of his greatness   narud how can the human mind fix itself upon god being that it is in its nature changeable and perpetually running from one object to another   brimha true the mind is stronger than an elephant whom men have found means to subdue though they have never been able entirely to subdue their own inclinations but the ankush aukush is an iron instrument used for driving elephants of the mind is true wisdom which sees into the vanity of all worldly things   narud where shall we find true wisdom   brimha in the society of good and wise men   narud but the mind in spite of restraint covets riches women and all worldly pleasures how are these appetites to be subdued   brimha if they cannot be overcome by reason let them be mortified by penance for this purpose it will be necessary to make a public and solemn vow lest your resolution should be shaken by the pain which attends it   narud we see that all men are mortal what state is there after death   brimha the souls of such good men as retain a small degree of worldly inclinations will enjoy surg heaven for a time but the souls of those who are holy shall be absorbed into god never more to reanimate flesh the wicked shall be punished in nirick hell for a certain space and afterward their souls are permitted to wander in search of new habitations of flesh   narud thou o father do mention god as one yet we are told that ram whom we are taught to call god was born in the house of jessarit that kishen whom we call god was born in the house of basdeo and many others in the same manner in what light are we to take this mystery   brimha you are to look upon these as particular manifestations of the providence of god for certain great ends as in the case of the sixteen hundred women called gopi when all the men of sirendiep the island of ceylon were destroyed in war the women prayed for husbands and they had all their desires gratified in one night and became with child but you are not to suppose that god who is in this case introduced as the actor is liable to human passions or frailties being in himself pure and incorporeal at the same time he may appear in a thousand places by a thousand names and in a thousand forms yet continue the same unchangeable in his divine nature    without making any reflections upon this chapter of the dirm shaster it appears evident that the religion of the hindoos has hitherto been very much misrepresented in europe the followers of the neadirsen shaster differ greatly in their philosophy from the sect of the bedang though both agree about the unity of the supreme being to give some idea of the neadirsen philosophy we shall in this place give some extracts from that shaster  neadirsen is a compound from nea signifying right and dirsen to teach or explain so that the word may be translated an exhibition of truth though it is not reckoned so ancient as the bedang yet it is said to have been written by a philosopher called goutam near four thousand years ago the philosophy contained in this shaster is very abstruse and metaphysical and therefore it is but justice to goutam to confess that the author of the dissertation notwithstanding the great pains he took to have proper definitions of the terms is by no means certain whether he has fully attained his end in this state of uncertainty he chose to adhere to the literal meaning of words rather than by a free translation to deviate perhaps from the sense of his author  the generality of the hindoos of bengal and all the northern provinces of hindostan esteem the neadirsen a sacred shaster but those of the decan coromandel and malabar totally reject it it consists of seven volumes the first only came to the hands of the author of the dissertation and he has since his arrival in england deposited it in the british museum he can say nothing for certain concerning the contents of the subsequent volumes only that they contain a complete system of the theology and philosophy of the brahmins of the neadirsen sect  goutam does not begin to reason a priori like the writer of the bedang he considers the present state of nature and the intellectual faculties as far as they can be investigated by human reason and from thence he draws all his conclusions he reduces all things under six principal heads substance quality motion species assimulation and construction these are in the original shanscrita dirba goon kirmo summania bishesh sammabac  in substance besides time space life and spirit he comprehends earth water fire air and akash the four grosser elements he says come under the immediate comprehension of our bodily senses and akash time space soul and spirit come under mental perception  he maintains that all objects of perception are equally real as we cannot comprehend the nature of a solid cubit any more than the same extent of space he affirms that distance in point of time and space are equally incomprehensible so that if we shall admit that space is a real existence time must be so too that the soul or vital principle is a subtle element which pervades all things for that intellect which according to experience in animals cannot proceed from organization and vital motion only must be a principle totally distinct from them  the author of the bedant a system of skeptical philosophy to which many of the brahmins adhere  says goutam finding the impossibility of forming an idea of substance asserts that all nature is a mere delusion but as imagination must be acted upon by some real existence as we cannot conceive that it can act upon itself we must conclude that there is something real otherwise philosophy is at an end  he then proceeds to explain what he means by his second principle or goon which says he comprehends twentyfour things form taste smell touch sound number quantity gravity solidity fluidity clasticity conjunction separation priority posteriority divisibility indivisibility accident perception ease pain desire aversion and power the twentyfour things are in the shanscrita in order these rup is gund supursi shubardo sirika putriman cur dirbitte sinniha shanskan sangoog bibag pirrible particca apporticta addarillo bud suc duc itcha desh jotna  kirmo or motion is according to him of two kinds direct and crooked sammania or species which is his third principle includes all animals and natural productions bishesh he defines to be a tendency in matter toward productions and sammabae or the last principle is the artificial construction or formation of things as a statue from a block of marble a house from stones or cloth from cotton  under these six heads as we have already observed goutam comprehends all things which fall under our comprehension and after having reasoned about their nature and origin in a very philosophical manner he concludes with asserting that five things must of necessity be eternal the first of these is pirrum attima or the great soul who says he is immaterial one invisible eternal and indivisible possessing omniscience rest will and power these properties of the divinity are the following in order nidakaar akitta oderisa nitte apparticta budsirba suck itcha jotna   the second eternal principle is the jive attima or the vital soul which he supposes is material by giving it the following properties number quantity motion contraction extension divisibility perception pleasure pain desire aversion accident and power his reasons for maintaining that the vital soul is different from the great soul are very numerous and it is upon this head that the followers of the bedang and neadirsen are principally divided the first affirm that there is no soul in the universe but god and the second strenuously hold that there is as they cannot conceive that god can be subject to such affections and passions as they feel in their own minds or that he can possibly have a propensity to evil evil according to the author of the neadirsen shaster proceeds entirely from jive attima or the vital soul it is a selfish craving principle never to be satisfied whereas god remains in eternal rest without any desire but benevolence  goutams third eternal principle is time or duration which says he must of necessity have existed while any thing did exist and is therefore infinite the fourth principle is space or extension without which nothing could have been and as it comprehends all quantity or rather is infinite he maintains that it is indivisible and eternal the fifth eternal principle is akash a subtle and pure element which fills up the vacuum of space and is compounded of purmans or quantities infinitely small indivisible and perpetual god says he can neither make nor annihilate these atoms on account of the love which he bears to them and the necessity of their existence but they are in other respects totally subservient to his pleasure  god says goutam at a certain season endued these atoms as we may call them with bishesh or plasticity by virtue of which they arranged themselves into four gross elements fire air water and earth these atoms being from the beginning formed by god into the seeds of all productions jive attima or the vital soul associated with them so that animals and plants of various kinds were produced upon the face of the earth  the same vital soul continues goutam which before associated with the purman of an animal may afterward associate with the purman of a man this transmigration is distinguished by three names mirt mirren and pirrapurrapurvesh which last literally signifies the change of abode the superiority of man according to the philosophy of the neadirsen consists only in the finer organization of his parts from which proceed reason reflection and memory which the brutes only possess in an inferior degree on account of their less refined organs  goutam supposes with the author of the bedang that the soul after death assumes a body of fire air and akash unless in the carnal body it has been so purified by piety and virtue that it retains no selfish inclinations in that case it is absorbed into the great soul of nature never more to reanimate flesh such says the philosopher shall be the reward of all those who worship god from pure love and admiration without any selfish views those that shall worship god from motives of future happiness shall be indulged with their desires in heaven for a certain time but they must also expiate their crimes by suffering adequate punishments and afterward their souls will return to the earth and wander about for new habitations upon their return to the earth they shall casually associate with the first organized purman they shall meet they shall not retain any consciousness of their former state unless it is revealed to them by god but those favored persons are very few and are distinguished by the name of jates summon the acquainted with their former state   the author of the neadirsen teaches for the purposes of morality that the sins of the parents will descend to their posterity and that on the other hand the virtues of the children will mitigate the punishments of the parents in nirick and hasten their return to the earth of all sins he holds ingratitude mitterdro to be the greatest souls guilty of that black crime says he will remain in hell while the sun remains in heaven or to the general dissolution of all things  intellect says goutam is formed by the combined action of the senses he reckons six senses five external onnuman reason upimen perception  and one internal the last he calls manus by which he seems to mean conscience in the latter he comprehends reason perception chakous shraban rasan granap tawass and memory and he concludes that by their means only mankind may possibly acquire knowledge he then proceeds to explain the manner by which these senses act  sight says he arises from the shanskar or repulsive qualities of bodies by which the particles of light which fall upon them are reflected back upon the eyes from all parts of their surfaces thus the object is painted in a perfect manner upon the organ of seeing whither the soul repairs to receive the image he affirms that unless the soul fixes its attention upon the figure in the eye nothing can be perceived by the mind for a man in a profound reverie though his eyes are open to the light perceives nothing colors says coutam are particular feelings in the eye which are proportioned to the quantity of light reflected from any solid body  goutam desines hearing in the same manner with the european philosophers with this difference only that he supposes that the sound which affects the ear is conveyed through the purer element of akash and not by the air an error which is not very surprising in a speculative philosopher taste he defines to be a sensation of the tongue and palate occasioned by the particular form of those particles which compose food smell says he proceeds from the effluvia which arise from bodies to the nostrils the feeling which arises from touching is occasioned by the contact of dense bodies with the skin which as well as the whole body excepting the bones the hair and the nails is the organ of that sense there runs says he from all parts of the skin very small nerves to a great nerve which he distinguishes by the name of medda this nerve is composed of two different coats the one sensitive and the other insensitive it extends from the crown of the head down the right side of the vertebrae to the right foot to save the credit of goutam in this place it is necessary to observe that anatomy is not at all known among the hindoos being strictly prohibited from touching a dead body by the severest ties of religion  when the body becomes languid the soul fatigued with action retires within the insensible coat which checks the operation of the senses and occasions sound sleep but should there remain in the soul a small inclination to action it starts into the sensitive part of the nerve and dreams immediately arise before it these dreams says he invariably relate to something perceived before by the senses though the mind may combine the ideas together at pleasure  manus or conscience is the internal feeling of the mind when it is no way affected by external objects onnuman or reason says goutam is that faculty of the soul which enables us to conclude that things and circumstances exist from an analogy to things which had before fallen under the conception of our bodily senses for instance when we see smoke we conclude that it proceeds from a fire when we see one end of a rope we are persuaded that it must have another  by reason continues goutam men perceive the existence of god which the boad or atheists deny because his existence does not come within the comprehension of the senses these atheists says he maintain that there is no god but the universe that there is neither good nor evil in the world that there is no such thing as a soul that all animals exist by a mere mechanism of the organs or by a fermentation of the elements and that all natural productions are but the fortuitous concourse of things  the philosopher refutes these atheistical opinions by a long train of arguments such as have been often urged by european divines though superstition and custom may biass reason to different ends in various countries we find a surprising similarity in the arguments used by all nations against the boad those common enemies of every system of religion  another sect of the boad says goutam are of opinion that all things were produced by chance addaristo  this doctrine he thus refutes chance is so far from being the origin of all things that it has but a momentary existence of its own being alternately created and annihilated at periods infinitely small as it depends entirely on the action of real essences this action is not accidental for it must inevitably proceed from some natural cause let the dice be rattled eternally in the box they are determined in their motion by certain invariable laws what therefore we call chance is but an effect proceeding from causes which we do not perceive  perception continues goutam is that faculty by which we instantaneously know things without the help of reason this is perceived by means of relation or some distinguishing property in things such as high and low long and short great and small hard and soft cold and hot black and white  memory according to goutam is the elasticity of the mind and is employed in three different ways on things present as to time but absent as to place on things past and on things to come it would appear from the latter part of the distinction that the philosopher comprehends imagination in memory he then proceeds to define all the original properties of matter and all the passions and faculties of the mind he then descants on the nature of generation  generation says he may be divided into two kinds jonidge or generation by copulation and adjonidge generation without copulation all animals are produced by the first and all plants by the latter the purman or seed of things was formed from the beginning with all its parts when it happens to be deposited in a matrix suitable to its nature a soul associates with it and by assimulating more matter it gradually becomes a creature or plant for plants as well as animals are possessed of a portion of the vital soul of the world  goutam in another place treats diffusely of providence and free will he divides the action of man under three heads the will of god the power of man and casual or accidental events in explaining the first he maintains a particular providence in the second the freedom of will in man and in the third the common course of things according to the general laws of nature with respect to providence though he cannot deny the possibility of its existence without divesting god of his omnipotence he supposes that the deity never exerts that power but that he remains in eternal rest taking no concern neither in human affairs nor in the course of the operations of nature  the author of the neadirsen maintains that the world is subject to successive dissolutions and renovations at certain stated periods he divides these dissolutions into the lesser and the greater the lesser dissolution will happen at the end of a revolution of the jugs the world will be then consumed by fire and the elements shall be jumbled together and after a certain space of time they will again resume their former order when a thousand of those smaller dissolutions shall have happened a mahperley or great dissolution will take place all the elements will then be reduced to their original purmans or atoms in which state they shall long remain god will then from his mere goodness and pleasure restore bisheth or plasticity a new creation will arise and thus things have revolved in succession from the beginning and will continue to do so to eternity  these repeated dissolutions and renovations have furnished an ample field for the inventions of the brahmins many allegorical systems of creation are upon that account contained in the shasters it was for this reason that so many different accounts of the cosmogony of the hindoos have been promulgated in europe some travelers adopting one system and some another without deviating from the good manners due to those writers we may venture to affirm that their tales upon this subject are extremely puerile if not absurd they took their accounts from any common brahmin with whom they chanced to meet and never had the curiosity or industry to go to the fountain head  in some of the renovations of the world brimha or the wisdom of god is represented in the form of an infant with his toe in his mouth floating on a comala or water flower or sometimes upon a leaf of that plant upon the watery abyss the brahmins mean no more by this allegory than that at that time the wisdom and designs of god will appear as in their infant state brimha floating upon a leaf shows the instability of things at that period the toe which he sucks in his mouth implies that infinite wisdom subsists of itself and the position of brimhas body is an emblem of the endless circle of eternity  we see brimha sometimes creeping forth from a winding shell this is an emblem of the untraceable way by which divine wisdom issues sorth from the infinite ocean of god he at other times blows up the world with a pipe which implies that the earth is but a bubble of vanity which the breath of his mouth can destroy brimha in one of the renovations is represented in the form of a snake one end of which is upon a tortoise which floats upon the vast abyss and upon the other he supports the world the snake is the emblem of wisdom the tortoise is a symbol of security which figuratively signifies providence and the vast abyss is the eternity and infinitude of god  what has been already said has it is hoped thrown a new light on the opinions of the hindoos upon the subject of religion and philosophical inquiry we find that the brahmins contrary to the ideas formed of them in the west invariably believe in the unity eternity omniscience and omnipotence of god that the polytheism of which they have been accused is no more than a symbolical worship of the divine attributes which they divide into three principal classes under the name of brimha they worship the wisdom and creative power of god under the appellation of bishen his providential and preserving quality and under that of shibah that attribute which tends to destroy  this system of worship say the brahmins arises from two opinions the first is that as god is immaterial and consequently invisible it is impossible to raise a proper idea of him by any image in the human mind the second is that it is necessary to strike the gross ideas of man with some emblems of gods attributes otherwise that all sense of religion will naturally vanish from the mind they for this purpose have made symbolical representations of the three classes of the divine attributes but they aver that they do not believe them to be separate intelligences brimh or the supreme divinity has a thousand names but the hindoos would think it the grossest impiety to represent him under any form the human mind say they may form some conception of his attributes separately but who can grasp the whole within the circle of finite ideas  that in any age or country human reason was ever so depraved as to worship the work of hands for the creator of the universe we believe to be an absolute deception which arose from the vanity of the abettors of particular systems of religion to attentive inquirers into the human mind it will appear that common sense upon the affairs of religion is pretty equally divided among all nations revelation and philosophy have it is confessed lopped off some of those superstitious excrescences and absurdities that naturally arise in weak minds upon a subject so mysterious but it is much to be doubted whether the want of those necessary purifiers of religion ever involved any nation in gross idolatry as many ignorant zealots have pretended  in india as well as in many other countries there are two religious sects the one look up to the divinity through the medium of reason and philosophy while the others receive as an article of their belief every holy legend and allegory which have been transmitted down from antiquity from a fundamental article in the hindoo faith that god is the soul of the world and is consequently diffused through all nature the vulgar revere all the elements and consequently every great natural object as containing a portion of god nor is the infinity of the supreme being easily comprehended by weak minds without falling into this error this veneration for different objects has no doubt given rise among the common indians to an idea of subaltern intelligences but the learned brahmins with one voice deny the existence of inferior divinities and indeed all their religious books of any antiquity confirm that assertion  end of the dissertation a catalogue of the gods of the hindoos to prevent future writers from confounding themselves and others by mistaking synonimous names of the gods of the hindoos for different intelligences we here present the public with a catalogue of them as taken from an original book of the brahmins a list of proper names especially in a foreign language is so very dry of itself that it is superfluous to advise such as are not particularly inquisitive upon this subject to pass entirely over this list as it can afford very little amusement  brimh or the supreme being is distinguished by a thousand names in the shanscrita according to the brahmins but it is to be observed that in that number they include the names of all those powers properties and attributes which they conceive to be inherent in the divine nature as well as the names of all those symbols and material essences under which god is worshipped those commonly used are ishbur the great will bagubaan the receptacle of goodness narrain the giver of motion pirrimpurrous the first essence niringen the dispassionate nidakar the

in all climes and ages to take advantage of superstitious minds there is one thing however to be said in favor of the hindoo doctrine that while it teaches the purest morals it is systematically formed on philosophical opnions let us therefore no longer imagine half the world more ignorant than the stones which they seem to worship but rest assured that whatever the external ceremonies of religion may be the selfsame infinite being is the object of universal adoration  map of india a general map of hindostan with the adjacent countries   the history of hindostan part i the history of the hindoos before the first invasion of hindostan by the mahomedans section i of the fabulous accounts of the hindoos concerning their origin  a specimen of their ancient history the ancient history of the hindoos fabulous there is no history among the hindoos of better authority than the mahabarit mahabarit signifies the great war our author has in this section given a specimen of the legends contained in that book  which shech abul fazil translated into persian in the reign of akbar it consists of about one hundred and twenty thousand periods ashlogues or stanzas in the original shanscrita in a kind of long blank verse we shall from this author select the particulars which relate to the history of the hindoos  their division of time the hindoos divide the age of the world into four grand periods or jugs the sat jug the treta jug the duapur jug and the call jug they believe that when the call jug is finished the sat jug will commence again and that thus time will revolve in eternal succession the sat jug is said to have been a period of fourteen millions and four hundred thousand years and it is represented as the age of felicity in which there was nothing but truth religion happiness peace plenty and independence and that the life of man extended to one hundred thousand years  the treta jug is said to contain one million and eighty thousand years in which it is said that in the composition of mankind there were three fourths truth and one fourth falsehood and that the age of man extended to ten thousand years the duapur jug is said to contain seventy two thousand years in which two parts of the composition of man were truth and two parts falsehood his age extending to one thousand years the call jug contains thirty six thousand years in which period three fourths of the composition of man consisted of falsehood and only one fourth of truth his age being one hundred years  brimha creates the world it is the opinion of the hindoos that god first created five elements fire water air earth and akash or a celestial element of which the heavens are made he afterward created a kind of being endued with perfect wisdom whom he called brimha and commanded him to make the world and mankind when brimha had created mankind out of nothing he divided them into four tribes the brahmin the kittri the bise and the sudur the first tribe were to be priests to direct man in the ways of god the second rulers and possessors of the earth the third laborers and the fourth tradesmen and servants which division is strictly maintained to this day  author of the bedas brimha say they wrote a book which he called the beda by the order of god in which he affirms that all things were originally god and that all things shall be resolved into him again that happiness consists in virtue and that vice will be punished with misery to regulate the ceremonies of religion and to instruct men how to govern the world he has in the beda given a canon of laws founded upon the principles of justice but as the bedas are covered with a veil of darkness by the brahmins we cannot say much more for certain concerning them the hindoos affirm that brimha lives for ever or as some say one hundred years in which each day is computed at four hundred revolutions of the jugs we shall here give a specimen of the early history of the hindoos  specimen of the ancient history of the hindoos it is recorded in the mahabarit that about the middle of the third period there was a raja of the tribe of kittiri in the city of histinapoor whose name was birt he ruled the kingdom of hindostan and his issue after him in lineal descent for eight generations in peace and tranquillity the ninth in succession whose name was kour we are told founded the city of that name which is now called tannassar and is about  0 crores from delhi he was the father of the tribe who are still called kours  ditarashter being blind his brother succeeds to the throne in the thirteenth generation from kour chitterbourge reigned and was esteemed a great prince he had two sons one named ditarashter and the other pind but when ditarashter grew up he became blind and therefore his father left the kingdom to his younger son who had five children judishter brimsein and arjun by one wife and nucul and sedive by another woman but his elder brother ditarashter had sons one hundred and one by a variety of women among whom one was named jirjodin being the eldest of his children by the first wife and another was called jutush being his first born by a second spouse in short when pind died the inheritance descended by right to the heirs of his elder brother ditarashter so that jirjodin became king  differences between their children but the children of pind regarded jirjodin as an enemy and waited an opportunity to divest him of his authority ditarashter fearing disturbances advised his son to build a palace without the city for the sons of pind in which for some time they consented to reside in the mean time jirjodin had privately ordered the workmen who built this palace to fill up several vaults with combustibles and hired an old woman to set fire to them at a proper opportunity but the plot being discovered accidentally by the sons of pind they themselves set fire to the mine and burnt the old woman and her five sons in the flames while they privately withdrew into the wilderness where they remained for some time the king imagining they had been destroyed in the fire  the sons of pind show themselves at cumpula the sons of pind ventured at length into a certain city called cumpula where they wedded diropti the rajas daughter with whom they lived by turns for the space of seventeen days in a short time however it was noised abroad that the sons of pind were not dead as was supposed which reaching the ears of the king he ordered enquiry to be made and found that truth was in the report are invited to court anxious to have them again in his power he wrote to them affectionate letters inviting them to histinapoor to share with him the inheritance of their forefathers they were at length prevailed upon by his fair promises returned to court and were treated in every respect becoming their dignity a part of the kingdom was allotted for their maintenance for upon their arrival they became so much beloved by the people and nobility that the king was afraid to lay violent hands upon them their popularity daily increasing and their party being strengthened by many of the principal nobility they at length openly insisted upon a division of the empire in their favor which the king being in no condition to refuse complied with without hesitation  the feast of the period some time after these transactions judishter gave the feast of the period jograjasou somewhat similar to the secular games among the romans  the manner of which is said to be this they lighted a prodigious fire and threw into it every kind of spice perfume fruit and grain at this feast it was necessary that all the rajas of the earth should be present judishter in order to invite the rajas sent his four brothers to the four quarters of the world that by the favor of god his design in a short time might be accomplished his brothers according to his desire from arab from agim from turkistan from habysh and other countries brought those princes to be present at this grand festival jirjodin on observing the greatness of judishter burnt with envy at his fortune and contrived this scheme to deprive his rival of his kingdoms and wealth  the sons of pind banished for twelve years it was the custom in those days to play at dice and jirjodin having made a false set challenged judishter to play which being accepted by him he in a short time in the presence of the princes lost all his wealth and kingdoms jirjodin told him then that he would give him one more chance to recover the whole but that if he again should lose he must retire with all his brothers for the space of twelve years into banishment and if during that interval he was to be seen in his former dominions he was to remain in banishment twelve years more judishter hoping that fortune would not always be unkind consented to these terms but having lost as before he was constrained by the princes who were umpires to relinquish his kingdoms to jirjodin and retire into banishment with his brethren from inderput his capital city now known by the name of delhi  send an ambassador to demand their share of the kingdom twelve years they lay concealed in the wilderness in such a manner that the tread of their feet was not heard and when the time of their exile expired they dispatched kishen the son of basdeo to demand the restoration of their kingdoms jirjodin notwithstanding of his promise made a jest of the embassy and turned the ambassador with scorn from his presence the sons of pind finding that they could do nothing without force began to collect their friends of whom they had many and in a short time they appeared in the field of kirket near the city of tanassar at the head of a mighty army in the beginning of the call jug jirjodin advancing with his army after having drawn up his troops in array encouraged the ranks of the valiant a battle the soldiers on both sides according to the custom of battle began to work for death the contest was renwd with dubious advantages for the space of eighteen days till at length jirjodin with most of his friends as the reward of his perfidy drank the cup of fate in the field of war  incredible number of both armies the hindoos say that in this war jirjodin commanded eleven cohin and the sons of pind seven a cohin according to their fabulous accounts consisted of twentyone thousand eight hundred and seventy elephants of war an equal number of chariots six thousand six hundred and ten horsemen and one hundred and nine thousand three hundred and fifty foot of all this incredible number they say that only twelve men survived on both sides four on the part of jirjodin and eight on the part of judishter among the latter was the ambassador kishen basdeo who is esteemed a great prophet among the hindoos they say that the astrologers gave advice to raja kuns who ruled in the city of muttra that kishen should one day take away his life upon which he sought every opportunity to put kishen to death but kishen knowing the designs of his foe retired to a place called nind where he lived with a shepherd eleven years he ventured at length into the world and collecting a body of men together who were dissatisfied with the government of kuns he made war upon him and put him to death setting up ogursein the father of kuns in the kingdom and he himself lived afterward thirtytwo years at the head of the administration at muttra raja jeradsing from the country of barounia came at length with a great army toward muttra to turn kishen from his place at the same time came from the east raja callioon and attacked him on the other side kishen not able to oppose these two rajas fled toward duarka which is on the coast of the salt sea and was there besieged for the space of eighteen years where some say he died but the superstitious aver that he is still alive and therefore they pay him divine honors  they relate that after the mahabarit which signifies the great war judishter having overcome jirjodin ruled the whole empire of hindostan for thirtysix years when being disgusted with the vanity and pomp of the world he retired into a mountain dividing his wealth and empire among his friends and lived the life of religion and poverty the remainder of his days the reign of jirjodin and judishter is said to be one hundred and twentyfive years such are the tales of the hindoos concerning an age too dark and distant to be distinctly known  section ii of the origin of the hindoos though our author begins his accounts of hindostan with the stood yet like the annals of other nations there is little to be depended upon in the history of that country for some ages after that supposed period this must rather be ascribed to the ignorance of the mahommedans in the shanscrita language than to a real want of ancient monuments among the hindoos themselves in the first centuries of the higerah truth begins to beam forth with luster in his accounts of india and that with more precision and minuteness than any history we have of any european nation in so early a period  origin of the hindoos as the best and most authentic historians agree that adam was the father of mankind whose creation they place about five thousand years before the higerah the sensible part of mankind who love the plainness of truth better than the extravagance of fable have rejected the mavelous traditions of the hindoos concerning the transactions of a hundred thousand years and are of opinion that they like other nations are the descendants of the sons of no who peopled the world the hindoos pretend to know nothing of the flood however as this event is supported by the testimony of all other nations there is little room to doubt of its truth and we shall therefore proceed to trace the hindoos from that great era according to the best authorities  the sons of no or noah we are told that no had three sons sham eaphs and ham sham the eldest had nine sons arshud arphashud bood khe simood aram kibt aad and keitan all the tribes of arabs abraham and the prophets were of the race of arphashud and his second son keiomours is said to be the first king of agim media  and his sons were six shamuc pharis iraac billou shaam and mogaan shamuc inherited the kingdom after the death of his father whereas the other sons dispersing themselves laid the foundation of monarchies which passed by their names  eaphs or japhet eaphs according to the desire of his father turned his face to the northeast where he had many sons and daughters the name of his firstborn was turc from whence all the tribes of the turks moguls usbecks chigettas turkumanians and rumians the european turks are called rumians by the eastern nations from their possessing the empire of the romans in the lesser asia  the name of the second son was chin who laid the foundation of the mighty monarchy of china and the third whose name was rus is said to be the father of those nations who extend themselves northward even into the regions of darkness in the countries of muse ghiz and eucolaat  ham the progenitor of the hindoos ham by the order of his illustrious father turned his face to the south he also had many children the name of the first was hind the second sind the third habysh habysh according to the mahommedans was the progenitor of the abyssinians  the fourth zinge the fifth barber and the sixth nobah from these all the kingdoms distinguished by their names took their rise hind turning eastward possessed himself of the paradisial regions of hindostan where he laid the foundation of his monarchy his brother sind turning to the southeast possessed himself of the fertile plains of the river the indus  and founding the city of tatta ruled the kingdom of moultan  the sons of hind hind had four sons one of whom was named purib another bang a third decan and a fourth nerwaal they first inhabited the countries known to this day by their names to decan the son of hind was born three sons among whom he divided his kingdom marhat conher and tiling and from them sprung these three great tribes in the decan marhattas conherias and telingas nerwaal had also three sons beroge cambage and malrage whose names descended to the countries over which they ruled bang also had many children who lived to inherit the kingdom of bengal but purib the firstborn of hind had fortytwo sons who in a short time multiplied exceedingly but among these one of them whose name was krishen exalted himself above his brethren  section iii of the reign of krishen the founder of the dynasty of the marages krishen first king of hindostan let it not be concealed that the first who placed his foot on the musnud of empire in the region of hindostan was krishen but not that krishen whom the hindoos worship but a man of wisdom policy and courage he was it is said so fat a man that finding no horse sufficiently strong for his weight he first prompted by necessity found out the art of catching and taming elephants in the reign of krishen it is also said that there lived a certain person of the race of bang whose name was brahma wise and learned whom krishen made his vizier this brahma is said to be the father of many arts of writing and of working in wood and iron he was also the founder of the city of oud which became the capital of krishen and is said to have been the first regular imperial city of hindostan when krishen had lived to the age of four hundred years that is to say krishen and such of his race as bore his name reigned four hundred years over hindostan it is to be observed that our author does not properly speaking begin his history till the empire of ghizni was founded by subuetagl his professed design being to record the transactions of the mahommedans in hindostan what therefore the translator has distinguished under the title of the first part of this history is no more than a dissertation prefixed to the original in which the domestic accounts of the hindoos concerning their ancient kings are briefly recapitulated  he left the world to his firstborn marage having during his reign peopled near two thousand towns and villages  section iv of the reign of marage marage signifies the great king  the son of krishen and of the dynasties of the marages and keshrorages is seeded by marage when marage by the consent of his brothers and of the people had ascended the throne in the art of government he soon rivalld the same of his father devoting his time to the just administration of his affairs as the children of brahma were skilled in the arts of their father he continued the most expert of them as his vizier and appointed the rest his astrologers physicians and priests whence some derive the origin of the brahmins who to this day exercise those functions in hindostan others of the nobility were appointed hereditary governors of provinces from whom the second great sect of the hindoos are supposed to derive their origin while a third class were commanded to cultivate the ground and a fourth to employ themselves in such arts as were necessary for the purposes of society marage divides his subjects into four tribes it was enacted that this division of the subjects of marage into four grand departments should subsist for ever and thus was laid the foundation of the four great sects of hindoos brahma kittri bise and sudur  is a lover of learning the wise and the excellent marage was a lover of learning he invited philosophers from all parts and founded the city of bahar for their reception appropriating the revenues of certain lands for their maintenance and building several noble edifices and temples for the worship of the true god of the length of his reign and the manner of his death we have no particular accounts neither are we informed of the lives and actions of his successors who are said to have ruled over hindostan under the name and honors of their father during the space of seven hundred years in which time the country is said to have greatly increased in riches cultivation and in the number of its people a friendly correspondence was kept up between the imperial crowns of hindostan and iran persia  till at length one of the princes of the blood of hind went in disgust to the presence of feredoon king of iran he laid his complaints before the king who ordered kirshib the son of attrid with a numerous army to recover his rights the persians for the first time invade hindostan when kirshib reached the kingdom of hindostan a war was commenced which continued with various success for the space of ten years the country suffered exceedingly till marage was compelled to give up a part of his dominions to the fugitive prince of whose name we have no information only that he was nephew to the then emperor marage thus procured peace and sent presents by the hand of kirshib to the king of iran  rebellion in ceylon it is said that some time after the governor of shingeldiep ceylon and carnatic trusting in his strength blew up the flames of rebellion which was the occasion of a long and bloody war in the decan in which the eldest son of the king lost his life being deserted in the fight by showra ruler of the decan who fled with his discomfited army to the king marage on hearing this news writhed himself like a snake with anger and bit the finger of sorrow because before that time none of the rulers of the islands of atchin or the coasts of pegu or malabar had dared to dispute his commands  second invasion of the persians he was at the same time threatened with an invasion from iran for minuchere had advanced as far as moultan with a mighty army intending to make an entire conquest of hindostan marage sent baal chund his general against him who finding that peace would be more advantageous at that juncture than war with this foreign enemy prevailed on minuchere by large presents to return to iran ceylon reduced when baal chund had accomplished this pacification he was ordered by the king to march to the carnatic where he subdued the governor of shingeldiep and again established the authority of his master some authors relate that baal chund was obliged to cede the whole territory of punjaab to minuchere the general of feredoon feredoon and minuchere seem to have been names common to all the kings of persia in those ages  before he would return to iran but others affirm that the territory of punjaab during the reign of feredoon was in the possession of the king of agim media   when baal chund returned from the war marage in reward of his bravery appointed him ruler of malava this general is said to have built the castles of gualier and biana and to have first introduced music into hindostan from the tilingas of the decan among whom it was invented  before christ      dynasty of the keshrorage commences the dynasty of the posterity of marage lasted seven hundred years after the death of krishen when keshrorage ascended the throne this prince was also of the race of the marages and had fourteen brothers whom on his accession he dispatched into different countries while he himself taking the way of calpic went into the decan by the city of gunduar and directing his march toward shingeldiep reduced that country into obedience and regulated its government rebellion in the decan soon after the zemindars of the decan joining in confederacy exalted the spear of enmity and day by day gained strength till at last they ventured to advance their standards against the king keshrorage seeing the inequality of his force began to treat about a peace which he obtained and began his retreat  persians aid keshrorage in the mean time he sent presents to minuchere king of iran to demand assistance minuohere ordered sham the son of nireman with a great force to his aid keshrorage met him at the town of jillender and received him with feasts and with joy the confederate armies turned their standards toward the decan and the chiefs of the rebels began to be greatly affected with the terror of the troops of iran the decan reduced the regions of the decan fell again into the hands of the king when the country was settled in tranquillity keshrorage returned with his army to his capital of oud and from thence accompanying sham as far as punjaab dismissed him with presents to his prince minuchere keshrorage returning home spread the umbrella of justice over the head of his people and gave them happiness plenty and peace his successors of the same name ruled hindostan two hundred and twenty years of whom we hear nothing remarkable till firose ra ascended the throne of empire  section v of the reign of firose ra and the dissolution of the dynasty of the keshrorage before christ   0  firose ra a weak prince firose ra being versed in the indian sciences of the shashter took great delight in the society of learned men and entirely neglected the art of war he expended his revenues in charities to fakeers and in building temples for the worship of god he made two journeys to the city of bahar to which he granted large endowments and built the town of moneer among the bad actions of his life is related that on the death of sham the son of nireman who was a great general under minuchere king of persia  afrasiab king of turan or great tartary he was one of the greatest conquerors of the east having invaded the kingdom of iran seizes upon punjaab firose ra ungratefully seized the same opportunity to wrest the countries of punjaab the countries lying near the five heads of the indus and jallender from that prince notwithstanding the generous assistance of persia to his father in recovering the kingdoms of the decan some ancient authors relate that till the reign of keikubad the territories of punjaab were annexed to those of hindostan but when the hero of the world rustum dista rustum dista was king of seistan and for his great exploits he was reckoned the hercules of the east  gave grace to the throne of empire he turned to the conquest of punjaab and firose ra unable to oppose his progress withdrew his army to the mountains of turhat deposed by rustum dista after rustum had conquered sind moultan and punjaab he advanced toward turhat and firose ra in great terror fled from thence to the mountains of jarcund and gundwarah nor did he ever after see happiness but gave up his soul to death dynasty of the firose ra ends he is said to have reigned one hundred and thirtyseven years but this period must be understood to include all the kings who ruled under that name and title  section vi of the reign of soorage and the dynasty of that name before christ  0   soorage ascends the throne when the news of the death of firose ra reached the ears of rustum that hero on account of his character and ingratitude to minuchere was not desirous that his son should succeed to his honors he therefore placed a chief of the hindoos whose name was soorage upon the throne and he himself returned to iran a powerful prince soorage became a powerful prince and from the sea of bengal to that of malabar placed his viceroys and governors and turned his mind to erect magnificent edifices and to improve agriculture  in the reign of soorage a brahmin from the mountains of jarcund appeared who was skilled in the arts of enchantment and who insinuating himself into the favor of the king instructed him in the practices of idolatry it is said that hind continued in imitation of his father to worship the true god and that his descendants followed his example till in the time of marage a person came from iran and introduced the worship of the sun moon and stars and their proper symbol the element of fire the worship of idols introduced but the brahmin in the days of soorage having introduced the worship of idols in a manner obliterated all traces of the old religion for then every great family molded their silver and gold into images of their fore fathers and setting them up as objects of worship among their vassals there arose in the land gods without number  soorage builds kianoge soorage built the city of kinnoge which he adorned with the temples of his gods and was intent upon the practice of idolatry this city being pleasantly situated on the banks of the ganges he constituted his capital and it is said that the extent of the walls of kinnoge was at that time fifty crores  duration of the dynasty of the soorages the dynasty of the soorages lasted two hundred and eightysix years during which time they sent annual presents by way of tribute to the kings of iran  section vii of barage before christ     barage mounts the throne of the race of the surage we hear nothing particular till the reign of barage who was the last of that family when barage mounted the throne of hindostan he enlarged the city of barage and dignified it with his own name this city is situated to the northwest of oud about forty crores by the foot of the mountains he is said to have wrote some books on the science of music which were in great repute in ancient times we are also told that he finished the city of banaris which his father had begun to build toward the latter end of his reign is tyrannical but his disposition being somewhat tinctured with madness he overturned the laws of marage which were founded on wisdom and great disturbances arose in hindostan deposed keidar a brahmin from the mountains of sewali having collected a great army invaded him and having in the end entirely defeated the king wielded the scepter of government in his own hand the reign of barage is said to have been thirtysix years  section viii of the reign of keidar the brahmin before christ   0 keidar a brahmin succeeds to the throne when keidar the brahmin had claspt the bride of royalty in his arms a metaphorical expression for the empire  being a man of learning and genius he became a great king but carrying the trappings of kei caous and kei chusero keicaous and keichusero were kings of persia on his shoulders he was constrained by way of tribute to send them annual gifts this prince laid the foundation of the castle of killinger upon a high rock about thirty crores south from allahabad and lived to see it completely finished defeated and dethroned by shinkol in the latter end of his reign one shinkol a native of kinnoge having strengthened himself took possession of bang the province of bengal and behar where he had been governor and leading a great army against keidar after many battles had been fought with various success the fortune of shinkol at length prevailed the reign of keidar was nineteen years  section ix of the reign of shinkol and of his son and successor rhoat before christ     shinkol mount the throne when shinkol had ascended the throne he exerted himself in the military art and affected great magnificence the city of lucknouti which is famous by the name of goura he rebuilt and beautified with many noble structures that city is said to have been the capital of bang for the space of two thousand years and was not destroyed till after the conquest of timur when tanda became the seat of government in those parts  his great army shinkol kept up a force of four thousand elephants of war a hundred thousand horse and four hundred thousand foot refuses to pay tribute to persia when therefore afrasiab afrasiab was a common title of the kings of persia of the tartar race  king of iran demanded his tribute shinkol confiding in his own strength refused to make any acknowledgment but turned away the persian ambassador with disgrace afrasiab being enraged at this treatment one of his generals whose name was peiran was commanded to march against shinkol with fifty thousand chosen troops when intelligence of this invasion came to shinkol he exalted the spear of defiance and raising a great army marched forth to meet him  the two armies came in sight of each other near the hills of koge which are in the country of koracut on the frontiers of bengala the battle soon begun and it lasted two days and two nights without victory declaring on either side the turks the word turk signifies no more than a soldier in the persian language so that all their troops went by that name turks in this place must be understood of those whom we call tartars  doing justice to their former fame had by this time laid fifty thousand of the hindoos upon the field yet on account of the number of the enemy the harvest seemed not to decrease before them in the mean time eighteen thousand of the smaller army being slain a weakness appeared distinctly on the face of their affairs defeats the persians however urged as they were they made a third attempt and finding themselves overcome they sought as they retreated to the mountains there they took possession of a strong post from which it was impossible to drive them from this post they continued with small parties to harrass the neighboring country and in the mean time dispatched letters to afrasiab giving him an account of their situation  afrasiab was at that time in the city of gingdis which is situated between chitta and chin and about a months journey beyond the city of balich when he received intelligence of the situation of peiran he hastened to his relief with a hundred thousand horse and came just in time to save him from destruction for shinkol had so closely invested him with a numerous army that in a few days more he must have perished with famine or submitted himself to the mercy of an enraged enemy afrasiab without delay assaulted shinkol the terrified hindoos unable to stand the combat were dispersed like straw before the storm leaving their wealth and equipage behind but is overcome by afrasiab and hindostan ravaged when peiran was relieved from his distress afrasiab pursued the enemy and put thousands of them to the sword shinkol himself hastened to bang and came to the city of lucknouti but being closely pursued by afrasiab he tarried there only one day and then fled to the mountains of turhat the turks ravaged the whole kingdom with fire and sword  afrasiab having received intelligence of shinkol he directed his march toward him shinkol immediately sent some of the wise men of his court to beg peace and forgiveness for his errors soliciting that he might have the honor to kiss the foot of the lord of nations submits and is earned to persia afrasiab yielded to his entreaties and shinkol with a sword and a coffin was brought into his presence it was agreed between the kings that shinkol should accompany afrasiab to turan and that his son should have the empire restored to him upon condition of paying an annual tribute thus shinkol continued to attend afrasiab who returned to his own dominions till in one of the battles with rustum rustum seems to be a name common to all the kings of  he was slain by that heros sword  before christ     rhoat a good prince shinkol is said to have reigned sixtyfour years his son rhoat who succeeded him in the throne was a wise religious and affable prince the revenues of his empire which extended from kirmi to malava he divided into three parts one of which he expended in charities tributary to persia another he sent to afrasiab for his tribute in which there was a large surplus for the use of his father and the other third was appropriated to the necessary expenses of his government his standing army upon this account was small which induced the king of malava who was rich and powerful to withdraw his neck from the yoke of obedience and to seize upon the castle of gualier at the time that raja rhoat was busy in building the strong hold of rhotas which still goes by his name when intelligence was brought to the king of the loss of gualier he assembled an army and led them against the raja of malava but was forced to retreat the family of shinkol become extinct after rhoat and his race had reigned eightyone years they went the way of their fathers and having left no children to assume the ensigns of royalty there arose great disturbances in the city of kinnoge a nobleman whose name was merage from the rajaput tribe of cutchwa assumed at last the dignities of the empire this prince we are told was a native of marwar  section x of the reign of merage merage succeeds to the throne before christ    after merage had firmly established himself upon the throne he led an army toward narval guzerat  and punished the disobedient zemindars of that country encourages trade having built a port on the shores of the salt sea he there constructed ships of wonderful invention to trade into foreign lands and having settled the country in peace returned to his capital dies where he died after a reign of forty years he was cotemporary with gustasp emperor of turkistan hystaspes the father of darius hystaspes king of persia it is remarkable that the chronology of the hindoos agrees almost exactly with sir isaac newton newton fixes the commencement of the reign of darius in the    st year before christ so that if we suppose that hystaspes made a figure in turkestan twenty five years before the accession of his son to the throne of persia which is no ways improbable the chronology of hindostan agrees perfectly with that which newton has established  to whom he paid tribute  section xi of the reign of kederage before christ     kederage kederage was nephew by a sister to the former king and nominated by him for his successor conquers punjaab rustum dista the second being slain and the ruler of punjaab being a weak man kederage led an army that way conquered it without much difficulty and remained some time in bhera which is an ancient city he built the fort of jimbu situated about forty crores from lahore on a mountain then leaving one of his kinsmen whose name was wirick to govern the country he returned to his capital but loses it again but some time after two tribes of mountaineers the gickers and joppies collecting all the troops of cabul and kandahar advanced against kederage and recovered all those territories from which time these people have kept possession of the mountains and are now called asgans kederage reigned forty three years  section xii of the reign of jeichund before christ  0  jeichund jeichund was commander in chief of the armies of the former king and having the power in his hands he mounted the throne at the death of his sovereign a dissolute prince in this reign a dreadful famine and pestilence devoured the land the king neglecting the public calamity in the city of biana spent his time in riot and festivity many towns and villages upon this occasion became desolate and the whole kingdom of hindostan put on the aspect of ruin and distress dies jeichund at the expiration of sixty years withdrew into the regions of eternity he was cotemporary with bemin and daraab and sent them an annual tribute delu usurps the throne he left one son of tender years so that the mother of the child took the reins of administration into her hands but being too weak to guide the chariot of empire delu the brother of jeichund seized that opportunity of usurping the government  section xiii of the reigns of delu and the two foors before christ     a brave and generous prince delu was a prince uncommonly brave and generous with a disposition benevolent toward men and entirely devoted to his creator he founded the city of delhi in the fortieth year of his reign foor or porus rebels but a raja of his own family whose name was foor foor was father to the famous porus who sought against alexander  and who ruled the country of cumaoon under him rebelled and having first secured that country drew a great army together and invaded the emperor in kinnoge defeats and deposes delu thus a bloody war was commenced in which the emperor was taken prisoner and sent to be confined in the fort of rhotas foor led his army toward bang and conquered the country as far as the ocean and became a great and powerful prince his son neglects to pay the tribute to persia and is overthrown and slain by alexander before christ   0 but his son foor confiding in his strength neglected to pay the customary tribute to the king of iran which drew the victorious army of the great secunder alexander the great upon his head foor notwithstanding would not submit but with an army numerous as the locusts met secunder at sirhind about eighty crores from delhi where a terrible battle was fought in which he bravely lost his life with many thousands of his subjects  when the great secunder came to hindostan there was a raja of the decan whose name was bider and founder of the castle of that name who upon hearing of the victory of secunder and the death of foor sent his son with great wealth to the conqueror to obtain peace which being granted and a mutiny arising in his army secunder returned to iran  sinsarchund after the death of foor and the return of secunder sinsarchund assumed the imperial dignity and in a short time regulated the empire which was then in great confusion pays the persian tribute but he neglected not to send his regular tribute to kodirs and nirsi who at that time held the sultanit of iran  after he and his family of the same name had reigned seventy years jonah a raja whose name was jonah invaded the empire and gained the ascendancy some say that jonah was the nephew of foor but this is not well attested  however when his fortune raised him to the throne he became an excellent prince taking great pains in peopling and cultivating the waste parts of his dominions and founding a lasting name of justice and benevolence aridshere aridshere is the same with arsaces king of parthia who founded the parthian or second persian empire about two hundred and fiftysix years before the christian era at this time was emperor of iran and advanced with an army to the borders of hindostan submits to persia when jonah in fear of his arms hastened to make his submission carrying with him a great number of warlike elephants with a vast quantity of gold and jewels which he presented to the emperor and bought peace he then returned to kinnoge and ruled in tranquillity for many years he and his posterity reigned ninety years without doing any thing remarkable to the accession of callian chund to the imperial throne  section xiv of callian chund before christ   0 callian chund a bad prince callian chund was a prince of an evil disposition oppressive and tyrannical to his subjects whose blood he shed without mercy his cruelty occasioned many people of distinction to desert the country and fly to other kingdoms for protection by which the luster of the court and the beauty of the country were greatly diminished deposed at length faction began openly to raise her head and all the dependant rajas to appear in arms so that being deserted by his own troops he fled and died in obscurity  from this period we find nothing certain in the history of hindostan to the time of bickermagit the raja of malava who made a considerable figure in the world we shall therefore make a short digression from the history of the kings of kinnoge to give some account of him  bickermagit this bickermagit was of the tribe of tuar and great things are recorded in the histories of the hindoos concerning the policy justice and wisdom of his government travels to foreign countries it is said that this prince in his youth putting on the habit of a fakeer traveled over the world for many years in acquiring the arts learning and policy of foreign nations his great actions and good qualities it was not however till the age of fifty that he became famous for his exploits in the field to which they say he was impelled by divine command which notion seemed indeed to be justified by his uncommon success which soon paved his way to the throne in a few months he entirely subdued the kingdoms of narval and malava spreading the carpet of justice and throwing the shadow of his protection over the heads of his subjects the poets of those days praise his justice by telling us that the magnet without his leave durst not exert its power upon iron nor amber upon the chaff of the field and such was his temperance and contempt of external grandeur that he slept upon a mat and reduced the furniture of his apartment to an earthen pot filled with water from the spring  in his reign the city of ugein was built as also the fort of daar where he took up his residence sets up an idol he is said to have set up the idol makaal great time in ugein and to have collected brahmins fakeers and jogies to attend that worship for the vulgar but worships the true god while he himself worshipped only the infinite and invisible god the time of his death before the writing of this history in the year of the higerah one thousand and fifteen according to the account of the hindoo writers is fifteen hundred and sixty three years he is said to have been cotemporary with shawpoor shawpoor signifies the king of the city a title of the kings of persia for some time after the dissolution of the first empire it is the same name with sapor so famous in the roman history king of iran  slain bickermagit the era of bickermagit is that which is most commonly used by the gentoos was slain in his old age in a battle with the princes of the decan who had lifted up their standards against him upon the banks of the river nirbidda the hindoo historians have stretched the praise of this hero so far beyond the bounds of reason and probability that the love of truth obliges us to be silent on this head an interregnum after the death of bickermagit the kingdom fell into anarchy for some time till raja boge drew the reins of government into his hands  a d  raj  a good prince raja boge also was of the tribe of tuar and in policy justice and government followed the example of bickermagit in the discipline of his troops he was extremely active and vigilant often going the rounds in disguise to see that they were watchful on their posts he had a peculiar passion for architecture which he gratified in building restoring and ornamenting many cities in his dominions hindia bijanagur and gircoon were built in his reign he was also much addicted to women whom he collected into his haram from all parts twice every year he made a grand festival to which thousands of musicians and singers crowded for his entertainment this festival continued for the space of forty days in which nothing went on but dancing singing and debauchery the company on the breaking up of the assembly were presented each with a dress and other presents according to their rank in this luxurious manner he reigned fifty years  to return to the history of kinnoge after the expulsion of callian chund the kingdom of kinnoge remained in anarchy to the days of basdeo basdeo reduces bahar and bengal who having mounted the throne recovered bahar and bengal which had revolted and began to restore the power and authority of his kingdom the king of persia comes in disguise to hindostan a d  byram gore king of iran at that time came in disguise to hindostan in the character of a merchant to inform himself of the power government and manners of that country when he was entering the city of kinnoge it is related that a wild elephant attacked him who in the season of lust had rushed from the woods killing and destroying all who came in his way byram gore pierced the elephants forehead with an arrow by which he acquired great fame and popularity this circumstance having reached the ears of the king he was desirous of seeing the merchant and ordered him to be brought into his presence is discovered when one of the nobles who had gone to the court of iran some years before with the tribute discovered him to basdeo who being perfectly assured of the truth descended from his throne and embraced him  treated with magnificence byram gore being constrained to assume his proper character he was treated with the utmost magnificence and respect while he remained at the court of kinnoge where he married the daughter of basdeo and returned in a short time to iran basdeo and the princes his posterity are said to have ruled the empire for eighty years ramdeo the country being torn to pieces by a civil war which arose between the descendants of basdeo ramdeo who had been general of the forces excluded the royal line from the throne and by consent of the nobility and troops took the supreme authority into his own hands  section xv of the reign of ramdeo rhator a d     ramdeo was of the tribe of rhator a prince bold wise and generous the first thing he did on his accession was to exterminate by degrees the chiefs and rajas who assumed independency and raised factions in the empire then he advanced with his army toward marvar and recovered that country from the tribe of cutchwa whom he dispossessed and peopled it with that of rhator from which time they have possessed it these are the mahrattas who at present make such a figure in india  the tribe of cutchwa was sent to the precincts of rhotas which they still inhabit his great actions ramdeo rhator after these transactions returned and marched toward lucknouti which he took and gave to his nephew here great wealth fell into his hands and after an expedition of three years he returned to kinnoge where he remained two years and then marched his army toward malava which he conquered and putting it in the hands of his vizier ordered many cities and towns to be built in that province having repaired the fort of narvar he appointed one of his kinsmen governor and demanded the daughter of the raja of bijanagur in marriage who fearing the power of ramdeo complied he remained in the city of gundwara two years where he slew many of the rebellious zemindars then returning to kinnoge spent seven years in festivity and pleasure  ramdeo afterward went unto the mountains of sawalic and reduced all the rajas of those parts particularly the raja of comaoon whose ancestors according to the fabulous history of the hindoos had reigned there ten thousand years this raja had drawn together a powerful army with which he engaged ramdeo in several great battles so that for some time the war was doubtful at length the fortune of ramdeo prevailed and the raja of comaoon was forced to abandon his wealth and take refuge in the inaccessible mountains the mountains of comaoon lie about two hundred miles north from delhi  his wives and daughters fell into the hands of ramdeo who having softened him to compassion he restored to the raja his country and turned his face toward nagracut plundering the country till he reached scutdimmindi there he halted out of respect to the temple of bowani bowani is one of the names of the goddess pirkirti concerning whom see the dissertation prefixed to this history  which was built near the sort of nagracut sending a person to call the raja before him the raja afraid for his life delayed for some time till he had received proper assurances of personal safety by the mediation of a brahmin and then he waited on the king and exhibited the customs of obedience ramdeo went to pay his adoration to the idol to whom he made rich offerings then retiring demanded the daughter of the raja in marriage for his son and marched to the fort of jummu the raja of jummu being strong in troops and well supplied with money and provisions confiding in the strength of his fort and the inaccessibleness of the roads leading toward it despised the summons of the king and refused to bend to his commands preparing himself for war but in the first encounter in the field his irregular troops though singly brave were discomfited before the united powers of the king who driving him within his walls immediately invested the place and storming it in a few days imprisoned what part of the garrison escaped the sword and in the fort found great wealth  the raja having previously fled into the mountains saw no hope but in peace and therefore solicited the mercy of the king ramdeo reinstated him taking one of his daughters for his second son directing his march from thence to the banks of the river nerbet which falls from the mountains of cashmire into the districts of punjaab he traversed the country of hindostan to the salt sea of bengal where the great mountains of sewalic press upon the ocean he accomplished this march in five months having reduced near five hundred disobedient rajas and zemindars he plundered them of their wealth and then turned his victorious standards toward his capital of kinnoge which he entered in pomp and triumph  he soon after prepared a magnificent festival and divided the spoil among his soldiers the share of each being forty pieces of gold besides a third part of the spoil was thrown among the people from this time forward he reposed upon the throne of ease and magnificence nor ever afterward mounted the horse of war to hunt for further conquests dies after he had reigned fifty four years he followed his ancestors to the unknown world from whence none return but the great actions of his life rendered his fame immortal for among the kings of hindostan we are told by historians that few have rivalled the greatness of ramdeo he was cotemporary with firose sassa father of keikubad to whom he paid tribute  section xvi of the reign of partab chund a d  00 upon the death of ramdeo enmity broke out among his children so that nothing but war slaughter and death raged in the plains of hindostan in a short time the great treasures which he had amassed were expended and desolation began to appear in the streets partab chund the general of ramdeo whose name was partab chund taking advantage of these family factions gained confidence and popularity among the troops he accordingly marched against the capital and reduced it in a few days his first care was to extirpate the royal family that his power might be firmly established then drawing many of the rajas by fair but false promises into his power he cut off the most formidable by which means the rest became obedient to his commands neglects to pay the tribute to the persians this prince by an uninterrupted course of success began at length to devour the wind of pride and neglected for some years to send the annual tribute to iran returning the ambassadors of noshirwaan with empty hands and dishonor from his court is forced to pay it this usage provoked the resentment of the king of iran and he sent an army against partab chund which having conquered and ravaged the countries of cabul and punjaab threw him into great confusion he therefore was forced to pay up his arrears to advance the tribute of the ensuing year and to make promises of future obedience  the empire declines after the death of partab chund several of the neighboring rajas gaining power formed independent governments and left but a small part of the country in the hands of the heirs of the empire insomuch that they lost the title of rajas or kings and had that of rana substituted in its place yet they possessed the mountains of combilmere and the adjacent countries of chitor and mindusur till they were conquered by the successors of timur  section xvii of annindeo maldeo and the dissolution of the empire annindeo annindeo was of the sect of bise who upon the death of partab chund seized upon the country of malava reduces the manhattas etc a d     and with rapidity of conquest brought narvalla the country of the marhattas and the whole territory of berar into the circle of his obedience to secure these conquests he built the forts of mahor rumgiri and mundo dies he was cotemporary with chusero king of persia purvese and died after a reign of sixteen years maldeo about this time a person whose name was maldeo of obscure original from the country of duaab raised himself to great power and collecting a numerous army took the city of delhi from the descendants of partab chund then directing his march to kinnoge soon reduced that capital to his obedience which at that time we are told was so populous that there were in the city thirty thousand shops in which arreca a kind of nut which the hindoos use as the europeans do tobacco was sold and sixty thousand sets of musicians and singers who paid a tax to the government from which we may judge of the amazing extent of this city empire of the hindoos dissolved maldeo at the end of fortytwo years died and as he had no issue every petty raja rendered himself independent from that time forward no imperial raja ruled hindostan for when sultan mahmood giznavi invaded that country who was the first of the islamite conquerors he found it divided into small states kinnoge was governed by one raja korrah merat by hirdit mahvin by calchunder lahor by jeipal the son of hitpal and callinger by begera malava ajmere guzarat and gualier had each their distinct rajas who were perfectly independent of one another for this reason we shall quit the history of the rajas and begin with that of the conquest of the islamites the mahommedans in hindostan  part ii the history of the empire of ghizni section i of the first appearance of the star of islamism a metaphorical expression for the mahommedan faith in hindostan together with a summary account of those mahommedans by whom the empire of ghizni was formed first invasion of hindostan by the mahommedans to minds enlightened like the sun let it not remain a secret that the first person of the faith who placed his foot within the boundaries of hindostan was mohlib the son of abiul sukur the particulars of his history are these in the twentyeighth year of the higerah abdulla the son of amir governor of bussorah by the command of osman led an army toward pharis against the sovereign of that kingdom who had revolted upon the death of omar abdulla reduced his enemy to obedience and returned victorious to bussorah in the thirtieth of the higerah osman turned olid okbah on account of his continuing to drink wine from the government of kusa which he conferred upon seid ben ul ass that commander marched the same year toward tibiristan accompanied by the two sons of ali hassen and hassein and conquered the country of jirju whose capital is ashtrabad where he raised a contribution of forty thousand dinars abdulla ben amir ruler of bussorah on the part of osman in the thirtyfirst of the higerah marched to the conquest of chorrasan by the way of kirman and having reduced that country seistan keistan neshapoor sirchush herat badyeish ghore girghistan murve talickan and balich he entered into a treaty with a king of the northern regions whose name was joos having appointed keis ben hanim to the government of chorrasan hanif ben keis to the superintendency of murve talickan and neshapoor and chalid ben abdulla to that of herat ghore and gerghistan he himself being bent on a pilgrimage to caba marched back by the way of hujage  in the thirtythird year abdul reiman by order of osman having marched with an army against balich he and all his troops became martyrs to the faith except a few who escaped the sword and fled by the way of gilan sharon who was an omrah of agim seeing that abdulla ben amir had gone a pilgrimage to mecca and that the plains of chorrasan were clear of persians and mussulmen raised in the same year an army of forty thousand men from jibbis herat badyeish ghore keistan and the adjacent countries and fell upon the mussulmen but abdulla hazim who was at neshapoor with hanif with four thousand horse attacked and defeated him for which service he was afterward rewarded with the government of chorrasan  in the fortyfourth year of the higerah mavia ben abessifian advanced zeiad ben abiera to the government of bussorah chorrasan and seistan and in that year abdul reiman ben summera according to the orders of zeiad conquered the country of cabul and bound them over to obedience  mohlib about the same time mohlib ben abul sukur who was a great omrah of arab by the way of murve invaded cabul and zabul enters hindostan then entering hindostan made war upon the idolators ravaging the country of limgan and its dependencies and with twelve thousand captives returned to chorrasan a few of the inhabitants of hind were converted at that time to the belief of the unity of god and the embassy of his holy prophet  in the fiftythird of the higerah zuad governor of bussorah died in consequence of a wound in his finger and mavia gave the government of kufa to abdulla his son abdulla led his troops against the country of maver ul near which he conquered and returned to kufa after which he got the government of bussorah and appointed aslim ben zerait ul gulabi to the government of chorrasan but in the year fiftysix mavia gave that appointment to seid ben osman affan and again in the year fiftynine that government was changed into the hands of abdul reiman ben zeiad  in the sixtysecond of the higerah zeid ben mavia appointed zillim ben ziad to rule over chorrasan and seistan among the chiefs who attended him was mohlib ben abiull sukur this zillim when he had seated himself in the government gave his brother izid the government of seistan who hearing that the king of cabul had imprisoned abu abida his brother who had been collecting the tribute he raised an army and marched toward him but after an obstinate battle he was defeated and lost the greatest part of his army  intelligence of this defeat coming to zillim he sent tilla ben abudulla to cabul who ransomed abuabida for five thousand dirms he then set aside his brother and gave the government of seistan to tilla who sent the troops of ghore and badyeish to cabul and by that means reduced that country to obedience and conferred the government upon chaled ben abdulla this chaled ben abdulla being ordered some time thereafter to return back and give an account of his administration fearing the oppression of new rulers with his family wealth and friends fled to the mountains of soliman which extend between moultan and peshawir and there took up his abode he married his daughter to one of the chiefs of the afghans who was a mussulman from this marriage sprung many children two of whom became famous load and soor from whom the two great tribes of that name derive their origin origin of the afgans in the history of muttelu ul anwar which is wrote by an author of good authority it is related that the afghans are of the race of the cibthi copts or egyptians  who were ruled by pharaoon pharaoh  and being expelled about the time of moses took up their residence in those mountains  but to return to our history we are told that this small colony under caled began to employ themselves in the cultivation of their grounds and in breeding of cattle when therefore mahumud casim by the way of sind came to moultan he remained some time among them and was hospitably entertained  in the one hundred and fortythird of the higerah when they began to multiply exceedingly they issued from their hills and possessed themselves of kirman peshawir and shinwaran raja of lahore designs to humble them but is worsted in the mean time the raja of lahore who was in alliance with the raja of ajmere entered into a design to humble them and sent one of his omrahs against them but the omrah was worsted and lost many of his men upon which the raja sent his nephew with an additional force of two thousand horse and five thousand foot  the mussulmen of cabul chillige and chore hearing of these hostilities against their brethren sent four thousand horse to the assistance of the afgans so that in the space of five months above seventy different battles and skirmishes were fought with various success is forced to retreat when winter came on the troops of hindostan unable to bear the inclemency of the weather were forced to retreat but returned again in the spring the two armies met between kirman and peshawir where a battle was fought in which the right wing of each army was victorious sues for a peace the raja of lahore finding at last that he could not reduce them was obliged to conclude a peace  a war broke out at that time between the raja of lahore and the tribe of gicker who entered into an alliance with the afgans or patans which obliged the raja to accommodate matters and give up several districts to the patans the tribe of chillige entered in the mean time into treaty with them in which the patans guarantied the boundaries of hindostan against any foreign invasion by the way of iran to be able to fulfill the terms of this treaty they built the fort of cheiber in the passes of the mountains which obliged the troops of samania to invade hind by the way of sind and battia  buctagi ommander of he troops of ghizni when the government of ghizni ghizni was at that time a province of the empire of bochara fell to abistagi his general whose name was subuctagi made some incursions into limgan and moultan carrying off plunder and slaves and the patans not being able to cope with him in the field sent an embassy to jeipal jeipal seems to have been the name of two or three successive rajas of lahore raja of lahore for assistance when jeipal understood that his troops could not subsist in the winter season in those cold regions he called sheck amid who was chief of the afgans conferred the title of general upon him and made over some countries of moultan and limgan to enable him to carry on the war  succeeds to the government abistagi dying about this time mahmud subuctagi succeeded him and shech amid finding it unadviseable to carry on the war sent an ambassador to him to propose terms of accommodation giving him to understand that as they were brethren of the same faith he was in hopes he would henceforth consider the afgans as his friends upon which conditions he might pass with his army unmolested toward hindostan defeats jeipal subuctagi gladly embraced this proposal and marching against jeipal defeated him and gave shul ameid the government of moultan the afgans reduced by mamood but sultan mahmood the son of subuctagi in the absence and contrary to the policy of his father made war upon the afgans and cut off many of their chiefs bending the rest to the yoke of his commands  section ii the reign of nasir uldien subuctagi the founder of the empire of ghizni a d     higer     subuctagi though the valiant subuctagi never crossed the river of nilaab nor attained to the government of punjaab yet authors have conferred upon him the honor of being the first mahommedan king of lahore his family and rise under abistagi subuctagi was originally a turkish slave and having fallen into the hands of abistagi was from a low degree in the reign of samania king of bochara  raised to the most considerable dignities of the kingdom being appointed to the government of chorrassan where he acquired great renown when abdul mallick the son of samania died the omrahs of bochara sent an embassy to abistagi to consult with him about a successor he told them that munsur the son of abdul mallick was as yet but a child and no ways capable of sustaining the weight of government he therefore advised them to elect his uncle but before the return of the ambassadors the omrahs had advanced munsur to the throne who hearing of the advice given by abistagi commanded that general back to bochara abistagi revolts from the empire of bochara but abistagi fearing the young kings resentment refused to comply he wisely considered that peaceable measures would only be to him the means of ruin and he forthwith stood behind his disobedience with thirty thousand men  in the three hundred and fiftyfirst of the higerah he directed his march toward ghizni and having subdued that country by the edge of the sword he exalted his standard of royalty that is assumed the title of king  in the mean time munsur hearing that abistagi had left chorrassan almost totally destitute of troops ordered abul hassen to march with an army that way but he was interrupted in his rout by abistagi who gave him two signal defeats and obliged him to fly into bochara secures to himself ghizni and chorassan abistagi immediately obtained the peaceable sovereignty of the kingdoms of ghizni and chorrassan during the fifteen years of the reign of abistagi he had employed subuctagi who had raised himself by his valor to make depredations upon the rajas of hind whom he plundered of much wealth  is succeeded by his son when abistagi in the year three hundred and sixtyfive departed into the regions of eternity his son abu isaac invaded bochara in which expedition subuctagi enjoyed the chief command munsur king of bochara being worsted in some engagements a peace was concluded in which it was stipulated that abu isaac should continue to enjoy the regency of ghizni under the direction of subuctagi  who dies abu isaac being very young and addicted to pleasure he readily entrusted subuctagi with the whole administration of affairs the voluptuous king traveled soon the road of mortality and the omrahs a d     higer     of ghizni who admired the wisdom and bravery of subuctagi unanimously elected him their king in the year three hundred and sixtyseven the reign of abu isaac continuing only for two years subuctagi succeeds him a good prince when subuctagi ascended the throne he married the daughter of abistagi and turning his mind wholly upon the art of government he soon established justice in his dominions and held the hearts of his subjects in his hand there was at this time a governor in the fort of bust of the name of tigha who was expelled by another chief called bab toor tigha who was an independent zemindar on the borders of ghizni upon losing his fort and country came and laid his complaint before the king promising him tribute and obedience if subuctagi should restore him to his dignity  aids tigha the king gave a favorable answer and sent an army against bab toor drove that chief from his new conquests and put tigha in quiet possession of his country who is ungrateful but tigha no sooner found himself possessed of his inheritance than he neglected all his promises to the king and never once thought of sending his tribute subuctagi perceived this ingratitude but he dissembled his resentment making soon after the circuit of his dominions when he came near the territories of tigha he invited him to the chase finding himself alone with tigha the king took that opportunity to upbraid him with his ingratitude tigha who was a daring and impetuous man put his hand on his sword on which the king also drew but in the combat was wounded in the hand  defeated immediately a crowd of attendants poured in upon them when a short but fierce conflict insued wherein tigha and his adherents were soon put to slight and so closely pursued by the troops of subuctagi that they entered the fort at his heels tigha leaped over the wall and fled toward kirman  a d     higer     it was here that subuctagi met with abul fatti who in the art of writing and in the knowledge of the sciences had no equal he had been formerly secretary to bab toor and on his defeat had retired to enjoy his studies subuctagi hearing of him called him into his presence and having obtained proofs of his great abilities made him his secretary and dignified him with honorable titles in that station abul fatti remained till the accession of sultan mamood when he retired in disgust to turkistan  subuctagi invades hindostan amir subuctagi having conquered bust turned toward kusdar and taking the chief of that place prisoner added his territory to his own dominions giving the government of it to actass he soon after resolved upon a war with the idolators of hindostan and toward the close of the year three hundred and sixtyseven which was the first of his reign he undertook that expedition and having ravaged part of the countries of cabul and punjaab he founded some mosques and returned to ghizni with great treasures  jeipal the son of hitpal the brahmin ruled at this time the country extending from sirhind to limghaan and from cashmire to moultan and kept his court at lahore advances against jeipal jeipal finding he could have no rest from the incursions of the mussulmen raised a great army with intent to invade them in their own country which subuctagi hearing put his army in motion and marched out to meet him the kings drew near one another at limghaan on the boundaries of their respective dominions they skirmished for a few days and sultan mamood though then a boy gave such signal proofs of his courage that he drew tears of joy from the eyes of his father  a miraculous storm historians whose credulity exceed their wisdom have told us that on this occasion a certain person informed the king that in a d     higer     the camp of jeipal there was a spring into which if a small quantity of a certain drug called casurat should be thrown the sky would immediately be overcast and a dreadful storm of hail and wind arise subuctagi having accordingly ordered this to be done the effects became visible for immediately the sky loured and thunder lightning wind and hail began turning the day into darkness and spreading horror and desolation around insomuch that a great part of the cavalry were killed and some thousands of both armies perished but the troops of ghizni being more hardy than those of hindostan suffered not so much upon this occasion which induces jeipal to sue for peace jeipal in the morning found his army in such weakness and dejection by the effects of this storm which was rather natural than the work of magic that fearing subuctagi would take advantage of his condition he sent heralds to treat of a peace he offered to the king of ghizni a certain tribute and a considerable present in elephants and gold  subuctagi was not displeased with these terms but his son sultan mamood who was an ambitious young man fearing this would put an end to his expedition prevailed with his father to reject the proposal jeipal upon this told him that the customs of the rajaputs were of such a nature that if he persisted in distressing them it must make him in the end pay very dear for his victories upon such occasions and when reduced to extremity said jeipal they murder their wives and children set fire to their houses set loose their hair and rushing in despair among the enemy drown themselves in the crimson torrent of revenge subuctagi hearing of this custom he was afraid to reduce them to despair and consented to let them retreat upon their paying a million of dirms and presenting him with fifty elephants jeipal not being able to discharge the whole of this sum in camp he desired that some persons of trust a d     higer     on the part of subuctagi should accompany him to lahore to receive the balance for whose safety subuctagi took hostages  his perfidy jeipal having arrived at lahore and finding subuctagi had returned home imprisoned his messengers and refused to pay the money it was then customary among the rajas in affairs of moment to assemble the double council which consisted of an equal number of the most respectable brahmins who sat on the right side of the throne and of the noblest kittries who sat on the left when they saw that jeipal proceeded to such an impolitic measure they entreated the king saying that the consequence of this step would bring ruin and distress upon the country the troops said they have not yet forgot the terror of their enemys arms and jeipal may rest assured that a conqueror will never brook such an indignity it was therefore the opinion of the double council to comply strictly with the terms of the peace that the people might enjoy the blessings of tranquillity but the king was obstinate and would not hearken to their advice  intelligence of what was done soon reached the ears of subuctagi like a foaming torrent he hastened toward hindostan with a numerous army to take revenge upon jeipal for his treacherous behavior renews the war jeipal also collected his forces and marched forth to meet him for the neighboring rajas considering themselves interested in his success supplied him with troops and money the rajas of delhi ajmere callinger and kinnoge were now bound in his alliance and jeipal found himself at the head of an army of a hundred thousand horse and two hundred thousand foot with which he marched with full assurance of victory  when the moving armies approached each other subuctagi ascended a hill to view the forces of jeipal which he beheld like a a d     higer     shoreless sea and in number like the ants or the locusts but he looked upon himself as a wolf among a flock of goats calling therefore together his chiefs he encouraged them to glory and honored them distinctly with his commands his troops though few in number he divided into squadrons of five hundred each which he ordered one after another to the attack in a circle so that a continual round of fresh troops harrassed the indian army  and is defeated the hindoos being worse mounted than the cavalry of subuctagi could effect nothing against them so that wearied out with this manner of fighting confusion became visible amongst them subuctagi perceiving their disorder sounded a general charge so that they fell like corn before the hands of the reaper and were pursued with great slaughter to the banks of the river nilaab where many who had escaped the edge of the sword perished by their fear in the waters  subuctagi acquired in this action much glory and wealth for besides the rich plunder of the hindoo camp he raised great contributions in the countries of limghaan and peshawir and annexed them to his own dominions joined them to his titles and stamped their names as was customary upon his coins one of his omrahs with three thousand horse was appointed to the government of peshawir and the afghans who resided among the mountains having promised allegiance he entertained some thousands of them in his army and returned victorious to ghizni  subuctagi solicited for aid by the king of bochara amir no samani king of bochara being at this time hard pressed by faeck sent abu niser pharsi to subuctagi to beg his assistance subuctagi was moved by gratitude to the family of bochara and hastened with his army toward maverulnere while amir no advanced to the country of sirchush to meet him subuctagi a d     higer     upon account of his age sent a messenger to amir no to excuse his lighting from his horse but when he advanced and recognized the features of his royal father in the face of the young prince he could not suppress the emotions of his heart he leaped from his horse and run to kiss his stirrup which the young king perceiving prevented him by dismounting and receiving him in his embrace at this happy interview the flower of joy bloomed in every face and such a knot of friendship was bound as can hardly be paralleled in any age  as the season was now too far advanced for action it was agreed that subuctagi should return during the winter to ghizni and prepare his forces to act in conjunction with those of amir no in the spring but when amir ali sumjure prince of chorassan at whose court faek was then in treaty heard of the alliance formed between amir no and subuctagi he began to fear the consequence of his engagement with faeck he asked his council where he should take protection in case fortune which was seldom to be depended upon should desert his standards in war they replied that the situation of affairs required he should endeavor to gain the alliance of fuchier ul dowla prince of jirja jaffier zul karmin was accordingly appointed ambassador to the court of jirja with presents of every thing that was valuable and curious and in a short time a treaty of friendship and alliance was settled between the two powers  the confederates join their armies subuctagi in the mean time put his troops in motion and marched toward balich where amir no joined him with his forces from bochara the rebel faeck and abu ali sumjure hearing of this junction with consent of dara the general of fuchir ul dowla willami marched out of herat in great pomp and magnificence subuctagi pitched his camp in an extensive plain where he waited for the enemy they soon appeared in his front he drew out his army in order of battle and took post in the center with his son sultan mamood and amir no  a d     higer     in the first charge the troops of the enemy came forward with great violence and bravery and pressed so hard upon the flanks of subuctagi that both wings began to give ground and the whole army was upon the point of being defeated but dara ben kabus the general of fuchir ul dowla charging the center where subuctagi in person led on his troops with great bravery as soon as he had got near threw his shield upon his back which was a signal of friendship and riding up to the king begged he would accept of his services he then returned with the few who had accompanied him and immediately brought over his troops to the side of subuctagi facing round on his deserted friends who were astonished at this unexpected treachery defeat the rebels subuctagi took immediate advantage of their confusion charged them home and soon put their whole army to flight pursuing them with great slaughter and taking many prisoners  thus the unfortunate man who had exalted the spear of enmity against his sovereign lost his honor and his wealth a tenth of which might have maintained him and his family in splendour and happiness for life  faeck and abu ali took in their flight the way of neshapoor with the scattered remains of their army amir no and subuctagi entered forthwith the city of herat where they remained a few days to refresh their troops and divide the spoil subuctagi after this signal victory received the title of nasir ul dein or the supporter of the faith and his son mamood was dignified with that of seif al dowla or the sword of fortune by amir no whom he still acknowledged as emperor though his power had been greatly diminished at this period  a d     higer     amir no after these transactions directed his march to bochara and subuctagi and his son sultan mamood turned their faces toward neshapoor faeck and abu ali fled into jirja and took protection with fucher ul dowla the country being thus cleared of the enemy subuctagi returned to ghizni while his son sultan mamood remained at neshapoor with a small force mamood the son of subuctagi defeated faeck and abu ali seizing upon this opportunity collected all their forces marched toward mamood and before he could receive any assistance from amir no or his father he was compelled to an engagement in which he was defeated and lost all his baggage  subuctagi comes to the aid of his son subuctagi hearing of the situation of his son hastened toward neshapoor and in the districts of toos meeting with abul ali and faeck engaged them without delay in the heat of the action a great dust was seen to rise in the rear of abul ali which proved to be sultan mamood and faeck and abul ali finding they would soon be attacked on both sides made a resolute charge against subuctagi which was so well received that they were obliged to give ground the rebels are again totally overthrown sultan mamood arriving at that instant attacked them like an angry lion and they unable to support the contest turned their face to flight and took refuge in the fort of killat  a d     higer     subuctagi dies subuctagi after this victory according to his hearts desire reposed upon the musnud of empire till in the year     which was the   th of his age death overtook him in the town of turmuz near balich  subuctagi reigned twenty years fourteen kings of his race held after him lahore and the countries adjacent within the circle of their command the vizier of subuctagi was abul abas fazil ben amud ispherai who was a great minister in the management of both civil and military affairs the author of the jam ul hickaiat relates a d     higer     his character that subuctagi was at first a private horseman in the service of abistagi and being of a vigorous and active disposition used to hunt every day in the forest it happened one time as he employed himself in this amusement that he saw a deer grazing with her young fawn upon which spurring his horse he seized the fawn and tying his legs laid him across his saddle and turned his face toward his home when he had rode a little way he looked behind and beheld the mother of the fawn following him and exhibiting every mark of extreme affliction the soul of subuctagi melted within him into pity he untied the feet of the fawn and generously restored him to his liberty the happy mother turned her face to the wilderness but often looked back upon subuctagi and the tears dropped fast from her eyes  subuctagi is said to have seen that night a figure or apparition in his dream who said to him that generosity and compassion which you have this day shown to a distressed animal has been approved of in the presence of god therefore in the records of providence the kingdom of ghizni is marked as a reward against thy name but let not greatness destroy your virtue but thus continue your benevolence to men  it is said in the masir ul maluck that sultan mamood his son having built a pleasure house in an elegant garden near the city of ghizni he invited his father when it was finished to a magnificent entertainment which he had prepared for him the son in the joy of his heart desired the opinion of subuctagi concerning the house and garden which were esteemed admirable in taste and structure the old man to the great disappointment of mamood told him that he looked upon the whole as a bauble which any of his sbjects might have raised by the means of wealth but that it was the business of a prince to erect the more durable structure of good same which might a d     higer     stand for ever to be imitated but never to be equalled by posterity the great poet nizami makes upon this saying the following reflection of all the magnificent palaces which we are told sultan mamood built we now find not one stone upon another but the edifice of his fame as he was told by his father still triumphs over time and seems established on a lasting foundation  section iii the reign of amir ismaiel ben nasir ul dien subuctagi a d     higer     ismaiel succeeds his father subuctagi subuctagi dying suddenly and his eldest son sultan mamood being at neshapoor which was a considerable distance from the place of the kings decease amir ismaiel prevailed with his father in his last moments to appoint him to succeed till the return of his brother the reason assigned for this demand was to prevent other usurpations which were then feared in the government ismaiel therefore immediately upon the demise of his father was crowned with great solemnity at balich to gain popularity ismaiel opened the treasury and distributed the greatest part of his fathers wealth in presents to the nobility and in expensive shows and entertainments to the people he also augmented the pay of the troops and rewarded small services with the hand of prodigality  this policy being overacted had not the desired effect the nobility perceiving that all this generality proceeded from the fear of his brother ungenerously increased their demands while the troops puffed up with pride by his indulgences begun to be mutinous disorderly and debauched  a d     higer     mamoods behavior upon his brothers accession when intelligence was brought to mamood of the death of his father and the accession of his younger brother he wrote to ismaiel by the hand of abul hassen in this letter he said thus that since the death of his royal father he held none upon earth so dear as his beloved brother amir ismaiel whom he would oblige to the full extent of his power but that the art of government required years experience wisdom and knowledge in the affairs of state which ismaiel could not possibly pretend to possess though subuctagi had appointed him to succeed to the throne in the absence of mamood he therefore advised ismael seriously to consider the matter to distinguish propriety from impropriety and to give up his title to government without further dispute which would restore him to the love and generosity of mamood for that it was his original intention to confer upon ismaiel the governments of balich and chorassan  war between the brothers amir ismaiel shut his ears against all the proposals of his brother and prepared for his own security turning the edge of the sword of enmity against him sultan mamood saw no remedy but in war and attaching his uncle bujerac and his brother nisir to his interest advanced with his standards toward ghizni while amir ismaiel hastened also from balich to oppose him when the two armies approached toward one another sultan mamood took great pains to avoid coming to extremities and in vain tried to reconcile matters in an amicable manner he was therefore forced to form his troops in order of battle while amir ismaiel also extended the lines of war which he supported by a chain of elephants both armies unsheathing their steel commenced such a slaughter that the swords wept blood sultan mamood at length charged the center of the enemy with such fury that they trembled as with an earthquake and turned their faces to slight taking refuge in the citadel of ghizni thither the conqueror pursued them and immediately invested the a d     higer     ismaiel defeated and taken place such a prodigious number of the runaways had crowded into ghizni that for want of provisions amir ismaiel was reduced to the necessity of treating about a surrender having therefore received promises of safety he submitted himself and delivered up the keys of the garrison and the treasury to sultan mamood  mamood having appointed a new ministry and regulated the government of the country proceeded with his army toward balich it is said that a few days after the submission of amir ismaiel he was asked by his brother what he intended to have done with him had his better fortune prevailed to which ismaiel replied that he intended to have imprisoned him for life in some castle and to indulge him with every pleasure but his liberty is imprisoned and dies upon which sultan mamood made no reflections at that time but soon after confined him in the fort of georghan in the manner that he himself had intimated where he remained till his death which happened not long after his being deposed  section iv the history of the reign of amin ul muluc emin ul dowla sultan mamood ghiznavi from his accession to the year  0  a d     higer     accession of mamood his character we are told by historians that sultan mamood was a king who conferred happiness upon the world and reflected glory upon the faith of mahomed that the day of his accession illuminated the earth with the bright torch of justice and cherished it with the beams of beneficence others inform us that in his disposition a d     higer     the sordid vice of avarice found place which however could not darken the other bright qualities of his mind a certain poet says that his wealth was like a pearl in the shell but as poets hunt after wit rather than truth therefore we must judge of mamood by his actions from which it appears that he was indeed a prince of great economy but that he never withheld his generosity upon a just and proper occasion we have the testimony of the fatti bilad wrote by abu nisir muscati and of the famous abul fazil that no king had ever more learned men at his court kept a finer army or displayed more magnificence than sultan mamood all these things could not be done without expense so that the stigma of avarice must have been owing to two particular circumstances of his life which ought by no means to have stamped his general character with that sordid vice  the two circumstances in a few words were these having a great propensity to poetry in which he made some tolerable progress himself he promised sheck phirdoci a golden mher a mher is about fourteen rupees this coin was called mher from having a sun stamped upon it mher signifies  in the persian for every verse of an heroic poem which he was desirous to patronize under the protection of this promise that divine poet wrote the unparalleled poem called the shaw namma which consisted of sixty thousand couplets when he presented it to the king he repented of his promise telling the poet that he thought sixty thousand rupees might satisfy him for a work which he seemed to have performed with so much ease and expedition phirdoci justly offended at this indignity could never be brought to accept of any reward though sultan mamood would after reflection have gladly paid him the sum originally stipulated the poet however took ample revenge in a satire of seven hundred couplets which he wrote upon that occasion  a d     higer     his person sultan mamood who it is reported was defective in external appearance said one day observing himself in a glass the sight of a king should brighten the eyes of the beholders but nature has been so capricious to me that my aspect seems the picture of misfortune the vizier replied it is not one of ten thousand who are blessed with a sight of your majestys countenance but your virtues are diffused over all but to proceed with our history  we have already observed that the father of sultan mamood was subuctagi his mother was a princess of the house of zabulstan for which reason she is known by the name of zabuli he was born in the year     of the higerah and as the astrologers say with many happy omens expressed in the heroscope of his fate subuctagi being asleep at the time of his birth dreamed that he beheld a green tree springing forth from his chimney which threw its shadow over the face of the earth and screened from the storms of heaven the whole animal creation his justice this indeed was verified by the justice of mamood for if we can believe the poet in his reign the wolf and the sheep drank together at the same brook a golden mine in the first month of his reign a vein of gold resembling a tree of three cubits in circumference was found in seistan which yielded pure gold till the reign of sultan musaood when it was lost in consequence of an earthquake  mamoods complaint to munsur king of bochara is ill received when sultan mamood had settled his dispute with his brother he hastened to balich from whence he sent an ambassador to amir munsur emperor of bochara complaining of the indignity which he met with in the appointment of buctusin to the regency of chorrassan it was returned to him for answer that he was already in possession of the territories of balich turmuz and herat which held of the empire and that there was a necessity to divide the favors of bochara among her friends buctusin it was also insinuated had been a faithful and good servant  a d     higer     but sultan mamood not discouraged by this answer sent abul hassen jemmavi with rich presents to the court of bochara and a letter in the following terms that he hoped the pure spring of friendship which had flowed in the time of his father should not now be polluted with the ashes of indignity nor he himself reduced to the necessity of divesting himself of that obedience which he had hitherto paid to the imperial family of samania  when abul hassen delivered his embassy his capacity and elocution appeared so great to the emperor that desirous to gain him over to his interest by any means he bribed him at last with the honors of the vizarit the office of vizier  but never returned an answer to mamood sultan mamood having received information of this transaction through necessity turned his face toward neshapoor and buctusin advised of his intention abandoned the city and sent the emperor intelligence of his situation war between mamood and munsur amir munsur upon this exalted the imperial standard and in the rashness of inexperienced youth hastened toward chorrassan and halted not till he arrived at sirchus sultan mamood though he well knew that amir munsur was in no condition to oppose him yet gratitude to the imperial family of samania wrought so much upon his mind that ashamed of measuring spears with his lord he evacuated the country of neshapoor and marched to murghab the eyes of munsur put out by his own officers buctusin in the mean time treacherously entered into a confederacy with faeck and forming a conspiracy in the camp of amir munsur seized upon the person of that prince and cruelly put out his eyes abdul the younger brother of munsur who was but a boy was advanced by the traitors to the throne being however afraid of the resentment of sultan mamood the conspirators hastened to murve whither they were pursued by the sultan with great expedition finding themselves upon their march hard a d     higer   0 pressed in the rear by mamood they halted and gave him battle they are overthrown by mamood but the sin of ingratitude had darkened the face of their fortune so that the gales of victory blew upon the standards of sultan mamood faeck carried off the young king and fled to bochara and buctusin was not heard of for some time but at length he found his way to faeck and begun to collect his scattered troops faeck in the mean time fell sick and soon went into the regions of death elich chan seizing upon the opportunity offered him by that event marched with an army from kashgar to bochara and rooted abdul mallick and his adherents out of the empire and the soil of life the royal family of bochara extirpated thus the prosperity of the house of samania which had continued for the space of one hundred and twentyseven years to illuminate the firmament of empire set for ever in darkness  sultan mamood at this juncture employed himself in settling the government of the countries of balich and chorrassan which he regulated in such a manner as to exalt the voice of his fame so high that it reached the ears of the calipha of bagdat al kadir billa abbassi the calipha sent him a rich chelat chelat signifies an honorary dress  such as he had never before bestowed on any king and dignified mamood with the titles of amin ul muluck emin ul dowla the protector of the state and the treasurer of fortune   in the end of the month zicada in the year three hundred and ninety the sultan hastened from balich to herat and from herat to seistan where he defeated chiliph ben amid the governor of bochara and returned to ghizni mamoods first expedition to hindostan he then turned his face to hindostan took many forts and countries in which having settled his own governors he again returned to his dominions where he spread the carpet of justice so smoothly upon the face of the earth that the love of him and loyalty gained place in every heart having at the a d  000 higer     same time set a treaty on foot with elich chan he had the province of mavirul nere ceded to him for which he made an ample return in presents of great value and the strictest friendship and greatest familiarity for a long time subsisted between the kings  his second expedition to hindostan sultan mamood having made a vow that if ever he should be blessed with tranquillity in his own dominions he would turn his arms against the idolators of hindostan marched in the year three hundred and ninetyone from ghizni with ten thousand of his chosen horse and came to peshawir where jeipal raja of lahere  with twelve thousand horse and thirty thousand foot supported by three hundred chainelephants opposed him on saturday the eighth of mohirrim in the three hundred and ninetysecond of the higera an obstinate battle ensued in which sultan mamood was victorious jeipal defeated and taken jeipal with fifteen of his principal friends was taken prisoner and five thousand of his troops lay dead upon the field sultan mamood in this action acquired great fame and wealth for round the neck of jeipal only were found sixteen strings of jewels each of which was valued at one hundred and eighty thousand rupees  after this victory the sultan marched from peshawir and investing the fort of bitinda reduced it and releasing his prisoners upon the payment of a large ransom and a stipulation of an annual tribute returned to ghizni it was in those ages a custom of the hindoos that whatever raja was twice worsted by the mussulmen should be by that disgrace rendered unfit for further command the death of jeipal jeipal in compliance to this custom having raised his son to the government ordered a funeral pile to be prepared upon which he sacrificed himself to his gods  mamoods third expedition to india in the mohirrim of the year three hundred and ninetythree mamood again marched into seistan and brought chiliph who a d  00  higer     had misbehaved in his government prisoner to ghizni finding that the tribute from hindostan had not been paid in the year three hundred ninetyfive he directed his march toward the city of battea and leaving the boundaries of moultan arrived at tahera which was fortified with an exceeding high wall and a deep broad ditch tahera was at that time governed by a raja called bachera who had in the pride of power and wealth greatly molested the mahommedan governors whom the sultan had established in hindostan bachera had also refused to pay his proportion of the tribute to annindpal the son of jeipal of whom he held his authority  when sultan mamood entered the territories of this raja he drew out his troops to receive him and taking possession of strong posts continued to engage the mahommedans for the space of three days in which time they suffered so much that they were on the point of abandoning the attack but on the fourth day sultan mamood spoke at the head of his troops and encouraged them to glory he concluded with telling them that this day he had devoted himself to conquest or to death bachera on his part invoked the gods at the temple and prepared with his former resolution to repel the enemy the mussulmen advanced with great impetuosity but were repulsed with slaughter yet returning with fresh courage and redoubled rage the attack was continued till the evening when sultan mamood turning his face to caba the holy temple of mecca  invoked the aid of the prophet in the presence of his army  advance advance cried then the sultan our prayers have sound favor with god  immediately a great shout arose among the host and the mussulmen pressing forward as if they thirsted for death obliged the enemy to give ground and pursued them to the gates of the town  a d  00  higer     defeats bachera sultan mamood having next morning invested the place gave orders to make preparations for filling up the ditch which in a few days was nearly completed bachera finding he could not long maintain the town determined to leave only a small garrison for its defense and accordingly one night marched out with the rest of his troops and took post in a wood on the banks of the sind the sultan being informed of his retreat detached part of his army to pursue him bachera by this time was deserted by his fortune and by the most of his friends he found himself surrounded by the mussulmen and he attempted in vain to force through them his way who kills himself being just upon the point of being taken prisoner he turned his sword against his breast and the most of his adherents were slaughtered in attempting revenge sultan mamood had in the mean time taken tahera by assault he found there one hundred and twenty elephants many slaves and rich plunder and annexing the town and its dependencies to his own dominions he returned victorious to ghizni  mamoods fourth expedition into india in the year three hundred and ninetysix he formed the design of reconquering moultan which had revolted from his obedience shuh amid lodi the regent of moultan had formerly paid mamood allegiance and after him his grandson abul fat daood till the expedition against raja bachera when he withdrew his loyalty  defeats annindpal raja of lahore the king marched in the beginning of the spring with a great army from ghizni and was met by annindpal the son of jeipal in the hills of peshawir whom he defeated and obliged to fly into cashmire annindpal had entered into an alliance with abul fat and as there were two passes only by which the mahommedans could enter moultan annindpal had taken upon himself to secure that by the way of peshawir which sultan mamood chanced a d  00  higer     to take the sultan returning from the pursuit entered moultan by the way of betinda which was his first intention when abul fat received intelligence of the fate of annindpal thinking himself too weak to keep the field he shut himself up in his fortified places and submissively solicited forgiveness for his faults promised to pay a great tribute and for the future to obey implicitly the sultans commands mamood received him again as a subject and prepared to return to ghizni when news was brought to him from arsilla hajib who commanded at herat that elich chan had invaded his government with an army the sultan hastened to settle the affairs of hindostan which he put into the hands of shockpal an hindoo prince who had been with abu ali sumjure in peshawir and had turned mussulman by the name of zab sais  misunderstanding between mamood and elich chan the particulars of the war of mamood with elich chan are these we have already mentioned that an uncommon friendship had subsisted between this elich chan king of kashgar and sultan mamood the sultan himself was married to the daughter of elich chan but some factious men about the two courts by misrepresentations of the princes to one another changed their former friendship into enmity who invades chorrassan when sultan mamood therefore marched to hindostan and had left the fields of chorrassan almost destitute of troops elich chan took that opportunity and resolved to appropriate that province to himself to accomplish his design he ordered his chief general sipistagi with a great force to enter chorrassan and jaffier tighi at the same time was appointed to command in the territory of balich arsilla hajib the governor of herat being informed of these motions hastened to ghizni that he might secure the capital in the mean time the chiefs of chorrassan finding themselves deserted and being in no condition to oppose the enemy submitted themselves to sipistagi  a d  00  higer

of the place fled toward turmuz at his approach the sultan then detached arsilla hajib with a great part of his army to drive sipistagi out of chorrassan and he also upon the approach of the troops of ghizni abandoned herat and marched toward mavir ul nere  elich chan seeing the bad state of his affairs solicited the aid of the king of chutun kudir chan who marched to join him with fifty thousand horse strengthened by this alliance he crossed with the confederate armies the river gion the oxus which was five pharsangs from balich and opposed himself to the camp of sultan mamood the sultan immediately drew up his army in order of battle giving the command of the center to his brother amir nisir supported by abu nisir faioon regent of gorgan and by abdulla jai a chief of reputation in arms the right wing he committed to the care of alta sash an old experienced officer while the left was the charge of arsilla hajib an omrah of the afghans the front of his line he strengthened with five hundred chainelephants with intervals behind them to facilitate their retreat  elich chan posted himself in the center comes to battle with elich chan kudir chan led the right and jaffier tighi the left the armies advanced to the charge the shouts of warriors the neighing of horses and the clashing of arms rent the ears of the firmament while dust obscured the face of day the flame of war was at once blown up by a storm of rage and the clay of the field was tempered with blood the fountains of life were opened by the edge of the sword and the sharp point of the deathful spear  a d  00  higer     elich chan advancing with some chosen squadrons threw disorder into the center of sultan mamoods army and was busy in the affairs of death mamood perceived his progress leaped from his horse and kissing the ground invoked the aid of the almighty he instantly mounted an elephant of war encouraged his troops and made a violent assault upon elich chan the elephant seizing the standard bearer of the enemy folded round him his trunk and tossed him aloft into the sky he then pressed forward like a mountain removed from its place by an earthquake and trod the enemy like locusts under his feet  when the troops of sultan mamood saw their king forcing thus his way alone through the enemys ranks they rushed on with headlong impetuosity and drove the enemy with great slaughter before them who is totally overthrown elich chan abandoned by fortune and his army turned his face to flight he crossed the river with a few of his surviving friends never afterward appearing in the field to dispute glory with sultan mamood  the sultan after this victory proposed to pursue the enemy which was thought unadviseable by his generals on account of the inclemency of the season it being then winter and the troops hardly capable of motion but the king was positive in his resolution and marched two days after the runaways mamoods army in distress on the third night a great storm of wind and snow overtook the army of mamood in the desert the kings tents were with much difficulty pitched while the army was obliged to lie in the snow mamood having ordered great fires to be kindled around his tents they became so warm that many of the courtiers began to turn off their upper garments when a facetious chief whose name was dilk came in shivering with cold the king observing him said go out dilk and tell the winter that he may burst his cheeks with blustering for here we value not his resentment a d  00  higer     facetious answer to an officer to mamood dilk went out accordingly and returning in a short time kissed the ground and thus presented his address i have delivered the sultans message to winter but the surly season replies that if his hands cannot tear the skirts of the king and his attendants yet he will so execute his power to night on his army that in the morning his majesty shall be obliged to saddle his own horses  mamood defeats and takes zab sais the king smiled at this reply but it presently rendered him thoughtful and determined him to proceed no farther in the morning some hundreds of men and horses were found to have perished with the cold mamood at the same time received advice from hindostan that zab sais had thrown off his allegiance and returning to his former religion expelled all the officers who had been appointed by the king from their respective departments the sultan immediately determined to punish this revolt and with great expedition advanced toward india he detached some part of his cavalry in front who coming unexpectedly upon zab sais defeated him and brought him prisoner to the king the rebel was fined in four lacks of rupees of which the sultan made a present to his treasurer and kept zab sais a prisoner for life  annindpal raises disturbances the king having thus settled his affairs in hindostan returned in autumn to ghizni where he remained for the winter in peace mamoods fifth expedition into india but in the spring of the year three hundred and ninetynine annindpal began to raise disturbances in moultan so that mamood was obliged to undertake another expedition into those parts with a great army to correct the hindoos annindpal hearing of the sultans intentions sent ambassadors every where to request the assistance of the other rajas of hindostan who considered the extirpation of the mussulmen from hindostan as a meritorious and political action  a d  00  higer     the rajas confederate against him the rajas of ugein gualiar callinger kinnoge delhi and ajmere entered into a confederacy and collecting their forces advanced toward punjaab with the greatest army that had been for some hundreds of years seen upon the plains of hindostan the two armies came in sight of one another in a great plain near pishawir they remained there encamped forty days without action but the troops of the idolaters daily increased in number they were joined by the gickers and other tribes with numerous armies and surrounded the mussulmen who fearing a general assault were obliged to entrench themselves  they are overthrown the king having thus secured himself ordered a thousand archers to his front to endeavor to provoke the enemy to advance to the entrenchments the archers accordingly were attacked by the gickers who notwithstanding all the sultan could do pursued the runaways within the trenches where a dreadful scene of slaughter ensued on both sides in which five thousand mussulmen in a few minutes drank the wine of martyrdom the enemy at length being slain as fast as they advanced the attack became fainter and fainter when on a sudden the elephant upon which annindpal rode took fright at the report of a gun according to our accounts there were no guns at this time but many eastern authors mention them ascribing the invention to one lockman  and turned his face to flight this circumstance struck the hindoos with a panic for thinking they were deserted by their sovereign they immediately followed the example abdulla tai with six thousand arabian horse and arsilla hajib with ten thousand turks afghans and chillages pursued the enemy for two days and nights a great slaughter of the hindoos so that twenty thousand hindoos were killed in their flight together with the great multitude which fell on the field of battle  thirty elephants with much rich plunder were brought to the king who to establish the faith marched against the hindoos of a d  00  higer     nagracut breaking down their idols and subverting their temples there was at that time in the territory of nagracut a famous fort called bime which the sultan invested after having destroyed the country round with fire and sword bime was built by raja bime on the top of a steep mountain and here the hindoos on account of its strength had reposited the wealth consecrated to their idols in all the neighboring kingdoms so that in this fort there was a greater quantity of gold silver precious stones and pearls than had been ever collected into the royal treasury of any prince on earth mamood invests bime the sultan invested the place with such expedition that the hindoos had not time to throw troops into it for its defense the greatest part of the garrison being before carried into the field those within consisted for the most part of priests a race of men who having little inclination to the bloody business of war in a few days solicited to be permitted to capitulate bime taken their request being granted by mamood they opened the gates and fell upon their faces before him and with a few of his officers and attendants he immediately entered the place  in bime were found seven hundred thousand golden dinars seven hundred maunds the least maund in india is about forty pounds avoirdupoise of gold and silver plate forty maunds of pure gold in ingots two thousand maunds of silver bullion and twenty maunds of various jewels set which had been collecting from the time of bime with this immense treasure the king returned to ghizni and in the year  00 prepared a magnificent festival where he displayed to the people his wealth in golden thrones and in other rich ornaments in a great plain without the city of ghizni and after the feast every individual received a princely present  in the following year the sultan led his army toward ghor the governor of that country mahummud ben suri with ten thousand troops opposed him from morning to noon the fire of war flamed a d  00  higer  00 and justice was done to valor on both sides the sultan finding that the troops of ghor defended themselves in their intrenchments with such obstinacy commanded his army to make a feint of retreating to allure the enemy out of their fortified camp which accordingly succeeded mamood reduces ghor the ghorans being deceived pursued the army of ghizni to the plain where the sultan facing round with his troops attacked them with great impetuosity and slaughter mahummud suri was taken prisoner and brought to the king but in his despair he had taken poison which he always kept under his ring and died in a few hours his country was annexed to the dominions of ghizni  some historians affirm that neither the sovereigns of ghor nor its inhabitants were mussulmen till after this victory whilst others of good credit assure us that they were converted many years before even so early as the time of ali  mamood in the same year was under the necessity of marching again into moultan which had revolted but having soon reduced it and cut off a great number of the chiefs he brought daood ben nazir prisoner to ghizni and confined him in the fort of gorci for life  his sixth expedition to india in the year  0  the passion of war fermenting in the mind of mamood he resolved upon the conquest of tannasar a city fourteen crores to the west of delhi in the kingdom of hindostan it had reached the ears of the king that tannasar was held in the same veneration by idolaters as mecca was by the mussulmen that there they had set up a whole tribe of rich idols the principal of whom they called jug soom that this jug soom they pretended to say existed when as yet the world existed not when the sultan reached the country of punjaab he wanted that according to the treaty that subsisted between him and annindpal he should not be disturbed in his march through that country he a d  0   higer  0  sends an ambassador to annindpal accordingly sent an embassy to annindpal advising him of his intentions and desiring him to send guards for the protection of his towns and villages which he would take care should not be molested by the followers of his camp  annindpal agreed to this proposal and prepared an entertainment for the reception of the king issuing out an order for all his subjects to supply the sultans camp with every necessary of life he in the mean time sent his brother with two thousand horse to meet the king and deliver this embassy to those who approached the throne annindpals request to mamood that he was the subject and slave of the king but that he begged permission to acquaint his majesty that tannasar was the principal place of worship of the inhabitants of that country that if it was a virtue required by the religion of mamood to destroy the religion of others he had already acquitted himself of that duty to his god in the destruction of the temple of nagracut but if he should be pleased to alter his resolution against tannasar annindpal would undertake that the amount of the revenues of that country should be annually paid to mamood to reimburse the expense of his expedition that besides he on his own part would present him with fifty elephants and jewels to a considerable amount  the king replied is refused that in the mussulman religion it was an established tenet that the more the glory of the prophet was exalted and the more his followers exerted themselves in the subversion of idolatry the greater would be their reward in heaven that therefore it was his firm resolution with the assistance of god to root out the abominable worship of idols from the face of the country of hindostan why then should he spare tannasar  when this news reached the raja of delhi he prepared to oppose the invaders sending messengers all over hindostan to acquaint the a d  0   higer  0  rajas that sultan mamood without any reason or provocation was marching with an innumerable army to destroy tannasar which was under his immediate protection that if a mound was not expeditiously raised against this roaring torrent the country of hindostan would be soon overwhelmed in ruin and the tree of prosperity rooted up that therefore it was advisable for them to join their forces at tannasar to oppose with united strength the impending danger  tannasar taken but sultan mamood reached tannasar before they could take any measures for its defense plundered the city and broke down the idols sending jug soom to ghizni where he was soon stripped of his ornaments he then ordered his head to be struck off and his body to be thrown on the highway according to the account of hadge mahumud of kandahar there was a ruby found in one of the temples which weighed four hundred and fifty miskal a miskal is thirty six rutty and a rutty seven eighths of a carat so that the size of this ruby is too improbable to deserve any credit   mamoods designs against annindpal mamood after these transactions at tannasar proceeded to delhi which he also took and wanted much to annex it to his dominions but his councillors told him that it was impossible to keep the rajaship of delhi till he had entirely subjected moultan under the mussulman government and exterminated the power and family of annindpal the king approved of this council and he immediately determined to proceed no farther against that country till he had accomplished the reduction of moultan and annindpal averted by the policy of that prince but that prince behaved with so much policy and hospitality that he changed the purpose of the king who returned to ghizni he brought to ghizni forty thousand captives and much wealth so that that city could now be hardly distinguished in riches from hindostan itself  section v the history of the reign of sultan mamood from the year  0  to his death in the year     a d  0   higer  0  in the  0 d year of the higerah the general of arsilla hajib governor of herat conquered the country of girgistan and brought shar ul nisier ruler of that province prisoner to ghizni mamoods embassy to the caliph sultan mamood at this time wrote to calipha abassi al kadir billa that the greatest part of the kingdom of chorassan was under his jurisdiction and that he hoped he would order his governors to give up the remainder the caliph fearing his great power which might fall upon his other dominions consented to this demand  his seventh expedition into india the sultan in the year  0  drew his army against the fort of nindoona which is situated upon the mountains of belnat and was in the possession of the raja of lahore annindpal by this time was dead and his son had acceded to his government when pitterugepal for that was the new rajas name saw that he could not stand against the sultan in the field he drew off his army toward cashmire leaving a good garrison for the defense of the place the sultan immediately invested it and with mining and other arts of attack assiduously employed himself so that in a few weeks the governor seeing his walls in ruins was under the necessity of begging to capitulate the sultan granted his request took every thing of value out of the place appointed a governor and set out without delay for cashmire upon which pitterugepal abandoned that province and fled to the hills the sultan plundered the country in which he found great wealth and having forced the inhabitants to acknowledge the prophet returned with the spoil to his capital  a d  0   higer  0  returns to cashmire mamood in the year  0  returned with an army to cashmire to punish the revolted chiefs and to besiege some forts which he had not reduced in his former expedition the first of those forts was lokote very famous for its height and strength which entirely defeated the sultans utmost efforts for not being able to reduce it all the summer season he was obliged on the approach of winter to abandon his enterprise and return to ghizni on his way home he was led astray by his guides and fell into an extensive morass covered with water from which he for several days could not extricate his army so that many of his troops perished upon that occasion  abul abas sultan of charizm demands mamoods sister in marriage abul abas mamoo in the course of the same year wrote to sultan mamood to ask his sister in marriage mamood consented to the match and sent her to charizm according to his desire is put to death in the year  0  a tribe of plunderers rising against abul abas charizm shaw and defeating him he fell into their hands and was put to death sultan mamood having had advice of this disaster marched to balich and from thence to charizm and when he arrived at hisserbund on the frontiers of that country he ordered mahummud tai to advance before him with a detachment when the mussulmen were at prayers in their camp himar tash the general of the charizmians rushed upon this detachment from a neighboring wood and making a great slaughter put them to flight the sultan having received intelligence of this affair supported them with several squadrons of his best horse the runaways deriving courage from this reinforcement returned to the charge routed the enemy and took their chief prisoner whom they carried before the king  which is revenged by mamood mamood advancing to the fort of hazar asp perceived the troops of charizm prepared to receive him in the field before it but they were soon defeated their general abistagi bochari taken prisoner and the murderer of abul abas met the just vengeance due to his a d  0   higer  0  crime the sultan spent some time in regulating the government which he bestowed upon amir hajib with the title of charizm shaw he annexed also to his government the province of orgunge returning to balich mamood gave the government of herat to his son amir musaood appointing abu sul his vizier and the government of gurgan he conferred upon his younger son amir mahummud under the care of abu bicker after the final settlement of the affairs of charizm the ghiznian army were cantoned for the winter at balich  mamoods eighth expedition into india in the beginning of the year  0  as soon as the sun began to awake the children of the spring sultan mamood with a hundred thousand chosen horse and thirty thousand foot raised in the countries of turkistan maverulnere chorrassan and the adjacent provinces undertook an expedition against kinnoge which from the time of gustasp to this period had not been visited by any foreign enemy kinnoge was distant from ghizni three months march and seven great rivers rushed across the way when mamood reached the confines of cashmire the raja sent him presents of every thing curious and valuable in his country and waited to have the honor of expressing his loyalty when the sultan with much difficulty had conducted his army through the mountains he entered the plains of hindostan drove all opposition before him and advanced to kinnoge mamoods route lay through the mountains behind cashmire and he must have entered hindostan by the way of tibet   the great city of kinnoge submits he there saw a city which raised its head to the firmament and which in strength and structure might justly boast to have no equal the raja of this rich city whose name was korrah and who affected great pomp and splendour being thus unexpectedly invaded had not had time to put himself in a posture of defense or to collect his troops together terrified by the great force and warlike appearance of the sultan he in his embarrassment resolved to a d  0   higer  0  sue for peace and accordingly went out with his family to the camp where he submitted himself to the mercy of the king some authors relate that he even turned mussulman or true believer  mamood advances toward merat which he takes the sultan tarried in kinnoge only three nights and then turned his face toward merat the raja of which place by name hirdit retreated with his army leaving only a garrison which was obliged to capitulate in a few days the terms were two hundred and fifty thousand rupees and fifty elephants to be paid by the raja besides the plunder of the city the sultan marched from thence to invest the fort of mavin upon the banks of the river gihon now called the jumna the raja of mavin coming forth to make his submission at the head of his troops a quarrel accidentally ensued between some soldiers and immediately the action became general calchunder the raja and most of his troops being driven into the river he drew his sword against his own wife and children and having dispatched them turned it in despair upon himself the fort immediately surrendered where the conqueror found much treasure and rich spoil among which were seventy elephants of war  when mamood had here refreshed his troops he was given to understand that at some distance there was a rich city called muttra muttra stands upon the jumna    miles above agra and is still a very considerable city consecrated to kissen basdeo which in buildings and extent yielded to none in hindostan marches against and takes muttra the sultan directed his march toward the place and entering it with very little opposition from the troops of the raja of delhi to whom it belonged gave it up to plunder great spoil found in muttra he broke down or burnt all the idols and amassed an immense quantity of gold and silver of which those figures were mostly made he intended to destroy the temples but he found that the labor exceeded his capacity while some say that he was a d  0   higer  0  turned from his purpose by the admirable beauty and structure of those edifices he it is certain extravagantly extolled the noble beauty of the buildings and city in a letter to the omrahs of ghizni after this conquest  it is said that the sultan found in muttra five great idols of pure gold with eyes of rubies each of which eyes were worth fifty thousand dinars upon another idol he found a sapphire weighing four hundred miskal and the image being melted down produced ninetyeight thousand three hundred miskal of pure gold besides these there were above a hundred idols of silver which loaded a hundred camels with bullion the sultan having tarried here twenty days in which time the city suffered greatly from fire besides what it suffered from the hand of ravage and desolation he marched against the other fortified places in these districts some of which he took himself while others fell into the hands of his chiefs  mungetaken one of those forts called munge held out twentyfive days being full of rajaputs but when they found the place no longer tenable some rushed through the breaches among the enemy and met that death which they no longer endeavored to avoid some threw themselves headlong from the walls and were dashed to pieces while others burnt themselves in their houses with their wives and children so that not one of the garrison survived this fatal catastrophe  the sultan having secured what was valuable invested the fort of chundpal but chundpal for that also was the rajas name had sent off all his treasure to the mountains and at the approach of the king evacuated the place there however still remained much spoil and provisions which the sultan divided among his troops  a d  0   higer  0  mamood marches against jundroy mamood immediately marched against a proud and imperious raja whose name was jundroy this raja after some skirmishes finding himself unable to cope with the king sent off his treasure and other valuable effects and fled also to the mountains jundroy had an elephant of a most uncommon size such as had never before been seen in hindostan nor was he more remarkable for his enormous bulk than for his docility and courage the sultan having heard much of this elephant sent to the raja offering him advantageous terms of peace and a great sum of money for this animal but the obstinacy of jundroy would never listen to any terms with the mussulmen so that mamood with regret was obliged to desist the elephant however happened one night to break loose from his keepers and went into the sultans camp where he permitted himself to be mounted and brought before the king who received him with great joy and named him the gift of god  returns to ghizni the sultan loaded with spoil and encumbered with captives returned to ghizni where he enumerated the articles of his plunder it consisted of twenty million of dirms fiftythree thousand captives three hundred and fifty elephants besides jewels pearls and precious effects which could not be properly estimated nor was the private spoil of the army less than that which came into the public treasury  builds the celestial bride the sultan upon his return to ghizni ordered a magnificent mosque to be built of marble and granate of such beauty and structure as struck every beholder with astonishment and pleasure this mosque he afterward adorned with such beautiful carpets chandeliers and other ornaments of silver and gold that it became known by the name of the celestial bride in the neighborhood of this mosque he founded an university which he furnished with a vast collection of curious books in various languages and with natural and a d  0   higer  0  artificial curiosities he appropriated a sufficient fund for the maintenance of the students and learned men who were appointed to instruct the youth in the sciences  mag of the ghiznians when the nobility of ghizni saw that the taste of their king began to run upon architecture they also endeavored to outvie each other in the magnificence of their private palaces as well as in public buildings which they raised for the embellishment of the city thus in a short space of time the capital was ornamented with mosques porches fountains reservoirs aqueducts and cisterns in a degree superior to any city at that time in the east some authors affirm that among the curiosities which the sultan possessed there was a bird of the size of a cuckoo which was possessed of this particular instinct or quality that whenever poison was brought however secretly into the apartment in which he hung he was affected with the smell in such a manner as to fly distractedly about his cage while the tears streamed involuntarily from his eyes this bird with other curiosities was sent as a present to the caliph of bagdat al kadir billa abassi we however believe that this story rose from the policy of mamood and the credulity of mankind rather than that it had actually any foundation in truth other authors mention a stone which he brought from hindostan as a great curiosity this stone being dipped in water and applied to a wound proved a powerful and efficacious remedy  mamood write to the caliph the sultan in the year   0 ordered a writing of victories this was an account of mamoods wars in verse to be made out which he sent to the caliph who ordered it to be read to the people of bagdat making a great festival upon the occasion to express his joy for the propagation of the faith which now begun to be spread over almost the whole face of the earth  a d  0   higer     in the year     mamood was presented with a petition from his subjects setting forth that some tribes of the wild arabs had for many years shut up the roads to mecca so that for fear of them and on account of the weakness of the caliph who neglected to expel them they had not been able to pay their devotions at the shrine of the prophet sends a convoy with the pilgrims to mecca the sultan immediately appointed abu mahummud his chief justice with a considerable force to protect the caffila the caravan of pilgrims but lest the enemy should be too strong for him he sent thirty thousand dirms to procure a safe journey to the pilgrims accordingly many thousands of all degrees prepared to go to mecca  when they had wound up their way as far as the desert of achtid they beheld a great camp of arabs pitched in their way the banditti drew up in order to receive them abu mahummud being desirous of treating with the arabs sent a message to their chief offering him five thousand dirms the chief instead of accepting the proposal resented it so much that without delay he advanced with intention to rob the caffila who defeat the wild arabs abu mahummud in the mean time drew out his troops to receive the robbers when fortunately in the very beginning of the action a turkish slave in the caffila who was master of the art of archery lodged an arrow in the brain of himad ben ali the chief of the arabs the banditti immediately upon the fall of their chief turned their face to flight and the caffila without further disturbance proceeded to mecca and having paid their devotions returned by the same way and arrived safe at ghizni  mamoods th expedition into in the sultan received this year advices from hindostan that the neighboring rajas had in his absence fallen upon korrah the raja of kinnoge for having entered into an alliance and for putting himself under the protection of the sultan mamood immediately a d  0   higer     marched to the aid of his vassal but before he could arrive raja nunda of callinger had drawn his army upon kinnoge and had slain raja kurrah with a great many of his principal warriors the sultan arriving at the river jumna encamped on the bank opposite to the enemy  defeats the hindoos seven officers in his army without orders swam across the river and entering the enemys camp in the morning by surprise struck such a pannick in their troops that they all betook themselves to flight the king notwithstanding their success was greatly enraged but passing with the remainder of his army he immediately commenced the pursuit  comes up with raja nunda when nunda came to the frontiers of his own dominions he halted with his army and prepared to receive the sultan with thirty six thousand horse forty five thousand foot and six hundred and fifty elephants the sultan after having reconnoitred the strength of the enemy and their situation from a rising ground prostrated himself before god and prayed that the standard of islamism might be exalted with glory and triumph who decamps in the night the day being far advanced he determined to wait for the morning which in the event disappointed his hopes and ambition for nunda decamped in the night with the utmost disorder leaving his tents equipage and baggage behind him  the sultan having next morning reconnoitred the woods and hollow grounds around ordered his army to march into the enemys camp and to lengthen their hands upon the spoil which proved to be very considerable besides five hundred and eighty elephants which were sound in the neighboring wood he then laid waste with fire and sword the country and returned to ghizni without prosecuting the war any further  a d  0   higer     mamoods expedition to kiberat he had not remained there many days before he heard that the inhabitants of kiberat and nardein countries upon the boundaries of hindostan would not acknowledge the mussulman faith but continued the worship of lions the divinity is worshipped under the figure of a lion by some of the hindoos that animal being in their opinion a proper emblem of almighty power and strength  mamood resolved to compel them and accordingly marched toward their country taking with him a great number of masons carpenters smiths and laborers that he might there build a fort to overawe them after his departure  which he reduces the lord of the country of kiberat finding he could not pretend to oppose the sultan submitted himself acknowledging the faith of the prophet hajib ali was sent with a division of the army to reduce the country of nardein which he soon accomplished pillaging the country and carrying away many of the people captives  a curious inscription there was a temple in nardein which hajib destroyed and brought from thence a stone upon which there was a curious inscription which bore that it was forty thousand years old  mamoods tenth expedition to india the sultan ordered a fort to be built in that place and left it under the care of ali ben kudur he himself in the mean time returned by the way of lahore and in his march invested the strong hold of locoat in the province of cashmire lahore reduced he besieged the place for a whole month but finding it impregnable he decamped and proceeding to lahore entered that city without much opposition giving it up to be sacked by his troops here wealth and precious effects beyond the power of estimation fell into their hands  a d  0   higer     patturugepal the raja unable to contend with so powerful an adversary fled to ajmere for protection and the sultan immediately appointed one of his omrahs to the government of lahore and sent other commanders to various districts in the territories of hindostan mamood himself returned in the spring to ghizni  mamoods eleventh expedition to india the martial disposition of mamood could not rest long in peace he marched again by the way of lahore in the    th year of the higerah against nunda the raja of callinger with a great army passing by the fort of gualier he ordered it to be besieged but the raja of that province prevailed upon him to remove from before that place in a few days by the means of rich presents and thirty five elephants the sultan immediately directed his march to callinger invested that city nunda submits and nunda offered him three hundred elephants and other presents for peace  the sultan consented to the terms proposed and the raja to try the bravery of the sultans troops intoxicated the elephants with certain drugs and let them loose without riders into the camp mamood seeing the animals advancing perceived the trick by the wildness of their motions and immediately ordered a party of his best horse to seize kill and drive them from the camp some of the turks emulous to display their bravery in the presence of their king and of both armies mounted the greatest part of the elephants and drove the rest into an adjacent wood where they were soon reduced to obedience  the enemy upon seeing the resolution of the ghiznians were much intimidated his panegyric upon mamood and nunda taking advantage of one of the foibles of mamood sent to him a panegyric in the indian tongue the king was much pleased with this elegant piece of flattery for the poetry was much admired by the learned men of hind arab and a d  0   higer     agim who were at his court to make return for this compliment the sultan conferred the government of fifteen forts upon nunda with many other curious presents but the peace was principally ratified by means of many valuable presents in jewels and gold on the part of nunda mamood immediately returned to ghizni  mamood musters his forces the sultan in the year     mustered all his forces he found them exclusive of his garrisons and those upon duty in various parts of his dominions to consist of fifty five thousand chosen horse one thousand three hundred elephants and one hundred thousand infantry with this force excepting a part of the infantry which he left at ghizni he marched to balich to expel ali tiggi from the government of maverulnere for oppressing the people who complained of his tyranny to the king when the chiefs of maverulnere heard that the king had crossed the jagetay they came with presents to meet him eusuph kudir chan king of turkistan paid him at the same time the compliment of a visit and was received with joy and friendship the sultan prepared a great feast upon the occasion and after having concluded a treaty the monarchs took leave of each other making an exchange of princely presents  ali tiggi seizing this opportunity betook himself to flight but the sultan sending a party of horse after him he was after a long search discovered and brought to the king who confined him for life in one of the sorts of hindostan while he himself returned to ghizni  mamoods twelfth expedition into india mamood understood in the same year that there was a famous temple called sumnat in the province of guzerat near the bunder bunder signifies a harbor this place is now called dieu and is in the possession of the portuguese of deo very rich and greatly frequented by devotees from all parts of hindostan these infidels believe that souls after death went before sumnat who transferred them into other bodies or animals a d  0   higer     according to their merits in their former state the sultan was also informed that the priests of this god gave out that the sins of the people of delhi and kinnoge had incensed him so much that he abandoned them to the vengeance of the mussulmen otherwise that in the twinkling of an eye he could have blasted the whole army of mamood  the sultan no ways intimidated by this report was determined to put the power of the god to a trial by personally treating him ill he therefore marched from ghizni with a numerous army in the month shaban  description of the temple of sumnat the temple of sumnat which also gave name to a great city was situated upon the shore of the ocean and is at this time to be seen in the districts of deo bunder under the dominion of the europeans portuguese some historians affirm that sumnat was brought from mecca where it stood before the time of the prophet but the brahmins deny this tale and say that it stood in deobunder since the time of krishen who was concealed in that place about four thousand years ago  mamood arrives at moultan the sultan about the middle of ramzan reached the city of moultan and as there was a great desert before him he gave orders that all his troops should provide themselves with several days water and provisions as also with provender for their horses he besides loaded twenty thousand camels with necessaries for the army when he had passed that terrible desert he arrived at the city of ajmere and finding that the raja and inhabitants had abandoned the place and that he could not prevail with them to come and submit themselves sacks ajmere he ordered the city to be sacked and the adjacent a d  0   higer     country to be laid waste with fire and sword but as the reduction of the citadel would take up too much time he left it and proceeded upon his expedition and reduced some small forts in the way by assault  arrives at narwalla having then arrived at narwalla a city of guzerat which was evacuated at his approach another desert presented itself to the king beyond that place and at sumnat mamood however taking the same precautions as before without any remarkable occurrence reached sumnat which was a lofty castle upon a narrow peninsula washed on three sides by the sea  upon the battlements of the place there appeared an innumerable multitude of people in arms they immediately made a signal for a herald to approach and told him that their mabood or idol sumnat had drawn the mussulmen thither that he might blast them in a moment and avenge the destruction of the gods of hindostan the sultan only smiled at this vain threat and commanded that as soon as the streams of light should pour from the spring of day his army should prepare for an assault  which he assault in the morning the valiant troops of the sublime mamood advanced to the foot of the walls and began the attack the battlements were in a short time cleared by the experience and valor of the archers and the dastardly hindoos astonished and dispirited crowded into the temple and prostrating themselves in tears before the idol prayed for assistance  scales the walls the mussulmen seized the opportunity which the devotion of their enemies offered them applied their scaling ladders and mounting the wall began to exclaim alla akber god is greatest  the hindoos now a d  0   higer     reduced to despair found they must fight for themselves or die they collected their force together and made so violent an attack upon the assailants that from the time that the king of day dispelled the darkness till the moon fair bride of night illuminated the court of heaven with paler rays the flames of war were not quenched with blood but is repulsed the mussulmen wearied out with fatigue were at length obliged to abandon all their advantages and retire to rest  repulsed a second time next morning the work of death was renewed but as fast as they mounted the wall so fast were they pushed headlong down by the spears of the defendants who weeping had taken leave of their god and now seemed wishing for death and thus the labors of this day proved more unsuccessful than the first  the army of the hindos appears an army of idolaters upon the third day presented themselves in order of battle in sight of the sultans camp mamood immediately advanced with an intention to raise the siege of sumnat and therefore ordered a party to amuse the besieged while he himself prepared to engage the enemy in the field he marched in order of battle toward the idolaters who advanced with equal resolution whom he engages the fire of adverse rage immediately illuminated the gleaming field and death stalked with such execution and power around that time trembling for his empire wept byramdeo and dabiselima in the middle of the action joined the enemy with their troops and inspired them with such fresh courage that faintness became visible in the sultans army  mamood perceiving a languor spreading over his lines leapt from his horse and prostrating himself before god implored his assistance then mounting with a noble assurance he took abul a d  0   higer     hassen chirkani one of his generals by the hand and inspired him with hope and glory he himself advanced upon the enemy encouraging his troops with such determined resolution that ashamed to abandon their king with whom they had so often trod the path of renown they with one accord gave a shout of victory and rushed forward as for a prize and overthrows they bore the enemy before them upon the points of their spears laying five thousand of them dead at their feet  sumnat surrenders when the garrison of sumnat beheld this defeat they were struck with confusion and fear they withdrew their hands from the fight and issuing out at a gate toward the sea to the number of four thousand embarked in boats intending to proceed to the island of sirindiep ceylon  but they did not escape the eyes of the sultan he seized upon boats which were left in a neighboring creek and manning them with rowers and some of his best troops pursued the enemy taking and sinking some of their boats while others escaped  mamood enters sumnat the emperor having placed guards round the walls and at the gates entered sumnat with his son and a few of his omrahs and principal attendants when they advanced to the temple they saw a great and antique structure built of stone within a spacious court they immediately entered it beheld a great square hall having it is lofty roof supported by fifty six pillars curiously turned and set with precious stones in the center of the hall stood sumnat an idol of stone five yards in height two of which were sunk in the ground  destroys the idol of sumnat the sultan was enraged when he saw this idol and raising his mace struck off the nose from his face he then ordered that two a d  0   higer     pieces of this image should be broke off to be sent to ghizni there to be thrown at the threshold of the public mosque and in the court of his palace two more fragments he reserved to be sent to mecca and medina  when the sultan was thus employed in breaking up sumnat a crowd of brahmins petitioned his attendants and offered some crores ten millions in gold if the king should be pleased to proceed no further the omrahs endeavored to persuade mamood to accept of the money for they said that breaking up the idol would not remove idolatry from the walls of sumnat that therefore it could serve no purpose to destroy the image but that such a sum of money given in charity among believers would be a very meritorious action the sultan acknowleged that what they said was in some measure true but should he consent to that bargain he might justly be called a seller of idols and that he looked upon a breaker of them as a more honorable title he therefore ordered them to proceed  finds an immense treasure the next blow having broke up the belly of sumnat which had been made hollow they discovered that it was full of diamonds rubies and pearls of a much greater value than the amount of what the brahmins had offered  account of sumnat it is said by some writers that the name of this idol is a compound word of sum and not sum being the name of the raja who erected it and not the true name of the god which in the language of the brahmins signifies creator in the time of eclipses we are told that there used to be forty or fifty thousand worshippers at this temple and that the different rajas of hindostan had bestowed in all two thousand villages with their territories for the maintenance of its priests besides the a d  0   higer     innumerable presents received from all parts of the empire it was a custom among those idolaters to wash sumnat every morning and evening with fresh water from the ganges though that river is above five hundred crores distant  among the spoils of this temple was a chain of gold weighing forty maunds which hung from the top of the building by a ring it supported a great bell which warned the people to the worship of the god besides two thousand brahmins who officiated as priests there belonged to the temple five hundred dancing girls three hundred musicians and three hundred barbers to shave the devotees before they were admitted to the presence of sumnat the dancing girls were either remarkable for their beauty or their quality the rajas thinking it an honor to have their daughters admitted  sultan mamood found in this temple a greater quantity of jewels and gold than it is thought any royal treasury ever contained before in the history of eben assure it is related that there was no light in the temple but one pendant lamp which being reflected from the jewels spread a strong and refulgent light over the whole place besides the great idol abovementioned there were in the temple some thousands of small images in gold and silver of various shapes and dimensions  the emperor marches against byram deo the emperor having secured the wealth of sumnat prepared to chastise raja byram deo from whom the harbor of deo takes its name for having endeavored to distress him during the siege and having given above three thousand of the mussulmen to drink of the wine of martyrdom byram deo after the taking of sumnat had fled from narwalla the capital of guzerat and shut himself up in the fort of gundia which was forty pharsangs from sumnat the king without opposition arrived before the sort and saw that it was surrounded a d  0   higer     on all sides by the sea which in every place appeared impassable he sent however to sound the depth of the water and received intelligence that at one place it was fordable at low water but if he should be caught by the tide in his passage the troops must inevitably perish  attacks him in his fort of gundia the sultan having ordered public prayers and cast his fortune in the koran turned his horse into the sea at the head of his troops and reaching in safety the opposite shore immediately made an assault upon the place byram deo looking upon life preferable to every other consideration left his family and wealth and in the habit of a slave stealing out of the fort run and concealed himself in a corner which he takes the troops who defended the place seeing themselves thus shamefully deserted were also struck with fear and quitted their posts upon the walls the mussulmen mounted their scaling ladders and commenced a dreadful havoc among the unfortunate slaves reserving the women and children for captivity the wealth of the raja was lodged in the treasury of the king  marches to narwalla mamood being thus victorious marched to narwalla he found the soil of that place so fertile the air so salubrious and pure and the country so well cultivated and pleasant that he proposed to take up his residence there for some years and to make it his capital conferring the government of ghizni upon his son the sultan musaood some historians relate that in that age there were goldmines in guzerat which occasioned sultan mamood to incline to fix his residence in that country but to this we cannot well give any credit as there are now no traces of those mines but it is acknowledged that the country was at all times one of the richest in hindostan in support of their assertion they however give many instances of the disappearance of gold mines such as that in seistan which was swallowed up by an a d  0   higer     earthquake there are other writers who pretend to say that the king having heard of gold and ruby mines upon the island of sirendiep and in the country of pegu intended to fit out a fleet for the conquest of those parts but that he was diverted by his council from this scheme and also prevailed upon not to abandon his native kingdom and capital  but is diverted from it by the omrahs mamood yielding to this latter advice consented to return and at the same time begged of his omrahs to recommend a fit person to him for the government of the kingdom of guzerat after consulting among themselves they told the king that on account of the great distance of this country from his other dominions and the number of troops it would require for its defense they thought it advisable that some one of the natives should receive that honor the king then enquired among the chiefs of the natives and was informed that the family of dabissalima was the noblest in those parts and that then a man of parts and distinction of that tribe was in his camp in the habit of a brahmin that they knew no person fitter to be exalted to royalty than him though he had been obliged to choose that way of life to conceal himself from the cruelty of a younger brother who had usurped his inheritance  makes dabissalima king of guzerat but some authors suspecting the probability of this story have informed us that dabissalima was raja of a neighboring country famous as well for his policy and wisdom as for his great knowledge in the sciences to him the king sent a friendly message inviting him to his presence to receive his allegiance for the government of guzerat which he intended to bestow upon him but as we have many authentic proofs of the truth of our first relation it must be acknowleged that the king upon having settled an annual tribute bestowed the kingdom of guzerat upon dabissalima the poor brahmin and not upon the raja of the same name who lived at that period  a d  0   higer     we find that when the king had bestowed the regency upon the brahmin that he petitioned him to leave some forces for his protection for that raja dabissalima as soon as mamood should evacuate the country would undoubtedly invade him before his power was thoroughly established the consequences of which might be easily foreseen but that if the king would grant him his protection he would annually give double the revenues of cabulistan and zabulistan  marches against and defeats a neighboring raja these considerations prevailed with the sultan to form a design to reduce this raja before he left the country he accordingly sent a part of his army into the dominions of the raja which in a short time defeated him and brought him prisoner to mamood he immediately delivered over the unfortunate raja into the hands of his kinsman dabissalima the viceroy to take away his life  dabissalima addressed himself to the king after this manner that in his religion the murder of a king was unlawful but that it was customary when one king got possession of the person of another who was his enemy to make a dark pit under his throne where he should remain imprisoned for life or till the death of his conqueror dabissalimas clemency that for his own part he esteemed such usage a cruelty of which he could not be guilty but that on the other hand if the raja should be confined by him in another prison his adherents would upon the kings departure attempt to release him he therefore earnestly begged that the king might carry him to ghizni  mamood returns to ghizni the sultan complied with this last request and after two years and six months absence turned homewards his victorious standards but having received intelligence that byram deo and the raja of ajmere with others had collected a great army to oppose him in the desert he turned by the way of sind and moultan he there also met with deserts in his march wherein his army greatly suffered a d  0   higer     by want of water and his cavalry by want of grass but in the year     he with much difficulty and toil reached ghizni during his march through sind he was led astray three days and nights by one of his hindoo guides in a desert of dry sand so that madness and thirst began intolerably to rage through his perishing troops  perfidy of one of the priests of sumnat the sultan suspecting his guide commanded him to be put to the torture when he confessed that he was one of the priests of sumnat who to revenge the injuries done to his god had thus endeavored to bring about the ruin of the ghiznian army the king then commanded him to be put to death and it being toward evening he fell prostrate before god imploring a speedy deliverance a meteor was immediately seen in the east to which he directed his march and before morning found himself upon the banks of a lake  dabissalima deman as the imprisoned raja dabissalima the devout having established himself upon the throne of guzerat continued to send his revenues punctually to the king and some years after desired the imprisoned raja might be returned to him but the raja had by this time gained upon the mind of the king which made him unwilling to part with him he however was overpersuaded by his counselors who were envious of the favor which the unfortunate raja had acquired and he was accordingly put into the hands of the person who brought the revenue to ghizni  his uely when they reached the dominions of guzerat dabissalima the devout gave orders to dig a hole under his own throne in which he intended to confine the unhappy raja according to the barbarous custom of the hindoos to stretch his triumph still further he advanced to some distance from his capitol to meet the raja that the unfortunate man might run before his horse with a basin on his head and an ewer in his hand  a d  0   higer     and punishment the king it is said having overheated himself upon this occasion lay down much disordered in a shade drew a red handkerchief over his face and ordered his attendants to withdraw a vulture which was hovering over that place mistaking the red handkerchief for prey soused down upon the king and fixing her talons about his eyes rendered him totally blind and therefore incapable to reign according to the laws of the country  when the accident which befell the king became public the whole camp and city were filled with confusion and uproar the imprisoned raja arriving at that very instant was received with universal acclamations and immediately elected king he put the basin upon the head of dabissalima and placed the ewer in his hand and drove him before him into the dungeon which he himself had prepared where he spent the remainder of his life  this barbarous action however showed that his successor was unworthy of what providence had so miraculously bestowed upon him this story is a striking instance of the just punishment of pride and that he who digs a pit for another will fall into it himself  story of an iron idol the author of the jam ul hikaiat has related that when sultan mamood was in guzerat he saw a small black idol under a circular arch which to all appearance was suspended in the air without support the king amazed at this phenomenon consulted the philosophers of his court concerning it they told him that they believed the image to be iron and the stones of the arch magnets the king observed that be thought the equilibrium of weight and attraction could not be so exactly found he however by way of experiment ordered a stone to be struck out of the arch which was no sooner done than the idol sell to the ground and the stone was accordingly found to be a magnet but philosophers of latter days a d  0   higer     are of the kings opinion and that this story may be ranked among the fabulous  the caliph writes to mamood the caliph of bagdat being informed of the expedition of sultan mamood wrote him a congratulatory letter in which he styled him the guardian of fortune and islamism to his son sultan musaood he gave the title of the light of posterity and the beauty of nations and to his second son mur eusoph the appellation of the strength of the arm of fortune and establisher of the state he at the same time assured mamood that whoever he should appoint to the succession he himself would confirm and support  mamood attacks the jits mamood marched this year an army against the jits who had insulted him in his way from sumnat this people inhabited the country on the borders of moultan near the banks of the river that runs by the mountains of jude when he arrived at moultan finding that the country of the jits was defended by great rivers he ordered fifteen hundred boats to be built each of which he armed with six iron spikes projecting from their prows and sides to prevent their being boarded by the enemy who were very expert in that kind of war when he had launched this fleet he ordered twenty archers into each boat and five others with fireballs to burn the craft of the jits and naphta to set the whole river on fire this force he commanded to extirpate the jits and remained with the remainder of his army at moultan  who are overthrown the jits having intelligence of this armament sent their wives and children and most valuable effects into an island and launching according to some four thousand or according to others eight thousand boats manned and armed prepared to receive the ghiznians they met and a terrible conflict ensued but the projected pikes from the sultans boats did such execution when they ran against a d  0   higer     the craft of the jits that many of them were overset the archers at the same time plied their bows to such good purpose that many of the enemy plunged over board to avoid their galling arrows some of the jitsiad boats being in the mean time set on fire communicated their flames to others some were sunk some boarded by the turks and others endeavored to make their escape in this scene of confusion and terror very few of the jits could shun their hard fate all those therefore who escaped death met with the more severe misfortune of captivity  the sultan after this victory returned in triumph to ghizni and in the    th year of the higerah ordered amir toos one of his generals to the government of badwird that he might chastise the turkuman of siljoki who had crossed the river amavia and invaded that province amir toos defeated by the turkumans but amir toos being defeated in a very bloody action wrote to the sultan that without his presence and fortune nothing could be done against the enemy  mamood marches against and overthrows the turkomans reduces iraak the sultan immediately put his army in motion and having come up with them gave them a total defeat which entirely dispersed them and cleared the country hearing at this time that one of his generals had conquered iraak western provinces of persia  he marched that way and seized all the treasure that had been amassed by the race of boia who had possessed that country and lived in the city of rai returns to ghizni having there enforced some laws respecting the religion of the inhabitants who had adopted false tenets he settled the government of rai and ispahan upon his son sultan musaood and returned himself to ghizni  falls sick the sultan was soon after afflicted with the stone which disorder daily increased he went in this condition to balich to settle some a d  0   higer     state affairs and in the beginning of the spring he turned his face again to ghizni dies where upon friday the   d of ribbi ul sani in the    th of the higera and the sixty third year of his age this great conqueror amidst the tears of his people gave up his body to death and his soul to immortality  sultan mamood reigned thirtyfive years and he was buried by torch light with great pomp and solemnity in the palace of triumph at ghizni his person he was a man of a middle stature not very handsome in his person but without any deformity or blemish  instances of his avarice two days before his death he commanded that all the sacks of gold and caskets of precious stones which were in the treasury should be placed before him when he beheld them as with regret he wept ordering them to be carried back to the treasury without exhibiting his generosity at that time to any body for which he has been accused of avarice he ordered the following day a review of his army his elephants camels horses and chariots with which having feasted his eyes for some time from his traveling throne he again burst into tears and retired in grief to his palace  it is said that sultan mamood upon hearing that a citizen of neshapoor was possessed of immense wealth commanded him to be called into his presence the king began to reproach him for being an idolater and an apostate from the faith the citizen replied o king i am no idolater nor apostate but it is true that i am possessed of much wealth take it therefore but do me not a double injustice by robbing me of my money and my good name the king for this insolence as he termed it ordered him to be punished and confiscated his whole estate  a d  0   higer     but mamood was in other instances famous for justice a person one day thrusting himself into the presence called loudly for justice the king ordered him to explain his complaint which he thus did that unfortunately having a handsome wife the kings nephew had conceived a passion for her and came to his house every night with armed attendants beating him and turning him into the street till he had gratified his adulterous passion that he had frequently complained to those who ought to have done him justice but that the rank of the adulterer had shut their ears against him  of his justice the king upon hearing this was so much enraged that tears of resentment and compassion started from his eyes he reprimanded the poor man for not making sooner his complaint to him the man replied that he often attempted it but could not gain admittance he was then commanded by the king to return to his house and to give him notice the first time that his nephew was guilty of the like violence charging those who were present upon pain of death to let nothing of this complaint transpire ordering him to be admitted at any hour accordingly the man returned to his house and upon the third night following the kings nephew as usual came and having whipped the husband severely turned him into the street the poor man hastened to the king but the captain of the guards would not give him admittance saying that his majesty was in the haram the man immediately began to make a violent outery so that the porter fearing that the court might be disturbed and that the noise might reach the king he was under the necessity to conduct him to the eunuchs of the bedchamber who immediately acquainted the sultan with the affair  the king immediately rose and drawing on a garment followed the man to his house he found his nephew and the mans wife a d  0   higer     sleeping together in one bed with a candle standing on the carpet near them the sultan extinguishing the candle drew his dagger and severed his nephews head from his body then commanding the man to light the candle he called out for some water and having taken a deep draught he told him he might now go and sleep with safety if he could trust his own wife  the poor man fell down at the sultans feet in gratitude to his justice and condescension but begged he might tell him why he put out the candle and afterward called out so vehemently for water the king replied that he put out the candle that pity might not arrest his hand in the execution of justice on a youth whom he tenderly loved and that he had made a vow to god when he first heard his complaint that he would neither eat nor drink till he had brought the criminal to justice in so much that he

sultan often entreated to undertake the shaw namma but he excused himself on account of his age he was the master of phirdoci who afterward undertook that work but phirdoci falling sick by too much application before it was finished he applied himself to his old master assidi telling him that he was now at the point of death and that his only regret for leaving this vain world was that his poem was unfinished the old man weeping replied that though he had often excused himself to the king from having any hand in that performance yet for the affection he bore to phirdoci he would undertake to finish his poem the dying poet replied that he was a d  0   higer     well assured no other man of the age had the genius to attempt it but at the same time he was afraid years and infirmities had damped the native fire of assidi  the old man warmed with friendship and emulation collecting the force of his mind made the attempt and brought into the chains of rhyme in a few days that part of the poem between the arabian conquest of agim to the end which consists of four thousand couplets he immediately brought it to phirdoci who was so rejoiced that he recovered from his disorder the shaw

of those times four hundred poets and learned men besides all the students of the university of ghizni acknowledged him for their master he was therefore appointed by the king to superintend literature and it was ordered that no performance should be brought before the sultan without being previously honored with the approbation of ali unsuri  among the works of unsuri there is an heroic poem upon the actions of sultan mamood the king having one night in his cups cut off the long tresses of his beloved his favorite mistress  he was much afflicted in the morning for what he had done he sat he rose he walked by turns and there was a terror round him which kept the people at distance a d  0   higer     ali unsuri accosted him with some extempore lines the beauty of the lines consisted

let it be rather crowned with mirth and wine for the beauty of the cypress is increased by the pruning of it is branches  which so pleased the king that he ordered his mouth to be filled three times with jewels calling then for wine he sat down with the poet and washed down his grief seasoning society with wit  asjuddi was one of the scholars of unsuri he was a native of hirvi a poet blessed with the light of true genius but his works are very scarce and the greatest part of them lost firochi was also a pupil of unsuri he was of the ancient royal race of the kings of seistan but reduced by fortune so low that he was obliged to hire himself to a farmer for the yearly wages of a hundred dirms when he married he found this small sum would not answer his expenses so he became desirous of having his wages increased the farmer told him he certainly deserved a great deal more but that his capacity could not extend the allowance further firochi in this state of dependence waited on the sultans nephew abul muziffir with a poem for which he was honored with a handsome reward with a horse and a dress he was introduced to the king by muziffir who settled a pension upon him which enabled

bequeath to mahummud he moreover added that the regions of the hills tiberistan and ayrack which he had mostly acquired by his own sword were ample enough dominions for him he only insisted so far on his birthright as to have his name first read in the chutba the genealgy and titles of their kings read from the pulpit on all public occasions of worship after the praise of the prophet  over all his dominions  his moderation amir musaood is allowed to have been very moderate in this case for though he and mahummud were twins he was the elder by some hours and consequently had the undoubted right of succession  war between the brothers but enmity had subsisted between the brothers from their youth and sultan mahummud returned his brother upon this occasion a very unfriendly answer and began to prepare for war in spite of all that his council could do to oppose so rash a measure the sultan accordingly put his army in motion and leaving ghizni proceeded to meet musaood it is said that at the feast upon the conclusion of the ramzan which mahummud held at tunganabad his crown fell accidentally from his head when he sat in state this was reckoned a very unfortunate omen of which some disaffected omrahs taking advantage estranged the minds of the soldiery from their prince mahummud deposed accordingly upon the third night after there was a confederacy formed by amir ali eusoph ben

his affections upon his brother amir mahummud who was of a more mild and tractable disposition  a d  0   higer     anecdote concerning musaood chaja abu niser muscati relates that when the name of amir mahummud was inserted before that of musaood in the chutba and read in public for the first time that he himself followed amir musaood to the door of the mosque and told him that what he had heard gave him the utmost concern for that his own as well as the hearts of most of the omrahs burnt with affection for him amir musaood replied with a smile give yourselves no concern about it the world is for the longest sword  one of the kings spies hearing this conversation immediately gave information of it to the sultan mamood immediately calling abu niser asked him what had passed between him and amir musaood abu niser thinking that truth would be his best defense related the particulars upon which the king said that he had always a high opinion of the superior abilities of musaood who he foresaw would one day be king but that amir mahummud had gained his heart by filial duty and implicit obedience  musaood releases several prisoners of state sultan musaood upon his accession released ahummud ben hassen mumundi who by the orders of the sultan mamood had been imprisoned in the fort of callinger and again made him vizier he called amir ahummud ben mealtagi the treasurer to a strict account and after having obliged him to refund a great sum for malpractices in his office appointed him general of all his forces in hindostan and ordered him to proceed to lahore he at the same time released mujeid ul dowla willami who had also been imprisoned in one of the forts of hindostan and called him to his court  higer     invades kutch and mackeran sultan musaood in the year     having left balich came to ghizni and sent an army to kutch and mackeran and the coin of both provinces was struck in his name the prince of those countries died about that time and left two sons abul asakir and isah a d  0   higer      isah the younger brother taking possession of the government abul asakir had recourse for aid to regain his inheritance to sultan musaood to whom the fugitive prince promised an annual tribute and to hold his dominions when recovered of him which are reduced musaood agreeing to this proposal sent a great army with abul asakir with orders to his general if possible to reconcile the difference between the brothers and to divide the country equally between them but if this could not be done to put the whole into the possession of abul asakir  when abul asakir arrived upon the frontiers with this powerful army so obstinate was his brother and so much devoted to his own ruin that he would not be brought to listen to any accommodation and though he was deserted by many of his friends who joined his brother he determined to decide the affair with his sword he accordingly fought with great bravery till he obtained that death he seemed so eagerly to pursue the provinces fell into the hands of abul asakir who paid tribute and allegiance to the empire  mash made governor of rai in persia the sultan in the same year bestowed the viceroyship of rai of hammedan and of all the regions of the hills upon mash a man who though he had raised himself from the lowest office in the camp displayed uncommon abilities in reducing those provinces to obedience after the departure of sultan musaood the countries which we have just mentioned revolted in part but mash not only reduced them to their former dependence but chastised ali ul dowla governor of chorassan who had been tampering with the rebels  unsuccessful war with the turkumans sultan musaood after having settled affairs at ghizni intended to march to ispahan and rai but when he arrived at herat the people of sirchus and badawird complained to him of the ravages of the siljoki turkumans the king moved by the injuries done to his a d  0   higer     subjects was incensed very much against the enemy and therefore immediately ordered abduse ben abdul azize with a great force to chastise them this general however was received by the turkumans with so much bravery that he could gain no advantages over them and the king for what reason is not known returned to ghizni  higer     war with ali tiggi in the year     musaood dispatched altasash hajib from charizm with a great army to oppose ali tiggi who had invaded and conquered samarcand and bochara altasash marched to maverulnere where fifteen thousand horse were ordered to join him from ghizni bochara reduced after this junction was effected he crossed the river amavia in the face of the enemy and continued his rout to bochara which he reduced and then proceeded to sumarcand ali tiggi marched out of the city and took possession of a strong post having the river on one side and a high mountain on the other ali tiggi overthrown by altasash when the fire of contention arose that is when the battle begun  a party of ali tiggis horse having turned the mountain attacked the army of altasash in the rear a great slaughter commenced and the ghiznian commander was wounded in a part of the body in which he had formerly received a wound in taking one of the forts of hindostan he however concealed his blood from his army and charged the enemy with such vigor in his front and rear that after an obstinate and bloody conflict they were at length put to flight  who dies of his wounds when the battle was over altasash called a council of his principal officers and showing his wound told them his end was approaching and that they must now manage affairs in the best manner they could intimating at the same time that he thought they could do nothing better than conclude a peace with the enemy this motion being approved a messenger was dispatched to them a d  0   higer     that very night with proposals which were eagerly accepted the conditions were that ali tiggi should keep possession of samarcand and that bochara should remain to musaood the two armies immediately after this pacification departed the one for samarcand and the other for chorrassan the brave altasash died the second day after but his death was concealed from the army and the chiefs conducted the troops to charizm and when these accounts came to sultan musaood he conferred the government upon haro the son of altasash  ahmed ben hassen mumundi dying this year musaood appointed abu niser ahmid to succeed him as vizier musaood invades hindostan in the    th of the higera sultan musaood resolved upon an expedition into hindostan sursutti invested taking the rout of cashmire he invested the fort of sursutti which commanded the passes the garrison being intimidated sent messengers to the king promising valuable presents and an annual tribute if he should desist from his enterprise the sultan begun to listen to the proposals when his ears were stunned with a grievous complaint from some mussulmen captives who were then detained in the place he immediately broke up the conference and began to besiege the fort ordering the ditch to be filled up with sugarcanes from the adjacent plantations the garrison put to the sword this being done he ordered scaling ladders to be applied to the walls which after a bloody contest were mounted and the garrison without distinction of age or sex barbarously put to the sword excepting a few women and children who were protected by the soldiers for slaves the king commanded that what part of the spoil was saved from pillage should be given to the mussulmen who had been slaves in sursutti and who had formerly lost their effects  a famine and pestilence this year was remarkable for a great drought and famine in many parts of the world the famine was succeeded by a calamitous a d  0   higer     pestilence which swept many thousands from the face of the earth for in less than one month forty thousand died in ispahan alone nor did it rage with less violence in hindostan where whole countries were entirely depopulated  disturbances in tibirian sultan musaood in the mean time was obliged to march back to quell some disturbances in tibiristan are quelled the inhabitants of amalisar opposed him in his progress but they were dispersed by the imperial troops with little opposition and abu callingar prince of tibiristan sent an ambassador and subjected himself and his country to the king he at the same time gave his son bhamin and his nephew shirvi as hostages for his future good behavior  war with the turkumans sultan musaood turned from thence his face toward ghizni and when he arrived at neshapoor the people of that place again complained of the incursions of the turkumans of siljoki and musaood immediately dispatched buctadi and hussein ben ali with a great force to chastise them when the ghiznian army reached the village of seindenfauk a messenger came from the turkumans with a letter to the following purpose who demand a subsidy that they were the kings servants and not at all desirous to disturb any body but his enemies if they should be enabled by an annual subsidy to live at home without plunder or led out to war that they might exert their skill in what they reckoned their only profession  and are defeaed by buctadi the answer of buctadi was very haughty there is no peace says he between us but the sword unless you will give over your depredations and submit yourselves implicitly to the laws and authority of the king after the turkumans had heard this message from their ambassador they advanced and made a violent assault upon the camp of buctadi but as they were conducted more by rage than conduct they were repulsed and obliged to turn their backs a d  0   higer     upon the honors of the field buctadi pursuing them with great expedition took all their baggage and their wives and children  but when buctadi was returning from the pursuit whom in another battle they overthrow while yet many of his troops were dispersed and intent upon the plunder the turkumans issued out from between two hills and rendered desperate by their former loss made a dreadful slaughter among the troops of buctadi who could not be regularly brought up to the charge the ghiznians continued to fight and retreat for two days and nights but hussein ben ali could not be persuaded to quit the field so that after the most of his men were killed he himself fell a prisoner into the hands of the enemy buctadi fled and carried advice of his own defeat to sultan musaood at neshapoor  the sultan was obliged for that time to restrain his resentment disturbances in hindostan upon account of some disturbances in hindostan he marched back to ghizni in the year     and thence sent an army under ban an indian chief against ahmud neal tiggi who had rebelled in his government but when the two armies met ban was defeated with great slaughter the rebels defeated musaood being informed of this disaster sent touluck another hindoo chief who coming to battle with ahmud neal tiggi gave him a total overthrow he fled in great haste toward munsura tatta and sind their great distress touluck pursued him so close that many thousands of the runaways fell into his hands whom he treated in the most inhuman manner cutting off their noses and ears when tiggi reached the banks of the sind he found himself if possible in greater distress than before for collecting all the boats which the pressure of the enemy would permit he endeavored to cross the river but the soldiers afraid of being abandoned hurried into the boats with such violence and in such numbers that most of them were either overset or sunk a sudden storm and an inundation of the river added to the confusion of the a d  0   higer     vanquished so that very few of them escaped the body of their chief was soon after found by the enemy and his head sent to ghizni  a new palace built at ghizni a new palace being finished in the year     at ghizni a golden throne studded with jewels was erected in a magnificent hall and a crown of gold weighing seventy maunds the least maund in india is that of surat which weighs thirtyseven pound five ounces and seven drachms averdupoize by which we may conjecture that the value of this crown was immense  darting luster from its precious stones suspended by a golden chain over it by way of canopy under which the king sat in state and gave public audience musaood invades hindostan he in the same year conferred the ensigns and drums of royalty upon his son amir modood and sent him to the government of balich whilst he himself marched with an army to hindostan to reduce the strong city of hassi  this city was the capital of sewalic and was by the hindoos reckoned impregnable for they were taught to believe by some of their prophets that it should never fall into the hands of the mussulmen but the hindoo prophets like those of other nations deceived their followers takes hassi for the king in the space of six days though with a very considerable loss on his side scaled the place and took it musaood found immense treasures in hassi and having put it into the hands of a trusty servant he marched toward the fort of sunput sunput evacuated deipal the governor of sunput evacuated the place and fled into the woods but he had no time to carry off his treasure which fell into the conquerors hands musaood ordered all the temples to be laid in ruins and all the idols to be broke down  musaood surprises deipal the sultan then went in pursuit of deipal who began to show himself in the field but he was surprised by the king and all his army a d  0   higer     taken prisoners while he himself escaped in the habit of a slave musaood marched from thence toward raam another raja of those parts who upon receiving intelligence of the kings intentions sent immense presents of gold and elephants excusing himself on account of his age from personally attending upon musaood the sultan received his presents and excuse and withheld his hand from giving him any farther molestation then leaving a trusty omrah in sinput forty miles from delhi on the road to lahore  he took possession of all the countries in his rear intending to return to ghizni when he reached lahore he left there his son mugdood on whom he conferred the government and the drums and ensigns of state with eur his favorite to be his counselor in matters of importance  marches to balich in the year     musaood again marched to balich to quell the tumults raised by the turkumans who upon hearing of the kings approach evacuated that country the inhabitants of that province addressed the sultan and acquainted him that eur tiggi after his departure had made diverse incursions into their territories and crossing the river had lengthened his hands upon the lives and effects of his subjects the king determined therefore to chastise him that winter and in the beginning of the spring to bring the other turkomans of siljoki to a better understanding the omrahs of his court with one accord advised him to march first against the siljokis because they had for two years gained an ascendancy over the inhabitants of chorrassan and were daily gaining strength the sultan at that time received also a letter from one of the nobles of that province acquainting him that his enemies who were once but ants were now become little snakes and if they were not soon destroyed they might grow in a short time to serpents  a d  0   higer     the good fortune of musaood declines but the star of the kings fortune had now reached the house of adversity and he would not by any means hearken to their advice in hopes to conquer the country before him he laid a bridge over the gion and crossing his army without opposition took possession of the whole province of maver ul nere but during that winter such a quantity of snow fell that it was with the greatest difficulty he marched back his army toward ghizni in the mean time chukker beg daood siljoki marched with an army against balich from whence chaja amud wrote to the king the particulars begging as he had not a sufficient force to oppose the enemy that he would take some measures to reinforce him musaood upon this turned his army toward balich  ghizni pillaged eur tiggi taking this advantage marched quickly to ghizni where he plundered the kings stables and after having greatly dishonored the capital he was repulsed when the sultan reached the confines of balich daood retreated toward murve upon which the king in conjunction with his son modood set out in pursuit of him to gurgan peace with the turkumans when the turkumans heard of the motion of the ghiznians toward murve they sent an ambassador professing obedience and loyalty if the king would bestow a track of country upon them in which they might settle sultan musaood consenting to this proposal sent a messenger to their chief whose name was pugu to come and settle the treaty which accordingly he did and the king upon promise of their future good behavior alienated a large territory for their maintenance  their perfidy musaood after this treaty turned with his army toward herat but such was the infidelity of those ravagers that they attacked the rear of the kings army carrying off part of his baggage and slaying a number of his attendants the sultan incensed at this behavior sent a detachment in pursuit of them who took a small a d  0   higer   0 party of them prisoners and brought them to his feet he immediately ordered their heads to be cut off and sent to pugu who excused himself saying that for his part he was glad they had met with their deserts for he had no knowledge of their proceedings  musaood takes the rout of herat the sultan continued his march to herat from herat to neshapoor and from thence to toos at toos he was attacked by another tribe of turkumans whom he defeated with great slaughter in the mean time he received intelligence that the inhabitants of badwird had given up their forts to the turkumans he marched immediately against them retook the forts and cleared that country of the enemy he then returned to neshapoor where he spent the winter and in the spring of the year   0 he again returned to badwird which had been infested in his absence by toghril siljoki who fled upon the sultans approach toward tizin musaood after this exploit returned by the way of sirchus whose inhabitants had refused to pay their taxes but upon some of their chiefs being put to death they became more tractable and upon their submission the king continued his march to dindaka  his army surrounded by the turkumans the turkumans collecting their forces at dindaka surrounded the kings army securing the passes upon every side the sultan to bring them to an engagement drew out his army in order of battle which the enemy by no means declined advancing upon all quarters with barbarous shouts and great impetuosity is deserted by a great part of his army this uncommon method of charging discouraged the sultans troops and whether through fear or perfidy several of his generals in the beginning of the action rode off with their whole squadrons and joined the enemy the king enraged at this treachery and seeing his affairs in a desperate situation addressed himself in a few words to his friends about him musaood encourages his troops he told them that their own safety their long acquired honor the glory of their king and the security of their native country a d  0   higer   0 now depended upon one noble effort to revenge themselves upon their enemies and those still greater enemies who had so basely deserted their cause  his valor musaood then turning his horse to where he beheld the torrent of gleaming arms rolling on plunged singly to oppose the stream bearing down all before him and exhibiting such acts of gigantic force and valor as never king had before displayed a few of his friends rouzed by his words and actions and that innate honor which inspires the brave seconded their lord so well that whithersoever he turned his fatal sword the enemy were mowed down or retreated before him his army deserts him but now when victory seemed to blow on his standard misfortune was active behind it for when he looked round he beheld his whole army devouring the paths of flight  he opens a passage for himself through the enemy the king seeing himself thus shamefully deserted and that no hope from his single arm remained turned his steed and trampling down the enemy opened to himself a clear passage with his own sword when he reached the river near murve he met with a few of the fugitives who now began to collect themselves from all quarters he took from thence the way of ghor and proceeded to ghizni punishes the deserters there he seized upon the generals who had so ingloriously deserted him he ordered ali daia buctadi and sab sinai to be conveyed to hindostan and confined in a certain fort for life  he retreats to hindostan the sultan finding himself at this period unable to withstand the enemy resolved to withdraw to hindostan till he could collect his forces and make another effort to retrieve his affairs he left his son modood and his vizier chaja mahummud with four thousand horse to defend balich and ordered his other son amir mugdood a d  0   higer     who had come from lahore with two thousand horse to secure moultan in the mean time erid ear another of his sons was sent with a detachment to awe the mountain afghans near ghizni who were in arms he then collected all his wealth from the different strong holds to ghizni and laying it upon camels bent his way to lahore sending for his brother mahummud the blind from his confinement  a tumult in the camp when musaood arrived upon the banks of the gelum the water of which on account of its purity is called the water of paradise the slaves who were very numerous in his camp entered into a confederacy with the camel keepers and began to divide the treasure among them the troops observing this they were determined to partake of the spoil so that in a moment nothing was to be seen but drawn swords ravage and confusion every one plundered his neighbor some gained much wealth while others more weak or unfortunate were robbed of all upon which they had laid their hands and stripped of their own besides mahummud proclaimed king the army for this tumult fearing the resentment of the king and not choosing to refund the plunder hastened in a mob to mahummud the blind who had been before king and exalting him upon their shoulders proclaimed him emperor  musaood was during this time collecting what friends he could to suppress the mutiny but no sooner was it known that his brother was proclaimed king than the sultan found himself entirely deserted musaood deposed the mob pressing round him he was obliged to give himself up into their hands and he was carried before the new sultan mahummud told him he had no design to take his life and desired he might pitch upon some sort whither he might retire with his family into confinement sultan musaood in this extremity chose the fort of kurri but was even in distress for money to pay his few a d  0   higer     menial attendants this obliged him to send a person to his brother to request him for some sultan mahummud accordingly ordered the pitiful sum of five hundred dirms to be sent him upon which musaood when it was brought him exclaimed after the following manner o wonderful cast of providence o cruel reverse of fate yesterday was i not a mighty prince three thousand camels bending under my treasure today i am forced to beg and to receive but the mere mockery of my wants with that he borrowed a thousand dirms from his servants and bestowed it in a present upon his brothers messenger who had brought the five hundred dirms which he desired he might again carry back to his master  sultan mahummud upon his accession advanced his son ahmid to the government reserving for himself only the name though ahmid was by many supposed to have a tincture of madness in his disposition and assassinated the first thing he did was without consulting his father in conjunction with soliman ben eusoph and the son of ali cheshawind to go to the castle of kurri and assassinate sultan musaood in the year     but some affirm that he buried him alive in a well  his character the reign of musaood was nine years and nine months he was a prince of uncommon strength and bravery affable of easy access and generous to prodigality munificent to the learned particularly to learned men of whose company he was excessively fond which drew many from all parts to his court  among the first of the learned in the court of musaood we must reckon abu keihan charismi a great philosopher and astrologer who wrote one of the best treatises upon astronomy called canoon musaoodi for which he was presented with an elephant made of silver the size of which we are not told casi abu a d  0   higer     mahummud nasahi was also a man of much reputation in this age he wrote a book called musaoodi in support of the doctrine of abu hanifa which he presented to the king charitable the author of the rosit ul sulja tells us that so extensive was the kings charity that some days in the month of ramzan he bestowed often a lack of dirms upon the poor magnificent in the beginning of his reign he built many noble mosques and endowed many colleges and schools which he erected in different cities of his dominions  section vii the reign of abul fat chutub ul muluck shahab ul dowla amir modood ben musaood ben mamood ghiznavi mahummud grieves for the death of musaood when the news of the murder of musaood came to mahummud the blind he wept bitterly and severely reproached the assassins he at the same time wrote to modood who was then at balich that such and such people had killed his father calling god to witness that his hands were clear of the wicked deed to this modood replied sarcastically may god lengthen the days of so good and so merciful a king and grant that his mad son ahmid may gain glory in the practice of regicide till his reward be obtained from our hands  modood ascends the throne of ghizni modood was for marching immediately to revenge the death of his father but he was persuaded by his council to go first to ghizni where the citizens upon his approach thronged out to meet him and expressed their joy in acclamations and congratulations upon his accession  a d  0   higer     marches to revenge the death of his father in the year     he marched from ghizni while mahummud the blind appointing his younger son nami governor of pishawir and moultan marched in person to the banks of the sind to receive modood who was moving that way and the two armies meeting in the forest of diner between the uncle and nephew the flames of contention began to arise totally defeats mahummud the gales of victory at length began to fan the standards of modood while sultan mahummud with his sons and tiggi ali cheshawind and soliman ben eusoph were taken prisoners they were all put to death except abdul rahim the son of mahummud whom modood pardoned for this reason that during the time that musaood was prisoner abdul rahim went with his brother abdul reiman to see him when upon this occasion the latter insultingly threw off musaoods royal cap abdul rahim took it up and put it upon the kings head with much respect chastising his brother for his mean and barbarous behavior  modood having thus revenged his fathers murder built a town on the spot upon which he had obtained the victory and called it fat abad he carried the remains of his father and family to be interred at ghizni whither he returned and appointed abu niser ahmed his vizier but he soon after discharged that omrah from that high office and conferred the dignity upon chuja tahir he sent at the same time nisir ahmed with a force to moultan against nami the son of mahummud whom he slew reducing the country under the obedience of modood the sultan had now nothing to fear but from his own brother who was in possession of lahore and its dependencies this brother upon the murder of his father marched from moultan and by the council of eas possessed himself of all the country lying between the sind hassi and tannasar  a d  0   higer     modood sends an army against his brother sultan modood finding that his brother refused to pay him allegiance ordered an army against him mugdood being apprised of this expedition marched from hassi where he then resided with his whole force to oppose the sultans troops he came up with them before they reached lahore with an army so numerous that the forces of modood were upon the point of flying at their appearance several of the chiefs deserting their colors and enlisting themselves under the banners of mugdood but fortune here or treachery befriended modood who is found dead in his bed in the morning of the i would of sacrifice mugdood was found dead in his bed without any previous complaint or apparent cause of his decease but what seemed to discover the hand of traitors was that next day his counselor and friend eas was found dead in the same manner mugdoods army marched under the banners of modood so that the southern countries submitted in peace  nor was modood less fortunate toward the north the province of maverulnere which had for some time asserted its independance submitted but the siljokies notwithstanding the king had taken one of the daughters of their chief in marriage began to make incursions anew into his territories  invasion from delhi in the year     the raja of delhi in alliance with others raising an army took hassi tannassar and their dependencies from the governors to whom modood had entrusted them the hindoos from thence marched toward the sort of nagracot which they besieged for four months and the garrison being distressed for provisions and no succors coming from lahore were under the necessity of capitulating the hindoos according to the ancient form erected new idols and recommenced the rites of idolatry  a pretended vision we are told that the raja of delhi observing a weakness in the empire of ghizni pretended to have seen a vision in which a d  0   higer     the great idol of nagracot told him that having now revenged himself upon ghizni he would meet him at nagracot in his former temple this story being propagated by the brahmins who probably were in the secret it gained faith among the superstitious by which means the raja was joined by zealots from all parts and soon saw himself at the head of a very numerous army with this army as we have already mentioned he besieged nagracot and when the place surrendered a holy trick he took care to have an idol of the same shape and size with the former which he had caused to be made at delhi introduced in the night into a garden in the center of the place this image being discovered in the morning there was a prodigious rejoicing among his deluded votaries who exclaimed that their god was returned from ghizni the raja and the brahmins taking advantage of the credulity of the populace with great pomp and festivity carried him into the temple where he received the worship and congratulations of his people  this story raised so much the same of the idol that thousands came daily to worship from all parts of hindostan as also to consult him as an oracle upon all important occasions the manner of consultation was this the persons who came to inquire into futurity slept on the floor of the temple before him after drinking a dose of something which the brahmins prescribed to create dreams from which they predicted their fortune in the morning according to their own fancy  the siege of lahore the success of the raja of delhi gave such confidence to the rajas of punjaab and other places that though before like foxes they durst hardly creep from their holes for fear of the musselman arms yet now they put on the aspect of lions and openly set their masters at defiance three of those rajas with ten thousand horse and an innumerable army of foot advanced to lahore and invested it a d  0   higer     the mussulmen in defense of their laws families and effects exerted all imaginable valor upon this occasion during the space of seven months defending the town street by street for the walls being bad were soon laid in ruins is raised finding however that in the end they must be rooted out by this defensive war unless they had speedy succors they bound themselves by oath to devote their lives to victory or martyrdom and making a sally out of the city presented themselves in order of battle before the enemys camp the hindoos either struck with their unexpected appearance or intimidated by their resolution betook themselves instantly to flight and were pursued with great slaughter  in the year preceding this event the king sent artagi hajib with an army to tiberistan against the turkumans when he reached that place he heard that the son of daood had advanced to arkin the turkumans defeated but when the two armies drew up in order against one another the chief of the turkumans who was a young man without either experience or courage showed such pufillanimity in arranging his troops that the enemy had begun the charge before they were properly formed which occasioned an immediate confusion so that they abandoned the field and were pursued with great slaughter artagi having returned from the pursuit marched directly to balich which the turkumans had taken and recovered that city out of their hands  not long after the turkumans advanced again with a powerful force and invested the same place as it was not very defensible and artagi was too weak to engage the enemy in the field he wrote to modood for succors the succors not arriving and the general finding his difficulties daily increasing and his force diminishing determined to evacuate the place which he accordingly did and fled to ghizni with a few of his attendants but the popular outery was so great against the unfortunate artagi that the sultan was obliged a d  0   higer     artagi hajib put to death in some measure to silence the clamor by the death of his servant about this time another tribe of the turkumans of ghizizi made an incursion into the ghiznian territories by the way of bust against whom modood sent an army which gave them a signal defeat  the turkumans repeatedly defeated in the year     chaja tahir the vizier was deposed and chaja abul fat abdul rysaac was exalted to that dignity and in the same year tughril hajib was sent with a force toward bust from whence he proceeded to seistan and brought his own brother and ringi abu munsur who had rebelled against the king prisoners to ghizni the turkumans of siljoki in the year following collected all their forces and directed their march toward ghizni plundering the palace of bust tughril was ordered against them with the troops of ghizni and he defeated them with great slaughter and pursued them out of the country after this victory tughril marched immediately against the turkumans of candahar whom they called redcaps and defeating them also took many prisoners whom he brought to ghizni  tughril revolts in the    th year tughril was again ordered to bust with a numerous army but when he came to tiggiabad he began to discover the traitor news of his revolt having reached modood he sent some persons to endeavor to reclaim him to his duty with promises of pardon and a removal of all the disgusts which he might have entertained to this tughril replied that the reason of this step was to secure himself that he had an information of a plot formed against his life by those sycophants whose only business was to stand by the throne and to amuse the too easy ears of the king with lies and flattery that being once forced to disobedience he had for a subject gone too far to retreat the kings emissaries however though they had no effect upon tughril found that the most part of the chiefs were still loyal to the king and brought over others who a d  0   higer     had changed rather out of a desire of innovation than disaffection to their sovereign upon this they returned and having told to the king in what manner things were concerted with the other chiefs he immediately ordered ali ben ribbi with two thousand horse to favor the insurrection deserted by his army so that tughril finding himself deserted by the army upon the appearance of ali ben ribbi betook himself to flight with a few of his adherents  madood willidingi hajib bab tiggi was in the same year sent to ghor to the assistance of willidingi who joining him with his force they

and raising a great army marched toward ghizni besieges ghizni where abdul reshid being almost destitute of troops was forced to shut himself up but the place being very extensive it was impossible for him to defend it long which he however did to the last extremity the sultan taken and  ghizni was taken at length and the sultan with nine of the blood royal were inhumanly put to death by the usurper who now ascended the throne but tughril did not long enjoy the fruits of his villainy having wrote to noshtagi hajib endeavoring to bring him over by fair means to acknowledge him that chief answered him with the contempt he deserved  hajib at the same time wrote private letters to the daughter of musaood whom the tyrant had compelled to marry him as also to all the omrahs who he knew had retained their loyalty for the imperial family spiriting them up to conspire against the usurpers life the usurper assassinated they were so far excited to resentment that a conspiracy was forthwith formed amongst them and put in execution on new years day when tughril was stepping up to the throne to give public audience thus the usurper at the end of forty days arrived at his tragical end

certain author tells us that tughril being one day asked by one of his intimate friends  what induced him to think of aspiring to the empire replied that when abdul reshid dispatched him to take the government of seistan he found that his hand trembled from which circumstance he concluded that he was destitute of that resolution and fortitude which are necessary accomplishments of a king  section

to invade ghizni he advanced with a numerous army while noshtagi collecting all his forces went forth to meet him when the armies engaged the fire of gleaming steel was extinguished in torrents of blood for from the rising to the setting of the sun the warriors on both sides labored in the field of death and though thousands a d  0   higer     fell at their feet they seemed insensible of their own mortality overthrows the turkumans victory at length declared for noshtagi while his enemies betook themselves to flight leaving all their camp equipage and baggage on the field to the conquerors who immediately returned victorious to ghizni  this victory served to establish feroch zaad without fear upon the throne he now exalted the standard of triumph and inclined it toward chorrassan where on the part of the siljoki he was met by callisarick one of their principal omrahs with a numerous army feroch zaad overthrows the turkumans when the engagement commenced such a flame of rage and contention appeared as the tongue of the travelers of the plain of eloquence cannot sufficiently express then also the gales of victory fanned the royal standards of ghizni and callisarick and several other persons of note were taken prisoners  defeated by alib arsilla intelligence of this defeat coming to daood siljoki he collected all his forces which he submitted to the command of his son alib arsilia a youth of great expectations arsilla advanced to oppose the king and having engaged him with great resolution recovered the honor of the turkumans and took many of the omrahs of ghizni prisoners in the pursuit but he did not think proper at that time to make further use of his fortune and he therefore returned with his victorious army  prisoners released when sultan feroch zaad arrived at ghizni he called callisarick and all the prisoners of the turkumans into his presence bestowed upon each of them the honor of a dress and gave them their liberty the turkumans returning home represented in so strong a light the humanity of the king that daood ashamed to be outdone in a virtuous action ordered the prisoners of ghizni to be also released  a d  0   higer   0 sultan

flower of his youth amidst a paradise of pleasure conquered all the sensual appetites and added two months more to the feast of ramzan which he kept with the strictest severity he at the same time gave proper attention to government and the due administration of justice and opened the hand of charity to the poor this prince excelled in the art of fine writing and in the libraries of mecca and medina there are two copies of the koran wrote by his own hand which were sent as presents to the caliph  peace with the turkumans in the first year of his reign he concluded a treaty of peace with the turkumans ceding to them a d  0   higer   0 all the countries they had seized upon condition that they would not lengthen the hand of violence any further upon his dominions he married at the same time his son musaood to the daughter of their king malleck shaw which opened the door of friendship and intercourse between the two nations  we are told that before this peace was concluded malleck shaw had collected a great army with an intention to invade ghizni which greatly intimidated ibrahim as he was not then in a condition to oppose him policy of ibrahim but knowing that policy is sometimes a good substitute for strength he wrote letters to the principal omrahs of malleck shaws army which he dispatched by a messenger who had received his instructions how to proceed the purport of those letters was to importune the omrahs to whom they were directed to hasten the kings march to ghizni lest their scheme should be prematurely discovered and that they might depend upon his fulfilling his engagements to their satisfaction  king of the turkomans deceived the messenger accordingly took an opportunity one day when malleck shaw was hunting upon the road to ghizni to come running toward him but upon discovering the king he stole slowly away which creating suspicion he was pursued by some horsemen and brought before the king he was immediately searched and the packet was found upon him though he had previously suffered himself to be severely bastinadoed without confessing any thing the king having read these letters the power of the supposed conspirators was such that there was great danger in accusing them but it raised such a diffidence in his mind that he from that time was desirous of peace and gave over all thoughts of his expedition  when the mind of ibrahim was quieted from any apprehensions from that quarter he sent an army toward hindostan and conquered a d  0   higer     many places in that country which before had not been visited by the mussulman arms ibrahims expedition to hindostan in the year     he marched himself toward that country and extended his conquests to the fort of ajodin called now palanshukurgunge this place being taken he turned to another fort called rupal which was built upon the summit of a steep hill a river enclosed it on three sides and a small peninsula joined it to the other hills which were entirely covered with an impervious wood and much infested by venomous serpents this however did not discourage the sultan from his attempt he ordered some thousand hatchet men to clear the wood which they effected in spite of all opposition and the rock being soft the miners forced their way in a short time under the walls which were brought down in ruins takes rupal the place was immediately taken and the garrison made prisoners  he marched from thence to another town in the neighborhood the inhabitants of which came originally from chorrassan and were banished thither with their families by afransiab a name common to a long race of persian kings  for frequent rebellions here they formed themselves into a small independent state being encircled by impassible mountains and had preserved their ancient customs and rites without intermarrying with any other people the sultan having with infinite labor cleared a road for his army over the mountains advanced toward the town which was well fortified he was overtaken by the rainy season and his army was greatly distressed during three months he was obliged to remain idle before it but when the rains began to abate and the country to dry up he summoned the town to surrender and acknowledge the faith  ibrahims proposals being rejected he commenced the siege which continued some weeks with great slaughter on both sides the a d  0   higer     town at length was taken by assault and the mussulmen found much wealth within it and one hundred thousand unfortunate persons whom they carried bound to ghizni some time after the king accidentally saw one of those unhappy men carrying a heavy stone with great difficulty and labor to a palace which was then building this awakened his pity he commanded him to throw it down and gave him his liberty  this stone happened to lie upon the public road and proved troublesome to passengers but as the kings rigid adherence to his commands was universally known none would attempt to remove it a courtier one day having stumbled with his horse over this stone took occasion to mention it to the king insinuating that he thought if his majesty pleased that it were advisable to have it removed to which the king replied i have commanded it to be thrown there and there it must remain as a memorial of the misfortunes of war and my own pity for it is better for a king to be obstinate even in his inadvertencies than to break his royal word the stone was accordingly permitted to remain where it is shown as a curiosity to this day  sultan ibrahim had thirty six sons and forty daughters the latter he gave in marriage to learned and religious men in the year     he left this mortal state after having reigned in tranquillity and happiness forty two years in his time

make peace between them but sultan sinjer was found to continue his march which convinced arsilla haw that he could have no dependence upon any thing but his sword arsilla deceived by his mother but his mother mehid irac being offended with him for the murder of his brother musaood and his inhuman treatment of her other children with well dissembled affection prevailed upon him to send her to

literature and a liberal patron of learned men many men of letters resorted to his court particularly shech nizami and seid hassen both poets and philosophers of great fame many books were in this reign translated from various languages into the persian tongue among the most famous of which was an hindoo book called the killila dumna a fabulous story pregnant with sound morality policy and entertainment  a digression this book was sent formerly by the king of hindostan accompanied by a chess table to noshirwan surnamed the just king of iran buzurg chimere his vizier surnamed the wise was so well versed in all the known languages that in a few days he translated the killila dumna into phelevi or ancient persic to the astonishment of the ambassador who imagined the sanscrita language was entirely unknown in those parts but he could form no conception of the chessboard as that game was at that time unknown in persia he therefore had recourse to the ambassador who was esteemed the best player in hindostan to have this matter explained to him who having accordingly discovered to him the principles buzurg chimere sat down with him to play the first game he obliged the ambassador to draw the second he chaced his king solitary and the third he gave him checkmate the ambassador was so mad to be soiled at his own weapons that he would play no more buzurg chimere then invented the game of backgammon returning a set of those a d      higer     tables by the ambassador who having related his adventure with buzurg chimere and given an account of the genius and government of noshirwan his master gave up all thoughts of an invasion which he had been meditating against that king  the present of the chessboard was intended as an experiment upon the genius of the minister and to indicate that in the great game of state attention and capacity were better friends than fortune while the book in its whole tenor strongly inculcated that wise maxim that true wisdom and policy is always an overmatch for strength the backgammon table which was returned signified that attention and capacity alone cannot always insure success but that we must play the game of

historian tells us that about the time when feredoon subdued zohac tazi two brothers of that family souri and saam were taken into favor by the conqueror but having by some means incurred his displeasure they fled with a party of their friends to hawind where they took up their abode possessing themselves of a small territory souri took the government of this district appointing his brother to the command of his small army and gave his daughter in marriage to his son suja  suja the first of that race suja after his fathers decease enjoyed his place but some private enemies having traduced him to his uncle inspired him with jealousy and enmity to such a degree that he wanted to take his daughter away from him when suja found this he was determined to seek his fortune elsewhere flies to the mountains of ghor he accordingly in the night with ten horsemen and a few camels laden with his effects set out with his wife and children to the mountains of ghor where he built a house and called it romejandish that is go without care   here he was gradually joined by many of his friends who built a strong fort which he held out against the troops of feredoon for some time but at length he was obliged to submit and pay tribute  thus the race of zohac one after another succeeded to this government which began to gain strength by degrees till the time of the prophet when it was ruled by shinsub who some say was converted to the faith by the great ali who confirmed him in his kingdom the genealogy of the house of ghor the genealogy of the kings of ghor according to the most

of rendering himself independent commenced a war against sultan ibrahim by whom he was defeated and taken prisoner the kingdom being conferred upon his son mahummud who swore allegiance to the empire of ghizni he was succeeded by his son cuttub ul dien hussein who was killed by an arrow in the eye in attacking a certain fort when he rebelled against ghizni  the adventures of sham upon the death of cuttub his son sham was obliged to fly to hindostan where he followed the business of a merchant and having acquired much wealth he returned up the indus to his native country wrecked on the indus but unfortunately he was wrecked narrowly escaping with his life upon a plank with his son ezid ul dien hussein after driving with the tide for three days when they got foot on shore they made toward a town that appeared in sight but it being late before they arrived they could find no lodgings and were obliged to creep in under a balcony where they might sleep out of the rain the watch going the rounds perceived them and without further examination concluding they were thieves carried them to prison condemned to slavery they were condemned to slavery for seven years during which time the son died  when sham obtained his liberty he proceeded toward ghizni on the way to which he was met by a gang of robbers that had for a long time infested the roads taken with robbers when they saw him a man of great strength and of a bold appearance they insisted upon enrolling him in the gang to which he was obliged to consent but unfortunately that very night a party of the troops of sultan ibrahim surrounded them and carried them all in chains before the emperor condemned to death who immediately condemned them to death  when the executioner was binding up the eyes of sham he raised a grievous complaint protesting and calling god to witness that he was innocent which softened the steely heart of the executioner to pity he desired him to relate what he had to say in his own defense which he did in such a circumstantial and probable manner that the magistrate who attended believing him innocent petitioned the king to give him a hearing pardoned and received into favor by sultan ibrahim this being accordingly granted he acquitted himself with such modesty and eloquence that the king commanded him to be released and admitted him into his particular friendship and favor ibrahim some time after created sham an omrah and appointed him master of requests in which station he acquitted himself so honorably that he rose daily in rank and honors till sultan musaood the son of ibrahim put him in possession of his hereditary kingdom he then married a princess of the house of ghizni by whom he had seven sons denominated the seven stars  history of his sons after the death of hussein

to great power he meditated an attempt upon the empire of ghizni collecting soldiers of fortune from all parts but byram shaw being privately acquainted of his intentions treacherously invited him in friendship to ghizni where contrary to all the laws of honor and hospitality he ordered poison to be administered to him which proved the fatal cause of the war between the houses of ghor and ghizni  seif ul dien souri the fifth son who had accompanied his brother escaped the snare and fled to firose ko he there placed himself at the head of his brothers army and marched toward ghizni to revenge his death as we have seen in the history of that kingdom he took ghizni and byram shaw fled to hindostan but byram returning again in the winter when the troops of seif ul dien were mostly gone to ferose ko and ghor from whence they could not easily return on account of the roads and deep snow seif ul dien as before related was treacherously delivered up to him and with his vizier put to a most ignominious death  the consequence of this impolitic cruelty was that baha ul dien sham the sixth brother prepared to invade byram with an army from firoze ko and ghor but dying in the interim the command devolved upon the seventh brother alla ul dien the incendiary who took and destroyed ghizni he carried his ravages so far as to destroy every monument and tomb of the ghiznian kings excepting

endeavored to make by their unbounded generosity and liberality to military men whom they began to collect from all parts they began to extend their limits this having reached the ears of alla ul dien he sent a force against them and seizing them both confined them in the fort of goristan  alla then turned the hostile spear against sultan sinjer to whom his father paid tribute he overrun the

that kingdom  in the year     sultan yeas ul dien marched in person against the omrahs of chusero malleck and entirely reduced them he gave the government of ghizni to shab ul dien who according to his brothers orders in the year     led an army toward moultan which he entirely subdued he marched from thence to adja the raja of that place shut himself up in a strong fort shab ul dien began to besiege the place but finding it would be a difficult task to reduce it he sent a private message to the rajas wife promising to marry her if she would make away with her husband  a d      higer     the base woman returned for answer that she was rather too old herself to think of matrimony but that she had a beautiful young daughter whom if he would promise to espouse and leave her in free possession of the country and its wealth she would in a few days remove the raja shab ul dien basely accepted of the proposal and the wicked woman accordingly in a few days found means to assassinate her husband and to open the gates to the enemy  shab ul dien confirmed his promise by marrying the daughter upon acknowledging the true faith but he made no scruple to deviate from what respected the mother for instead of trusting her with the country he sent her off to ghizni where she soon died of grief and resentment nor did the daughter relish her situation better for in the space of two years she also fell a victim to grief  sultan shab ul dien having conferred the government of moultan and adja upon ali kirbach returned to ghizni from whence in the year     he again marched to adja and moultan and from those places continued his course through the sandy desert to guzerat raja bim deo advanced thither with a great army to give him battle in which the mussulmen were defeated with great slaughter and suffered many hardships in their retreat till they arrived at ghizni  in the year following he marched his recruited army toward peshawir known in ancient history by the names of bickraam firshoor and poorshoor which he in a short time brought under subjection he proceeded in the course of the next year toward lahore where he invested chusero malleck who had been so weakened at that time by wars with the rajas of hind and the afghans that he could not oppose him in the field but shab ul dien finding he could not reduce the place he intimated a desire of treating with a d      higer     chusero malleck who glad to get rid of him made him some presents and gave his son as an hostage for the performance of the rest of the agreement between them  shab ul dien returned to ghizni but he could not rest long in peace he the very next year drew his army toward dewil in the province of sind and subdued all the country to the sea coast returning loaded with rich spoil  higer   0 in the year   0 he returned again to lahore where chusero malleck shut himself up as before sustaining a long siege which at length shab ul dien was obliged to raise he in this expedition built the fort of salcot in which he left a garrison to command the countries between the rivers ravi and chinab under the government of hussein churmili while he himself returned to ghizni this fort as we have before related was ineffectually besieged by chusero malleck in the absence of shab ul dien which occasioned his third expedition toward lahore which he took in the year     by the perfidious stratagem mentioned in the conclusion of the history of ghizni the sultan extirpates the royal family of ghizni he sent chusero malleck and his family prisoners to his brother at firose ko who confined them in a fort in ghirgistan where they were some time afterward put to death on account of something the astrologers had predicted concerning them  when shab ul dien had settled the provinces of lahore he left the government of that place in the hands of ali kirbach governor of moultan and returned himself to ghizni he marches to hindostan in the year     he marched again toward hindostan and proceeding to ajmere took the capital of tiberhind where he left malleck zea ul dien with above a thousand chosen horse and some foot to garrison the place he himself was upon his way back when he heard that pittu ra the raja of ajmere with his brother candi ra raja of delhi in alliance a d      higer     with some other hindoo rajas were marching toward tiberhind with two hundred thousand horse and three thousand elephants shab ul dien determined to return to the relief of the garrison he met the enemy at the village of sirauri upon the banks of the sirsutti seven crores from tannassar and forty crores from delhi and gave them battle  engages the hindoos upon the first onset his right and left wings retired being outflanked by the enemy till joining in the rear his army was formed into a circle shab ul dien who was in person in the center of the line when first formed was told that his right and left wings were defeated and advised to provide for his own safety enraged at this council he smote the imprudent adviser and rushed on toward the enemy among whom he commenced with a few followers a great slaughter  a single combat between the sultan and the raja of delhi the eyes of candi ra raja of delhi fell upon him he drove the elephant upon which he was mounted directly against him the sultan rising from his horse threw his lance with such force at the elephant that he drove out three of his back teeth he is overthrown in the mean time the raja of delhi from above pierced the sultan through the right arm and had almost thrown him to the ground when some of his chiefs advanced to his rescue this gave an opportunity to one of his faithful servants to leap behind him as he was sinking from his horse and supporting him in his arms he carried him from the field which by this time was deserted almost by his whole army the enemy pursued them near twenty crores  after this defeat and when he had recovered of his wound at lahore he appointed governors to the different provinces he possessed in hindostan and returned himself to ghor with his army at ghor he disgraced all those omrahs who had deserted him in battle a d      higer     extraordinary punishment of cowardly omrahs he obliged them to walk round the city with their horses mouthbags filled with barley hanging about their necks at the same time forcing them to eat or have their heads struck off the former of which they chiefly chose to do  we are told by eben asire contrary to all other authority that when sultan shab ul dein was wounded he fell from his horse and lay upon the field among the dead till night and that in the dark a party of his own horse returned to search for his body and carried him off to his own camp  the combined rajas take tiberhind upon the retreat of the sultan the allied rajas continued their march to tiberhind which they besieged for one year and one month and at last were obliged to give favorable terms of capitulation sultan shab ul dien remained a few months with his brother at ghor and then returning to ghizni spent the ensuing year in indolence and festivity the sultan raises a fine army but ambition again fermenting in his mind he recruited a noble army consisting of one hundred thousand chosen horse turks persians and afghans many of whom had their helmets ornamented with jewels and their armor inlaid with silver and gold with these he marched in martial splendour from ghizni toward hindostan without disclosing to his friends any part of his intentions  his conference with a sage when his victorious spears had advanced as far as peshawir an old sage of ghor prostrating himself before him said o king we trust in thy conduct and wisdom but as yet thy design has been a subject of much dispute and speculation among us shab ul dien replied know old man that since the time of my defeat in hindostan notwithstanding external appearances i have never slumbered in ease nor waked but in sorrow and anxiety i have therefore determined with this army to recover my lost honor from those a d      higer     idolaters or die in the noble attempt the sage kissing the ground said victory and triumph be thy attendants and fortune be the guide of thy paths but o king let the petition of thy slave find favor and let those omrahs you have so justly disgraced be permitted to take this glorious opportunity of wiping away their dishonorable stains  sends for the dishonored omrahs the prince listened to his request and sent an order to ghizni to release the disgraced omrahs from their confinement and that such of them as were desirous of recovering their honor might now attend his stirrup they accordingly obeyed the order and were each honored with a chelat according to their rank declares war against the hindoos the next day the royal standard was put in motion and the army advanced to moultan where the sultan conferred titles and employments upon all who had been firm to his interest he then proceeded to lahore from whence he dispatched ruckun ul dien humza one of his principal omrahs ambassador to ajmere with a declaration of war if they should reject the true faith  raja pittu rai gave a disrespectful answer to the embassy and immediately wrote for succors to all the neighboring rajas they meet him with a numerous army nor did his allies delay their coming and therefore he soon advanced to meet shab ul dien with an army consisting according to the lowest and most moderate account of three hundred thousand horse of rajaputs kittries and others besides above three thousand elephants and foot innumerable as the locusts the hindoos again waited to receive shab ul dien upon the former field of battle the two armies encamped in sight of each other with the river sursutti between them  the hindoo rajas of whom there were one hundred and fifty in this enormous camp having assembled rubbed tica upon a d      higer     their foreheads and swore by the water of the ganges that they should conquer their enemies or die martyrs to their faith they then wrote a letter to shab ul dien in these haughty terms the haughty letter of the rajas to the sultan to the bravery of our troops we imagined you was no stranger and to our great superiority in number which daily increases your eyes will bear testimony of the truth if you are wearied of your own existence yet have pity upon your troops who may still think it a happiness to live it were better then you should repent in time of the foolish resolution you have taken and we shall permit you to retreat in safety but if you have determined to force your evil destiny we have sworn by our gods to advance upon you with our rankbreaking elephants wartreading horses and bloodthirsting soldiers early in the morning to crush the unfortunate army which your ambition has led to ruin  the sultans answer sultan shab ul dien returned them this politic answer  that he had drawn his army into hindostan by the command of his brother whose general he only was and that honor and duty bound him to exert the utmost of his capacity in his service that therefore he could not retreat without his leave but would be glad to obtain a truce till he informed him of the situation of affairs and received his answer  this letter produced the intended effect for the enemy imagined that shab ul dien was intimidated and they spent the night in riot and revelry while the sultan was preparing for a surprise he surprises their camp he accordingly forded the river a little before the dawn of the morning drew up his army on the sands and had entered part of the hindoo camp before the alarm was spread notwithstanding the confusion that naturally reigned on this occasion among the hindoos their camp was of such an amazing extent that the greater part had sufficient time to form the line which served to cover the rout so that now they began to advance with great resolution and some order in four lines  a d      higer     sultan shab ul dien upon seeing this ordered his troops to halt and his army which had been divided into four parts were commanded to renew the attack by turns wheeling off to the rear after they had discharged their bows a certain number of times upon the enemy giving ground gradually as they advanced with their elephants a battle in this manner he retreated and fought till the sun was approaching the west when thinking he had sufficiently wearied the enemy and deluded them with a security of victory he put himself at the head of twelve thousand of his best horse whose riders were covered with steel and giving orders to his generals to second him he made a resolute charge and carried death and confusion among the hindoo ranks the disorder increased every where till at length it became general the mussulman troops as if now only serious in fight made such a dreadful slaughter that this prodigious army once shaken like a great building was lost in its own ruins the hindoos overthrown the enemy recoiled like a troubled torrent from the bloody plain  candi rai raja of delhi and many other rajas were slain in the field while pittu rai was taken in the pursuit and afterward put to death the spoil of the camp which was immensely rich fell into the hands of the conquerors and the forts of sursutti samana koram and hassi surrendered after the victory shub ul dien settles the conquered countries sultan shab ul dien in person went to ajmere and took possession of it after having barbarously put some thousands of the unfortunate inhabitants to the sword reserving the rest for slavery but upon a promise of a punctual payment of a large tribute he gave up the country to gola the son of pittu rai he then turned his standards toward delhi but he was prevailed upon by the new raja with great presents to abandon that enterprise he left cuttub ul dien abeik in the town of koram with a considerable detachment and marched himself with the body of his army toward the mountains of sewalic which lie to the north of hindostan destroying and plundering all the countries in his way to ghizni  a d      higer     exploits of cuttub in hindostan after the return of the sultan cuttub ul dien abiek who had been formerly a slave raised an army and took the fort of merat and the city of delhi from the family of candi rai it was from this circumstance that foreign nations say that the empire of delhi was founded by a slave in the year     he also took the fort of kole and making delhi the seat of his government there established himself in security obliging all the districts around to acknowledge the mussulman faith  sultan shab ul dien in the mean time marched from ghizni toward kinnoge and engaged rai joy chund who was lord of kinnoge and benaris and who

treasure which in a few days he took and found there gold silver and precious stones to a great amount he marched from thence to benaris and broke down the idols in above one thousand temples which he purified and consecrated to the true god here he also found immense plunder he returned then to the fort of kole where he again confirmed cuttub ul dien in the regency of hindostan and from thence laden with treasure he took the rout of ghizni  in the mean time one of the relations of pitta rai whose name was himrage invaded gola the son of pittu rai and drove him out of ajmere gola immediately had recourse for assistance to cuttub ul dien abiek cuttub accordingly marched in the year     from delhi against himrage who having collected a great army gave the mussulmen battle in which he lost

up in the city the sultan pitched his camp on the banks of the great canal which the chilligies had formerly dug to the westward of that city he forthwith attacked the place and in a few days lost

he was totally defeated losing all his elephants and treasure  he is again totally overthrown in the mean time sultan osman and abieck who had taken a circuit to cut off shab ul diens retreat met him full in the face as he was flying from charizm shaw under a fatal necessity he was obliged to rally his army who now saw no safety in flight surrounded thus by the enemy he commenced a desperate carnage but valor was overpowered by numbers in the end and of his late mighty army there now remained scarce a hundred men who a d   0  higer  00 still defended their king and in spite of innumerable foes hewed him out a passage and conducted him safe to the fort of hindohood which was at a small distance from the field shab ul dien was besieged here by the enemy but upon paying a great ransom to

of his officers of state named abiek nack birka escaped from the field and imagining the king was slain with very great expedition made his way to moultan without mentioning the affair to any body he waited immediately upon mere dad hassen governor of that province and told him that he had a private message from the king hassen retired with him into his closet where the villain whispering in his ear drew out a dagger and stabbed him to the heart he ran instantly into the court yard where he proclaimed aloud that he had killed the traitor mere dad hassen in obedience to the kings command producing then a false order and commission to take the government into his own hands he was acknowledged by the army and the people  the chief of the gickers aspires to the throne the chief of the gickers at this time hearing that the king was certainly slain aspired to the empire and raising a great army advanced toward lahore kindling the war between the rivers gelum and sodra the sultan refused admittance into ghizni when the sultan from the fort of hindohood arrived at ghizni his own slave ildecuz having seized upon the supreme authority in the city presented himself to oppose his entrance which obliged the king to continue his rout to moultan there birka also rebelled against him but the sultan being by this time joined by many of his friends gave him battle and obtaining a complete victory took the traitor prisoner he then with all the troops of the borders of hindostan who now joined his standard a d   0  higer  00 marched to ghizni and the citizens presenting him with the head of the rebellious slave obtained their pardon  shab ul dien at this time concluded a treaty of peace with charizm shaw and then in order to chastise the gickers drew his army toward hindostan cuttub ul dien attacked them on the other side with his army from delhi and the gickers being defeated and dispersed the sultan parted at lahore with cuttub ul dien who returned to his government of delhi  during the residence of the sultan at lahore the gickers who inhabited the country from the nilaab up to the fort of the mountains of sewalic began to exercise unheard of cruelties upon the mussulmen so that the communication between peshawir and moultan was entirely cut off the gickers a tribe of barbarians these gickers were a race of wild barbarians without either religion or morality it was a custom among them as soon as a female child was born to carry her to the market place and there proclaim aloud holding the child in one hand and a knife in the other that any person who wanted a wife might now take her otherwise she was immediately put to death by this means they had more men than women which occasioned the custom of several husbands to one wife when this wife was visited by one of her husbands she set up a mark at the door which being observed by any of the others who might be coming on the same errand he immediately withdrew till the signal was taken away  they are converted this barbarous people continued to make incursions upon the mahommedans till in the latter end of this kings reign their chieftain was converted to the mussulman faith by one of his captives he upon this change of principles addressed the king who advised him to endeavor to convert his people and at the same time honored him with a title and dress and confirmed him in a d   0  higer  0  the command of the mountains a great part of these mountaineers being very indifferent about religion followed the opinions of their chief and acknowledged the true faith at the same time about four hundred thousand caffers of teraiba who inhabited the mountains between ghizni and punjaab were converted some by force and others by inclination  the sultan having settled the affairs of hindostan in peace marched in the year  0  from lahore to ghizni shab ul dien proposes to invade turkestan he conferred the government of bamia upon baha ul dien saam with orders that when he himself should march toward turkestan to take satisfaction for his former defeat to march at an appointed time with all the forces of those parts and encamp on the banks of the geihu where he would receive further orders and at the same time to throw a bridge over the river  twenty gickers form a conspiracy shab ul dien upon the second of shaban having reached the banks of the nilaab at a place called rimeik twenty gickers who had lost some of their relations in their wars with the sultan entered into a conspiracy against his life and sought an opportunity to put their wicked purpose in execution the weather being close and sultry the king ordered the canats screens which surround the kings tents forming a large square of his tents to be struck to give free admission to the air which gave them an opportunity of seeing the kings sleeping tent they cut their way through the screens in the night and hid themselves in a corner while one of them advanced to the door but being there stopped by one of the guards who was going to seize him he buried his dagger in his breast the groans of the dying man being heard within alarmed the rest of the guards in the outer tent who running out to see what was the matter the other assassins took that opportunity of cutting their way through the kings tent behind a d   0  higer  0  they found him asleep with two slaves fanning him who stood petrified with terror when they beheld the assassins advancing toward the sultan the sultan assassinated they at once plunged all their daggers in his body he was afterward found to have been pierced with no less than forty wounds  thus tragically fell that great king and conqueror moaz ul dien in the year  0  after a reign of thirty two years from the commencement of his government over ghizni and three from his accession to the empire the honors and titles of which he permitted his elder brother to retain during his life one daughter only remained of his race  his vizier chaja moweid ul mulluck took some of the assassins and put them to a cruel death he then called the omrahs together and having obtained their promise of fidelity in protecting the kings treasure which was loaded on four thousand camels he prevented the army and the slaves who had proposed to plunder it from putting their scheme in execution he carried the body in mournful pomp toward ghizni disputes about the succession but when they reached peshawir a great contest arose about the succession the omrahs of ghor insisting upon baha ul dien saam governor of bamia and one of the seven sons of ezid dien hussein and the vizier and turkish chiefs on yeas ul dien mamood son of the former emperor  the vizier therefore wanted to go by the way of kirma where he knew that the governor ildecuz was in the interest of yeas ul dien hoping by his assistance to secure at least the treasure for his own party the omrahs of ghor were equally desirous of proceeding by that road which lay nearest to bamia that

sultan shab ul dien the sultan purchased him and called his name abiek from having his little finger broke his rise he behaved himself in such a becoming and assiduous manner that he soon attracted the notice of his prince and daily gained confidence and favor generosity one night the sultan kept a magnificent festival at court and ordered a liberal distribution of presents and money to be made among his servants abiek partook largely of his munificence but had no sooner retired than he divided his share among his companions the prince having heard of this circumstance asked him the cause and abiek kissing the earth replied that all his wants were amply supplied by his majestys bounty affability he had therefore no desire of burthening himself with superfluities his favor being a certain independence capacity this answer so pleased the king that he immediately gave him an office near his person and in a little time was so satisfied with his diligence and capacity that he appointed him master of the horse  when the princes of ghor ghizni and bamia had drawn their forces toward chorrassan in order to expel the shaw sultan of charizm from that province abiek went out

animal pined away with visible sorrow and expired the third day after this was the only white elephant of which we have ever heard in hindostan but it is said that the king of pegu keeps always two

him with some fine jewels and two melons of gold when he had settled the country he again returned to delhi from whence he wrote to the king a particular account of his conquests which so pleased

rajas of the rajaputs had entered into an alliance with the raja of narwalla and had formed a design to recover ajmere from the mahommedans the troops of cuttub ul dien being dispersed over the provinces he was forced to march against the rajaputs with what small part of the army lay in delhi to prevent their junction with the forces of narwalla and is defeated but he was defeated received

and conduct that having trodden down their ranks above fifty thousand of the enemy with their blood tempered the dust of the field twenty thousand were taken prisoners and an immense spoil fell into his hands  marches to guzerat when he had given his army some respite from slaughter and fatigue he pursued his rout into guzerat and ravaged that country without further opposition taking the city of

divided the remainder among his trusty partners in the glories of the field  in the year     he mustered his forces and marched to the siege of calinger where he was met by the raja of that country whom he defeated and dismounting his cavalry began to besiege him in his fort the raja seeing himself hard pressed offered cuttub ul dien the same tribute and presents which his ancestors had formerly paid to sultan mamood the proposal was accepted but the vizier who wanted to hold out without coming to any terms found means to make away with the raja while the presents were preparing to be sent the flag of hostility was again hoisted upon the fort and the siege recommenced the place however was in a short time takes calinger reduced on account of the drying up of a spring upon that hill whereon the fort stood and which supplied the garrison with water there is a tradition among the natives of the place that the above fountain always dries up upon the discharging the artillery of the place this story may possibly from a natural cause have some foundation but we are rather tempted to believe that the present drying up of this spring was owing to the increase of inhabitants and the thirst occasioned by hard duty for besides the garrison cuttub ul dien found there fifty thousand male and female  takes mhoba and budaso the plunder of this city was very great in gold jewels and precious effects cuttub then marched to the city of mhoba the capital of the raja of calpee he also took that place together with budaso between the rivers jumna and ganges mahummud bucht ear chillige

toward ghizni and in a manner surprised the king who had no intelligence of his design till the day before his arrival expelled from ghizni it was now too late to put himself in a proper state of

slaves whom he afterward adopted as his children four of those slaves besides cuttub ul dien became great princes of whom the present taje ul dien eldoze was one the king having observed him to be a youth of genius advanced him gradually till at last he bestowed upon him the government of kirma and shinoran which lay between ghizni and hindostan his situation gave him an opportunity of frequently entertaining his prince upon his expeditions to and from that country which he always did with great magnificence and festivity making presents to all the kings attendants  sultan shab ul dien in his last expedition savoured taje ul dien so much that he bestowed upon him the black standard of the kingdom of ghizni by this intimating his will that he should succeed to that throne but upon the death of that monarch the turkish omrahs were desirous that sultan yeas ul dien ben sham should come from ghor and reign at ghizni yeas ul dien being a man of an indolent disposition declined it and said that he was content with the throne of his ancestors ascends the throne of ghizni he however assumed the imperial title proclaimed taje ul dien king of ghizni and was content to maintain the appearance of that power which he would not or rather durst not enforce  the first thing taje ul dien eldoze did after his accession was to invade punjab and lahore as we have seen in the former reign he was defeated by cuttub ul dien abiek and in consequence lost his own kingdom which however he soon after recovered he afterward in conjunction with sultan yeas ul dien mamood sent an army to herat

being taken died in confinement the time of his reign was nine years  as we have already given the history of two of shab ul diens slaves who arrived at the imperial dignity it may not be improper here to say something of tughril who raised himself from the same low situation  tughril a brave and virtuous omrah tughril was an omrah of some repute in the service of shab ul dien brave and of a virtuous disposition they relate that when shab ul dien mahummud took the fort of biana he gave the command of it to tughril and proceeded himself to gualier as we have seen before but after he left hindostan tughril continued to infest the country about gualier the king having told him at his departure that if he conquered the place he would confirm him in the government of it when he found that this manner of war had no effect as they always found some opportunity of supplying the place he ordered small forts to be built all round which he garrisoned and by this means the place was effectually blockaded yet it held out for near a whole year when being distressed for provisions they sent an embassy privately to sultan cuttub ul dien abiek to come and take possession of the place for they had conceived an implacable resentment against tughril the sultan accordingly sent his troops to seize upon gualier upon which war had almost ensued between him and tughril death however interfering put an end to the dispute for at this juncture tughril suddenly expired the actions of the other two princes formerly slaves to shab ul dien will be seen in the history of sind and punjab

of housewifry and when she complained one day that she had burnt her fingers in baking his bread desiring he might allow her a maid to assist her he rejected her request with saying that he was only a trustee for the a d      higer     state and that he was determined not to burden it with needless expenses he therefore exhorted her to persevere in her duty with patience and god would reward her in the end  as the princes of hindostan never eat in public his table was rather that of a hermit than suitable to a great king he also continued the whimsical notion of living by his pen one day as an omrah was inspecting a coran of the emperors writing before him he pointed out a word which he said was wrong the king looking at it smiled and drew a circle round it but when the critic was gone he began to eraze the circle and restore the word this being observed by one of his old attendants he begged to know his majestys reason for so doing to which he replied that he knew the word was originally right but he thought it better to erase from a paper than touch the heart of a poor man by bringing him to shame these might indeed be virtues in private life but were certainly none in a

which art he was very expert his gradual rise in the state he rose from that station both by the influence of his brother who happened to be then an omrah and in great favor at the court of delhi and

that of nasir ul dien he was raised to the vizarit which high office he managed in such a manner as to leave the king but the mere title of royalty succeeds to the empire he therefore upon the death of his sovereign mounted the throne not only without opposition but even by the general voice of the nobility and people  in the reign of shumse ul dien altumsh forty of his turkish slaves who were in great favor entered into a solemn association a d      higer     to support one another and upon the kings death to divide the empire among themselves but jealousies and dissentions having arose afterward among them prevented this project from being executed the emperor balin was of their number rids himself of his rivals and as several of them had raised themselves to great power in the kingdom the first thing he did after his accession was to rid himself of all who remained of that association either by sword or poison among whom was a nephew of his own shere chan a man of great bravery and reputation  courted by the kings of tartary and persia his fears after these assassinations were entirely dispelled and he became so famous for his justice and wise government that his alliance was courted by all the kings of iran and turan he took particular care that none but men of merit and family should be admitted to any office in his government and for this purpose he endeavored to make himself acquainted with the particular talents and connections of every person in his court as he was very assiduous in rewarding merit he was no less so in punishing vice for whoever misbehaved in their station were certain of being immediately disgraced  an enemy to vice he expelled all flatterers usurers pimps and players from his court and being one day told that an omrah an old servant of the crown who had acquired a vast fortune by usury and monopoly in the bazar would present him with some lacks of rupees if he would honor him with one word from the throne he rejected the proposal with great disdain and said what must his subjects think of a king who should condescend to hold discourse with a wretch so infamous  his generosity balin was so famous for his generosity that all the princes of the east who had been overthrown by the arms of chingez chan a d      higer     sought protection at his court there came upwards of twenty of those unfortunate sovereigns from turkestan mavir ul nere chorrassan ayrac azurbaejan pharis room the lesser asia so called from being long a part of the roman empire  and shaam syria  they had a princely allowance and palaces for their residence allotted them and they were upon public occasions ranked before his throne according to their dignity all standing to the right and left except two princes of the kalifat who were permitted to sit on either side of the musnud the palaces in which the royal fugitives resided in delhi took their names from their respective possessors and were ranked in the following order abbassi singeri charizm shahi willami ollavi attabuki ghori chingezi roomi aesunkari emuni museli samarcandi cashgari and chittai  in the retinue of those princes were the most famous men for learning war arts and sciences that asia at that time produced the court of hindostan was therefore in the days of balin reckoned the most polite and magnificent in the world all the philosophers poets and divines formed a society every night at the house of chan shehid the heir apparent of the empire and amir chusero the poet presided at those meetings another society of musicians dancers mimicks players buffoons and storytellers was constantly convened at the house of the emperors second son kera chan who was given to pleasure and levity the omrahs followed the examples of their superiors so that various societies and clubs were formed in every quarter of the city the sultan himself having a great passion for splendour and magnificence in his palaces equipages and liveries he was imitated by the court a new city seemed to lift up its head and arts to arise from the bosoms of luxury and expense  and magnificence such was the pomp and grandeur of the royal presence that none could approach the throne without terror the ceremonies of introduction a d      higer     were conducted with so much reverence and solemnity and every thing disposed so as to strike awe and astonishment into the beholders nor was balin less magnificent in his cavalcades his state elephants were caparisoned in purple and gold his horseguards consisting of a thousand noble turks in splendid armor were mounted upon the finest persian steeds with bridles of silver and saddles of rich embroidery five hundred chosen men in rich livery with their drawn swords upon their shoulders ran proclaiming his approach and clearing the way before him all the omrahs followed according to their rank with their various equipages and attendants the monarch in short seldom went out with less than one hundred thousand men which he used to say was not to gratify any vanity in himself but to exalt him in the eyes of the people  his justice the festivals of norose and i would as also the anniversary of his own birth were held with wonderful pomp and splendour but amidst all this glare of royalty he never forgot that he was the guardian of the laws and protector of his meanest subjects it was before balins time a custom in hindostan in cases of murder to satisfy the relations by a certain fine if they consented to accept of it he abolished this custom which has been since revived and ordered the suba of budaoon malleck feick to be put to death upon the complaint of a poor woman for killing her son  when balin was only an omrah he gave into the then courtly vices of wine women and play but upon his accession he became a great enemy to all those luxuries prohibiting wine upon the severest penalties to be drank in his dominions laying great restrictions upon women of pleasure and banishing all gamesters from his court  so zealous was balin to support his authority that for the disobedience of one man he would order a force to the remotest parts a d      higer     of the empire to bring him to punishment his severity to rebels in cases of insurrection or rebellion against his government he was not content as had formerly been the custom to chastise the leaders but he extended the capital punishment of high treason to the meanest of their vassals and adherents this severity rendered it necessary for the subas to have the kings mandate for every expedition or hostilities they were about to commence  that his army might be kept in constant exercise he led them out twice every week to hunt for forty or fifty miles round the city and established laws for the preservation of the game rejects the advice of his council to reduce malava in the year     he was advised by his council to undertake an expedition to reduce the kingdoms of guzerat and malava which had been annexed to the empire by cuttub ul dien but were afterward permitted to shake off the yoke to this advice the emperor would by no means consent saying that the moguls were become so powerful in the north having conquered all the mussulmen princes that he thought it would be much wiser to secure what he possessed against those invaders than to weaken himself and leave his country unguarded by foreign wars  tatar chan reduced mahummud tatar chan the son of arsilla chan who had begun to assert independence in lucknouti was this year however reduced and obliged to send his usual tribute to delhi a great rejoicing was made upon this occasion at which the king was present and gave public audience  the mewats extirpated balin ordered in the course of the same year an army to extirpate a certain tribe of banditti called mewats who had possessed themselves of an extensive wilderness about eighty miles south east of the city toward the hills from whence they used in former reigns to make incursions to the number of fifty thousand even to the gates a d      higer     of delhi it is said that in this expedition above one hundred thousand of these wretches were put to the sword and the army being supplied with hatchets and other implements cleared away the woods for above the circumference of fifty crores the cleared space afterward proved excellent lands and was well inhabited as the people were protected by a line of forts along the foot of the mountains  the emperor quells several insurrections in the     year of the higera balin sent an army down between the ganges and jumna to suppress some insurrections in those parts with orders to punish the offenders without mercy the sultan soon after marched in person toward kattal pattiali and bhogepoor whose inhabitants had begun to stop all intercourse with bengal by the way of jionpoor and benaris he put some thousands of them to death establishing justice and public security in those parts he ordered forts to be built which he garrisoned with pattans to crush any future disturbance and then returned toward delhi soon after his arrival he received intelligence of an insurrection in budaoon and kutter whither he hastened with five thousand chosen horse and ordered a general massacre among the unfortunate insurgents and some thousands of every age and sex fell by the sword  if such cruelties can be any where excused it must be in a government like that of hindostan where rebellions were in those days so common that without the most vigorous measures the peace and royal authority could not be at all established  reduces jehud balin after these transactions marched his army toward the mountains of jehud where he employed them for the space of two years in taking sorts and reducing the wild inhabitants to obedience this country was famous for breeding horses many thousands of which were carried by the sultan to delhi wherever the a d      higer     king marched there was an order for the subas zemindars fogedars and magistrates of the provinces to meet him on their own frontiers with their offerings which was afterward distributed among the poor the sultan some time after made a journey to lahore which city having greatly suffered from the moguls he ordered to be put in a proper state of defense and repair and after having erected some public buildings he returned to delhi  regulates the army about this time balin was told by one of his omrahs that a great number of veterans who had served in the preceding reigns were now become invalids and incapable of attending their duty the sultan upon this ordered a list of their names to be taken and settling half pay upon them for life discharged them from further service the old men however were dissatisfied with this provision and some of the principals of them were deputed by the rest to go to malleck ul omrah fuchur ul dien chief magistrate of delhi with presents to represent their case to the king  this venerable magistrate being in great favor with the sultan rejected their presents but told them he would use his endeavor to get them continued upon full pay he accordingly went next day to court and while he stood in the presence put on the appearance of sorrow which being observed by the king he enquired about the cause of his grief the old man replied i was just thinking that if in the presence of god all the old men were rejected what would become of me the king was struck with the reproof and after some pensive silence ordered the veterans to be continued in their usual pay  shere chan dies in the fourth year of the reign of balin shere chan chaja tash who had from the time of nasir ul dien governed the provinces of lahore moultan battize tibberhind debalpoor and other districts a d      higer     died some say by poison from the king but this is not now believed though reported by some malicious people in those days he was esteemed a man of great genius and an intrepid warrior having defended his country from the incursions of the moguls who now became the terror of the east sultan balin upon the demise of shere chan gave sunnam and semana to timur chan and the other countries were divided among other omrahs of his court the moguls encouraged by the death of shere chan began again their depredations in those provinces the mutual jealousies and dissensions among the subas prevented them from doing any thing effectual for the public good  mahummud appointed governor of the frontiers the emperor therefore was obliged to appoint his eldest son mahummud at that time bearing the title of chan malleck afterward famous by the name of chan shehid viceroy of all those frontier provinces mahummud was immediately dispatched to his government with a fine army and some of the wisest and best generals in the empire an encourager of learning the prince himself was blessed with a bright and comprehensive genius taking great delight in learning and the company of learned men he with his own hand made a choice collection of the beauties of poetry selected from the most famous in that art the work consisted of twenty thousand couplets and was esteemed the criterion of taste among the learned men in the princes court amir chusero and chaja hassen bore the first rank in genius and in his esteem these with many more of his philosophical society accompanied him on this expedition to lahore  mahummud was visited at lahore by shech osman marindi who was esteemed the greatest man of that age but no presents or entreaty could prevail upon him to remain out of his own country so that after a short stay he returned we are told that as he was a d      higer     one day reading one of his poems in arabic before the prince all the poets who were present were transported into a fit of dancing but the piece affected the prince to all appearance in a quite contrary manner for the tears began to flow fast down his cheeks this might indeed be occasioned by excess of pleasure though it was at that time attributed to that noble emulation which grieves for that excellence to which it cannot attain  he invites the famous poet sadi to his court the fame of shech sadi of schiraz being great at that time mahummud invited him twice to his court but that renowned sage excused himself upon account of his years and with much difficulty was brought to accept of some presents sadi in return sent to mahummud a copy of his works and did honor to the abilities of amir chusero the sultans favorite and president of his learned society  the prince every year made a journey to see his father at delhi to whom he always behaved with the greatest filial affection and duty sultan balin gave his younger son baghera chan entitled nasir ul dien a jagier of sammana and sunnam whither the prince set out to reside his father at his departure advised him to recruit and discipline a good army to watch the motions of the moguls and that if he ever should hear of his giving himself up to wine and his former debaucheries he would certainly withdraw him from that subaship and never put confidence in him again baghera the sultans younger son reforms his manners the prince took the advice of his father to heart and entirely reforming his manners gave great proofs of his natural abilities though his mind had taken a wrong biass in his youth a place of rendezvous was appointed in case of an invasion from the north on the river bea near lahore where the two princes were to join the imperial army from delhi  a d      higer     tughril rebels in lucknouti every thing seemed now in perfect peace and security throughout the empire when tughril who was entrusted with the government of lucknouti began to appear in arms in the year     this bold and enterprizing man led an army against the rajas toward jagenagur whom he defeated carrying off some hundreds of elephants and much wealth out of which he made no acknowledgment to the king balin happened at that time to be very sick insomuch that the news of his death was spread abroad this intelligence having reached the ears of tughril he assumed the red umbrella with all the royal dignities and declared himself king of bengal balin hearing of this wrote him an order to return immediately to his allegiance which having produced no effect he commanded ab tiggi suba of oud to raise his forces and declaring him suba of bengal sent timar chan shumshi malleck taje ul dien jemmal ul dien and other generals to his assistance with an army from delhi to reduce the traitor to obedience  defeats the imperial army when ab tiggi was joined by this force he crossed the sirju now the gagra or deo and proceeded toward lucknouti whence tughril advanced with his forces to meet him tughril employed his money so well among the troops of ab tiggi that he drew many of the turkish chiefs over to his party and then engaging the imperial army he gave them a total defeat the sultan hearing this news bit his own flesh with indignation he ordered ab tiggi to be hanged at the gate of oud and dispatched turmutti a turkish general with another army against the rebel nor was the fate of turmutti more fortunate than that of his predecessor he was totally routed and lost all his baggage and the public treasure  the sultan prepares to march against him in person the sultan having intelligence of this second disgrace to his arms was in great affliction and prepared to take the field in person he gave orders to build a large fleet of boats with all expedition to a d      higer     carry his baggage down the river he in the mean time under pretense of going upon a hunting party went to sunnam and samana the subaship of his younger son whom he brought with his army with him to delhi leaving malleck sotch in the government having collected the imperial army he appointed malleck ul omrah fuchier ul dien or chief magistrate of the city regent during his own absence  he enters bengal the emperor crossing the ganges without waiting for the dry season proceeded to lucknouti by forced marches but having met with great delay on account of the roads and numerous rivers tughril heard of his approach and had time to collect his army and with all his elephants treasure and effects took the rout of jagenagur a town in orissa near cattack  with intention to remain there till the sultan should return to delhi the sultan having arrived in lucknouti remained there only a few days he appointed hissam ul dien barbek governor of the province and proceeded himself with his army toward jagenagur at sunnargaum the zemindar of that place hunnage rai joined him with his troops and promised to guard the river against tughril if he should endeavor to escape that way  persues the rebels into orissa the sultan continued his march with great expedition but he could gain no intelligence of the enemy he therefore ordered malleck barbek beg birse with seven thousand chosen horse to advance ten or twelve crores in front of the army and by all means to endeavor to gain intelligence of the rebels but in spite of all enquiry no satisfactory accounts could for several days be obtained one day however malleck mahummud shir governor of kole being out from the advanced guard with forty horse reconnoitring the country beheld some bullocks with packsaddles and having seized the drivers began to enquire about the enemy they obstinately a d      higer     pretended ignorance but the head of one of them being struck off the rest fell upon their faces and confessed that they had just left the enemys camp which was about two crores in front that they had halted for that day and intended to advance to jagenagur  a gallant exploit of mahummud shir mahummud shir sent the drivers to malleck barbek birse who commanded the vanguard that he might examine them and proceeded himself as directed to reconnoitre the enemys camp he saw from a rising ground the whole encampment extended over a great plain with the elephants and cavalry picqueted and every thing in rest and security having fixed his eye upon the rebels tents which were pitched in the center of the army he determined to execute one of the boldest enterprises perhaps ever attempted he advanced on full speed with his forty attendants whom he fired with the glory of the undertaking toward the camp which he was permitted to enter being taken for one of their own parties he continued his course to the usurpers tents and then ordered his men to draw and rushing into the great tent of audience which was crowded with men of distinction put all they met to the sword crying victory to sultan balin  tughril flies tughril who imagined he was surprised by the imperial army started from his throne in confusion and cut his way through the tent behind he mounted a horse without a saddle and the cry having now spread through the camp he was confirmed in his fears and fled toward the river with an intention to cross it that he might make his escape to jagenagur in the mean time malleck makuddur the brother of the gallant mahummud shir having seen the rebel as he fled pursued him to the river and shot him with an arrow as he was crossing and is killed tughril immediately fell from his horse and malleck plunging into the stream dragged him out by the hair and cut off his head at that very instant seeing some of the enemy a d      higer     coming that way he hid the head in the sand and sending the body down the stream begun to bath himself in the river the party questioned him about their king and then went off without suspicion  his army fly mahummuds party in the mean time having dispatched every body they found in the royal tents dispersed themselves in such a manner among the enemy who were now in the greatest confusion that most of them escaped in the crowd tughril being no where to be found and the panic having run through the whole army the flight became general and none thought about any thing but personal safety those who remained alive of the forty heroes loitered in the rear till the enemy were quite gone off the field they then returned to the deserted camp where they chanced to meet malleck mukuddur he related the kings death to his brother who instantly sent the head to the sultan he at the same time dispatched an express to the vanguard which came up that night and took possession of the camp  the sultan reprimands mahummud for his rashness the sultan arrived the next day with the imperial army he called to him the two gallant brothers and commanded them to relate the particulars of this astonishing exploit he heard it with surprise but instead of praising them as they expected he told them that the rashness of their behavior was inconsistent with their duty and prudence with much more to the same purpose but rewards him but he in a few days took them into favor and conferred great titles and honors upon them  the sultan finding the enemy had entirely dispersed returned to lucknouti and put every one of the rebels family and principal adherents to death he did not even spare his innocent women and children and he carried his cruelty so far as to massacre a hundred a d      higer     balins cruelty fakiers and their chief shaw collinder for having been in great favor with the rebel who had given him a present of three maunds of gold to support the society balin appointed his son baghera chan king of lucknouti bestowing upon him all the ensigns of royalty and the spoils of tughril except the elephants and treasure returns to delhi while he himself returned with his army toward delhi  the sultan was absent upon this expedition three years upon his arrival he conferred great dignities upon malleck fuchier ul dien who had ruled delhi with great wisdom he then visited the learned men at their own houses made them princely presents and at their instigation published an act of grace to all insolvent debtors who were in confinement striking off at the same time all old balances of revenues due to the crown notwithstanding this appearance of humanity either the policy or natural cruelty of his disposition rendered him unmerciful to all rebels he ordered spits to be erected in the market place for the execution of all the prisoners taken in the late expedition and it was with the utmost difficulty that the casies mufties and learned men in a body petitioning their pardon could obtain it this venerable body at last softened the sultan into mercy and he drew the pen of forgiveness over their crimes  his eldest son returns to delhi his eldest son having heard of his fathers arrival proceeded to delhi to visit him and was received with the greatest affection and joy invasion of the moguls he had not remained at delhi three months during which his father and he were inseparable when news was brought that the moguls had invaded moultan mahummud hastened his departure to oppose them but before he had taken leave his father called him into a private apartment and accosted him in the following manner  he told him his fathers a vice to mahummud that he himself had spent a long life in the administration and government of kingdoms that by study and experience a d      higer     he had acquired some knowledge which might be of service to mahummud after his death which in the course of nature now hastened apace that therefore he desired he would lend him the ear of attention and treasure up his maxims in his mind when you shall ascend the throne look upon yourself as the deputy of god have a just sense of the importance of your charge permit not any meanness of behavior in yourself to fully the luster of your exalted station nor let avaritious and lowminded men share your esteem or bear any part in your administration  let your passions be governed by reason and beware of giving way to your rage anger is dangerous in all men but in kings it is the weapon of death  let the public treasure be expended in the service of the state with that prudent economy yet benevolent liberality which reason will dictate to a mind always intent on doing good  let the worship of god be inculcated by your example and never permit vice and infidelity unpunished to hold up their face to the day  be ever attentive to the business of the state that you may avoid the imposition of designing ministers make it your study to see them execute your commands without the least deviation or neglect for it is by them you must govern your people  let your judges and magistrates be men of capacity religion and virtue that the light of justice may illuminate your realms let no light behavior in public or private detract from that important majesty which exalts the idea of a king and let every thing around you be so regulated as to inspire that reverence and awe which will tender your person sacred and contribute to enforce your commands  a d      higer     spare no pains to find men of genius learning and courage you must cherish them by your beneficence that they may prove the soul of your council and the sword of your power  throw not down a great man to the ground for a small crime nor entirely overlook his offense raise not a low man too hastily to a high station lest he forget himself and be an eyesore to men of superior merit  never attempt any thing unless it is through necessity but what you are sure to accomplish and having once determined upon a measure let your perseverance be never shaken by doubt nor your eye ever deviate from the object for it is better for a king to be obstinate than pusillanimous as in the first case he may chance to be right in the latter he is always sure to be wrong nothing more certainly indicates the weakness of a prince than a fluctuating mind    mahummud marches against the moguls the sultan having ended his instructions embraced his son tenderly and parted with him in tears the prince immediately marched against the enemy and having defeated and slain mahummud chan chief of the moguls he recovered all the territories of which they had possessed themselves in the empire  the throne of iran was at this time filled by argunu chan the son of eback chan and grandson of hallaku chan who had conquered that empire about the year     the moguls invade hindostan timur chan chingezi who was then an omrah of mighty renown in the empire of the race of chingez chan and governed herat candahar balich cabul buduchsha ghizni ghor bamia and other countries invaded hindostan with twenty thousand chosen horse to revenge the death of his friend mahummud chan who had been killed the former year having ravaged all the country about debalpoor and a d      higer     lahore he turned toward moultan mahummud sultan who was then in moultan hearing of his designs hastened to the banks of the river of lahore which runs through part of moultan and prepared to oppose him when timur chan advanced to the river he saw the army of hindostan on the opposite bank but the prince desirous of engaging so great a chief upon equal terms permitted timur chan to pass the river unmolested  and are defeated by mahummud both armies then drew up in order of battle and engaged with great fury for the space of three hours in which both commanders eminently distinguished their valor and conduct the moguls were at last put to flight and the omrahs of hind pursued them with imprudent disorder mahummud fatigued by the pursuit halted by a large pond of water with five hundred attendants to drink he there fell prostrate upon the ground to return god thanks for his victory  who is surprised and slain in the mean time one of the mogul chiefs who had hid himself with two thousand horse in a neighboring wood rushed out upon mahummud and began a dreadful slaughter the prince had just time to mount his horse and collecting his small party and encouraging them by his example fell upon his enemies he was at last overpowered by numbers after having thrice obliged them to give ground and he unfortunately received a fatal arrow in his breast by which he fell to the ground and in a few minutes expired a body of the troops of hind appearing at that instant the moguls took to flight very few of the unfortunate mahummuds party escaped from this conflict among the fortunate few was amir chusero the poet who relates this event at large in his book called chizer chani  when the army returned from the pursuit of timur chan and beheld their prince in his blood the shouts of victory were changed a d      higer     to the wailings of woe the grief of the army for the death of the prince no dry eye was to be seen from the meanest soldier to the omrah of high command the fatal news reached the old sultan who was now in his eightieth year the fountains of his tears were exhausted and life became obnoxious to his sight however bearing himself up against the stream of misfortune he sent kei chusero his grandson and the son of the deceased to supply the place of his father kei chusero upon his arrival at moultan took the command of the army and pouring the balm of benevolence and kindness upon the wounds of his afflicted people began to adjust his government and provide for the defense of his frontiers  the sultan worn out with age sends for his son baghera to succeed him when the sultan found grief and infirmities began to conquer his vital strength he sent for his son baghera chan from lucknouti and appointed him his successor at the same time insisting that he should continue with him at delhi till his death and appoint a deputy for his government of lucknouti to this baghera chan consented but finding his fathers illness was not likely to come soon to a crisis he set out for lucknouti without acquainting him of his departure this undutiful behavior in his son threw the old man into the deepest affliction so that death began now to press hard upon him  he in the mean time sent for his grandson kei chusero from moultan the prince hastened to his presence and a council of all the omrahs being called the succession was changed in his favor all of them promising to enforce the sultans last will in favor of this young prince the sultans death balin in a few days expired in the year     after a reign of twentytwo years  immediately upon the death of the emperor malleck ul omrah fuchur ul dien cutwal having assembled the omrahs and being a d      higer     always in enmity with the father of chusero harrangued them upon the present posture of affairs he assured them that kei chusero was a young man of a very violent and untractable disposition and therefore in his opinion unfit to reign besides that the power of baghera chan was so great in the empire that a civil war was to be feared if the succession should not be continued in his family that therefore as the father was absent it would be most prudent for the omrahs to elect his son kei kubad who was a prince of a mild disposition and then present in delhi kei kubad the son of prince baghera raised to the throne so great was the influence of the minister that he procured the throne for kei kubad and kei chusero glad to escape with

year ascended the throne and assumed the title of moaz ul dien he was a prince remarkably handsome in his person and of an affable and mild disposition he had a talent for literature and his knowledge that a d      higer     way was pretty extensive his mother was a beautiful princess daughter to nasir ul dien altumsh and if purity of blood royal is of any real worth kei kubad had that to boast for a series of generations  luxury prevails at delhi as he had been bred up with great strictness under the wings of his father when he became master of his own actions he began to give a loose to pleasure without restraint he delighted in love and in the soft society of silver bodied damsels with musky tresses spent great part of his time when it was publicly known that the king was a man of pleasure it became immediately fashionable at court and in short in a few days luxury and vice so prevailed that every shade was filled with ladies of pleasure and every street rung with music and mirth even the magistrates were seen drunk in public and riot was heard in every house  kei kubad gives himself up to pleasure the sultan built a palace at kilogurry upon the banks of the river gion and retired thither to enjoy his pleasures undisturbed admitting no company but singers players musicians and buffoons malleck nizam manages public affairs malleck nizam ul dien who was nephew and son

was the greatest man of that age was appointed his deputy  affairs to the throne malleck nizam ul dien seeing that the king was quite swallowed up in his pleasures began to form schemes to clear his own way to the empire the first object of his attention was kei chusero who was now gone to ghizni to endeavor to bring timur chan over to his party in order to recover the throne of delhi to which he claimed a title from his fathers right of primogeniture as well as a d      higer     from the will of the last sultan but in this scheme chusero did not succeed and he was obliged to return from ghizni in great disgust  in the mean time nizam ul dien endeavored to make him as obnoxious as possible to the king who was at length prevailed upon to entice chusero to delhi murders kei chusero nizam hired assassins to murder the unfortunate prince on the way which they accomplished at the vilage of hicke his many villainies the villainies of nizam did not stop here he forged a correspondence between chaja chatire the vizier and kei chusero and thus effected that ministers disgrace and banishment he also privately assassinated all the old servants of sultan balin insomuch that a general consternation was spread through the city though none as yet suspected nizam as the cause the more he succeeded in his villainies he became less secret in the execution and though he began to be detested by all ranks his power and influence was so great with the king that he was the terror of every man  while things were in this situation advices arrived of another invasion of moguls into the districts of lahore malleck barbeck beg birse and chan jehan were sent with an army against them the moguls defeated the moguls were defeated near lahore and a number of prisoners brought to delhi the next step the traitor took was to inspire the king with jealousy of his mogul troops who as soldiers of fortune had enlisted in great numbers in his service he pretended that in case of a mogul invasion they would certainly join their countrymen against him insinuating at the same time that he believed there was already some treachery intended  kei kubad massacres the moguls in his service the weak prince listened to those villainous intimations and calling their chiefs one day together he ordered them to be set upon by his guards and massacred confiscating at the same time all their a d      higer     goods and wealth he seized upon all the omrahs who had any connections with the moguls and sent them prisoners to distant garrisons in the remotest parts of the empire so blind was kei kubad to his own ruin and so infatuated by this deceitful minister that when any of his fathers friends or well wishers to himself and the state made any complaints against the traitor he immediately called for nizam himself and smiling told him that such a person had been doing him such and such ill offices with an intention to alienate his affections from him the person who preferred the complaint became by this means a sacrifice while fear prevented others from falling martyrs to virtue and honesty  the minister carries all before him when nizam thus carried all before him in the durbar his wife was no less busy in the haram she had all the ladies at her devotion and by way of particular respect was called the kings mother malleck ul omrah fuchir ul dien cutwal who had now reached his ninetieth year perceived the design of the treacherous minister and called him to his house and by various arguments endeavored to suppress his ambitious schemes and to lay the deformity of such behavior fully open to his view the minister allowed the justice of his reasoning and affirmed that he had no further intentions than to secure himself in the kings favor that having unfortunately disobliged so many people it was dangerous for him to permit his authority to decline  in the mean time baghera chan the sultans father who had contented himself with the kingdom of bengal having heard how matters went on at the court of delhi penetrated into the designs of the minister and wrote a long letter to his son forewarning him of his danger and advising him how to proceed baghera chans advice to his son is slighted but his advice like that of others was of no weight with that vicious luxurious and infatuated prince when baghera found that his instructions were a d      higer     slighted and that things would soon be brought to a disagreeable issue marches toward delhi he collected a great army and directed his standards toward delhi about two years after the death of balin sultan kei kubad hearing that his father had advanced as far as behar drew out his forces and marched down to meet him encamping his army upon the banks of the gagera baghera chan lay upon the sirve and both armies remained some days in hourly expectation of an action the old man finding his army much inferior to that of his son began to despair of reducing him by force and accordingly began to treat of peace  the young prince upon this became more haughty and by the advice of his favorite prepared for battle a conference proposed between the father and son in the mean time a letter arrived from his father wrote in the most tender and affectionate terms begging he might be blessed with one sight of him before matters were carried to extremities this letter awakened nature which had slumbered so long in kei kubads breast and he gave orders to prepare his retinue that he might visit his father the favorite attempted all in his power to prevent this interview but finding the prince for once obstinate he prevailed upon him to insist as emperor of delhi upon the first visit hoping by this means to break off the conference his design however did not succeed for the old king seeing what a headstrong boy he had to deal with consented to come to the imperial camp and ordered the astrologers to determine upon a lucky hour and crossing the river proceeded toward his sons camp  kei kubads insolence the young monarch having prepared every thing for bagheras reception in the most pompous and ceremonious manner mounted his throne and arrogantly gave orders that his father upon his approach should three times kiss the ground the old man accordingly when he arrived at the first door was ordered to a d      higer     dismount and after he had come in sight of the throne he was commanded to pay his obeisance in three different places as he advanced the sultans chobdars crying out according to custom baghera chan to the king of the world sends health  mollified upon seeing his father the old man was so much shocked at this indignity that he burst out into a flood of tears which being observed by the son he could no longer support his unnatural insolence but leaping from the throne fell on his face at his fathers feet imploring his forgiveness for his offense the good old man melted into compassion and raising him in his arms embraced him and hung weeping upon his neck the scene in short was so affecting on both sides that the whole court began to wipe the tears from their eyes  these transports being over the young sultan helped his father to mount the throne and paying him his respects took his place at his right hand ordering a charger full of golden suns to be waved three times over his fathers head and afterward to be given among the people all the omrahs also presented to him their nasirs  a peace settled between them public business being then talked over every thing was settled in peace and friendship and baghera chan returned to his own camp a friendly intercourse commenced immediately between the two armies for the space of twenty days in which time the father and son alternately visited one another and the time was spent in festivity and mirth the principal terms settled between the two kings were that they should respectively retain their former dominions they return to their respective capitals and then sultan moaz ul dien kei kubad prepared to return to delhi and his father to bengal  before they had taken leave baghera chan called his son the favorite minister and his deputy into a private apartment and gave a d      higer     them a long lecture of advice on the art of government he then embraced kei kubad and whispered in his ear to rid himself of nizam ul dien as soon possible they both parted in tears and returned to their respective capitals baghera chan was much affected upon this occasion and told his friends at his return to his own camp that he had that day parted with his son and the empire still apprehensive of the minister and the wayward disposition of the young man  kei kubad beginning to reform when the sultan arrived at delhi the advice of his father for a few days seemed to take root in his mind but his reformation was not the interest of the minister he therefore soon brought back his prince to the paths of pleasure he for this purpose collected together all the most beautiful women most graceful dancers and sweetest singers from all parts of the empire and these allurements to vice were occasionally introduced to his view  one day as he was riding out he was accosted by a beautiful lady mounted upon a fine arabian horse with a crown of jewels upon her head a thin white robe with golden flowers flowing loosely over her snowy shoulders and a sparkling girdle of gems around her slender waist this fair one advancing before the royal umbrella with a thousand charms and smiles began to sing a love song then stopping short she begged pardon for her intrusion and would not without much entreaty proceed is again brought back to pleasure the king was struck with the beauty of this enchantress and immediately dismounting ordered his camp to be pitched and employed the evening in the pleasures of love this damsel was no less remarkable for her wit than for her beauty the king while she was dancing having broke out in rapturous verses upon those charms which she displayed she answered every time extempore in the same measure with such a d      higer     propriety and elegance as astonished and silenced the greatest wits of the court  kei kubad falls sick in short the king continued in this course of pleasure till wine and intemperance in his other passions had ruined his health he fell sick and then began to recollect the advices of his father and to consider nizam ul dien as the cause of all his distress he immediately began to form schemes in his mind to rid himself of that wicked minister he for this purpose ordered him to the government of moultan but nizam ul dien perceiving his drift contrived many delays that he might get a favorable opportunity to accomplish his villainous intentions his designs however in the mean time reverted upon his own head nizam poisoned the omrahs dispatched him by poison some say without the kings knowledge while others affirm that it was by his authority  promotion at court malleck jellal ul dien ferose the son of malleck egherish of chillige who was naib of sammana came by the sultans orders to court and was honored with the title of shaista chan and made lord of requests as also suba of birren malleck itimer chigen was promoted to a high office at court and malleck eitumur surcha was made vakeel of the empire these three divided the whole power of the government amongst them kei kubad becomes paralytic while the king by this time became afflicted with a palsy by which he lost the use of one side and had his mouth distorted  his son raised to the empire every omrah of popularity or power began now to intrigue for the empire which obliged the friends of the royal family to take keiomourse a child of three years son to the reigning emperor out of the haram and to set him upon the throne the army upon this split into two factions who encamped on opposite sides of the a d      higer     city the turks the turks and tartars here mentioned were mercenaries in the imperial army espoused the cause of the young king and the chilligies a powerful tribe of tartars joined shaista chan who usurped the throne upon the first disturbance those turks who had set up the young prince jealous of the power of the chilligies assembled themselves and proscribed all the principal chilligian officers  shaista chan rebels jellal ul dien shaista chan being the first in that bloody list immediately rebelled himar chigen had been deputed by the turkish party to invite shaista to a conference with the sick sultan and a plot was formed for his assassination shaista discovering his designs drew upon the traitor who came to invite him and killed him at the door of his tent  his sons seize the young king the sons of jellal ul dien who were renowned for their valor immediately put themselves at the head of five hundred chosen horse and making an assault upon the camp of the turks cut their way to the royal tents which were pitched in the center of the army and seizing the infant king carried him and the son of malleck ul omrah off in spite of all opposition to their father they killed malleck eitumur surcha who pursued them with many other men of distinction  the citizens of delhi take arms when this exploit began to be noised abroad in the city the mob flew immediately to arms they marched out in thousands and encamping at the budaoon gate prepared to go against jellal ul dien and rescue the infant king for they greatly dreaded the power of the chilligies who were a fierce and savage race malleck ul omrah the old minister so often mentioned considering that this step would occasion the assassination of the young king and of his own a d      higer     son who was in their hands exerted his great influence and authority among the people and at length prevailed with them to disperse  kei kubad assassinated jellal ul dien in the mean time sent an assassin to cut off kei kubad who lay sick at kilogurry the villain found this unfortunate prince dying upon his bed deserted by all his attendants he beat out the poor remains of life with a cudgel then rolling him up in his bedcloaths threw him over the window into the river this assassin was a turk of some family whose father had been unjustly put to death by kei kubad and he now had a complete revenge  shaista chan ascends the throne when this horrid deed was perpetrated shaista chan ascended the throne and assumed the title of jellal ul dien having put an end to the dynasty of ghor and commenced that of chillige malleck chidju nephew to sultan balin and who was now esteemed the just heir of the empire was immediately appointed suba of kurrah and sent off to his government jellal ul dien marched into the palace and was proclaimed with great solemnity in the city and to complete his villainy he made away with the young prince that he might reign with the greater security  this great revolution happened in the year six hundred and eightyseven the reign of sultan kei kubad being something more than three years a time long and disastrous if we look upon the villainies of nizam ul dien and the consequent overthrow of the family of balin  section xii the reign of sultan jellal ul dien firose of chillige a d      higer     different opinions concerning the origin of the tribe of chillige nizam ul dien ahmud says in his history that the tribe of chillige derived their origin from calidge chan callidge continues that writer having quarrelled with his wife who was an imperious and vindictive woman and fearing she would draw the resentment of her brother chingez chan upon him deserted his army as he was passing the mountains of ghor and ghirgistan in his return from the conquest of iran three thousand of his friends followed calidge and took possession of those mountains where they were afterward joined by many of their countrymen and even by some of the family of chingez chan  other historians with equal improbability affirm that we ought to look for the origin of the chilligies as far back as eaphs the son of no japhet the son of noah  who say they had eleven sons one of whom was called chillige but we have reason to think that neither of the accounts is authentic the one being too modern and the other too ancient to merit our faith we hear of this tribe of chillige in the reigns of subuctagi and mamood of ghizni which entirely destroys the former supposition and we have great doubts concerning the existence of chillige the son of eaphs being persuaded that this idle story took its rise from the natural vanity of nations in tracing themselves back to remote antiquity  this tribe however as we have already observed inhabited the mountains of ghor and ghirgistan and were a brave and hardy though a d      higer     barbarous race they make a business of war and always served as mercenaries any power that chose to employ them the father of that shaista chan who mounted the throne of delhi was egherish he was one of those soldiers of fortune who subsist by the sword and raised himself to some rank in the army of sultan balin his son firose being a man of genius was appointed to the government of samana he was called from thence as before related and usurped the empire he reserved for some months the young prince keiomours as a cloak to his villainy he murders the infant emperor and having established himself upon the throne he ordered him to be put to death he was seventy years of age when he mounted the musnud firose by way of plainness changed the royal umbrella from red to white laid entirely aside his cruelty after the death of the young prince and became remarkable for his humanity and benevolence  resides at kilogurry he had no great confidence in the loyalty of the people of delhi and therefore resided always at kilogurry which he strengthened with works and adorned with fine gardens and beautiful walks by the side of the river the omrahs following the sultans example built palaces around so that kilogurry became known by the name of the new city  confers honors upon his son egherish chan the sultans brother was appointed ariz mumalick or receivergeneral of all petitions to the throne and the emperors eldest son was dignified with the title of chan chanan lord of lords  the second son with the title of arkali chan and the third with that of kuder chan they had all governments conferred upon them and maintained separate households chaja chatire was appointed vizier and the old chief magistrate of the city malleck ul omrah fuchir ul dien was continued in his office  seeks after popularity the citizens of delhi perceiving the wisdom lenity and justice of the king were gradually weaned from their attachment to the old a d    0 higer     family and became friends and supporters of the new government the sultan himself was at much pains to cultivate popularity and for that purpose he gave great encouragement to the learned of that age who in return offered the incense of flattery at the altar of his fame the nephew of sultan balin rebels in the second year of firose malleck chidju nephew to sultan balin and the nabob of kurrah in alliance with halim chan nabob of oud assumed the ensigns of royalty and struck the currency of the country in his own name which he changed to that of moghiz ul dien he brought over to his party all the rajas and jagierdars of those parts and raising a great army advanced toward delhi  his army defeated advices of this insurrect on arriving in the capital the sultan collected his forces and marched out to meet the rebels he sent the chilligian cavalry who excelled at the bow a few miles in his front under the command of arkilli chan his own son arkilli encountering the enemy about twelve crores from the city after an obstinate engagement defeated them he took several omrahs prisoners in the pursuit whom he mounted upon camels with branches hung round their necks and in that plight sent them to the sultan when he saw them in this distress he immediately ordered them to be unbound to have a change of linen given them and an elegant entertainment to be provided he called them before him and repeated a verse to this purpose that evil for evil was easily returned but he only was great who could return good for evil he then ordered them to retire in full assurance of his forgiveness  he is taken  pardoned malleck chidju some days after was taken by the zemindars and sent prisoner to the king instead of condemning him to death as was expected the sultan gave him a free pardon and sent him to moultan where he had a handsome appointment for life as prisoner at large this lenity of the king gave great umbrage to the omrahs of chillige who addressed him upon the occasion and advised him to pursue the policy of sultan balin who never pardoned a traitor they desired that at least a needle should be a d    0 higer     passed through the eyes of malleck chidju to be an example to others if that was not done they averred that treason would soon raise its head in every quarter of the empire and should the turks once gain the superiority they would not leave the name of chillige in hindostan the king answered that what they said was certainly according to the true policy of government clemency of the emperor but my friends says he i am now an old man and i wish to go down to the grave without shedding blood  this behavior of the sultan it must be acknowledged had soon the effect which the chilligian chiefs foresaw clemency is a virtue which descends from god but the degenerate children of hind did not deserve it occasions disturbances there was no security to be found in any place the streets the highways were infested by banditti housebreaking robbery murder and every other species of villainy became a business all over the empire insurrections were heard of in every province numerous gangs of robbers stopped all commerce and intercourse and the nabobs refused or neglected to send any account of their revenues or administration  the omrahs conspire against him the omrahs of chillige were greatly alarmed at these proceedings and began to lengthen the tongue of reproach against their sovereign they even began to consult about deposing him and to raise malleck tage ul dien kugi who was a man of influence courage and resolution to the throne for this purpose they met one day at an entertainment in his house but having intoxicated themselves with wine they began openly to talk of assassinating the emperor quarreling about which of them should have the honor of that undertaking while they were in this situation one of the company privately withdrew and running to the sultan repeated very circumstantially every particular of what he had heard the sultan immediately ordered a guard to surround the house who having seized the omrahs a d    0 higer     brought them all before him he upbraided them with their treason he drew his sword and throwing it down upon the ground challenged the boldest of them to wield it against him but they fell upon their faces and remained silent and confounded are discovered and pardoned one of them however whose name was malleck nuserit was gifted with more impudence than the rest and told the king that the words of drunkenness were but wind where can we ever find so good and gracious a king if you should be no more or where can the king get so faithful servants were he to condemn us for a little unguarded folly  remarkable story of a dirvesh the unguarded prince was pleased with this and smiling called for wine and gave him another cup with his own hand he then upbraided the rest for their conduct advised them to behave better for the future and dismissed them all with his pardon  the execution of a dirvesh is one of the most remarkable events in this reign the name of the dirvesh was seid molah and the whole affair has been thus delivered down in history  malleck ul omrah fuchir ul dien cutwal dying about this time all the great men who by his interest held jagiers and places at court were deprived of them and reduced to want among other dependants of the venerable cutwal chief magistrate of the city  that became destitute by his death were twelve thousand readers of the coran each of these was obliged to read the coran over once a day  and some thousands of his sipais and servants all these turned their face toward seid molah for their maintenance  his history this seid molah was a venerable sage in a mendicant dress who traveled from girjan toward the east where he visited various

whom he resided some time in great friendship but in the reign of sultan balin having an inclination to see delhi he took leave of his friend who advised him to cultivate no intimacy with the great

all denominations turning none away from his door though he was very religious and brought up in the mahommedan faith yet he followed some particular tenets of his own so that he never attended public worship he kept no women nor slaves for himself and lived upon rice only yet his expenses in charity were so great that as he never accepted of any presents men were astonished whence his finances were supplied and actually believed that he possessed the art of transmuting other metals into gold upon the death of sultan balin he launched out more and more in bestowing great sums in charity and expended a princely revenue in his entertainments which were now frequented by all the great men of the city for he made nothing of throwing three or four thousand pieces of gold into the bosom of a noble family in distress his magnificence and charity in short he displayed more magnificence in his feasts than any of the princes of the empire his charity was so unbounded that he expended daily upon the poor a thousand maunds of flower five hundred maunds of meat eighty maunds of sugar besides rice oil butter and other necessaries in proportion the mob at length crowded his gates in such numbers that it was almost impossible to pass that way in the mean time the sons of the emperor and all the princes of the court resorted to him with all their retinues and spent whole days and nights in innocent festivity and philosophical conversation a d    0 higer     after the death of fuchir ul dien cutwal the dirvesh stretched forth his hand to his numerous dependants and supported them in plenty and ease  in the mean time casi jellal ul dien a man of an intriguing turbulent disposition wrought himself into the favor and confidence of seid molah and being endued with art and plausibility of tongue began to inspire the philosopher with ambitious views he told him that the people looked upon him as sent by god to deliver the kingdom from the tyranny and oppression of the chilligies and to bless hindostan with a wise and just government  aspires to the throne the philosopher in short suffered his imagination to be deluded by the splendid ideas of royalty and privately began to bestow titles and offices upon his disciples and to take other measures to execute his designs conspires against the king he engaged beregin cutwal and heitai palwan two of his particular friends to join in the kings retinue on friday as he went to the public mosque and to assassinate him while he himself prepared about ten thousand of his adherents to support his usurpation but one of his followers understanding that some others of less merit than himself were appointed to be his superiors became disgusted went privately to the king and disclosed to him every particular of the conspiracy  he is seized the king ordered seid molah and jellal ul dien to be immediately seized and brought before him for examination but they persisted in their innocence and no other witness appeared against them which rendering the accusation doubtful the sultan ordered a great fire to be prepared in the field of bahapoor that they might be put to the ordeal trial he himself marched out of the city to see the ceremony performed and ordered a ring to be made round the pile the fire being kindled the sultan commanded seid a d    0 higer     mola and the two assassins to be brought that they might walk through the flames to prove their innocence having said their prayers they were just going to plunge into the fire when the sultan stopped them short and turning to his ministers said that the nature of fire was to consume paying no respect to the righteous more than to the wicked besides said he it is contrary to the mahommedan law to practice this heathenish superstition  ordered to perpetual imprisonment he therefore ordered casi jellal to budaoon and seid molah to be thrown into chains in a vault under the palace and the two men who were to perpetrare the assassination to be put to death he at the same time banished a number of those who were suspected of the conspiracy when they were carrying seid molah through the court to his prison the king pointed him out to some collinders who stood near him and said behold the man who was projecting such evil against us i therefore leave him to be judged by you according to his deserts  at the word a collinder whose name was beri started forth and running toward the prisoner began to cut him with a razor the unfortunate dirvesh told him to be more expeditious in sending him to god he then addressed himself to the king who was looking over the balcony and said i am rejoiced that you have thought of putting a period to my life yet to distress the pious and the innocent is an evil and be assured that my curse will lie heavy upon you and your unfortunate posterity the king hearing these words became pensive and perplexed put to a cruel death his son arkilli chan who hated seid molah for the great intimacy between him and his elder brother chan chanan seeing the emperors irresolution beckoned to an elephant rider who stood in the court mounted to advance which accordingly he did and commanded his elephant to tread seid molah to death  a d      higer   0 a prodigy zea ul dien birni in his history of firoze shaw informs us that he himself was at that time in delhi and that immediately upon the death of seid

habitations the same author relates that no rain fell in these provinces during that year and the consequence was a most terrible famine by which thousands daily died in the streets and highways while whole families drowned themselves in the river but these were the throes of nature and not the rage of the elements for seid molah this event happened in the year   0 and the loss of the dirvesh was much regretted for many believed him entirely innocent of the charge  the good fortune of the king declines the prosperity of the king began visibly to decline for every day new factions and disputes arose which greatly disturbed his administration private misfortunes pressed hard upon him at the same time among the number of which was the madness of his eldest son chan chanan heir apparent of the empire no medicines could cure that prince and the distemper hourlygaining ground soon terminated in his death  he marches to rintimpore the king after the decease of his son marched his army toward rintimpore to quell an insurrection in thse parts he left his son arkilli chan to manage affairs in his absence the enemy having retired into the fort of rintimpore and the king having reconnoitered the place despaired of reducing it he marched toward a small sort called jain which he took then breaking down the temples of malava plundered them of some wealth and again returned to rintimpore he summoned the sort a second time to surrender but finding the rebels paid no attention to his threats he gave orders to undermine the walls he however changed his resolution and a d      higer     decamped saying that he found the place could not be taken without the loss of many lives and therefore that he would lay aside his designs against it malleck amed chip who was one of the pillars of the empire replied that kings in the time of war should make no account of those things when compelled to it by justice and the necessity of supporting their authority which was now plainly the case the king in wrath asked him how he came to think that these were not his sentiments but i have often said he told you that now being on the brink of the grave i am unwilling to entail the curse of widows and orphans upon the reign of a few days he therefore continued his march to delhi  the moguls invade hindostan in the year     one of the kinsmen of hallacu chan grandson of zingis chan and king of persia  invaded hindostan with ten tomans a toman consisted of  0000 men of moguls the sultan having received advices of the approach of the enemy collected his army and moved forward to oppose them when he reached the frontiers of biraam he saw the moguls in front beyond a small river both armies encamped for the space of five days upon either side of this stream during which time their advanced posts skirmished frequently and many were killed  the armies at last by mutual consent pitched upon an extensive plain where they might have room to contend for the victory accordingly on the sixth morning they drew up in order of battle and closed up the dreadful interval of war overthrown by the sultan the moguls after an obstinate contest were overthrown many of their chiefs killed and about a thousand men taken prisoners among the latter were two omrahs and several officers of rank the sultan notwithstanding this victory was afraid to pursue it and offered them peace upon condition of their evacuating his dominions they accordingly a d      higer     gladly accepted of those terms and presents were exchanged between them when the moguls were retreating allaghu chan grandson to the great chingez chan joined the sultan with three thousand men they all became mussulmen and their chief was honored with one of the sultans daughters in marriage  arkilli chan made governor of lahore the king about this time appointed his son arkilli chan viceroy of lahore moultan and sind with whom he left a strong force and returned himself to his capital to allaghu chan and the rest of the moguls who had now become true believers was allotted a certain district near the city where they built for themselves houses and raised a considerable town known by the name of mogulpurra  in the year     the sultan was under the necessity of marching his army again to quell an insurrection about mindu which fort he took and put the enemy to flight the expeditions of alla ul dien in the mean time malleck alla ul dien the kings nephew and governor of kurrah requested to be permitted to march against the hindoos of belsa who infested his province having obtained leave he marched the same year to belsa which he took and having pillaged the country returned with much spoil part of which was sent as a present to the sultan among other things there was a large brazen idol which was thrown down by the budaoongate the sultan was greatly pleased with the success and behavior of alla ul dien upon this expedition for which he rewarded him with princely presents and annexed the subadary of oud to his former government of kurrah  alla ul dien upon this preferment acquainted the king that there were some rajas of great wealth toward chinderi whom if the sultan should give him permission he would reduce to his obedience and send their spoils to the royal treasury the king a d      higer     through covetousness consented to this proposal to which alla ul dien was moved by the violent temper of his wife mallike jehan the sultans daughter who threatened his life to avoid therefore her resentment and that of her father he looked round for some remote country which might afford him an asylum marches into the decan accordingly in the year     he took leave of the sultan at delhi and proceeding toward kurrah took many chiefs of distinction into his service he marched with eight thousand chosen horse by the nearest road against ramdeo raja of the decan who possessed the wealth of a long series of kings  alla ul dien arriving upon the frontiers of the decan pressed forward against the capital of rumdeos dominions which not being fortified he was in hopes of surprising though this attempt seemed too bold to be attended with success yet he persisted in his resolution and by surprising marches reached elichpoor where he made a short halt to refresh his small army he marched from thence with equal expedition toward deogire the capital intelligence of allas progress coming to the raja who with his son had been absent upon some service in a distant part of his dominions he returned with great expedition to intercept the enemy with a numerous army overthrows ramdeo he accordingly threw himself between alla and the city engaged him with consummate bravery but in the end he was defeated with great loss  another account of this expedition this expedition is otherwise recorded by the author of the tibcat nasiri alla ul dien says that writer left kurrah on pretense of hunting and having passed through the territories of many petty rajas avoided all hostilities giving out that he had lest the emperor in disgust and was going to offer his services to the raja of the tillingas ram chunder who was the most powerful king in the decan accordingly after two months march he arrived a d      higer     without any remarkable opposition at elichpoor from whence at once changing his course he decamped in the night and in two days surprised the city of deogire the capital of ramdeo the raja himself was in the city but his wife and his eldest son had gone to worship at a certain temple without the walls  ramdeo upon the approach of alla was in the greatest consternation alla takes deogire he however collected three or four thousand citizens and domestics engaged alla ul dien at one of the gates of the city but being defeated retired into the citadel this fort having no ditch and not being stored with provisions he had no hopes of defending it long alla ul dien immediately invested the place in the mean time he gave out that he was only the vanguard of the emperors army who were on full march to the place this struck universal terror into all the rajas round who instead of joining for the general safety began to secure themselves allas cruelty alla ul dien having pillaged the city and seized upon the merchants brahmins and principal inhabitants tortured them for their wealth while he at the same time carried on the siege of the citadel  ramdeo seeing he must soon be obliged to yield and imagining that the emperor intended to make a general conquest of the decan endeavored to procure a peace before any other forces arrived he therefore wrote after this manner to alla  your invasion of this country was certainly impolitic and rash but fortunately for you having found the city unguarded you have been permitted to range at large it is however possible that the rajas of the decan who command innumerable armies may yet surround you and not permit one of your people to escape from our dominions alive supposing even that you should be able to retreat from hence undisturbed are not the rajas of malava candez and a d      higer     gundwarra in your way who have each armies of forty or fifty thousand men do you hope they will permit you to escape unmolested after this perfidious attack on their brethren in religion and gods ramdeo proposes terms of peace it is therefore advisable for you to retire in time by accepting a small reward and what spoil you have already got to indemnify you for your expense and labor which alla accepts malleck alla ul dien was very glad to accept of those proposals and having received fifty maunds of gold a large quantity of pearls and jewels fifty elephants and some thousand horses which were taken in the rajas stables he released his prisoners and promised to abandon the place in the morning of the fifteenth day from his first entrance  ramdeos son advances with an army but when alla was preparing to retreat the rajas eldest son who had fled with his mother on the first appearance of the imperial troops to collect forces advanced with a numerous army within a few miles of the city ramdeo sent a message to his son informing him that peace was concluded and whatever was done was done he therefore ordered him not to open again the door of disturbance for that he perceived the turks were a warlike race whose peace was better than their war the young prince however understanding that his army was thrice the number of the enemy and expecting hourly to be joined by other rajas with numerous forces listened not to the commands of his father but wrote to alla ul dien in these terms  his  letter to alla if you have any love for life and desire safety rush out of this horrible whirlpool into which you have plunged yourself whatever you have plundered and received you must return and take your way homeward rejoicing in your happy escape a d      higer     alla ul dien upon reading this insolent letter kindled the fire of rage and blackening the face of the messenger hooted him out of the city he left malleck nuserit to invest the citadel with a thousand horse and immediately marched with the rest of his army to attack the rajas son and drew up in the front of his camp  is overthrown the hindoo did not decline the offered battle he drew forth his numerous squadrons and the battle commenced with such violence that the stout heart of alla ul dien began to quake for the victory his troops began to fall back on all sides in the mean time malleck nuserit having learned by his scouts the situation of affairs left the citadel without orders and galloping up to the field of battle with his thousand horse changed the fortune of the day the dust having prevented the enemy from discovering the force of nuserit some person cried out that the turkish army of whom they had been told was arrived this spread instantly a panic through the hindoo ranks and they at once turned their face to flight alla ul dien did not think proper to pursue them far but immediately returned into the city and invested the citadel  cruelty of the turks a scene of cruelty and horror now commenced the turks enraged at the perfidy of the hindoos for their breach of the treaty began to spread fire and sword through the city from which no discipline could restrain them several of the rajas kindred who had been taken prisoners were in chains thrown down in sight of the enemy the raja in the mean time sent express upon express to hasten the succors which he expected from the raja of kilbirga tillingana malava and candez but was informed that there remained no provisions in the place for that a great number of bags in which they had reckoned upon rice had been found upon examination to be salt  a d      higer     the raja in great distress the raja was greatly perplexed he commanded that this should be concealed from the troops and began a second time to propose a treaty with alla ul dien  proposes terms it must be known to you said the raja o my lord that your wellwisher ramdeo had no hand in the late quarrel if my son in the way of folly and the pride of youth exalted the spear of valor and hostility let not your resentment be kindled against me for his rashness ramdeo told the messenger privately that there was no provisions in the place and that if the enemy should persist a few days they must be informed of their distress which would inevitably bring on the ruin of the whole for said the raja supposing we should be able to hold out the place against the assaults of the enemy yet famine cannot be withstood and there is now scarce six days provision left use then every art and take any means to persuade the army of islam that is the mahommedans  to evacuate the country  a peace concluded but malleck alla ul dien from the behavior of ramdeo perceived the true cause of his proposals and therefore started every day some new difficulty to retard the treaty till the garrison was in the utmost distress but at length it was concluded according to our author upon the following almost incredible terms that alla ul dien should receive upon consideration of evacuating the country six hundred maunds of pure gold according to the weights of the decan the maund of the decan is   lb avoirdupoise  seven maunds of pearl two maunds of diamonds rubies emeralds and sapphires one thousand maunds of silver four thousand pieces of silk and a long list of other precious commodities that surpass all belief this ransom was not only required but also the cession of elichpoor and its dependancies where alla might leave a d      higer     a small garrison to collect the revenues which should remain there unmolested  alla retreats with an immense treasure malleck alla ul dien having settled affairs to his satisfaction released all his prisoners and marched in triumph out of the city with his plunder and proceeded on his way homeward on the twentyfifth day after his taking the city he conducted his retreat with such surprising address that he opened his way through extensive and powerful kingdoms through malava conduana candez and others though he was surrounded by numerous armies who admiring his order and resolution made but faint and irresolute attacks which served only to adorn his triumph we may here justly remark that in the long volumes of history there is scarcely any thing to be compared to this exploit whether we regard the resolution in forming the plan the boldness of the execution of it or the fortune which attended the attempt we cannot help to lament that a man formed for such great exploits should not be actuated by better motives than rapine violence and the thirst of gain  the sultan suspects alla of treasonable designs when alla ul dien marched to deogire all communication with kurrah being stopped no news was heard of him for some months the person whom he left his deputy to make the king easy wrote that he had accounts of his being busy in the conquest of chinderi and amused him every day with false intelligence but as the king for the space of six months had received no letters from under his own hand he began to suspect treason and in the year     under a pretense of hunting ordered out his retinue and proceeded toward gualier where he encamped and built a choultry inscribing a verse to this purpose over the door  i who press with my foot the celestial pavement what same can i acquire by a heap of stones and mortar no i have joined these broken stones together that a d      higer     perhaps under their shade the weary traveller or brokenhearted may find repose  alla ul dien returns toward kurrah in the mean time firose shaw received private intelligence that alla ul dien had conquered deogire and had acquired there such wealth as had never been possessed by an emperor of delhi and that he was now upon his march toward kurrah the king was greatly pleased with this intelligence and reckoned upon the spoil as if already in his own treasury but men of more wisdom thought otherwise and justly concluded that it was not to fill the royal coffers as alla ul dien without the kings authority had undertaken such a daring expedition they however waited to see the event without informing the king of their suspicions the sultan consults his council concerning alla the king having one day assembled his council and told them that alla ul dien was now on his march to kurrah with immense plunder requested their advice whether it was most prudent to remain where he was and command alla to his presence to march toward him or to return to delhi  malleck ahmed chip who was renowned for his wisdom and penetration expressed his suspicions to the king in a rational and plausible manner they differ in their opinions he advised the sultan at the same time to advance with his army toward chinderi and to encamp in the way between alla ul dien and kurrah this said he will discover allas intentions before he has time to augment his army ahmed chip added further that upon the appearance of the imperial army it was highly probable that the troops of alla ul dien being laden with spoil and within their own country would not choose to hazard the loss of it by an action but would rather endeavor to secure their wealth among the mountains that by this means alla ul dien would be deserted by the greatest part of his small army which would oblige him to think of nothing but peace and to lay all his wealth at the a d      higer     foot of the throne that the king in that case might take all the gold jewels and elephants permitting him to retain the remainder for himself and either leave him his government or carry him to delhi according to the royal pleasure  malleck fuchier ul dien kudgi though he was sensible of the prudence of this advice yet turning his eyes upon the emperor he perceived he did not at all approve of it and therefore began to this effect the news of alla ul diens return the amount of his plunder and the truth of his conquest has not yet been confirmed but by flying reports which we all know are often vague and extravagant supposing even that this account is true is it not natural to imagine that when he shall hear of the approach of the imperial army that the fear of false accusation or evil designs against him will prevail on him to retreat among the mountains from whence as the rainy season is at hand it will be impossible to dislodge him let us not therefore cast off our shoes before we reach the river but wait till alla shall arrive at kurrah if then it shall appear that he cherishes his treasonable views one assault of the imperial army will crush his ambition  malleck ahmed chip having heard this perfidious advice was kindled into generous resentment and replied the time passes  as soon as alla ul dien shall have escaped us will he not proceed by the way of oud to lucknouti where his treasure will soon enable him to raise such an army as neither you nor i will be able to oppose o shame that men should know better yet not have the honesty to give salutary advice  the sultan was displeased with those words and spoke thus to the omrahs who stood near him malleck chip does always ill offices to alla ul dien he endeavors to raise my suspicion and resentment a d      higer     against him but such private rancour shall have no weight with the king i am so well assured of the loyalty of malleck alla ul dien whom i have nursed in my bosom that i should sooner believe treason in my son than in him  malleck ahmed upon this shut the door of argument and rising with some emotion walked out striking one hand upon the other and repeating a verse to this purpose when the sun of prosperity is eclipsed no advice can enlighten the mind the king bestowing great commendations on kudgi marched back with his army to delhi  alla ul diens insidious message to the king not many days after the sultans arrival the address of alla ul dien was brought to him setting forth that he was the kings slave and that all his own wealth was consecrated to him that being wearied by a tedious march he begged some repose at kurrah that he intended to kiss the footstool of the throne but that knowing he had some enemies at court who might have in his absence defamed him and deprived him of his majestys favor he and the chiefs who accompanied him in the expedition in which he was sensible he had exceeded his orders were apprehensive that some punishment might be inflicted upon them that he therefore requested to have a letter of grace to assure him and his followers of perfect safety under the royal protection which deceives the sultan the king having received this address expressed great joy and entirely laid aside all suspicions of alla ul dien he ordered a letter full of kindness and the most solemn assurances of protection to be wrote to him and dispatched by the hands of two messengers of distinction  alla pre to  bengal in the mean time alla ul dien was preparing to retreat to bengal he was now joined by all the zemindars of the neighboring districts who inlisted themselves under his fortunate banners the messengers a d      higer     perceived plainly his intentions but they were detained and watched so strictly that they could send no advices to the king malleck almass who was also son in law and nephew to sultan firose in the mean time received advices from his brother alla ul dien that it was now become public at kurrah that the king intended certainly to take his life for proceeding to deogire contrary to his orders that he repented the occasion and had taken his majestys displeasure which to him was worse than death so much to heart that he was afraid excess of sorrow would put an end to his melancholy life he therefore requested that his brother should inform him before the king put his design in execution that he might either take poison or look out for a place of security  his insidious letters to the court letters to the same purpose were day after day wrote to his brother almass beg who being in the plot was constantly at court and showed them to the king seemingly distracted lest his brother should lay violent hands upon himself or fly his country he used a thousand delusive arts to inveigle the king who no less feared the loss of the treasure than his nephews life to kurrah the sultan inveigled to proceed to kurrah the old man at last took the golden bait and embarked with a thousand horse and a small retinue on the ganges ordering malleck ahmed chip to follow with the army by land  alla ul dien hearing of the sultans departure from delhi crossed the ganges with his army and encamped near mannickpoor upon the opposite bank when upon the seventeenth of ramzaan the sultans umbrella appeared in sight alla ul dien drew out his army on pretense of doing him honor and sent his brother almass beg who had come on before to concert measures to introduce the king into camp this artful traitor represented to the sultan that if he should take the thousand horse with him alla ul dien might be alarmed for that some bad people had confirmed him so strongly a d      higer     in his fears that all he could say to him was not sufficient entirely to expel his suspicions  persuaded to leave his retinue behind him the poor old king suspecting nothing of this horrid treachery from a man whom he had cherished from his infancy in his bosom gave into this proposal he ordered a few of his select friends into his own boat and commanded the fleet to remain some distance behind when they came near the camp almass beg again opened the mouth of delusion and told the king that his brother seeing so many men in complete armor might possibly be startled that therefore as he had taken such ridiculous notions into his head which no body could remove it were better to avoid the least appearances to favor them the weak king might have seen that this was overdoing the matter but perhaps he thought it now too late to reveal his suspicions being near the skirts of the camp and that an open confidence might be his best security he therefore ordered all his attendants to unbuckle their armor and lay their weapons aside malleck charram vakiel of the empire opposed this step with great vehemence for he plainly saw into the bottom of their perfidy but the traitor had such a soft and plausible tongue that at last he yielded though with great reluctance  they had now reached the landing place and alla ul dien appeared upon the bank with his attendants whom he ordered to halt he himself advancing alone met the sultan just after he had landed upon the beach and fell down prostrate at his feet the old man in a familiar manner tapped him on the cheek and raising him up embraced him saying i who have brought you up from your infancy and cherished you with a fatherly affection holding you dearer in my sight if possible than my own offspring and who have not yet washed the odors of your infant smiles from my garments how could you imagine i should entertain a thought to your a d      higer     prejudice then taking him by the hand he was leading him back into the royal

liver in the arms of kindness and in their gratitude confideth his strength  alla ul dien immediately exalted the white umbrella over his own head but the vengeance of heaven soon after fell heavy on all who were concerned in the assassination of the late king they relate that when alla ul dien visited a reverend sage named shech karrick mudgzu who is buried at kurrah and whose tomb is held sacred to this day he rose from his pillow and repeated an extempore verse to the following purpose he comes but his head shall fall in the boat and his body shall be cast into the ganges which they say was explained a few hours after by the death of the unfortunate king whose head was thrown into the boat upon that occasion the miserable end of the assassins mamood the son of salem one of the assassins

overthrown ziffer chan began the action with great impetuosity on the right and breaking with his elephants the enemys line commenced a dreadful slaughter and bore them like a torrent before him inclining then to the left he pressed upon their flank and put their whole army to flight before the action was well begun in the center  the sultan seeing the victory complete ordered elich chan who commanded on the left to advance and pursue the enemy but the perfidious man jealous of the glory of ziffer chan stopped at a small distance ziffer chan pressing  upon the enemy while ziffer chan continued the slaughter for upwards of thirty miles one of the mogul chiefs who commanded the left seeing ziffer chan was not supported rallied with ten thousand horse and sending advice to cuttuligh chaja he also returned with ten thousand more and attacked ziffer in the rear the brave general saw into his error but it was now too late to retreat he drew up his troops which were not half the

last cut in pieces with a few trusty servants who stood by him to the last  the moguls retreat this advantage however did not dispel the fears of the moguls they continued their retreat and evacuated hindostan with all expedition the bravery of ziffer chan became famous among the moguls when their horses started or were unruly they used wantonly to ask them whether they saw the ghost of ziffer chan sultan alla ul dien it is said esteemed the death of this great general as a second victory and could not help expressing his satisfaction upon the occasion and thus displayed his own base ingratitude for that brave life which had been thrown away in his unworthy service great rejoicings were made at delhi to celebrate the victory and the principal officers were rewarded with titles and

dedicate the few years he had to live by the course of nature to martyrdom with this firm resolution he waited upon the king whom he found drinking wine with a great number of his principal omrahs alla ul mulucks advice to the king the king beginning to confer with muluck upon the occasion the old man told him he had something to say to him in private and would be glad he should order the wine and the company away the king smiled and desired all the company to retire except four  a d      higer     the old cutwal then fell upon his face and having kissed the ground at his feet rose up and thus spoke against his scheme of a new religion o king religion is the law of god by his spirit inspired in his prophets nor depends it upon the opinions of mortals we are taught by his word to

monarchs and his successors labor for ages to subvert our faith that they might establish their own what rivers of blood were spilt in the contest till at length the spirit of truth prevailed and they became proselytes to that religion which they had labored so long to destroy  the sultan having listened with attention replied what you have said is just and founded on friendship and reason i will for ever lay aside all thoughts of this scheme which has so long engaged my attention but what do you think of my project of universal conquest  malleck alla ul muluck answered against his project of universal conquest some kings in former ages formed the same great resolution which your majesty does at present and your power personal bravery and wealth gives you at least equal hopes of success

principles and the cunning and treachery of the present times were then held in utter abomination your majesty has no counselors like aristotalice aristotle  who kept by his wisdom and policy not only his own country in peace and security but brought other nations by voluntary consent under his masters protection if your majesty can put equal confidence in your omrahs and can depend so much upon the love of your people as aescunder you may then carry your scheme into execution if not we cannot well reconcile it to reason  the king enquiring how he should employ his power the king after musing awhile said what you have told me bears the face of sincerity and truth but what avails all this power in armies in wealth and in kingdoms if i content myself with what i already possess nor employ it in acquiring conquest and glory  is advised to conquer the unsubdued provinces of hindostan alla ul muluck replied that there were two undertakings in which his treasure might be expended to good purpose the first was the conquest of the southern kingdoms of hindostan such as rintimpore chitore jallore chunderi and malava and the second the reduction of all the western provinces which had been invaded by the moguls such as limghan cabul ghizni toor and chorrassan this said the cutwal would secure the peace of hindostan and procure to the king immortal honor in bestowing happiness upon his people a thing greater in itself than if he should consume the world in the flames of war but even to succeed in this project it is requisite that the sultan should abstain from excess of wine and from luxurious pleasures  the sultan  the cutwal sultan alla ul dien contrary to the old mans expectations took all this advice in good part and praising him for his fidelity presented a d      higer     him with a royal chelat ten thousand rupees two horses caparisoned and two villages in freehold the other omrahs who though they themselves wanted the virtue or resolution to speak their minds were extremely pleased with the cutwal and sent him also presents to a great amount  the imperial army invading rintimpore the king in the year     according to the advice of malleck alla ul muluck called elich chan from samana nuserit chan from kurrah and others from their respective subadaries and sent them with a great army against the raja of rintimpore they soon took the fort of jain and afterward invested the capital nuserit chan advancing near the wall was crushed to death by a stone from an engine is defeated and the raja at the same time sallying with forty thousand men drove elich chan back to jain with great loss  the sultan takes the field elich chan wrote to delhi the particulars of this defeat the sultan flew into a violent rage and immediately took the field upon his march he halted for a day at a place called jilput and went out a hunting having wandered far from his camp in the chase he remained with his attendants all night in the forest in the morning before sunrise he placed himself upon a rising ground where he sat down with two or three attendants and commanded the rest to hunt in his view akit chan observing this recollected that it was now in his power to cut off the king in the same manner as the king himself had cut off his predecessor he thought that being nephew and brother in law to the emperor he might claim by that and the influence he had by being vakeel muttaluck the same title which alla himself had to the empire alla ul dien was himself the nephew and son in law to firose shaw whom he murdered   a conspiracy akit chan imparted his resolution to a few chosen horsemen who accompanied him on this party they immediately rode up to the a d      higer     king saluted him with a flight of arrows two of which entered his body so that he lay for dead on the ground akit chan upon this drew his sword and ran to cut off his head when he was told by one of the kings attendants that he was quite dead that therefore to cut off his head would be an unnecessary piece of cruelty  akit chan mounts the throne akit being thus prevailed upon to desist from his intentions set out for the camp with all expedition mounted the throne and proclaimed the sultans death the army was thrown into great confusion but where loyal affection and patriotism are things unknown mankind are satisfied to bow their necks to any new master the great men assembled to pay their court and present their nizirs or presents upon the occasion the customary service was read from the coran the chutba was proclaimed aloud and the singers ordered to extol his praise akit chan then rose from the throne and proceeded toward the haram but malleck dinar the chief eunuch with his guard stopped him at the door swearing that till he showed him the sultans head or put him to death he should not enter  the sultan is advised to return to his army sultan alla ul dien in the mean time recovered his senses and having his wounds bound up imagined that akit chans treason and treachery was a preconcerted conspiracy of the omrahs he signified his intentions to fly to his brother elich chan at jain with about sixty servants who still attended him malleck humid ul dien deputy porter of the presence advised the sultan against this resolution he told him that he ought immediately to go to his own camp and there show himself to his army for that the usurper had not yet time to establish himself and that upon seeing the emperors umbrella he doubted not but the whole army would immediately return to their duty he observed at the same time that the least delay might render his affairs irrecoverable  a d      higer     the sultan saw the propriety of this resolute advice and mounting his horse with great difficulty spread the white umbrella which lay on the field over his head and with his small retinue proceeded toward the army when he appeared in sight being joined by some foraging parties on the way he was now guarded by about five hundred men he ascended an eminence in full view of the camp where he was at once seen by the whole army who desert the usurper they crowded in thousands toward him and the court of the usurper was immediately broke up and in a few minutes he found himself alone in this situation he mounted his horse and distracted with fear fled toward binour  sultan alla ul dien now marched down from the eminence toward the royal pavillion and mounting the throne gave public audience sending at the same time a party of horse after the usurper he is taken and slain they soon came up with him and brought back his head the sultan ordered the usurpers brother cuttulich chan and the chief conspirators to be put to death  alla besieges rintimpore when alla recovered of his wounds he continued his march to rintimpore where he was joined by elich chan and began to besiege the place but the hindoos so well defended themselves that numbers of the imperial army daily fell the sultan however continued his attacks with redoubled obstinacy while detachments of his army ravaged the adjacent territories of malava and daar a rebellion quashed but the siege being protracted for some months without much effect amir omar and mungu chan who were both nephews to the emperor and held the governments of budaoon and oud rebelled and raised a great army the sultan wrote letters to the several omrahs of those provinces whom he thought loyal as also to the neighboring subas and zemindars and they levied forces engaged defeated and took the rebels and sent them both prisoners to the a d      higer     royal camp the sultan ordered their eyes to be put out and then to torture them to death as a barbarous example to others  an extraordinary conspiracy notwithstanding this severity one of the most extraordinary conspiracies recorded in history was undertaken by hadjee mola the son of a slave of the old cutwal amir ul omrah fuchir ul dien this ambitious youth seeing the sultan busied in the siege of rintimpore began to form the scheme of a revolution in the empire he was perhaps moved to this scheme by the murmuring of the citizens against alla ul mulucks deputy tirmazi who in his masters absence in camp oppressed the people having the government entirely in his hands the first thing however that hadjee mola publicly did was in the heat of the day when every body was gone to rest to collect a mob of citizens by a forged order from the king with these he hastened to the house of tirmazi and sent in to tell him that a messenger had arrived with an order from the king tirmazi out of respect to the sultans order hastened to the door when the young impostor showing him the paper in one hand cut him down with the other he then read aloud the forged mandate for that purpose  a sedition at della the mob now increasing he sent parties to secure the city gates and dispatched a person to alla ul dien eaz who was cutwal of the new city to come and see the kings order this magistrate however having heard of the disturbance paid no regard to the message but shut his own gates hadjee mola in the mean time with his mob entered the red palace and released all the state prisoners taking out all the arms treasure and valuable effects which he divided among his followers he then by force placed allavi one of the prisoners who was descended from altumsh upon the throne and imperiously commanded all the principal men of the city to pay him allegiance  a d      higer     the sultan having advice of these strange transactions was struck motionless with astonishment but stirred not a step from the siege he however wrote to malleck himid ul dien his foster brother who raising a party in the city seized the budaoon gate the seventh day after the usurpation and took the field where he was joined by a great multitude from the new city and the country around with these he again by surprise entered the city at the ghizni gate but he was met at the second gate called beder by hadjie mola and his associates and a sharp conflict ensued himmid ul dien being dismounted run up to hadjie mola who was leading on his party with great bravery and pulling him from his horse threw him down in the street and slew him he himself in the mean time received several wounds quashed but the faction of hadjie mola dispirited by his death gave ground and dispersed themselves all over the city himid ul dien then proceeded to the red palace dragged from thence the unfortunate allavi and sent his head round the city upon the point of a spear which put an end to this strange conspiracy  elich chan sent to punish the rebels elich chan was in the mean time sent by the sultan to delhi to punish all who were supposed to have had any hand in this rebellion the sons of malleck ul omrah fuchir ul dien and the old cutwal himself were put to death merely on suspicion as the rebel had been one of their dependants but the most probable cause was their great wealth which was confiscated to the king  rintimpore taken rintimpore had now been closely besieged for a whole year and the sultan after trying all other means fell upon the following expedient to take the place he collected together a great multitude of people and provided each of them with a bag which they filled with earth and having begun at some distance from the rock with immense labor formed an ascent to the top of the walls by which a d   00 higer  00 the troops entered the place and put raja amir deo his family and the garrison to the sword this fort is esteemed the strongest in hindostan  mier mahummud shaw the mogul general who had taken refuge in rintimpore after the mutiny at jallore having lost most of his men in the defense of the fort was himself lying ill of his wounds when the sultan entered the place alla finding the unfortunate mahummud in this condition asked him in an insulting manner what gratitude would he express for his lord should he command his wounds to be immediately cured the mogul fiercely replied i would put him to death for a tyrant and endeavor to make the son of amir deo to whom my gratitude is due king mahummud shaw put to a cruel death the sultan enraged at this reply threw him beneath the feet of an elephant but considering afterward that he was a brave man and one of whose gallant behavior he himself had been often witness he ordered his body to be put in a coffin and interred with decent solemnity the sultan then commanded that the rajas vizier who had deserted over to him with a strong party during the siege should with all his followers be massacred saying upon the occasion that those who have betrayed their natural lord can never be true to another having bestowed the government of rintimpore with all the riches taken in it upon his brother elich chan he returned with his army to delhi but elich chan about six months after fell sick and died on his way to the capital  the sultan convenes a council of the omrahs alla ul dien being in the course of this year apprehensive of conspiracies and insurrections called together the omrahs who were most renowned for their wisdom and commanded them to give their opinion without reserve how he should conduct matters so as to prevent disturbances and rebellions in the empire he at the same time desired them to explain what they thought were the principal a d   00 higer  00 causes of those disorders the omrahs after consulting among themselves replied that there were many causes concurring in a state from which the convulsions disagreeable in their consequences proceeded that as those misfortunes could not be obviated at once they would only mention for that time a few of those evils from which danger to the empire must have arose  the causes of disturbances in the empire at the head of this list said the omrahs we must place the kings inattention to advance the good or to redress the wrongs of the people the public use of wine is the source of many disorders for when men form themselves into societies for the purpose of drinking their minds are disclosed to one another while the strength of the liquor fermenting in their blood precipitates them into the most desperate undertakings the connections formed by the great men of the court are pregnant with danger to the state their numerous marriages and the places in their gift draw the strength of the government into the hands of a few who are always able by associating themselves together to create revolutions in the empire the fourth and not the least cause of disturbance is the unequal division of property for the wealth of a rich empire is circulated in a few hands and therefore the governors of provinces are rather independent princes than subjects of the state  the sultan begins to redress grievances the sultan approved so much of the remarks of his omrahs that he immediately began to carry into execution the plan which they laid before him he first applied himself to a strict inquiry into the administration of justice to redress grievances and to examine narrowly into the private as well as public characters of all men of rank in the empire he laid himself out to procure intelligence of the most secret discourses of families of note in the city as well as of every transaction of moment in the most distant provinces he executed justice with such rigor and severity that robbery and theft formerly a d   00 higer  00 so common were not heard of in the land the traveller slept secure upon the public highway and the merchant carried his commodities in safety from the sea of bengal to the mountains of cabul and from tilling to cashmire  forbids the use of wine he published an edict against the use of wine and strong liquors upon pain of death he himself set the example to his subjects and emptied his cellars in the street in this he was followed by all ranks of people so that for some days the common sewers flowed with wine  prohibits marriages without license he issued out orders that no marriage among the nobility should be ratified without a special license from him that no private meetings or conversation should be held among the omrahs which proved a severe check to the pleasures of society this latter order was carried into such rigorous execution that no man durst entertain his friends without a written permission from the vizier  seizes upon the effects of the wealthy he then lengthened the hand of violence upon the rich he seized upon the wealth and confiscated the estates of mussulmen and hindoos without distinction and by this means he accumulated an immense treasure men in short were almost reduced to a level over all the empire  cuts off fees from the offices all emoluments were cut off from the different offices which were filled with men whose indigence and dependence rendered them implicitly obedient to the dictates of government  an equal land tax established he ordered a tax of half the real annual produce of the lands to be raised over all the empire and to be regularly transmitted to the exchequer he appointed officers to superintend the collectors who were to take care that the zemindars should take no more from the a d   00 higer  00 poor farmers than in proportion to the estimate which they had given in of their estates and in case of disobedience or neglect the superintendants were obliged to refund the overplus and to pay a fine for the oppression the farmers at the same time were confined to a certain proportion of land and to an appointed number of servants and oxen to cultivate the same no grazier was permitted to have above a certain number of cows sheep and goats and a tax was paid out of them to the government  severity to the officers of the revenue so strictly did the sultan look after the behavior of the collectors and other officers of the revenue that many of them who formerly kept great retinues were obliged to dismiss them and to have all the menial offices of their families performed by their wives and children neither were they permitted to resign their employs till they found others as capable as themselves to execute the duties of their office   these regulations were good but they were arbitrary and severe he broke through all laws and customs which according to the mahommedan law were left to the decision of the casis other monarchs left state affairs to the common course of justice alla descended to all the inferior departments of government it was with him a common saying that religion had no connection with civil government but was only the business or rather amusement of private life and that the will of a wise prince was better than the variable opinions of bodies of men  the sultan appie hself to letters as the sultan was known to be illiterate it became a maxim with the learned men at court to talk upon no subjects which they knew must be beyond the kings knowledge he was however so sensible of the disadvantages which he labored under by his ignorance of letters that he applied himself privately to study and soon notwithstanding a d   0  higer  0  the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge of the persian manner of writing which generally requires ten or twelve years study he soon read all addresses and made himself acquainted with the best authors in the language after he had proceeded so far as to be able to hold part in learned discourses he encouraged literary subjects and showed particular favor to all the eminent men of that age particularly to casi zea ul dien molana zehirling to molana murshid corami and cuzi moiz ul dien biana he appointed the last of those learned men to explain the law to him which he did according to the true spirit in every point upon which he was consulted he did not however do it without fear and trembling where it differed from the kings violent maxims of government  the sultan reduces chitor the sultan much about this time sent an army by the way of bengal to reduce the fort of arinkil which was in the possession of the raja of tilling he himself moved the royal standard toward chitor which had never before been reduced by the troops of islam after a siege of six months he took the place in the year  0  conferred the government of it upon his eldest son chizer chan and called it chizerabad he at the same time bestowed upon chizer regal dignities and authority  the moguls invade hindostan intelligence of this expedition arriving at maver ul nere jirghi who distinguished himself formerly against ziffer chan thinking that the sultan would be a long time absent seized that opportunity for invading hindostan alla hearing of this dangerous inroad abandoned all his schemes against the decan and made what haste he could with his army to delhi  they advance toward delhi jirghi with twelve tomans of mogul horse approached in a few days the city and encamped upon the banks of the jumna the horse of the imperial army being absent on the expedition to a d   0  higer  0  arinkil the sultan was in no condition to face upon equal terms so powerful and warlike an enemy in the field he therefore contented himself with entrenching his army in the plain beyond the suburbs till he could draw the forces of the distant subas together but the moguls having the command of the adjacent country prevented the succors from joining the sultan and proceeded so far as to plunder the suburbs in the kings presence without his being able to prevent them  in this situation stood affairs for two months and then the sultan say some authors had recourse to supernatural aid he applied to a saint of those days whose name was shech nizam ul dien aulia but retreat the saint in one night without any visible cause struck the mogul army with a panic which occasioned their precipitate retreat to their own country but we have no reason to ascribe the flight of the moguls to so weak and superstitious a cause as private order intelligence or the improbability of success brought about their sudden departure more than the power of the saint the sultan during this alarming period was heard to confess that his ideas of universal conquest were idle and ridiculous for that there were many heads in the world as hard as his own  alla being relieved from the perils of this invasion built a palace upon the spot where he had entrenched himself and ordered the citadel of delhi to be pulled down and built anew alla levies a great army he then began to recruit his army with an intention to retaliate upon the moguls their repeated inroads he increased his forces to such a prodigious number that upon calculating the expense he found his revenues and what treasures he had himself could not support them above six years he resolved therefore to reduce the pay but it occurred to him that this could not be done with propriety without lowering proportionably the price of horses arms and provisions a d   0  higer  0  this he did by an edict which he strictly enforced all over the empire settling the price of every article at about half the common rate which in fact was just doubling his treasure and revenues  the prices of grain regulated to establish this reduction of the price with respect to grain he ordered great magazines to be built upon the rivers jumna and ganges and other places convenient for water carriage under the direction of malleck cabuli this collector received half of the land tax in grain and the royal agents supplied the markets at a stated price to prevent any monopoly in this article every farmer was allowed to retain only a certain quantity according to the number of his family and send the overplus as soon as it was threshed out to market for which he was obliged to take the standing price the importation of grain was encouraged but to export it or any other article of provisions was a capital crime the king himself had a daily report laid before him of the quantity sold and remaining in the several royal granaries and spies were appointed in the different markets to inform him of abuses which he punished with the utmost rigor  and of cloth the sultan also appointed a public office and inspectors who fixed the price of the various kinds of cloth according to its quality obliging the merchants to open their shops at certain hours every day and sell their goods at the stipulated price he at the same time opened a loan by which they were enabled to procure ready money to import cloth from the neighboring countries where the poverty of the people rendered their manufactures cheaper but what is somewhat unaccountable the exportation of the finer kind of manufacture was prohibited yet not permitted to be worn at home except by special authority from the king which favor was only conferred upon men of rank  a d   0  higer  0  of horses as horses had arose to an immense price by an association of the dealers who only bought up a certain number from the persian and northern merchants to inhance the price the king published an edict by which they were obliged to register the prices paid for them and to sell them at a certain profit within such a time if that price was offered them otherwise the king took them upon his own account the price of the horse was at the same time according to his quality and care was taken by that means that the merchants and dealers in those animals should not have an opportunity by secret connivance to raise the price many frauds being found out in this article some time after a great number of horse dealers were whipped out of the city and others put to death oxen sheep goats camels and asses were also taken into consideration and in short every useful animal and all commodities were sold at a stated price in the bazars  the sultan having thus regulated the prices of things his next care was to new model his army settles the pay of the army he settled the pay of every horseman for himself and horse from     rupees a year down to  0 according to the goodness of the horse and upon a muster he found his cavalry to consist of four hundred and seventyfive thousand  the moguls invading hindostan are overthrown in the mean time ali beg the grandson of chingez chan and jirpal chaja with forty thousand horse made an irruption into hindostan but the sultan sending malleck tughlick with a force against them they were defeated with the loss of seven thousand ali beg and jirpal with nine thousand of their troops were taken prisoners they were sent in chains to the sultan who ordered the chiefs to be thrown under the feet of an elephant and the soldiers to be inhumanly massacred he appointed tughlick for this service viceroy of punjab  alip chan was about this time appointed amir ul omrah of guzerat and sent thither with a great force ain ul muluck moultani a d   0  higer  0  an omrah of great fame was at the same time ordered with a numerous army to the conquest of malava malava reduced he was opposed by kokah the raja with forty thousand rajaput horse and one hundred thousand foot an engagement ensued in which ain ul muluck proved victorious and took the cities of ugein mandu daranagurri and chanduri he after these successes dispatched a fat namma a writing of victory pompous accounts of his actions according to their custom to the emperor who upon receiving it ordered a rejoicing of seven days throughout the city of delhi kuntir deo the governor of the fort of jallore terrified by the conquests of ain ul muluck gave up that place upon terms of capitulation  the raja of chitor makes his escape the raja of chitor who had been prisoner since the emperor took that place found in the mean time means to make his escape in a very extraordinary manner the sultan having heard extravagant things in praise of the beauty and accomplishments of one of the rajas daughters told him that if he would send her he should upon her account be released  the raja who was very ill treated in his confinement consented and sent for his daughter with a manifest design to prostitute her to the king the rajas family hearing this dishonorable proposal concerted means of poisoning the raja to save their own reputation but the daughter being a girl of invention proposed a stratagem to release her father and at the same time to save her own honor she accordingly wrote to her father to give out that she was coming with all her attendants and would be at delhi upon a certain day acquainting him with the part she intended to act by the contrivance of his daughter her contrivance was this she selected a number of enterprising fellows who in complete armor concealed themselves in doolies or close chairs in which the women are always carried she provided for them a chosen retinue of horse and foot as is customary to guard ladies of a d   0  higer  0  rank she herself by this time had by her fathers means received the sultans passport and the whole cavalcade proceeded to delhi and were admitted without interruption it was now night and by the sultans permission they were permitted to see the raja the chairs being carried into the prison and the attendants having taken their stations without the armed men started out of the chairs and putting all to the sword within the courts carried the raja out and having horses prepared for him he mounted and with his attendants rushed out of the city before any opposition could be made and fled to his own country  in the year  0  kabeik an omrah of dova chan king of maver ul nere with design to revenge the death of ali beg and jirpal invaded hindostan with a great army and ravaging moultan proceeded to sewalic the moguls overthrown malleck tughlick in the mean time collecting his forces cut off the retreat of the moguls before any troops arrived from delhi and defeated them with great slaughter those who escaped the sword finding it impossible to force their way home retired into the desert where thirst and the hot winds which blow at that season put an end to their miserable lives so that out of fifty seven thousand horse besides their attendants who were still more numerous only three thousand who were taken prisoners survived this horrid scene the unhappy captives were only reserved for greater misery they were sent to delhi with their unfortunate chief kabeik where they were all trodden to death by elephants except some women and children who were sold in the market for slaves  these repeated misfortunes did not however discourage the moguls aekbalmund a chief of great reputation soon after invaded hindostan with a powerful army the moguls again overthrown but malleck tughlick defeated him also with great slaughter and sent some thousand prisoners to a d   0  higer  0  delhi who were dispatched by the customary inhumanity of alla fear from this time forward took possession of the moguls and they gave over all thoughts of hindostan for many years they were even hard pressed to defend themselves for malleck tughlick made incursions into their country every year plundering the provinces of cabul ghizni candahar and garrimsere or laying them under heavy contributions  the sultan busy in settling the police of the empire in the mean time the sultan was employed in settling the internal policy and government of his empire and with such fortunate perseverance in whatever he undertook that the superstition of the times ascribed his success to supernatural power amazed at the good effects that flowed from the strictness of his government  ram deo raja of deogire in the decan having neglected to send the revenues of that district which he assigned over to the sultan by treaty malleck cafoor with many omrahs of renown and a great army was ordered to conquer the decan this cafoor was one of the sultans catamites and originally a slave taken by force from a merchant of guzerat as we have already mentioned the emperors affection for cafoor exceeded all the bounds of decency and prudence upon the present occasion he gave him the title of malleck naib cafoor that is a viceroy with all the ensigns of royalty  commanding the omrahs who attended him to pay their respects to him every day as to a sovereign this created among them great disgust but they durst not murmur chaja hadjee was appointed his lieutenant a man much esteemed in those days for his good principles the imperial army invades the decan in the beginning of the year  0  they marched from delhi with an army of one hundred thousand horse and were joined in their way by ain ul muluck moultani suba of malava and alip chan suba of guzerat with their forces  a d   0  higer  0  comlades address to the sultan one of the sultans wives the fair comlade formerly mentioned hearing of this expedition addressed herself to the king and told him that before she was taken prisoner she had two beautiful daughters to raja kirren that one of them she heard had since died but that the other whose name was dewilde was still alive she therefore begged that the sultan should give orders to his generals to endeavor to get her into their possession and send her to delhi the king consented and gave orders accordingly  cafoor enters the decan malleck cafoor having passed through malava encamped upon the borders of the decan he sent the sultans order to raja kirren to deliver up his daughter dewilde which was now urged as a pretext for commencing hostilities in case of a refusal the raja could by no means be brought to agree to this demand malleck cafoor therefore marched from his camp at nidderbar while alip chan with his forces from guzerat was taking the rout of the mountains of buckelana to enter the decan by another pass he was opposed by raja kirren who defeated all his attempts for two months in which time several undecisive actions were fought  singeldeo demands dewilde in marriage singeldeo the son of ram deo raja of deogire who had been contracted to the young dewilde without consent of his father sent his brother bimedeo with presents to raja kirren persuading him that as dewilde was the occasion of the war if he should deliver her over to him the troops of islam in despair of obtaining their ends would return to their own country raja kirren who depended much upon the young princes aid consented to this proposal and gave his daughter then in her thirteenth year in marriage to singeldeo  alip chan hearing this news was greatly terrified lest the sultan should impute this circumstance to his slowness and was resolved at a d   0  higer  0  alip chan designs to intercept her all events to seize her before her departure as he was certain his own life depended upon his success he acquainted all the omrahs with his intentions who readily seconded the attempt he then entered the mountains with his army and engaging the raja gave him a total defeat upon which kirren fled to deogire leaving all his elephants tents and equipage upon the field alip chan pursued him through the hills for some days but at length entirely lost his track and all intelligence concerning him and his daughter but in the end accident threw this pearl in his way  halting to refresh his army two days among the mountains some of his troops without leave to the number of three hundred went from the camp to see a famous mountain in the neighborhood of deogire from which city he was not then far distant in their excursion they saw a great troop of horse whom they apprehended to belong to ramdeo and to be in pursuit of them as there was no safety in flight they were determined to stand on their defense and accordingly drew up to receive the enemy this troop proved to be the retinue of bimedeo who was carrying the young bride to his brother seizes her by an accident the two parties in short engaged and the hindoos were put to flight while an unfortunate arrow having pierced the horse of dewilde the unhappy fair one was abandoned in the field the conquerors seeing her gathered round her horse and commenced a bloody scuffle about the prize this might have proved fatal to the beautiful dewilde had not one of her female slaves told aloud her name and quality conjuring them to carry her to their commander with that respect which was due to her rank and sex upon hearing this they knew the peril of treating her with any indignity and while an express was dispatched with the news to alip chan they conducted her with great care and respect to the camp  a d   0  higer  0  he conducts her to delhi alip chan having obtained this prize was exceedingly rejoiced knowing how acceptable it would be to his prince over whom the ladys mother had great influence he therefore prosecuted his conquests no further but returned to guzerat and from thence carried dewilde to delhi and presented her to her mother in a few days her beauty inflamed the heart of the sultans eldest son chizer chan to whom she was given in marriage the history of the loves of this illustrious pair is wrote in an elegant poem by amir chusero  cafoors transactions in the decan let us now return to malleck naib cafoor whom we left entering the decan he first subdued the country of the mahrattors which he divided among his omrahs then proceeded to the siege of deogire since known by the name of dowlatabad ramdeo being in no condition to oppose this great army prudently left his son singeldeo in the fort and advanced himself with great presents to the conqueror to procure peace which was accordingly settled between them malleck cafoor upon this wrote a fatee namma to the king and some time after brought ramdeo with rich presents and seventeen elephants to pay his allegiance to him at delhi where he himself was received with the most extravagant marks of favor and distinction ramdeo had royal dignities conferred upon him with the title of rai raian prince of princes  and had not only the government of his own dominions restored to him but others were also added for all which he did homage and paid tribute to the sultan the king moreover gave him the district of nosari near guzerat by way of jagier and a lack of rupees to bear his expenses home thus he dismissed ramdeo with princely

return was due to the raja upon this account  the sultan besieges and takes sewana during the absence of cafoor on his expedition to the decan the king employed himself in taking a strong fort to the southward of delhi called sewana which had often been attempted in vain when jilleldeo the raja of this place found he could hold out no longer he sent his own image which had been cast in pure gold to the sultan with a chain round its neck in token of obedience this present was accompanied by a hundred elephants and other precious effects in hopes of procuring peace the sultan received the presents but returned him for answer that unless he came and made his submission in person he could hope little from his dumb representative the raja finding the sultan inexorable threw himself upon his mercy and delivered up the place the sultan plundered and again restored it but he alienated a great part of the rajas country to his favorite omrahs and bound him over to pay homage for the rest the sultan then proceeded to jallire which he took and returned to delhi  cafoor marches toward arinkil the sultan much about this time was informed that the expedition by the way of bengal to arinkil in the country of tilling had not succeeded and that his army on that side had been obliged to retreat in great distress in the year  0  he dispatched malleck cafoor with a great force to invade that country by the way of deogire with orders that if lidder deo prince of arinkil should consent to give him a handsome present and promise an annual tribute to return without prosecuting the war any further when malleck cafoor and chaja hadjee had reached deogire ram deo came out to meet them with offerings and carrying them home entertained them with great hospitality ordering his bazar to the camp with strict orders to sell every thing according to the sultans established price in his own dominions  a d   0  higer  0  enters tilling cafoor having marched from deogire appeared at indore upon the frontiers of tilling and issued orders to lay waste the country with fire and sword which struck the unhappy people who had never injured their wanton enemies with great terror and consternation in the mean time the neighboring rajas hastened with all their forces to support lidderdeo in this alarming juncture but as the imperial army proceeded with great expedition he was forced before the arrival of his allies to shut himself up in the fort of arinkil which was a place of great strength the allied rajas upon this also took possession of diverse strong holds round the country  besieges and takes arinkil malleck cafoor immediately invested the place and began his attacks which were carried on and repelled with great slaughter on both sides notwithstanding the interruptions that cafoor received from the rajas without the place arinkil after some months siege was taken by assault and the garrison massacred without mercy for the citadel to which lidderdeo had retired was not sufficient to contain the whole lidderdeo driven to this extremity bought his peace with three hundred elephants seven thousand horses and money and jewels to a very great amount agreeing at the same time to pay an annual tribute malleck cafoor after this advantageous peace returned with his army to delhi he dispatched before him the news of his victories which was read from the pulpit and a public rejoicing ordered upon his approach to the city the king himself came out and met him at the budaoon gate and there the conqueror laid all the spoils at his feet  cafoors expedition to the decan in the year   0 the sultan sent malleck cafoor and chaja hajee with a great army to reduce dhoor summund and maber in the decan where he had heard there were temples very rich in gold and jewels when they had proceeded to deogire they found that a d    0 higer   0 ram deo the old raja was dead and that the young raja singeldeo was not so well affected to them as they thought they therefore left some omrahs in a strong post upon the banks of the ganges and continued their march when they had passed the rajas territories they began their inhuman cruelties and after three months march from delhi arrived in the countries which they were commanded to subdue the raja of the carnatic overthrown they engaged bellal deo raja of the carnatic and defeating him took him prisoner and then ravaged his whole country they found in the temples prodigious spoils in idols of gold adorned with the most precious stones and other rich effects consecrated to their worship here the conqueror built a small mosque and ordered divine service to be read according to the mahommedan faith and the chutba to be pronounced in the emperors name this mosque remains entire in our days for the caffers the mahommedans give the name of cassers or infidels to all the nations who do not profess their own faith esteeming it a house consecrated to god would not destroy it this observation of our author sets the two religions in very opposite lights and is perfectly consistent with the principle of the universal charity of the hindoos who think that the same god is the object of all religions however much they may differ in ceremonies and tenets   an immense treasure discovered malleck naib cafoor having wearied his own inhumanity and avarice in destroying and robbing an unfortunate people resolved to return to delhi with his spoils the night before his intended march a quarrel arose among some brahmins who had taken protection in his camp from the plundering parties that scoured the country some body who understood their language found the quarrel was about the division of some hidden treasure which was immediately communicated to the cutwal who seized them and carried them to malleck cafoor to be examined they were at a d      higer     first very obstinate but their lives being threatened and each being questioned apart they were afraid one would inform against the other by which means they discovered all they knew seven different places were pointed out near the camp where immense treasures were concealed these being dug up and placed upon elephants malleck cafoor turned the points of his spears to delhi where he arrived without any remarkable occurrence in the year     he presented the sultan with     elephants  0000 horses   000 maunds of gold several chests of jewels and pearls and other precious things this treasure may appear to exceed all belief in the eyes of europeans but if we consider the hindoos as a mercantile people and not disturbed perhaps by wars for thousands of years and add to this that it is the invariable custom of that race to live with the abstinence of hermits in the midst of wealth our wonder will cease and the credit of our author remain entire the gold alone amounts to about one hundred millions of our money  the sultan upon seeing this treasure which exceeded that of baadawird or pirvez was greatly rejoiced and opened the doors of his bounty to all the generosity of the sultan he gave to each of the principal omrahs ten maunds and to the inferior five the learned men of his court received one maund and thus in proportion he distributed wealth to all his servants according to their rank and quality the remainder was melted down coined and lodged in the treasury it is said that during this expedition to the carnatic the soldiers threw the silver they found away as too cumbersome where gold was found in such plenty no person wore bracelets chains or rings of any other metal than gold while all the plate in the houses of the great and in the temples was of beaten gold neither was silver money at all current in that country should we believe the reports of those adventurers  soon after this accession of wealth the tyrannical alla exhibited a scene in the capital too dreadful to be varnished over by his great a d      higer     abilities the mogul converts in his army having incurred his displeasure he ordered them to be all discharged some of them engaged themselves in the service of the omrahs but the greater number remained at delhi in great distress in hopes that the sultan would relent by seeing their wretched poverty his inhumanity to the mogul mercenaries he however remained obdurate and some daring fellows among them forced by their misfortunes entered into a conspiracy to murder the king this plot being discovered the sultan instead of punishing the conspirators extended his inhuman rigor to the whole body he ordered them all to be instantly put to the sword so that fifteen thousand of those unhappy wretches lay dead in the streets of delhi in one day all their wives and children were enslaved the sultan was so inexorable and vindictive that no one durst attempt to conceal however nearly connected they might be any of the unfortunate moguls so that not one of them escaped  his pride and magificence the king elevated by his good fortune gave himself over to pride he listened to no advice as he sometimes condescended to do in the beginning of his reign but every thing was executed by his irrevocable word yet the empire never flourished so much as in this reign order and justice traveled to the most distant provinces and magnificence raised her head in the land palaces mosques universities baths spires forts and all manner of public and private buildings seemed to rise as by the power of enchantment neither did there in any age appear such a concourse of learned men from all parts forty five skilled in the sciences were professors in

seemed to have carried every thing to the height of perfection and to the extent of his wishes he all at once adopted every measure that evidently tended to subvert the great fabric which he had raised he resigned the reins of government entirely into the hands of malleck cafoor whom he blindly supported in his most impolitic and tyrannical actions this gave great disgust to the omrahs and spread universal discontent over the face of the people he neglected the education of his own children who were let out of the seraglio when very young and entrusted with independent power chizer chan was made viceroy of chitor when as yet a boy without any person of wisdom to advise him or to superintend his conduct while shadi chan mubarick chan and shab ul dien chan his other sons had appointments of the same important nature  the raja of tilling about this time sent some presents and twenty elephants to the king with a letter informing him that the tribute which he had agreed to pay in his treaty with malleck cafoor was ready to be paid malleck cafoor proposes an expedition to the decan malleck cafoor upon this desired leave of the king to make another expedition into the decan promising that he would not only collect the revenues which had fallen due but bring the raja of deogire and others who had withheld their allegiance and tribute under due subjection he was principally moved to this by his jealousy of chizer chan the declared heir to the empire whose government lay most convenient for that expedition and whom he feared the sultan intended to send  he enters the decan and reduces it the sultan consented to cafoors proposal and he accordingly proceeded the fourth time to the decan with a great army he seized the raja of deogire and inhumanly put him to death then ravaging the countries of mahrat connir dabul giwil raijore a d      higer     and mudkil took up his residence at deogire he raised the tribute from the rajas of tilling and the carnatic and in the year     dispatched the whole to the emperor  the king falls sick the sultan by this time by his intemperance in the seraglio ruined his constitution and was taken extremely ill his wife mallecke jehan and her son chizer chan neglected him entirely and spent their time in riot and revelry which added new strength to the kings disorder he therefore ordered malleck cafoor from the decan and alip chan from guzerat he told them in private of the unpolitic undutiful and cruel behavior of his wife and son malleck cafoor aspires to the throne cafoor who had before aspired in his mind to the empire now began seriously to form schemes for the extirpation of the royal line he for this purpose insinuated to the king that chizer chan mallecke jehan and alip chan had conspired against his life what gave color to this wicked accusation was that at this time mallecke jehan solicited the sultan to get one of alip chans daughters for her son shadi chan plts against chizer chan this traitor did not fail to improve this circumstance to his own advantage the king at length suffered suspicion to steal into his breast and ordered chizer chan to amrohe and there to continue till he himself should recover though chizer chan was mad with the follies of youth this command of his father made a deep impression on his mind and at his departure he made a private vow that if god should spare the life of his father he would return all the way on foot when he accordingly heard that his fathers health began to return he performed his vow and waited upon him at delhi  the traitor cafoor turned this filial piety entirely against chizer he insinuated that his behavior by such a sudden change could be imputed to nothing but hypocrisy and urged his disobedience by coming without his fathers leave pretending at the same time that a d      higer     he was intriguing with the omrahs about kindling a rebellion in the empire the sultan could not give entire credit to these insinuations he sent for chizer chan into his presence embraced him to try his affection and seeing him weep seemed convinced of his sincerity and ordered him into the seraglio to see his mother and sisters but unhappily for this prince the flights of his youth made him deviate again into his former wild amusements he neglected for several days to visit his father during which time his subtle enemy bribed over to his own interest the sultans private servants and called upon them to witness his aspersions against chizer who is imprisoned he at length by a thousand wiles and stratagems accomplished his purpose and prevailed upon the king to imprison his two sons chizer chan and shadi chan in the fort of gualier and their mother in the old citadel he at the same time procured an order to seize aliph chan who was unjustly put to death and his brother nizam ul dien suba of jallore was assassinated by seid cummal ul dien carrick who assumed his place  disturbances in the empire thus far the traitors schemes advanced in the direct road of success but now the fire which had long been smothered began to flame kindling first at guzerat into a general insurrection the sultan to suppress this rebellion sent cumal ul dien currik thither with a great army but the forces commanded by the friends of alip chan defeated him with great slaughter and put him to a cruel death in the mean time the suba of chitor threw the sultans officers over the wall and assumed independence while hirpal deo the son in law of ramdeo stirred up the decan to arms and took a number of the sultans garrisons  the sultan dies alla ul dien upon receiving this intelligence could do nothing but bite his own flesh in resentment his grief and rage served to strengthen his disorder which would yield to no power of medicine a d      higer     on the evening of the sixth of shawal in the year     he gave up that life which like a comet had spread terror and desolation through an astonished world but not without suspicion of being poisoned by the villain whom he had raised from the dust to power he reigned twenty years and some months  his character if we look upon the government and policy of alla ul dien a great king arises to our view if we behold his hands which are red an inexorable tyrant appears had he come by better means to the throne his abilities deserved it well but he began in cruelty and waded through blood to the end ambition was the favorite passion of his soul and from it sprung forth like branches injustice violence and rapine had fortune placed him at first on high his glory would not perhaps be tarnished with meanness and deceit but in whatever way that flame was to pass through the world his tract like that of a storm must have been marked with ruin he had some right as a warrior to the title of secunder sani but these two princes resembled one another in nothing but in success and bravery the first was polished and generous the latter was dark and rude

was to send a person to gualier to put out the eyes of chizer chan and shadi chan his orders were inhumanly executed and the sultana malleke jehan was put into closer confinement and all her wealth seized mubarick chan the third son of alla was also taken into custody with an intention to have his eyes put out like his unhappy brothers  cafoor though an eunuch marries one of the sultanas there

regent intended to put out the eyes of her son acquainted shech nizam ul dien of her intelligence and he gave her some hopes that the threatened misfortune should be prevented  sends to put out the eyes of mubarick malleck cafoor in the mean time to cloak his wicked designs placed the young king every day upon the throne and ordered the a d      higer     nobles to pay their respects as usual to the emperor he sent one night some assassins to cut off mubarick shaw but when they entered the apartment of the prince he conjured them to remember his father whose servants they were then untying a string of rich jewels from his neck which perhaps had more influence than his entreaties he gave it them they immediately abandoned their purpose but quarrelling about the division of the jewels when they had got out it was proposed to carry them to the chief of the footguards and acquaint him of what the prince had said and of their instructions from malleck cafoor  a conspiracy against cafoor the mubishir chief or commander of the footguards  who owed every thing to the favor of the deceased king was shocked at the villainy of cafoor and finding his people of the same sentiments he immediately formed a conspiracy against the tyrant he is assassinated and accordingly he and his lieutenant the bushier entered his apartment in a few hours and assassinated him with some of the principal eunuchs who were attached to his interest this happened thirtyfive days after the kings death and thus the world was rid of a monster too horrid to exist among mankind  mubarick chan ascends the throne when with the return of day the transactions of the night became public they gave general satisfaction mubarick chan was released from his confinement and had the reins of government placed in his hand he however did not immediately assume the throne but acted for the space of two months as regent or vizier for his brother till he had brought over the omrahs to his interest he then claimed his birthright to the diadem deposed his brother and acceded to the imperial dignity but according to the barbarous custom and policy of those days he deprived shab ul dien of his eyes and confined him for life in the fort of gualier after he had borne the title of king for three months and some days  section xv the reign of cuttub ul dien mubarick shaw chillige a d      higer     upon

the imperial dignity as also the bushire were ungratefully and inhumanly put to death by his orders under no better pretense than that they presumed too much upon the services they had done him it is probable he was instigated to this base action by his fears as in some measure appears by his immediately dispersing all the old peons who were under their command into different parts of the country mubarick began to dispense his favors among the omrahs but he disgusted them all by raising some of his slaves to that dignity  promotions at court malleck dinar shenapil was dignified with the title

was appointed to the command of the armies of malleck cafoor and shadi chan and at the same time to the honor of the vizarit without any one good quality to recommend him to those high employs  the sultan affects popularity the sultan whether to affect popularity or in remembrance of his late situation ordered all the prisons to be opened by which a d      higer     means seventeen thousand were blessed with the light of day and all the exiles were by proclamation recalled he then commanded to give to the army a present of six months pay and conferred upon many other private benefits he at the same time issued orders to give free access to all petitioners he eased the petitioners of some of their taxes but by too much relaxing the reins of government disorder and tumult arose which threw down to the ground the great fabric raised by alla ul dien he gave himself up entirely to wine revelry and lust these vices became fashionable at court from whence the whole body of the people were soon infected  guzerat reduced mubarick in the first year of his reign sent an army under the command of ain ul mulluck moultani into the province of guzerat which had revolted moultani was an omrah of great reputation he soon defeated the insurgents cut off their chiefs and settled the country in peace the king conferred the government of guzerat upon ziffer chan whose daughter he had taken in marriage ziffer chan soon after marched his army to narwalla the capital of guzerat where some disturbances had happened reduced the rebels confiscated their estates and sent their moveable

assistance of the other rajas of the decan had recovered his country the sultan at his departure appointed shahin the son of a slave to whom he gave the title of offa beg governor of delhi during his absence when he arrived near deogire hirpaldeo and the other rajas who were then besieging the place fled but some omrahs being ordered to pursue hirpaldeo he was brought back prisoner flead alive and beheaded his head was fixed above the gate of his own capital the sultan a d      higer     ordered his garrisons to be reestablished as far as the sea and built a mosque in deogire which still remains he then appointed malleck ecklikki one of his fathers slaves to command in the decan he in imitation of his father gave his catamite chusero chan the ensigns of royalty sending him toward malbar with part of his army then returned himself to delhi  a conspiracy malleck assid ul dien son to the sultans grand uncle seeing the king daily drunk and negligent of all the duties of a king or commander began to entertain thoughts of the empire and formed a conspiracy against his life this plot however was discovered by one of the conspirators and assid ul dien was condemned to death whether mubarick had found proofs that his brothers were concerned in this conspiracy we cannot learn the sultans cruelty but at that time he sent an assassin to gualier and these two unfortunate blind princes were inhumanly murdered and the fair dewilde brought to the royal haram  the emperor abandons himself to every species of vice mubarick finding himself in quiet possession of all the

every thing however bloody or unjust by his obstinate blind arbitrary will ziffer chan suba of guzerat among others fell a victim to his tyranny as also offa beg upon whom he had heaped such favors without any plausible pretenses against either he was infamous in short in every vice that can taint the human mind and descended so far from the royal character as to dress himself often like a common prostitute and go with the public women to dance at the houses of the nobility at other times he would lead a gang of those abominable prostitutes stark naked along the terraces of the royal palaces and make them play their fountains upon the omrahs a d      higer     as they entered the court these and such other vices and indecencies too shocking to mention were the constant amusements

and sent him prisoner to delhi where he was not only pardoned but permitted to resume his place in the kings favor malleck odgi ul dien toureshi being sent to guzerat in his stead about this time news arrived that malleck ecklikki governor of the decan had rebelled the sultan sent a great army to suppress that insurrection who found means to seize the rebel and his principal adherents and to send

to the throne his ambition was increased by his wealth and he began to aspire to the throne not being able to join to his interest any of the omrahs of his army he formed the means of their destruction for this purpose he called malleck tilbigha from the government of the island of koohe malleck timur and malleck mullhe affghan who were on different services and gave out that he had orders to return to delhi these omrahs having intelligence of his intentions disobeyed his commands and wrote a remonstrance to the sultan accusing chusero chan of conspiracy against the state the sultan a d      higer     on this ordered them to seize him and send him prisoner to delhi which accordingly they found means to execute but when he came before the king he pleaded his own innocence so artfully and blamed his accusers with such plausibility of truth that the sultan believing the whole proceeded from the disgust of their being commanded by his favorite he recalled them and notwithstanding they gave undoubted proofs of their assertions the sultan was determined to listen to nothing against this vile catamite he dishonored them confiscated all their estates turned them out to poverty and the world the other omrahs seeing that the enemies of chusero chan right or wrong were devoted to destruction the men of the best principles among them made excuses and obtained leave to retire to distant parts of the empire while the abandoned to all honor joined themselves to the catamite who was now the object of universal dread as well as the source of all benefits and promotion chusero continues his designs this slave in the mean time cherished his own ambitious views and began again to form measures for his own advancement  to accomplish his purpose he told the king that as his own fidelity and services had been by his majesty so generously rewarded and as he might still have occasion for them in the conduct of his military affairs while the omrahs from the pride of family were seditious and disobedient to his commands he begged that he might be permitted to call some of his relations from guzerat in whom he could more certainly confide the sultan agreed to this request and chusero chan sent a great sum of money by some of his agents to guzerat who collected about twenty thousand of the dregs of the people and brought them to delhi every place of profit and trust were conferred upon those vermin which bound them fast to chuseros interest and also upon all the a d    0 higer   0 villains about the city who were remarkable for their boldness and address  conspires against the sultans life the sultan in the mean time going to hunt toward jirsava a plot was formed to assassinate him but this was laid aside on account of some difference in opinion among the conspirators and therefore they resolved to perform their tragedy in the palace the sultan returned to delhi and according to custom gave himself up to his debaucheries chusero chan was warm in his project and took the opportunity of a favorable hour to beg leave of mubarick to entertain his friends in the outer court of the palace the sultan not only consented but issued orders to give them free access at all times by which means the courts of the palace became crowded with those vermin  the sultan informed of the plot in the mean time casi zea ul dien who was famous for his skill in astrology though upon this occasion we imagine he consulted his own judgment and not the stars ran into the presence and kissed the ground o king said he chusero chan is concerning means for your assassination if this should prove false his honesty will be the better established if otherwise caution is necessary because life is the most inestimable jewel the sultan smiled at the old man who had been one of his preceptors and told him he would make enquiry into that affair while instantly chusero chan entered in a female dress with all the affectations of a girl his infatuation the sultan upon seeing the infamous catamite repeated a verse to this effect if my beloved were guilty of ten thousand crimes one smile from him and i forget them all he then embraced chusero and actually did forget all that the casi had said  that night as the casi was suspicious of treason he could not go to rest but walked out about midnight to see whether the guards were a d      higer     watchful in their rounds he met mundule uncle to chusero chan who engaged him in conversation the old casi murdered in the mean time one jaherba came behind him and with one stroke of a sword stretched him upon the ground having only strength to cry out treason treason murder and treason are on foot while two servants who attended him run off screaming aloud that the casi was assassinated the guards started up in confusion but they were instantly attacked by the conspirators and massacred before they could prepare for their own defense  the sultan alarmed by the noise asked chusero chan who lay in his apartment the cause of it the villain arose to enquire and going out on the terrace stood for some time and returning told the king that some of the horses belonging to the guard had broke loose from their picquets and were fighting while the people were endeavoring to lay hold of them this satisfied the sultan for the present but soon after the conspirators having ascended the stairs and got upon the terraces which led to the royal sleeping apartment they were stopped by ibrahim and ishaac with all the porters of the private chambers whom they immediately put to the sword the sultan assassinated the sultan hearing the clash of arms and groans of dying men so near him rose up in great terror and confusion running toward the haram by a private passage chusero chan fearing he might escape rushed close after him and seizing him by the hair in the gallery struggled with him for some time the sultan being the stronger man threw chusero on the ground but as he had twisted his hand in his hair he could by no means disengage himself till some of the other conspirators came and with a stroke of a sabre cut off his head and threw it down into the court proclaiming the deed aloud to those below  a d      higer     the conspirators in the court below began to be hard pressed by the guards and the servants who had crowded from all quarters but upon hearing of the sultans fate they all hastened out of the palace a general massacre in the palace the conspirators then shut the gates and massacred all who had not the good fortune to escape particularly the younger

surrounded by his creatures mounted the throne and ridiculously assumed the title of nasir ul dien or the supporter of religion he then ordered all the slaves and servants of mubarick shaw who he

and he took the first opportunity to fly from delhi and join his father  the usurper was in great perplexity upon the flight of jonah and began already to give his hopes to the wind ghazi malleck immediately prepared for hostilities and by circular letters invited all the omrahs to join his standard a great many subas put their troops immediately in motion but mogulti the suba of moultan

he could depend against the confederates  ghazi malleck defeats the usurpers army and marches to delhi ghazi malleck now joined by byram ibah with the army from moultan and other subas advanced to meet the usurpers army which he did upon the banks of the sirusti but as the troops of ghazi malleck were experienced in frequent wars with the moguls and those of chusero enervated by indolence and debaucheries and besides lost to all sense of military honor they were broke at the first onset and all the public treasure elephants and baggage were taken this booty was divided in the field among the conquerors they then continued their march in triumph toward delhi chusero marches out of the city the usurper in great embarassment marched out of the city and took possession of a strong post near the great pond of alahi with the citadel in his rear and many gardens with high walls in his front he then opened the treasury and gave three years pay to his troops leaving nothing but the jewels of some of which he also disposed the confederates advancing in sight an action was expected next morning but that night ain ul muluck moultani drew off his forces from the usurper and took the rout of mindu this struck great terror into chuseros army they however drew up in order of battle and malleck tilbigha and shaista chan opposing the confederates with great bravery as they advanced through the lanes were at length overpowered and slain but their situation gave such advantages to the usurpers army that they maintained their post till the evening when the infamous chusero fled with a few of his friends toward jilput he is overthrown taken and slain in the way he was deserted by all his attendants and obliged to conceal himself in a tomb from whence he was dragged the next day and ordered to be put to death together with his brother who was taken in a neighboring garden  a d      higer     the day after this action being the first of shaban all the omrahs and magistrates of the city came to pay their respects to the victor and made him a present of the keys of the capital he mounted his horse and entered delhi in triumph when he came in sight of the palace of a thousand pillars he began to weep crying with a loud voice ghazi mallecks moderation o ye subjects of this great empire i am no more than one of you who unsheathed my sword to deliver you from oppression and rid the world of a monster my endeavors by the blessing of god have been crowned with success if therefore any of the royal line remain let them be brought that justice may take place and that we his servants may prostrate ourselves before his throne but if none of the race of kings have escaped the bloody hands of tyranny and usurpation let the most worthy of the illustrious order be elected among you and i shall swear to abide by your choice  the people called out with one voice that none of the princes were now alive that as he had shielded them from the vengeance of the moguls and delivered them from the rage of a tyrant none was so worthy to reign then seizing him in a manner by violence they placed him upon the throne and hailed him king of the world he mounts the throne by the name of yeas ul dien but he assumed the more modest title of yeas ul dien or the reformer of the religion the reign of chusero chan was five months nothing in history can exhibit such an example of the dissolute and infamous manners of any age or nation as we are presented with in the accounts of this wicked and shameful usurpation  section xvi the reign of sultan yeas ul dien tuglick shaw a d      higer     his pedigree uncertain we have no true accounts of the pedigree of tuglick shaw it is generally believed that his father whose name was malleck tuglick had been in his youth slave to sultan balin his mother was one of the tribe of the jits but indeed the pedigrees of the kings of the patan empire make such a wretched figure in history that we could wish to omit them were it not to show how far the depravity and corruption of a people can plunge them into the sink of slavery and subject them to the vilest of men  a wise prince when sultan yeas ul dien mounted the throne he began to regulate the affairs of government which had fallen into the utmost disorder by the most salutary and advisable methods which gained him general esteem he repaired the palaces and fortifications founded others and encouraged industry and commerce men of genius and learning were called to court institutes of laws and government were established and founded upon the coran and the ancient usages of the empire  promotions at court malleck fuchir ul dien jonah the sultans eldest son was declared heir apparent with the title of aligh chan and all the royal ensigns conferred upon

troops stationed on the frontiers the emperor in the mean time stationed troops upon the frontiers toward cabul and built forts to defend the country from the incursions of the moguls which he did so effectually as not to be troubled by these invaders during his reign  aligh chan marches against arinkil in the second year from his accession aligh chan with some of the old omrahs and the troops of chinderi budaoon and malava was dispatched toward tilling to chastise lidderdeo raja of arinkil who had during the late disturbances wrested his neck from the yoke and refused to send his tribute while the raja of deogire had also swerved from his allegiance aligh chan having advanced into those countries began a barbarous war with fire and sword lidderdeo opposed him with some vigor but was in the end obliged to retreat into the city of arinkil which aligh chan immediately invested  lays siege to arinkil the siege was carried on with great loss on both sides till the walls were battered down and a practicable breach made the mahommedan army in the mean time on account of the hot winds and bad water were seized with a malignant distemper that swept hundreds to their graves every day many became desirous to return home and spread false reports through the camp which threw universal consternation among the army as there had been no advices for above a month from delhi shech zuda dimiski obeid the poet and some others who were companions of aligh chan a d      higer     raised a report by way of jest that sultan yeas ul dien was dead and that a great revolution had happened in delhi not content with this they went to the tents of malleck timur malleck mul afghan malleck cafoor mordar and malleck tiggi who were the principal omrahs in the camp and told them such and such was the state of affairs at delhi and that aligh chan knowing them as old omrahs to have an equal right with himself to the empire had resolved to dispatch them  which by the desertion of the omrahs he is constrained to raise the omrahs giving implicit belief to this false information fled that night with all their dependants from camp aligh chan thus deserted was under the necessity of retreating in great disorder toward deogire whither he was pursued by the besieged with great slaughter in the mean time advices arrived from delhi that all was well and aligh chan halted at deogire to collect his scattered army the four omrahs who fled having disagreed among themselves had each taken a separate rout by which means they were fallen upon by the hindoos plundered of their elephants camels and baggage and otherwise greatly harrassed in their march malleck timur and malleck tiggi were both slain while malleck mul and malleck cafoor were seized by their own troops and brought prisoners to deogire an enquiry was made into their conduct the authors of the disturbance seized and all of them sent prisoners to delhi the emperor ordered the propagators of the false intelligence to be buried alive with this severe sarcasm that they had buried him alive in jest but that he would bury them alive in good earnest  aligh chan was obliged to retreat from deogire and brought only back three thousand horse of all his great army to delhi he in two months however made great preparations and with a more a d      higer     numerous army than the former took the rout of arinkil he took in his way the city of bedir on the frontiers of tilling and other places where he left garrisons aligh chan returns to arinkil and takes it he then advanced to the capital renewed the siege and in a short time reduced it some thousands of the unfortunate hindoos were massacred and lidderdeo with his family taken prisoners aligh chan sent the prisoners their treasure elephants and effects to delhi under charge of kuddir chan and chaja hadgee upon their arrival great rejoicings were made in the new citadel which the sultan had built by the name of tughlickabad  takes jagenagur aligh chan having appointed trusty omrahs to govern the country of tilling proceeded in person toward jagenagur now cattack in orissa  in that place he took forty elephants from the raja and sent them to his father returning then to arinkil he staid there a few days and continued his march to delhi  in the beginning of the year     complaints arrived from lucknouti and sonnargaum of the great oppressions committed by the governors of those countries the sultan marches toward bengal the sultan appointed aligh chan to the government of delhi and with a great army marched toward bengal when he had reached nahib sultan nazir ul dien the son of sultan balin who had remained in that government since the death of his father arrived in a respectful manner from lucknouti with many valuable presents he was confirmed in his government of lucknouti sonnargaum koru and bengal and honored with royal dignities and the emperor prepared for his return  reduces turhat when he was passing near the hills of turhat the raja of those parts appearing in arms he pursued him into the woods finding his army could no longer continue the pursuit he alighted and calling a d      higer     for a hatchet cut down one of the trees with his own hand the troops upon seeing this set to work with such spirit that the forest seemed to vanish before them till they arrived at a fort surrounded with seven ditches full of water and a high wall the king immediately invested it and began the siege filled up the ditches and broke down the wall in three weeks he took the raja his family and wealth and conferred the government of turhat upon ahmed chan and returned with his army toward delhi  killed by accident when the emperor had reached afghanpoor he was met by aligh chan with all the omrahs of delhi to congratulate him upon his safe return but his death was now approaching his son had in that place raised a house in three days time for his fathers reception the entertainment being over the king was preparing to mount and every body hastened out to be ready to accompany him the roof of the building fell instantly in and killed the sultan and five of his attendants as he was rising to follow the omrahs  his death ascribed to various causes some authors attribute this accident to the newness of the building and the motion of the elephants that were preparing without others give it to design with which they charge aligh chan as the raising this unnecessary building seems indeed to indicate but others ascribe it to lightning so that the matter still remains in doubt the death of tuglich shaw happened in the month of ribbi ul awil of the year     after a reign of four years and some months amir chusero who lived down to the end of this sultans reign has favored posterity with his history at large by which it appears that he was a great and virtuous prince  section xvii the reign of sultan mahummud the son of yeas ul dien tughlick shaw a d      higer     aligh chan by the name of mahummud shaw mounts the throne after the kings funeral obsequies were performed aligh chan ascended the throne by the title of mahummud shaw and proceeded from tughlick abad to delhi the streets of that city were strowed with flowers the houses adorned the drums beating and every demonstration of joy exhibited the sultan ordered some elephants loaded with gold and silver before and behind him which was scattered among the populace  his generosity tatar chan whom the sultans father had adopted and appointed to the government of zifferabad was now honored with the title of byram chan and presented with a hundred elephants a crore of golden rupees two thousand horse and the government of bengal to malleck sinjer buduchshi mahummud gave seventy lacks in silver to malleck ul muluck eighty lacks and to molana azid his preceptor forty lacks all in one day molana nazir ul dien cumi had an annual pension of one lack and malleck ghizni the poet another to the same amount  his generosity in short was like his wealth without bounds which no man could well account for there being no great sum in the treasury upon his accession it is therefore probable that he had concealed the riches of the raja of arkilla from his father and that his liberality was supplied from the wealth of the decan which circumstance strengthens our suspicion that he was accessory to his fathers death his learning some writers notwithstanding this suspicion make long panegyrics upon his virtues and accomplishments he it must a d      higer     be acknowledged aimed at universal knowledge was conversant in all the literature of the times and a patron of learned men giving them profusely pensions for a magnificent subsistence  his religion the sultan was at the same time very strict with regard to public and private worship he ordered prayers to be read in the mosques five times every day he discouraged all intemperate pleasures and set the example by his own rigid life and cruelty but it is to be suspected that he acted the mean character of a hypocrite for he was vindictive and inhuman delighting in the blood of his subjects and condemning them without distinction of right or wrong to cruel and ignominious deaths  the moguls invade hindostan in the beginning of the reign of mahummud before the empire was properly settled tirim siri chan chief of the tribe of chighitta a mogul general of great fame invaded hindostan in the year     with an innumerable army with a view to make an entire conquest of it having subdued limghan moultan and the northern provinces he advanced toward delhi with incredible expedition and invested it retire with an immense treasure sultan mahummud seeing he could not cope with the enemy in the field and that the city must soon fall began to sue for peace sent an immense present in gold and jewels to soften the mogul chief who at last consented upon receiving almost the price of the empire to return to his own country taking guzerat and sind in his way which he plundered of a world of wealth  the sultans  sultan mahummud turned his thoughts to war and the regulation of his army he subdued by different generals many distant countries such as door summudir maber compila arinkil lucknouti sonnargaum and chittagaum some of which provinces had revolted and others had never been subjected by the arms of the islamites he soon after reduced the carnatic to the extremities of a d      higer     the decan and from sea to sea obliging all the rajas to pay him tribute by which means he again filled the treasury with money  the cause of disturbances in the empire but during the convulsions which soon after shook the empire all these foreign conquests were wrested from the yoke the causes of the disturbances were chiefly these the heavy imposts which were in this reign tripled in some provinces the passing copper money for silver by a public decree the raising   0000 horse for the conquest of chorrassan and maverulnere the sending  00000 horse toward the mountains of himmachil or kirrigil the cruel massacre of many mahommedans as well as hindoos in different parts of hindostan and many other lesser reasons which for the sake of brevity we shall forbear to mention  heavy imposts upon the necessaries of life the imposts upon the necessaries of life which were levied with the utmost rigor were too great for the power of industry and consequently the country was involved in distraction and confusion the farmers were forced to fly to the woods and to maintain themselves by rapine the lands being left uncultivated famine began to desolate whole provinces and the sufferings of the people obliterated from their minds every idea of government and subjection to authority  copper money the copper money for want of proper regulations was productive of no less evils than that which we have already specified the king unfortunately for his people adopted his ideas upon currency from a chinese custom of using paper upon the emperors credit with the royal seal appended for ready money mahummud instead of paper struck a copper coin which being issued at an imaginary value he made current by a decree throughout hindostan the mint was under very bad regulations bankers acquired immense fortunes by coinage whilst the merchants made their payments a d      higer   0 in copper to the poor manufacturers at the same time that they themselves received for their exports silver and gold villainies in the mint there was much villainy also practiced in the mint for a premium to those who had the management of it the merchants had their coin struck considerably below the legal value and these abuses were overlooked by the government  but the great source of the misfortunes consequent upon this debasement of the coin was the known instability of government public credit could not long subsist in a state so liable to revolutions as hindostan for how could the people in the remote provinces receive for money the base representative of a treasury that so often changed its master  the sultan obliged to call in the copper money from these evils general murmurs and confusions arose throughout the empire the sultan to ease the minds of the people was obliged to call in his copper currency but there had been such abuses in the mint that after the treasury was emptied there still remained a heavy demand this he was forced to strike off and thousands were ruined the emperor himself was so far from winning by this indigested scheme that he lost all he had in his treasury and the bankers accumulated immense fortunes on the ruin of their sovereign and the people  the army not being paid commit outrages mahummud by the advice of amir norose a mogul chief who with thousands of his tribe had entered into the service raised a great army the mogul buoyed up the emperors mind with the facility of reducing both iran and turan but before these mighty projects could be put in execution he fell in arrears to his forces they finding they could not subsist without pay dispersed themselves over the empire and carried pillage ruin and death to every quarter  a d      higer     the sultan forms a scheme to fill his treasury these misfortunes comprehended the domestic transactions of many years the public treasury being squandered by impolitic schemes and follies of various kinds the king entered into a project to repair his finances equally absurd with that by which they were principally ruined  the sultans scheme to conquer china having heard of the great wealth of chin china  mahummud formed a resolution to subdue that kingdom but to accomplish his design it was first necessary to conquer the country of himmatchil which lies between the borders of chin and hindostan he accordingly in the year     ordered one hundred thousand horse under the command of his sisters son chusero malleck to subdue the mountainous country of himmatchil and six garrisons as far as the frontiers of chin when this should be done he proposed to advance in person with his whole force to invade that empire  the omrahs endeavor to dissuade him from it the omrahs and counselors of state went so far as plainly to tell him that the troops of hindostan never yet could and never would advance a step within the limits of that mighty empire and that the whole was a visionary project the sultan insisted upon making the experiment and accordingly this army was put in motion and having entered the mountains began to build small forts on the road to secure a communication the sultans army advance to the frontiers of china proceeding in this manner to the boundaries of chin where a numerous army appeared to oppose them as their numbers were by this time greatly diminished and much inferior to that of the enemy the troops of hindostan were struck with universal dismay upon considering their distance from home the rugged ways they had passed and the rainy season which was now approaching besides the scarcity of provisions which now began to be severely felt in this consternation they bent their march toward the foot of a mountain where a d      higer     the savage inhabitants of the hills poured down upon them and plundered their baggage while the chinese army lay in their front  their distressful situation in this dreadful situation they remained for seven days suffering the extremities of famine without knowing how to proceed at length such a heavy rain fell that the cavalry were up to their bellies in water which obliged the chinese to remove their camp to a greater distance chusero malleck then determined to endeavor to make his retreat but the low country was quite covered with water and the mountains with impervious woods their misfortunes now came to a crisis having lost the road they found themselves in such an unfortunate situation that they could find no way out but that by which they entered which was now possessed by the enemy they are destroyed to a man this whole army in short in the space of fifteen days fell a prey to famine and a victim to false ambition scarce a man coming back to relate the particulars except those who were left behind in the garrisons a few of them escaped indeed the rage of the enemy but could not escape the more fatal tyranny of their emperor who ordered them to be put to death upon their return to delhi  kirshasib rebels in the decan baha ul dien the sultans nephew an omrah of great reputation known more generally by his original name kirshasib who possessed a government in the decan called saghir began to turn his thoughts upon the empire and gained over many of the omrahs of the decan to his party by their influence and the great riches which he had accumulated his power became very formidable he then attacked some omrahs who continued firm in their allegiance obliging them to take refuge in the sort of mindu  the sultan having intelligence of the revolt commanded chaja jehan with many other omrahs and the whole power of guzerat a d      higer     to chastise the rebel he is overthrown when the imperial army arrived before deogire they found kirshasib drawn up in order of battle to receive them but after a gallant contest he was defeated flies to the carnatic he fled toward sajur but not daring to remain there he carried off his family and wealth to campala in the carnatic and took protection in the dominions of the raja of that place with whom he had maintained a friendly intercourse  the sultan in the mean time took the field and arrived soon after at deogire his allies defeated he sent from thence chaja jehan with a great force against the raja of campala by whom the imperialists were twice defeated but fresh reinforcements arriving from deogire chaja jehan engaged the raja a third time and carried the victory he took the raja prisoner but kirshasib fled to the court of bellaldeo who fearing to draw the same misfortunes upon himself seized upon him and sent him bound to the general and acknowledged his subjection to the empire he is taken and flead alive chaja jehan immediately dispatched the prisoner to court where the sultan ordered him to be flead and shown a horrid spectacle all around the city while the executioner proclaimed aloud thus shall all traitors to their king perish  the sultan making deogire his capital calls it dowlatabad the sultan was so much pleased with the situation and strength of deogire that considering it more centrical than delhi he determined to make it his capital but upon proposing this affair in his council the majority were of opinion that ugein was a more proper place for that purpose the king however had previously formed his resolution destroys delhi he therefore gave orders that the city of delhi which was then the envy of the world should be rendered desolate and that men women and children with all their effects and cattle should make a grand migration to deogire to add magnificence to the migration he commanded trees to be tore up by the roots and planted in regular rows along the road to yield the emigrants a a d      higer     shade and that all who had not money to defray their charges should be maintained at the public expense he ordered that for the future deogire should be called dowlatabad raised noble buildings and dug a deep ditch round the walls which he repaired and beautified upon the top of the hill upon which the citadel stood he formed large reservoirs for water and made a beautiful garden this change however greatly affected the empire and distracted the minds of the people but the sultans orders were strictly complied with and the ancient capital left desolate  the sultan having effected this business marched his army against the fort of gundana near jinner nacknaig who was chief of the colies opposed him with great bravery but was forced to take refuge within his walls as the place was built upon the summit of a steep mountain inaccessible but by one narrow pass cut in the rock the sultan had no hopes of reducing it but by famine he accordingly ordered it to be blockaded and at the same time made some ineffectual attacks in which he was repulsed with great loss gundana taken the garrison becoming straitened for provisions and having no hopes of the sultans retreat delivered up the place at the expiration of eight months and the sultan returned to dowlatabad  the viceroy of moultan revolts he had not been long in his capital when he heard that malleck ibah the viceroy of moultan had rebelled and was then reducing the country of punjaab with a great army the cause of the revolt was this the sultan having sent an order to all his omrahs to send their families to dowlatabad the messenger who was dispatched to moultan presuming too much upon the kings authority upon observing some delay proceeded to impertinent threats he one day told byram shaws son in law that he believed his father was meditating treason against the king high words upon this arose between them which in the end proceeded to blows and the a d    0 higer     messenger had his head struck off by one of byram ibahs servants byram ibah knowing the vengeful disposition of the sultan was sensible that this disrespect to his authority would never be forgiven and resolved to seek refuge in arms  he is overthrown and slain the sultan upon these advices put his spears in motion and hastened toward moultan and byram ibah with an army numerous as the ants or locusts prepared to dispute the field both armies at last met and eager for victory engaged with great resolution but after the dust of the field was laid with blood on both sides misfortune darkened the standards of byram ibah and his troops turning their backs upon glory abandoned the field the sultan immediately gave orders for a general massacre of the inhabitants of moultan but shech rukun ul dien interceded for them and prevented the effects of this horrible mandate byram ibah was taken in the pursuit and his head brought to the king who returned toward delhi  the sultan resides at delhi two years at sight of their native country and city all those who had been forced to dowlatabad began to desert the sultans army and to disperse themselves in the woods the emperor to prevent the consequences of this desertion took up his residence in the city whither he invited them and remained there for the space of two years but then he again revolved in his mind the scheme of making dowlatabad his capital he removed his family obliging the omrahs to do the same and carried off the whole city a second time to the decan leaving that noble metropolis a habitation for owls and the wild beasts of the desert  oppressions and unheard of cruelty of the sultan about this time the taxes were so heavily imposed and exacted with such rigor and cruelty by the officers of the revenue that the whole extent of that fertile country between the two rivers a d      higer     ganges and jumna were particularly oppressed the farmers weary of their lives in one day set fire to their own houses and retired to the woods with their families and cattle the tyrant having received intelligence of this circumstance ordered a body of troops to massacre these unhappy people if they resisted and if they should be taken to put out their eyes many populous provinces were by this inhuman decree laid waste and remained so for several years the colony of dowlatabad was also in great distraction the people without houses without employment were reduced to the utmost distress  instances of it the tyrannies of the execrable mahummud exceeded in short any thing we have met with in history of which the following is a horrid instance when he remained at delhi he led his army out to hunt as is customary with princes when they arrived in the territory of birren he plainly told them that he came not to hunt beasts but men and without any obvious reason began a general massacre of the wretched inhabitants he had even the barbarity to bring home some thousands of their heads and to hang them over the city walls he upon another occasion made an excursion of the same nature toward kinnoge and massacred all the inhabitants of that city and the adjacent country for many miles spreading terror and desolation wherever he turned his face  a rebellion in bengal but to return to the chain of history during this time malleck fuchir ul dien after the death of byram chan rebelled in lucknouti having slain kudder chan and possessed himself of the three provinces of bengal bengal at this time was divided into three governments  the sultan at the same time received advices that seid hassen had rebelled in maber he ordered ibrahim the son of seid hassen and all his family to prison then marched in the year     from the sacking of kinnoge toward a d      higer     maber when he had reached dowlatabad he laid a heavy tax upon that city and the neighboring provinces which awakened the people into rebellion but his numerous army soon reduced all the unhappy insurgents to their former slavery from that place the sultan sent back a part of his army and chaja jehan to delhi while he himself marched with another force toward maber by the way of tilling  when mahummud arrived before arinkil there happened to be a plague in that city by which he lost a great part of his army he himself had a violent struggle for his own life and was obliged to leave amad ul malleck to command the army and return toward dowlatabad the sultan buries with great solemnity one of his teeth on the way he was seized with a violent toothache and lost one of his teeth which he ordered to be buried with much ceremony at beir and a magnificent tomb to be reared over it which still remains a monument of human vanity and folly having arrived at patan he found himself better and halted to take medicines for some days in this place he gave to shahab sultani the title of naserit chan and the government of bidder with its dependencies which yielded annually a revenue of one crore of rupees he at the same time conferred the government of dowlatabad and marhat upon cuttilich chan his preceptor  he returns to delhi he proceeded from patan in his palankie to delhi having heard of some disturbance among the patans he at this period gave leave to such of the inhabitants of dowlatabad as were willing to return to delhi to follow him many thousands returned but they had almost perished on the way by a famine which then desolated the countries of malava and chinderi the misery of the inhabitants when they came to delhi they found that the famine raged with redoubled violence in that city in so much that very few could procure the necessaries of life mahummud for once seemed affected with human miseries a d      higer     he even for some time entirely changed his disposition and took great pains to encourage husbandry commerce and all kinds of industry he opened the treasury and divided large sums to the inhabitants for these purposes but as the people were really in great distress they expended the money in the necessaries of life and many of them were severely punished upon that account  rebellion of the afgans shahoo a chief of the afgans about this time commenced hostilities to the northward pouring down like a torrent upon moultan which he laid waste and killed begad the sultans viceroy in battle and put his army to flight quelled the sultan having prepared an army at delhi moved toward moultan but shahoo upon the kings approach wrote him a submissive letter and fled to the mountains of afganistan the sultan perceiving that it was idle to pursue him returned to delhi  dreadful famine at delhi the famine continued still to rage in the city so dreadfully that men eat one another he ordered in this distress another distribution of money toward the sinking of wells and the cultivation of lands but the people weakened by hunger and distracted by private distresses in their families made very little progress while the drought continued and rendered their labor vain at the same time the tribes of mindahir chohan miana batti and others who inhabited the country about samana unable to discharge their rents fled into the woods the sultan marched forthwith against them with his army and massacred some thousands of these poor slaves  the gickers invade punjab in the year     malleck chunder chief of the gickers invaded punjab and killed malleck tatar the viceroy of lahore in action chaja jehan upon this was sent against him the sultan in the mean time began to entertain a ridiculous notion that all the misfortunes a d      higer     of his reign proceeded from his not having been confirmed in the empire by the caliph of mecca an embassy sent to mecca he therefore dispatched presents and ambassadors to arabia and struck the caliphs name in the place of his own on all the current coin and prohibited all public worship in the mosques till the caliphs confirmation should arrive in the year     hadgee seid sirsirri returned with the ambassador and brought the caliphs confirmation and a royal dress he was met without the city by the king in person who advanced to receive him on foot putting the caliphs phirman upon his head and opening it with great solemnity returning into the city he ordered a grand festival to be celebrated and public service to be read in all the mosques striking out every kings name from the chutba who had not been confirmed from mecca among the number of those degraded monarchs was the sultans own father he even carried this whim so far as to write the caliphs name upon his houses robes and furniture ridiculous behavior of the sultan these and some other ridiculous actions of the life of mahummud may reasonably make us suspect the soundness of his head the arabian ambassador after being royally entertained was dismissed with a letter to his master full of respect and with presents of immense value and accompanied by malleck kabire chief of the life guards  schemes for a revolt formed in the decan this year kinsanaig the son of lidderdeo who lived near arinkil went privately to bellaldeo the raja of the carnatic and told him that he had heard the mahommedans who were now very numerous in the decan had formed a design of extirpating all the hindoos that it was therefore advisable to prevent them in time what truth there might be in this report we know not but bellaldeo acted as if he was convinced of such a scheme he called a council of his nobles in which it was resolved that bellaldeo should first secure his own country by fixing his capital in a pass among the mountains to exclude the followers of mahommed from a d      higer     all those kingdoms kisnanaig in the mean time promised when matters should be ripe to raise all the hindoos of arinkil and tilling to his assistance  the decan lost to the empire the raja accordingly built a strong city upon the frontiers of his dominions and called it bigen from the name of his son to which the word nagur or city is now added he then began to raise an army and sent part of it under the command of kisnanaig who reduced arinkil and drove malleck amad ul muluck the sultans viceroy to dowlatabad bellaldeo and kisnanaig having joined their forces with the raja of maber and doorsummund who were formerly tributaries to the government of the carnatic they seized upon those countries and drove the mahommedans before them on all sides in short within a few months the sultan had no possessions in the decan except dowlatabad  the sultans tyranny and distractions in the empire the tyrannical mahummud upon receiving intelligence of those misfortunes grew vengeful splenitic and cruel wreaking his rage upon his unhappy subjects without crime provocation or distinction this conduct occasioned rebellion robbery and confusion in all parts of the empire the famine became daily more and more dreadful insomuch that the sultan not able to procure provisions even for his household was obliged to abandon the city and to open the gates and permit the starved inhabitants whom he had before confined to provide for themselves thousands crowded toward bengal which as we have before observed had revolted from the empire the sultan encamped his army near cumpula on the banks of the ganges and drew supplies from the countries of oud and kurrah he ordered his people to build houses which at length became a city under the name of surgdewarie  insurrections quashed in the year     nizam bain a zemindar possessed of some lands in the province of oud and a fellow of an infamous character a d      higer     collected a mob of the discontented farmers and assumed the royal umbrella with the title of alla ul dien but before the sultan marched against him ain ul muluck suba of oud raised his forces and defeating him sent his head to the king nuzerit chan in the same year who had taken the whole province of bidder at one crore of rupees finding himself unable to make good that contract rebelled but cuttulich chan being ordered against him from dowlatabad expelled him from that government  rebellion at kilbirgah quashed during this period ali shaw who was sent from dowlatabad to collect the rents of kilbirgah finding that country destitute of troops assembled his friends raised an army with the collections and in the year     erected his rebellious standards and took possession of kilbirgah and bidder the sultan on this occasion sent a reinforcement to cuttulich chan to suppress him cuttulich chan arriving on the confines of bidder ali shaw came out and gave him battle but being defeated he shut himself up in the city he was however soon obliged to capitulate and was sent prisoner to the king who banished him and his brother to ghizni  ain ul muluck meditates a rebellion ain ul muluck having paid great attention to the king and entirely gained his favor was appointed to the viceroyship of dowlatabad and arinkil in the room of cuttulich chan but ain ul muluck himself looked upon this appointment as an impolitic step in the king considering the services cuttulich chan had done to his affairs in the decan and the power he then enjoyed and therefore thought it a snare laid to draw him quietly from his own subaship and then to deprive him of both in the mean time a number of the clerks of the revenues being convicted of abuses in their office were ordered to be put to death some of those who survived found means to escape to ain ul muluck and endeavored to confirm him in his former opinion of the kings intentions  a d      higer     takes arms he accordingly disobeyed the kings order and erected the standard of rebellion sending a detachment of horse under the command of his brother who before the sultan received any intelligence of his designs carried off all the elephants camels and horses that were grazing or foraging near the royal camp the sultan in great perplexity called the troops of kole birren amrohe saman and other districts adjacent to his assistance while chaja jehan joined him with an army from delhi the sultan moved his standards for ain ul muluck and his brothers had now crossed the ganges and were advancing toward him in great hopes that the sultans army tired and disgusted with his tyrannical behavior would join them  the sultan engages and overthrows him the sultan enraged at their presumption mounted his horse and engaging them after a short conflict put them to flight ain ul muluck was taken prisoner and his brother shoralla drowned in the ganges as he was swimming across having been wounded in the action while another brother was slain in the field pardons him the sultan was so prejudiced in favor of ain ul muluck that he pardoned him and restored him to his former dignities saying that he was certain that muluck was a loyal subject though he had been instigated to this rebellion by the malice and falsehood of others  the sultan returns to delhi the sultan marched from thence to barage to pay his devotions at the tomb of sallar musaood one of the family of sultan mamood ghiznavi who had been killed there by the hindoos in the year     he distributed great sums among the fakiers who resided at barage and then returned to delhi another ambassador arrived at that time from the caliph and was received with the same distinguishing marks of respect as the former and dismissed with rich presents not long after a prince of the house of abassi arrived at delhi and was met by the sultan at the village of palum and he presented him with two lacks of rupees a large tract of territory a a d      higer     palace and fine gardens by way of respect to the caliphat he placed him upon his right hand and even sometimes ridiculously condescended to sit down upon the carpet before him and pay him obeisance  cuttulich chan recalled from the decan some of the courtiers calumniated cuttulich chan governor of the decan accusing him of oppressions and other abuses in his government though a man of justice and integrity the king recalled cuttulich chan to delhi ordering his brother molana nizam ul dien to whom he gave the title of alim ul malleck and placed at burudge to take charge of what remained to the empire of the decan till he should send some person from court when the kings order arrived cuttulich chan was digging a great pond or reservoir which he begged his brother to complete and prepared to return to delhi with all the revenues of the decan which he had previously secured in a fort called daragire upon a mountain close to the city  the sultan determines to reconquer the decan the sultan after the arrival of cuttulich chan appointed four governors for the decan having divided it into four provinces and determined to reduce it as before to his obedience to accomplish his purpose he ordered a numerous army under the command of amad ul malleck an omrah of great reputation to march to dowlatabad and entered into articles with him that he and the other chiefs should pay into the treasury seven crores of rupees annually for their governments to make up this sum and to gratify their own avarice they plundered and oppressed that unfortunate country at the same time the sultan conferred the government of malava upon aziz a mean fellow formerly a vintner and told him that the amirs of sidda mogul captains who entered into his service with amir norose were dangerous persons in that country therefore to endeavor to extirpate them  a d      higer     encourages husbandry the sultan then marched back to his old cantonments at surgdewarie and began to encourage cultivation upon a new plan which he himself had invented he appointed an inspector for the regulation of all that related to husbandry by the name of amir kohi who divided the country into districts of  0 miles square under a shickdar who was to be answerable for its cultivation and improvement above one hundred shickdars received their appointments at once and seventy lacks of rupees were issued out of the treasury to enable them to carry on this work  a cruel massacre at bedar aziz chumar when he arrived at bedar invited the amirs of sidda to an entertainment and assassinated eighty of them with their attendants he wrote to the sultan an account of this horrible massacre who sent him back a present of a dress and a fine horse for his loyal services such were the morals of those wretched days the sultan promotes men of low birth the tyrannical mahummud had now taken it into his head that he would be better served by people of low birth than by the nobility he accordingly promoted litchena a singer pira a gardener munga his son shech baboo a weaver muckbil a slave and other low fellows to the degree of omrahs and gave them the command of provinces and high offices at court he in this forgot the advice of the poet who writes that he who exalts the head of a beggar and hopes great things from his gratitude inverts the nature of things and nourishes a serpent in his bosom this resolution of the tyrant was occasioned by a noble refusal of the omrahs to put his cruel orders in execution  disturbances in guzerat in the mean time malleck muckbil entitled chan jehani vizier of guzerat with the treasure and the sultans horses set out for delhi the siddas of those parts hearing of his intentions waylaid him with a body of horse and having robbed him retired to narwalla the sultan hearing of this robbery in a great rage prepared a d      higer     for guzerat leaving malleck firose his nephew governor at delhi and in the year     marched to sultanpoor about  0 miles without the city where he waited for some reinforcements an address came from aziz chumar begging leave to go against the siddas being nearer and having a sufficient force as he imagined for that purpose cowardice defeat and death of aziz chumar the sultan consented to his request at the same time expressing much doubt of his success knowing him to be a dastardly and unexperienced officer aziz chumar advanced toward the rebels but in the beginning of the action he was struck powerless with terror and fell headlong from his horse he was taken and suffered a cruel death his army being defeated with some loss  zeai birnis reply to the sultan the sultan being informed of this disaster marched from sultanpoor it was on this march that mahummud is said to have asked zeai birni the poet what crimes a king ought to punish with severity the poet replied that seven sorts of criminals deserved severe punishments these were apostates from their religion shedders of innocent blood double adulterers rebellious persons officers disobeying lawful orders thieves and perverters of the laws the rebels totally defeated when he had reached the hills of abu upon the confines of guzerat he sent one of his principal omrahs chan jehan against the rebels who met them in the districts of bai and gave them a total defeat the sultan having halted at baruge sent malleck muckbil after them who coming up with them as they were crossing the nirbuda put the greatest part to the sword the few who escaped taking protection with madeo raja of buckelana were all plundered of their wealth  the sultans cruelty in cambait and guzerat the sultan upon this occasion massacred many of the siddas of baruge and plundered cambait and guzerat of every thing valuable putting all who opposed him to the sword he then sent zein dund mugid ul dien to dowlatabad that he might seize a d      higer     upon all the siddas of those parts to bring them to punishment alim ul malleck according to orders summoned the siddas from raijor mudkil kilbirgah bidder bijapoor genjouti ruibaug kollchir hukeri berar ramgire and other places the siddas conformable to those orders prepared for dowlatabad and when they were all collected alim ul muluck dispatched them under a guard of fifteen hundred horse to the royal presence  the imprisoned siddas forming a conspiracy when the siddas were arrived upon the frontiers of guzerat fearing that the sultan had a design upon their lives they entered into a conspiracy for their own security they with one accord fell upon their guard slew ahmed latchin their chief with many of his people while the rest under the command of malleck ali fled to dowlatabad surprise and take dowlatabad the siddas pursued them and before any advices could arrive to put the place in a posture of defense they took it by assault being favored by the troops within who became seditious alim ul muluck with whose behavior they were satisfied was spared but all the rest of the emperors officers were put to death and the treasure divided among the conspirators  proclaim ismaiel much king the siddas of guzerat and other parts who were skulking about in the woods and mountains hearing of the success of their brethren joined them ismaiel much one of the amirs of their faction was proclaimed king by the name of nasir ul dien sultan mahummud marches against him sultan mahummud hearing of this revolution at dowlatabad left baruge and hastened toward that city the usurper having drawn out his army waited to give battle to the king a drawn battle the two armies accordingly met and the siddas though greatly inferior in number roused by their danger and wrongs assaulted the imperial troops with such violence that the right and left wings were beat back and the whole army upon the point of flight but many of the chieftains who fought in the van being killed four thousand of the siddas fled and night a d      higer     coming on left the victory undecided so that both armies lay on the field of battle  the impolitic conduct of the siddas a council of war being in the mean time called by the siddas who had suffered greatly in the engagement it was determined that ismaeil much should retire into dowlatabad with a good garrison and that the remainder should shift for themselves till the sultan should leave the decan when they resolved to assemble again at dowlatabad this wretched conduct was accordingly pursued the sultan ordered amad ul muluck who was then at elichpoor to pursue the fugitives while he himself laid siege to the city  an insurrection in guzerat in the mean time advices arrived that malleck tiggi the slave of suffder ul muluck heading the siddas of guzerat was joined by many of the zemindars by which means he had taken narwalla and put malleck muziffer the naib of guzerat to death imprisoned shech moaz ul dien the viceroy and was now marching to lay waste cambait having in his rout blockaded baruge  the sultan marches against the insurgents the sultan upon this left kawman ul dien to carry on the siege of dowlatabad and with the greater part of his army marched with great expedition to guzerat he was plundered in his way of many elephants and a great part of his baggage by the hindoos he lost also a great many men in defending himself the sultan having arrived at baruge tiggi retreated to cambait and was pursued by malleck eusiph buckera whom the sultan had detached after him part of his army defeated tiggi having engaged the pursuers at cambait turned the chase upon them killed eusiph buckera and many other omrahs while the rest retreated to the sultan the rebel ordered all the prisoners taken in the action as well as those whom he had formerly in confinement to be put to death among the latter was moaz ul dien viceroy of guzerat  a d      higer     the sultan pursues mahummud hearing of this cruelty breathed revenge he hastened to cambait and tiggi unable to oppose him retreated to assawil but was closely pursued thither by the sultan the rebel continued his flight to narwalla and in the mean time the sultan on account of a prodigious rain was obliged to halt at assawil a whole month advices were brought him at assawil that tiggi having recruited his army at narwalla was returning to give him battle the sultan immediately struck his tents and met the rebel at kurri tiggi having injudiciously ordered his men to intoxicate themselves with strong liquors they attacked the sultan with the fury of madmen and overthrows the rebels but the elephants in front soon repressed this borrowed valor and repulsed and threw into confusion the rebels an easy conquest was obtained five hundred prisoners were taken and put to death and an equal number fell in the field the sultan immediately detached the son of eusiph buckera in pursuit of the runaways by the way of tatta whither tiggi had fled while the king went in person to narwalla and employed himself in settling guzerat  a rebellion in the decan news in the mean time arrived from the decan that the siddas had assembled again under hassen cacu had defeated amad ul malleck who had fallen in the action and had driven all the imperial troops toward malava that ismaiel much had resigned his regal dignity which hassen cacu had assumed under the title of sultan alla ul dien mahummud was excessively chagrined upon receiving this intelligence and began to consider his own tyranny as the cause of all those disorders he therefore resolved to govern with more mildness and humanity for the future he called malleck firose chaja jehan amir kiah malleck ghizni and sidder jehan from delhi with their troops in order to dispatch them against cacu  a d      higer   0 the sultan resolves to march in person against the rebels before those omrahs arrived the king was informed that the usurpers army was prodigiously increased he therefore determined first to settle guzerat and carnal now joinagur  and then to march in person to the decan but this business was not so soon accomplished as he at first imagined for he spent a whole year in regulating guzerat and in recruiting his army the next year was also spent in besieging the fort of carnal reducing cutch and the adjacent territories some authors affirm that mahummud took the fort of carnal but others of better authority say that he desisted from that attempt upon receiving some presents from the raja  asks advice of zeai birni the poet zeai birni informs us that the sultan one day about this time told him that the diseases of the empire were of such a malignant nature that he had no sooner cured them in one place than they broke out in another he would therefore be glad to know what remedy now remained to put a stop to this contagion  who advises him to resign the crown to his son the poet replied that when disaffection and disgust had once taken root in the minds of the people they were not to be exterminated without tearing up the vitals of the state that the sultan ought to be by this time convinced how little was to be hoped from punishment that it was therefore his opinion in this case that the king ought to invest his son with the government and retire which would obliterate all former injuries and dispose the people to peace and tranquillity he rejects the advice the sultan says birni answered in an angry tone that he had no son whom he could trust and that he was determined to scourge his subjects for their insolence whatever might be the event  falls sick the sultan soon after this conversation with zeai birni fell sick at kondal he had previously sent chaja jehan and amad ul muluck to delhi on account of the death of malleck kabire the a d      higer     viceroy and called most of the principal men of the empire to the royal camp recovers and marches toward tatta having recovered a little from his disorder he mustered his army and sent to collect boats at debalpoor moultan ouch and sewistan which he ordered toward tatta marching then from kondal he arrived on the banks of the river which he crossed in spite of tiggi and was on the other side joined by five thousand mogul horse from thence he took the rout of tatta to chastise the sumrahs for giving the rebel protection arriving within thirty crores of that city he halted to pass the first days of the mohirrim and when that fast was over having eat fish to excess he was seized with a fever dies he would not however be prevailed upon to stop but getting into a barge he proceeded to within fourteen crores of tatta and upon the banks of the sind on the twenty first of mohirrim in the year     this tyrant was conquered by death and shut up in the dark dungeon of the grave his execrable character he reigned twenty seven years during which time he seems to have labored with no contemptible abilities to be detested by god and feared and abhorred by all men  section xviii the reign of sultan moazim mohizzib firose shaw the son of sallar rigib firose shaw firose shaw was nephew to the emperor yeaz ul dien tughlick shaw and the late sultan mahummud having conceived great friendship for him designed to make him his successor and for that purpose recommended him upon his deathbed to the omrahs upon mahummuds demise the army fell into the utmost a d      higer     confusion firose shaw having gained over the majority of the omrahs to his party prevailed with presents upon the mogul mercenaries to move to some distance from the camp to prevent disturbances till he should reduce the rest of the army to obedience  designs of the mogul mercenaries amir norose an omrah who commanded a great body of the imperial troops deserted that night and having joined altu chan the general of the mogul mercenaries told him that now was the time to plunder the late emperors treasure and to retreat to their native country altu chan was easily prevailed upon to adopt this lucrative scheme they therefore returned next morning to the camp which was still in very great confusion and after a very sharp skirmish loaded some camels with treasure firose shaw to secure himself from further depredations led the army to sewan and took every possible means to defend himself against the avarice of the mercenaries  firose shaw mounts the throne the omrahs the day after this movement waited upon firose shaw and entreated him to mount the throne after many pretended excuses he favored the omrahs with his consent and was accordingly proclaimed sultan  he the very first day of his reign gave orders to ransom many prisoners who during the late confusion had fallen into the hands of the people of tatta defeat the mogul mercenaries and upon the third day he marched against the mogul mercenaries took many of their chiefs prisoners and forced the rest to fly toward their own country  the sultan soon after directed his march to the sort of bicker and gladdened the face of the court with princely presents and gave a d      higer     his liberality very liberally to the zemindars of bicker and sewistan he from thence sent amad ul muluck and amir ali ghori against tiggi with a part of his army and marched himself toward outch benevolence and charity where he did many acts of benevolence and charity  chaja jehan sets up at delhi his own adopted son at outch the emperor received advices from delhi that chaja jehan a relation of the late sultan now about ninety years of age had placed upon the throne a boy whom he had adopted by the name of sultan yeas ul dien mahummud and had massacred a number of the citizens who had refused to pay him allegiance  the sultan sends to expostulate with him firose shaw sent seif ul dien shanapil to expostulate with the old man who he thought was now in the dotage of years with promises of forgiveness and favor if he would relinquish his ridiculous scheme the emperor himself in the mean time remained with the army to regulate the territory of outch he was soon after joined by malleck muckbul amud ul muluck vizier of the empire who received a chelat and a confirmation of his former dignity  chaja jehan sends an embassy to the sultan firose shaw having reached hassi on his way to delhi met an ambassador from chaja jehan acquainting him that now the empire was in the hands of sultan mahummuds family and therefore that it would be no more than justice in him to acknowledge the title of the young king and act as regent during the minority the sultan immediately convened the omrahs before the ambassador and asked them whether they knew any of the male issue of mahummud they all declared that unless malana cumal ul dien an omrah then present knew of any they were perfectly strangers to any surviving issue of mahummud molana made answer that though one should remain of the issue of the former sultan it was now advisable a d      higer     to stand by what was already done we have reason to believe from this circumstance that the youth who was set up at delhi was actually a son of sultan mahummud though it was at that time prudent in the omrahs not to acknowledge him  who desires to accommodate matters amicably the emperor after the council sent daood molana zada the ambassador back to acquaint chaja jehan of what had passed and to advise him to accommodate matters in an amicable way when daood arrived in the city a number of the principal men in the place hastened to the camp of firose shaw and made their submission much about the same time advices were received from guzerat that mahummud tiggi was defeated by amud ul muluck and that very day a son was born to the emperor whom he named fat chan these fortunate circumstances concurred to strengthen the sultans interest  chaja jehan submits chaja jehan perceiving that he could not support the young king made overtures toward an accommodation to firose shaw he sent some respectable omrahs to intercede with the sultan for his pardon and to solicit leave to pay his respects in person the sultan consented and accordingly the old man with his head bare and his turban hung round his neck came accompanied by some of the principal men of his party to make his submission the king according to his promise gave him his life but ordered the cutwal of hassen to take him under his care which was a kind of imprisonment malleck chattab one of chaja jehans associates was banished to karkinda and sheck zadda gustami expelled the court  firose shaw arrives at delhi upon the second day of regib in the year     firose shaw marched into delhi and mounted the imperial throne he immediately a d      higer     began to administer impartial justice to his people who flocked from all quarters with their petitions he in the mean time conferred offices and titles upon his omrahs  hunts at sirmore upon the fifth of siffer in the following year he in order to hunt removed his court toward the hills of sirmore and reduced several zemindars to obedience he in the mean time had a son born to him at delhi whom he named mahummud chan and ordered great rejoicings to be made upon the occasion distributing his favors with a liberal hand  builds a palace in the year     the sultan hunted at callanore he ordered upon his return a palace to be built upon the banks of the sursuti and toward the end of the year appointed chan jehan to the viceroyship of delhi rebellion in bengal he himself in the mean time marched toward lucknouti to subdue elias hadgee who had assumed the title of sultan shumse ul dien and possessed himself of all bengal and behar even to benaris when he had arrived in the neighborhood of gorukpoor the zemindars of that place odeysing and rai capoor having brought proper presents were admitted to his presence  the sultan having penetrated as far as punduah one of the residences of the princes of bengal elias hadgee retreated to a strong post at ackdalla whither the sultan pursued him an action ensued but elias hadgee secured himself in his post which obliged the sultan to surround him the place being almost inaccessible the sultan having in vain tried to force the rebels to battle things having continued in this situation for twenty days firose shaw intending to change his ground and to encamp on the banks of the ganges went out to reconnoitre the enemy imagining that he meditated a retreat advanced out of their post and drew up in order of battle but when they saw that the sultan was preparing to attack them they again retreated within their works but with a d      higer     such precipitation and confusion that    elephants and many standards fell into the sultans hands the rainy season coming on with great violence a kind of peace was patched up between them and the sultan returned disappointed to delhi  firose shaw employs himself in public works in the year     the sultan built the city of firoseabad adjoining to that of delhi and in the following year marched to debalpoor where he made a canal  00 miles in length from the suttuluz to the jidger the king in the year     between the hills of mendouli and sirmore cut a channel from the gion or jumna which he divided into seven streams one of which he brought to hassi and from thence to beraisen where he built a strong castle calling it by his own name he drew soon after a canal from the cagar passing by the walls of sirsutti and joined it to the rivulet of kerah upon which he built a city named after him firoseabad this city he watered with another canal from the gion or jumna these public works were of prodigious advantage to the adjacent countries by supplying them with water for their lands and with a commodious watercarriage from place to place  bengal and the decan become independent an embassy about this time arrived with presents and new conditions of peace from bengal which the sultan accepted and soon after ratified the treaty bengal became in a great measure independent of the empire paying only a small acknowledgment annually by way of present he exacted no other terms of the decan so that these two great members were now lopt off from the government of delhi  in the year     the sultan of bengal sent a number of elephants and other rich presents to delhi which was amply repaid in arabian and persian horses jewels and other rich curiosities but when a d      higer     the imperial embassy arrived at behar they received news of shumse ul diens death and that his son ascunder chan had acceded to the throne they thought proper not to proceed further and returned to delhi invasions of the moguls the sultan being in the same year encamped at semana received advices that the moguls had made an incursion as far as debalpoor he forthwith ordered malleck kabool with a great army against them but the moguls before his arrival had laden themselves with spoil and had retreated toward their own country  the sultan invades bengal notwithstanding of the treaty of     the sultan in the year   0 resolved upon another expedition into bengal having arrived at zifferabad he cantoned there his army during the rains when he lay at this place shech zadda bustami who had been banished returned ambassador from the caliph of misser with a chelat for which he was graciously received and dignified with the title of azim ul muluck an embassy having been in the mean time dispatched to ascunder chan sultan of bengal returned with another on his part and with rich presents the king not being satisfied with these concessions marched after the rains were over toward lucknouti and on his way conferred the ensigns of royalty upon the prince fat chan his son he gave him masters for his instruction to whom the royal youth gave great attention  a peace with aescunder sultan of bengal the sultan having arrived at pundwah aescunder after the example of his father retreated to ackdalla and shut himself up in that place being however closely invested and reduced to great straits he sent    elephants and other presents to the sultan with overtures of peace in a few days the terms were agreed upon and the sultan marched to jionpoor where he cantoned his army for another season and then moved down behind the mountains toward jagenagur  a d      higer   0 firose shaw ravages jagenagur firose shaw having crossed the river mendri arrived at the capital of the raja of jagenagur which was also called benaris the raja upon the emperors approach fled toward tilling having plundered the country firose shaw returned and upon his way was met by the raja of beerbhan who presented him with    elephants and other valuable presents upon consideration of not ravaging the country the sultan having received the presents changed his rout and as he passed through the woods of puddmawitti which abounded with elephants he caught    of them and killed a few in the chase he then continued his march and arrived at delhi in the year      scheme for improving the lands of sirhind firose shaw who had much at heart the improvement of his country was informed that near hirdar there was a mountain from which there issued a great stream of water which fell into the suttuluz and that beyond that place there was a small rivulet called selima divided only by a rising ground from the large stream which we have just mentioned the sultan considered that by making a cut through this eminence the great stream might be carried into the rivulet and so form a river to water the countries of sirhind and munsurpoor from whence it might be carried to sunnam and so render great tracts of land fertile he therefore marched immediately that way and ordered fifty thousand laborers to be collected together to cut the passage when the workmen were in this place employed in digging to great depth they found some immense skeletons of elephants in one place and in another those of a gigantic human form the arm bones of which measured guzes some of the bones were in their natural state and others petrified  firose shaw reduces nagracut the sultan having finished this great work built a fort at sirhind which he called firosepoor he from that place marched toward the mountains of nagracut where he was overtaken by a storm of a d    0 higer     hail and snow he however reduced the raja of those parts after sustaining some loss on his side and confirmed him again in his dominions changing the name of nagracut to that of mahummud abad in honor of the former sultan firose shaw was told here that the goddess whom the hindoos worshipped in the temple of nagracut was the image of noshaba the wife of the great secunder which that conqueror had left with them the name of the idol is now changed to that of jewallamuckie in the temple there was also at that time a fine library of the books of the brahmins consisting of one thousand and three hundred volumes  the sultan ordered one of those books which treated of philosophy astrology and divination to be translated into the persian language and called it dellael firose shawi dellael firose shawi signifies the arguments of firose shaw some authors relate that the image now worshipped at nagracut is not that of noshaba which say they firose shaw sent to mecca where it was buried before the door of the great mosque it is not improbable but alexander who penetrated to the indies might have left an image of one of the grecian goddesses upon the frontiers of his conquests the brahmins might have with less absurdity converted this foreign goddess into one of their own growth than those holy persons at rome who have changed the statue of jupiter tonans into one of st peter disgracing with a parcel of keys that hand which formerly held the thunder  the sultan after the conquest of nagracut moved down by sind toward tatta where jambani who had been always a subject of delhi had rebelled and fortified himself invests tatta the sultan invested the city but as provisions and forage became excessively scarce and the rains had set in with great violence he was obliged to raise the siege and march to guzerat he there spent the season in hunting and after the rains he conferred the government of guzerat upon ziffer chan and returned again to tatta which he reduces jambani capitulated and delivered himself up to the sultan who carried him and the principals of his faction to delhi but after some time he took him again into favor and sent him to resume his former government  a d      higer     the vizier and prince royal die in the year     malleck muckbool chan jehan the vizier died and his son was honored with his titles nothing remarkable happened till two years after when the sultan was plunged into the gulf of affliction by the death of his favorite son fat chan a prince of great expectations  ferose shaw in the year     was informed that the revenues of guzerat were greatly deficient of the collections this induced him to listen to the proposals of chaja shumse ul dien wamaghani who offered to give one hundred elephants forty lacks of rupees four hundred abassinian slaves and forty arabian horses every year over and above the present payment should he be appointed to that government the sultan replied that if the present viceroy whose name was also shumse ul dien the successor of ziffer chan who was dead would consent to give as much he should be continued but to this the viceroy would not agree and therefore the sunnuds were granted to wamaghani and he forthwith set out for guzerat rebellion in guzerat quashed not being able the next year to perform his promise he withheld the revenue and rebelled which was a
