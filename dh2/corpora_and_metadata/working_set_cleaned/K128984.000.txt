july       0 answers for john and william cuninghams and company brewers in glasgow james hotchkis and company brewers in edinburgh and james graham vintner in glasgow for themselves and as trustees for the other creditors of william mgregor late tenant in the lands of parkhall and others to the petition of robert hamilton of wishaw the general question at issue between mr hamilton of wishaw and the other creditors of mgregor in the process of multiple poinding presently depending in this court is whether the various tacks which wishaw had granted to mgregor of sundry farms for a long course of years adjudged by wishaw himself as a creditor of mgregors were also adjudgeable by mgregors other creditors so as to bring them in pari passu with wishaw these being within year and day of wishaws adjudication  it was objected on the part of wishaw that as some of these tacks particularly that of easterpark and birkenhill though granted to mgregor and his heirs for a term of no less than    years excluded assignees and subtenants except by the special consent of the proprietor such tacks were not adjudgeable  it was on the other hand contended for the creditors that however effectual such clauses might be to exclude voluntary assignees they could not be effectual to exclude the legal diligence of creditors by adjudication especially in tacks such as these for such a long term of years granted to the leasee and his heirs in which there could be no dilectio personarum  dly that whatever should be the judgment of the law upon this point the tack of easterpark and birkenhill was attended with such special circumstances as ought to distinguish it from the other leases containing the like clause in so far as it was thereby conditioned that mgregor should be at liberty to subset those parts of the lands which lay on the south side of the tollroad during the first nineteen years of the lease and in so far as it was thereby also conditioned that wishaw should be at liberty to make void said tack at the term of martinmas      upon his making payment to mgregor of l  0     sterling  dly as wishaw had stated certain objections to the adjudications of the other creditors founded upon an alleged pluris petitio and had thereupon prevailed in obtaining the whole of these other adjudications that of james graham only excepted to be voided in totum the creditors upon their part stated certain objections to wishaws adjudication as sufficient to void it also in totum whereby the other creditors and he would be so far in pari casu  the result of all which was that the lord auchinleck ordinary by several interlocutors stated in the reclaiming petition for both parties sustained the objection pleaded for wishaw founded upon that clause of the tack of easterpark and birkenhill excluding assignees and subtenants and found said seclusion effectual not only against voluntary assignees but also against legal assignees by adjudication and consequently that the creditors of mgregor by their adjudication of the tack of easterpark and birkenhill can take nothing and have no title to compete with wishaw   dly as grahams adjudication was free from the objection of the pluris petitio and does inter alia adjudge the tack of easterpark and birkenhill his lordship found the same effectual to carry so much of the lands of said tack as mgregor was at liberty to subset and that it was equally effectual to carry the sum of l  0 which by said tack wishaw was bound to pay to mgregor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach thereby allowed to him  dly his lordship repelled the objections stated by the other creditors to wishaws adjudication the first and last of these points was submitted to your lordships review by a reclaiming petition at the instance of the other creditors and which with the answers thereto made on the part of wishaw is hitherto unadvised  but wishaw not satisfied with the advantage thereby gained over the other creditors at least equally onerous has along with his answers to the creditors petition preferred a reclaiming petition upon his part praying an alteration of those interlocutors whereby grahams adjudication is found effectual to carry the aforesaid tack of easterpark and birkenhill quoad such part of the lands therein contained as mgregor was empowered to subset as also to carry the l  0 which wishaw was bound to pay to mgregor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach in the tack thereby allowed which counterpetition being appointed to be answered the following answers are humbly submitted  and in the entry it is proper to observe that if the creditors shall prevail by judgment of your lordships in having it found that the clause in all or any of the tacks granted to mgregor by wishaw excluding assignees or subtenants does only exclude voluntary assignations but not the legal diligence of creditors by adjudication that will of course supersede any judgment upon the points stated in wishaws reclaiming petition but uncertain as the creditors are what the judgment of the court may be upon that capital point they will confine what they are now humbly to offer in support of the lord ordinarys judgment upon the other two points complained of by wishaw  in the more early periods of the law tacks were esteemed mere personal contracts and therefore however effectual against the granter and his heirs were not binding upon third parties singular successors in the lands and viewing them in that light were so strictly interpreted as to exclude either assignees or subtenants without any express covenant to that purpose but when tacks were by statute rendered real rights as the rigor and severity of the law in other particulars was gradually abated and as it is now an established law that leases may be granted to subsist for any given length of time it is adverse to every principle of justice that any beneficial estate should be placed beyond the reach of lawful creditors though this must be the unavoidable consequence of the doctrine here maintained on the part of wishaw the granting an assignment or subtack does not annul the principal tack so that if this tack however beneficial was not to be adjudgeable mgregor would be entitled to hold the same and laugh at his creditors  in a tack of this endurance which is nearly equal to a perpetuity there could be no dilectio personarum the heirs of the leasee being equally unknown to the leasor as any other persons and if the creditors are well advised this supposed dilectio personarum in the choice of a particular person is the only solid principle upon which the exclusion of assignees or subtenants can be justified the seclusion of assignees and subtenants by a clause in the tack itself cannot operate more strongly than the exclusion by force of the law so that as in the one case the diligence of creditors by adjudication was not understood to be excluded no good reason can be assigned why in the other case the expressing what would be implied supposing the tack had contained no such clause should produce so much a stronger effect such is plainly the import of the clause respecting subsets which could only be granted by the voluntary act and deed of mgregor and there is equal reason that the same construction should take place with regard to assignments the clause being one and the same as to both  and when to this is added the faculty or power of subsetting allowed by this tack of so large a part of this farm for a term of no less than    years it furnishes a strong handle that the clause secluding assignees and subtenants was only meant to exclude voluntary not legal assignees  such is plainly the import of the clause with respect to subsets if mgregor had granted a subset for a term of    years of that part of the farm which he was specially authorized to subset there cannot be a doubt that the same must have been effectual and consequently that the benefit arising to mgregor by that subset must have been adjudgeable by his creditors as the law will never permit any beneficial right belonging to a debtor to be placed without the reach of his lawful creditors it is true that mgregor has not in this case granted such subset but by contracting debts he has done what is equivalent as the law will adjudge every right that was in him or that he had power to grant in payment to his creditors if mgregor had granted a subset of these lands to his creditors with power to them to apply the surplusrent over and above a just proportion of the total tackduty in satisfaction of the debts due by him to his creditors a subset in these terms would not have been challengeable by wishaw or if he had granted such subset to any third person for an advanced rent his lawful creditors must have been entitled to have taken the benefit thereof for payment of their debts and there is no other method known in the law by which this could be obtained but by adjudication of his interest in the tack itself and sublease in so far as he had power to subset  wishaw is indeed pleased to contend that the tack being unicum quid for which one tackduty is paid in cumulo the creditors cannot be allowed to adjudge part of the tack for which no particular rent had been fixed by agreement between him and mgregor and that he cannot be obliged to submit to the division of the rent by the conjectural estimation of witnesses  but was this to be the consequence of the power and liberty to subset this part of the farm wishaw would have himself only to blame for granting the lease in those terms which he ought to have foreseen might be productive of such consequences there is no difficulty in ascertaining what part of the total rent corresponds to the different parts of this farm this must have been in the view of parties when liberty was granted to mgregor to subset a certain part thereof the subset behoved to ascertain a rent or tackduty payable by the subleasee for that part of the ground allowed to be subset and as wishaw could not have demanded from the subtenant more than the tackduty payable by the subset it is plain that the division of the rents corresponding to the grounds retained or subset must have been in the view of parties  and as wishaw has himself adjudged this tack it demonstrates his own sense and understanding of the matter viz that the clause secluding assignees and subtenants without the consent of him the proprietor intended no more but an exclusion of voluntar assignees the adjudication which he himself took can bear no other construction that is his only title in this competition and if it was adjudgeable at his instance it must be equally competent at the instance of mgregors other creditors especially as to that part of the farm which mgregor was empowered to subset  wishaw is indeed pleased to content that there is a material difference between a power to assign and to subset in this respect that an assignation denudes the principal tacksman of the lease altogether and vests the right wholly in the assignee whereas a subset does not denude the principal tacksman who remains still liable for the total rent  the creditors cannot agree to this distinction because however true it may be that an assignation transfers the whole right to the assignee it will not from thence follow that the cedent is thereby liberated from his original obligation for payment of the rent or tackduty the master may thereby have the superadded security of the assignees being also bound for payment of the rent but which can never liberate the original tacksman from the obligation which he had came under to make good the rent during the whole years of the lease so that in this respect the assignee and subtenant are in pari casu  if a by minute of sale shall dispone lands to b his heirs and assigns whereby b is taken personally bound in payment of a certain reddendo or duty though b is at liberty to alienate the subject and will no doubt stipulate relief from the disponee of the reddendo payable to his author a that will never liberate b the first disponee from the personal obligation he had come under from being liable to a in payment of the reddendo for which he was personally bound and no reason can be assigned why a different rule should obtain with respect to a lease containing a power to assign as the granting such assignation cannot liberate the original leasee from the obligation which he had come under to pay the rent or tackduty during the whole years of the lease the assignee may be bound to relieve him thereof at the hands of the leasor but he must still remain bound to the heritor for payment of the rent in terms of his personal obgation  the power and faculty of subsetting so large a part of the farm demonstrates this proposition that there was here no dilectio personarum when mgregor was at liberty to subset to any person he thought proper and as the granting such a subset must in the nature of things have required a division of the rent payable for the lands subset from the total rent or tackduty the adjudications taken against mgregor must be effectual to carry his interest both in the tack and subset so far as regards the lands which he was empowered to subset and thus far the lord ordinarys interlocutor falls to be affirmed  the other point determined by the lord ordinarys interlocutors viz that the adjudications deduced against mgregor were equally effectual to carry the l  0 sterling which wishaw was bound to pay to mgregor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach allowed by the tack depends upon the same principles and must be governed by the same rules viz that as every beneficial right or interest competent to a debtor must in some shape or other be attachable by his creditors and as by the aforesaid agreement l  0 sterling was ascertained to be the just value of the subjects therein mentioned for the remaining years of the lease in case wishaw should take advantage of the breach allowed of by the tack it would be a cruel case if this sum the agreed value of the tack for the remaining years thereof should be pocketted up by wishaw in exclusion of the other creditors adjudgers  this sum was the agreed estimation or value of the tack for the remaining years of the lease after the      it cannot be of less value now in the    0 when wishaw means to reassume the possession    years before the term specified in the breach that may be a just consideration for enlarging the premium to be paid but can never justify the attempt that is made to pocket up that sum in exclusion of the other creditors  for though it is true that wishaw does not now claim the possession of these farms in right of the stipulated breach but in virtue of his adjudication if by means thereof he is to reap that advantage at so much an earlier period than would have been the case if mgregor had continued in possession justice requires that he should make good to mgregor and his creditors the l  0 sterling however short of the sums expended by mgregor in the improvement of these gounds  and therefore to conclude upon this point also it is hoped your lordships will be of opinion with the lord ordinary that the tack of those lands so far as mgregor had power to subset the same is carried by their adjudications preferably to or pari passu with wishaws adjudication if the same shall be sustained  in respect whereof it is hoped your lordships will not only affirm the lord ordinarys interlocutors so far as complained of by wishaw but will alter the same so far as complained of by the creditors alex lockhart
