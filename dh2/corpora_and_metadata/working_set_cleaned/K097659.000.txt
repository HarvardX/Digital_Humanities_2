an account of a new method of treating fractured legs  read before the royal society of london on february          to which is prefixed  a letter on that subject to james parsons m d a member of that respectable society dated november         london printed in the year mdcclxvii  sir as the following treatment of fractured legs from the experience i have had of its success during a practice of several years appears to me preferable to any i have hitherto known and as it may be a means of lessening many of the inconveniences attending such accidents i take the liberty of sending it for your opinion and if you think it of consequence enough to be made public shall be glad to have it laid before the royal society  the instrument here recommended was first applied with great success in an oblique fracture of the tibia which could not be kept in a proper situation by the usual methods and afterward as happily in a dislocation of the lower extremity of the same bone accompanied with a fracture of the fibula in this latter case it is often difficult to reduce the dislocation even with a strong extension and more so to retain the bones in their proper situation whilst the limb is laid in the usual extended posture  but both these difficulties are absolutely avoided by the means i am about to describe  the remarkable good effects in the cases abovementioned induced me to try the same in different fractures of the leg as well compound as simple in all which i have found it to answer my expectation i have formerly explained this method of treating fractures to many gentlemen of the profession as well as to yourself and have also had several cases where other surgeons have been cencerned with me who have in general expressed great satisfaction and some of them have introduced it into their own practice so that i have reason to believe it would have become more general if the instruments that have hitherto been sold for that purpose had been made according to the original pattern but the workman whom i employed has made and sold many that differ from mine in some essential points i have therefore thought it necessary to send you enclosed a description of the instrument made after such a manner as i have found by experience to succeed best  i am with great esteem sir your most obedient and most humble servant wm sharp mincinglane nov        to dr parsons description of a newconstructed instrument for fractured legs recommended to be used instead of the common apparatus see the plate the figures are drawn on a scale of three inches to a foot and represent two splints of strong pasteboard made with glue to be fastened upon a fractured leg by three straps which surround the whole  these are adapted to the leg of a middlesized man nevertheless it may be convenient to have two other sizes the one almost twentytwo inches in length and the other sixteen  fig i a represents an under splint of an irregular form suitable to that part of the leg it is intended to cover it is a little unequal externally and concave internally the length eighteen inches from a to b the width two inches and three quarters at the strap near the knee and two inches and a quarter at both the other straps  bbb three leather straps from fifteen to twenty inches long and one wide having two rows of holes so placed that every hole in each row may be opposite to a space in the other these must be sewed fast to the middle and outside of the under splint the portions of straps ddd on the anterior part of the splint must be shorter than those on the posterior eee which are to surround the more muscular part of the leg  c a part to support the foot from the point a to the heel c five inches long at an angle of sixty degrees  d the footstrap twelve inches long sewed to the bottom of the under splint within two inches of the point to pass under the heel and through the leather loop on the upper splint to the lowest pin  e an irregular oval hole two inches long and almost one wide in the lowest part but decreasing upwards to receive the malleolus externus or lower extremity of the fibula  fig ii represents the leg raised up to show the situation of the under splint when properly applied  fig iii represents a fractured leg when laid within the splints according to the method i am about to recommend having the stockingfoot or sock and shoe upon it the darkest shade in this and fig ii being intended to show that part of the splints within the shoe  fig iv a the upper splint bbb the pins c the leather loop to receive the footstrap  fig v a manytailed bandage made of slips of russia linen regularly increasing in length from twelve or fourteen to eighteen or twenty inches according to the size of the leg each of these slips being two inches broad is so laid as to cover half the breadth of that which is underneath it  viz one inch another slip ten or twelve inches long is sewed on the back so as to unite them all in the middle making a bandage equally as firm as a circular one and which may be used without disturbing the leg the narrowest part must be placed nearest to the heel as the number of slips is to be increased or lessened according to the space necessary to be enclosed within them i call this a manytailed bandage leaving the precise number to be determined according to the nature of the circumstances  this has been used many years in st bartholomews hospital instead of the old eighteenheaded bandage nevertheless as it is not generally known i hope this description will not be thought superfluous  the three different sizes of splints abovementioned will generally be sufficient at least one or other of them may serve any leg of an adult till others can be provided  the legs of children as they are more round and less muscular may be defended nearly in the same manner with the common wooden splints properly bolstered that are now made use of in st bartholomews hospital provided they are long enough to secure both articulations of the fractured bones  when a surgeon is called to a fractured leg at the place where the accident happened let him lay the patient on the injured side on a flat surface and raise the knee of the fractured limb toward the abdomen bending at the same time the kneejoint so as to put the extensormuscles of the foot which are the strongest into a state of relaxation he will then be enabled to replace the ends of the fractured bones and restore them to their proper situation without the customary strong extension of the limb which is troublesome to the surgeon painful to the patient and apt to bring on tension spasms and inflammation of the stretched muscles  when the ends of the fractured bone are replaced which may often be done even without removing the shoe or stocking let an under splint of the most suitable size be applied to the fibula or outside of the leg and if it does not fit exactly let it be made to do so by adding such compresses of tow or thick flannel or combed wool as may be necessary for that purpose  this posture is much more comfortable and convenient rendering it less troublesome for the patient to ease himself or be moved by others and removes the foot and toes out of the way of being hurt by the weight of the bedcloathes so as to make a fracturebox or cradle unnecessary  if the fracture be compound the wound generally heals by the first intention the great impediment irritation being prevented of which i can produce many instances add to this that the leg may be taken up with the whole apparatus and the kneejoint gently moved as often as necessary to prevent that stiffness which always succeeds a case of this kind and is attended with much pain and inconvenience a long time after the leg is otherwise well the patient may also be taken out of bed frequently without pain or danger if not very heavy or unweildy  the under splint makes a safe and secure bed for the leg whilst the upper part is dressing if a compound fracture and the leg may by a steady hand be supported also against the upper splint and put into any posture that may be necessary to dress a sore on the fibula or under part  i do not always remove the shoe and stockingfoot as well because they serve to keep the part in perspiration as that the shoe adds steadiness to the limb by the connection it may have with the inferior part of the instrument  let also the upper splint be applied on the inside of the leg so as almost to cover the tibia on its whole length the straps may then be fastened sufficiently tight to secure the whole this done the patient may easily be removed in a sedan chair having the cushion so raised that the leg may hang down without resting upon the bottom or in a coach with the limb supported by the hand of a surgeon so that it may yield to every motion uniformly or all together as it were whilst it swings in his hand for it matters not how great the motion of the body be provided the points of the fractured bone are secured from being moved the one against the other  in this manner i have carried many patients from the place of the accident over the london pavements to their own homes at a great distance without their having suffered any inconvenience from the motion even when the fractures were compound  when the patient is brought home and put to bed the bed having a mattrass upon it let the stocking be removed and the proper remedies with the manytailed bandage and the above splints applied observing the same directions as to posture which i have already given viz that the patient be laid on his side with the broken leg undermost the knee bent and the thigh drawn up instead of laying him on his back with the injured limb extended  both the splints are designedly made narrow to leave room for examination of the parts affected lest any undue pressure should occasion pain but if it should be objected that they are not sufficiently broad for a thick leg that inconvenience may be remedied by putting a slip of pasteboard or thin wood between them on the fore part of the leg if thought necessary the straps of the instrument are sufficient to secure the whole some persons have proposed by way of improvement to have a rivet or pin like that upon the tibial or upper splint fixed upon an iron plate near one end of the middle strap instead of having the strap fixed to the fibular or under splint in order that it may be applied as the cale may require it but i nevertheless think it necessary to be fixed as described in the plate to prevent the splints from approaching or receding from each other if either of the other straps become too loose though i approve very much of an additional strap to be applied wheresoever such compression may be necessary   i made with my own hand the first of these instruments of strong pasteboard with iron plates rivetted upon them which succeeded very well i have tried also various materials for the same purpose such as strong about the year      mr holmes instrumentmaker to st bartholomews hospital made by my direction some splints of this shape of strong hide leather hardened with glue but the extraordinary expense as well as the difficulty of being supplied with a sufficient quantity of them induced me to continue the splints of pasteboard made with glue in my constant practice which by long experience i have found to answer the purpose effectually hide leather hardened with glue also wood and plate copper any one of which will answer sufficiently if well formed nevertheless i shall prefer the pasteboard if made strong enough till i can meet with a workman that will make them accurately of harder materials  the same posture that is recommended for broken legs i have found equally serviceable with respect to broken thighs and for the same reason in which case the common wooden splint is as good as any other provided it be long enough to secure both extremities of the fractured bone  i have through the whole of this description made use of the terms upper and under splints for the sake of being more easily understood though perhaps the calling the one tibiale or tibial splint and the other fibularium fibular splint would serve to distinguish them better and give a more precise idea of the manner of their application the first being placed so as to cover a great part of the tibia and the second forming a safe bed for the fibula  finis depictions of the splint as discussed in the text fig i fig ii fig iii fig iv fig v dent sculpball i of lombard street
