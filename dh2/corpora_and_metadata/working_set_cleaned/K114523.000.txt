the choice spirits assembly   songs comic and satirical  by george alexander stevens  i love fun  keep it up lecture upon heads oxford printed for the author  sold by j waller in fleet street g robinson in paternosterrow and f newbery the corner of st pauls church yard london  mdcclxxii  to the public a paultry collection of songs having lately made its appearance to which the publisher has with uncommon effrontery prefixed my name as the editor and upon my disclaiming the psiton has even had the assurance in a public advertisement to assert that he had my authority for so doing  although i have more veneration for the public than either to trouble them or load the daily papers with an altercation between a little country shopkeeper and a balladmaker yet i once for all beg leave to state the real fact  about four years ago i exhibited my lecture at whitehaven and having occasion to use this mans shop he took the opportunity of soliciting me to give him a few comic songs because he had a mind to publish a volume to please his customers in the part of the country where he lived and at the same time opening a song book showed me several under my name which he told me he purposed to print in his collection  my reply was  sir there is not one of those printed as i wrote them and some to which my name is affixed are really not mine  but sir replied my chapman will you please to give yourself the trouble to mark such of them as are yours  why really sir i am ashamed of them  lord sir they will do very well here pray sir take the book home and be so obliging as to mark them for me  and if it would not give mr stevens too much trouble i should be greatly obliged if he would just put a mark upon any other songs in the book that he thinks worth printing  this was done and the volume returned the next day  from hence i could not imagine he would do more than insert my name to the songs i had owned and i solemnly declare he had no authority from me to use it otherwise  what i did was a mere act of common civility  i had not then nor have i since had any connections with the man and upon this ground alone he has had the modesty to charge me with a breach of promise by my disavowal  this among other reasons has induced me to publish my own songs which i now claim as property and have entered in the hall books of the stationers company  g a stevens  directions to the binder the assembly of choice spirits frontispiece the moonlight piece to face the prologue signature a page    advertisement the writer of these ballads by way of preface begs leave to introduce a fragment which he happily met with among the mss preserved in that inestimable receptacle of curiosities at chelsea well known to the literati of all nations under the denomination of don salteros coffeehouse  this fragment indeed bears no marks of antiquity yet the origin as well as progress of music and poetry is here traced with uncommon perspicuity and it is greatly to be lamented that the author himself could not be consulted for putting the finishing hand to so arduous and elaborate an undertaking  the history of choice spirits and ballad singing jubal or tubal cain was the first composer of tunes his lyre preceded orions amphions and even the harp of orpheus  orion when making his voyage upon the dolphins back invented water music  amphion introduced cotillons as well as country dancing  orpheus to please his eurydice exhibited the first harmonic meeting  and on the mountain gibello circe held her first court for comus the magazines of the ancients those most useful repositories of readymade erudition tell us that bacchus instituted a club at this very period called the baccae or bacchantes and which are now called the bucks as it appears not only by nimrods ancient charter deposited in the archives of the babylonian lodge in the environs of soho but also by the authenticated records belonging to the pewter platter in bishopsgateprecinct  and to these two bodies of that noble and ancient order the following engraving of the famous goblet or cup used by the grand buck at rome when he celebrated the secular games is here addressed with its original inscription and a translation for the mutual entertainment of those distinct classes of critics the learned and unlearned who alternately take the lead in all conversations  poculum poculorum or the cup of cups   been vobis been mihi been amicae meae been omnibus nobis been cui non invidet mihi et eo cui nostro gaudeo gaudet thus translated  here is to thee here is to me on our absent friends well think to our noble selves well drink then to him from envy free who loves fun like you and me the reason for introducing this antique unto the readers acquaintance is according to the modern custom of bookmaking to show the authors erudition which is still farther displayed in the following account of choice spirits  after circes elopement with ulysses they became wanderers upon the face of the earth and like jews and strolingplayers continue itinerants even unto this day they have nevertheless multiplied exceedingly propagating their convivialities into the different orders of grigs gregs and gregorians  antigallicans free masons and macaroni  sons of sound sense and satisfaction  sons of kit and old souls  true blues purples and albions  the beef steak jockey and catch clubs  the magdalens and lumber troop with many others all which acknowledge the affinity they bear to their paternal society by celebrating their evening mysteries with a song and a sentiment  the choice spirits have ever been famous for their talents as musical artists they usually met at the harvesthomes of grapegathering there exhilerated by the pressings of the vintage they were wont to sing songs tell stories and show tricks from their first emerging until their perihelion under the presidentship of mr george alexander stevens balladlaureat to the society of choice spirits and who appeared at ranelagh in the character of comus supported by those droles of merry memory  unparalleled were their performances as first fists upon the saltbox and inimitable the variations they would twang upon the forte and piano jewsharp excellent was howard in the chin concerto whose nose also supplied the melodious tones of the bagpipe  upon the sticcado matt skeggs remains still unrivalled  and we cannot now boast of one real genius upon the genuine hurdy gurdy  alas these stars are all extinguished and the remains of ancient british harmony is now confined to the manly music of marrowbones and cleavers  every thing must sink into oblivion  corn now grows where troy town stood  ranelagh may be metamorphosed into a methodists meeting house vauxhall cut into skittlealleys the two theaters converted into auctionrooms and the new pantheon become the stately habitation of some jew pawnbroker  nay the sons of liberty themselves                          caetera desunt

furrows stand like soldiers in lines on the plain quoth he though in learning i am not well skilled in memory this maxim i will keep those weeds among wheat show when belly is filled we have nothing to do but to sleep ii each scene of creation that opes to our view affords contemplation a theme as blossoms enameled by drops of bright dew with dimonds so courtbeauties beam see grape to grape swelling transparent on vine that fruit is an emblem of bliss balmy lip to lip lovers as lusciously join and the nectar enjoy of a kiss iii while britons like britons dare english taste own success on our strength could depend we now by importing enervate bon ton to impotent idlers descend we wed without love we attempt without powers and strengthless and senseless in swarms insipid as butterflies basking on flowers the fribbles fill fine womens arms iv if bacchus and ceres were drove from loves court desire must frozen depart roast beef quantum suff and take tantum red port they steel the mainspring of the heart could we venus consult why indeed so we may since each circle a venus supplies i will back my opinion those beauties will say a milksops the thing we despise v the elixir of

miseries long i was forced to abide by the seasons sore pelted sore pelted by pride and though clad in ermine yet you have been distressed both our cares now are over  so let us both rest iii a committee of worms manor lords of the grave overheard em and wondered to hear the dead rave quoth the chairman dare mortals presume thus to prate when even we maggots dont think ourselves great iv insane ostentations who brag of their births yet are but machines mixed of aggregate earths they distinctions demand with distinctons they meet when we throw by the rich folks as not fit to eat v they are scurvy compounds of debauch and disease putrefactions of sloth or vice run to the lees by luxurys pestilence health is laid waste and all they can boast is  they are poisoned in taste vi it is true cries crawlina the queen of the worms they make upon earth immense noise with their forms  pon onner with beauties though so much i deal on not one in ten can i make a good meal vii when we chose to regale on the dainties of charms we formerly fed on necks faces and arms now varnish envenoms their tainted complections a fine womans features spread fatal infections viii not a worm of good taste and bon ton i dare vouch a morsel of fashionmade beauties will touch a quality toast we imported last week  two maggots my servants died eating her cheek ix very odd quoth a critic worms hold such discourse very odd quoth the author that men should talk worse like reptiles we crawl upon earth for a term take wing for a while  then descend to a worm x dan pope declares all human race to be worms

and the third was a joke of all places i toasted the best she seemed not to hear but her cheeks blushes spoke the wanton my sentiment guessed iii her bosom i pressed to my lips it arose the crimson still flushing her face with lovelisping laugh she replied i suppose you presume i can guess at the place iv i answered but first for my fee took a kiss where the temple of love we attend beautys columns begin at the fountain of bliss in tapering outlines they end v on the top at the arch of enjoyment unite curled tendrils the pediment grace for cupids pantheon the shaft of delight must spring from the masculine base vi if the lady of this perfect mansion you will see as i spoke gave my hand to the lass oh by all means she said  then my dear come with me so i led my girl up to the glass vii off she turned with a pshah yet no anger expressed goodbreeding scorns pruderys skreen among our dinnertime toasts when we drink to the best we only most excellent mean viii remember my bucks when youre aiming at jokes be sure make the most of a jest not like the assembly of impotent folks who prove themselves  bad at the best ix our youths in their waists are now scarcely a span an insensible expletive crew when loveliness weds one in hopes of a man it is the worst thing a lady can do x here is to beauty a toast sir but not face alone lower yet lies the circle of grace beneath where in center love buckles her zone the point of attraction we place xi let our bottles like globes have elliptical sweep geometrists mind what i say may beautiful parallels distances keep to give perpendiculars way song vi silenus and cupid tune  derry down i cupid sent on a message one evening by venus as illluck would have it was met by silenus the bigbellyd sot asked the urchin to play and the silly lad gamd all loves weapons away derry down etc ii his bow from the bubble the old gambler drew and into a crutchheaded stick turned the yew the string was tough catgut si swore it was well a strong line he wanted to ring his bar bell iii loves arrows were cane he divided the joints pipestoppers the ends made and pickteeth the points the feathers to brush down his tables were clever and to a tobaccopouch turned the boys quiver iv for pipelighting matches he chose billetdeux and away at each puff went a sonneteers vows his tinder was drawn from the brains of the jealous and longbottled

laughed and he smoked and he sung derry down vi she squeezed his hard hand and his filthy beard strokd nay kissed him though with his tobaccofumes choked then begged the boys arms but si swore with a frown he would be damned if he gave them for her derry down vii she whipped her doves back vastly piqued you may guess in synod celestial demanded redress jove laughed at the jest and he vowed by his

few years by the help of bon ton we shall be as polite as the best iii it is vastly immense and most horridly low when a month after marriage is past that the husband should be such a fright not to know his ladys affections cannot last iv for broken in fortune and ruined in health to patch up both person and purse his honor addresses some citizens wealth and the daughter accepts as his nurse v too often for the sake of a title impure doomed beauty is forced from her vows to unite with a blank for upon the grand tour foreign vice has disabled the spouse vi in defense of the fair satire

friend we can trust song cxxvii contentment tune  ye nobles who hurry through every gay toil i the poachers for fortune who damsels ensnare with dress and addresses deceive to lasses of wealth how those miscreants swear and alas how the lasses believe ii nay some ladies seem to expect being lost they trust whom they know are forsworn they listen to him who has ruined the most and hope to be ruined in turn iii can this be believed  no  the songmaker jokes it is the tale of a slanderous crew a sigh  then i fear that there may be some folks who are sorry to say it is true iv but when love for love is received on each side how tenderness smiles on the pair this this is a triumph and this is my pride i enjoy such a favorite fair v no paint in her face  no art in her mind her thoughts are explained by her eyes from principle faithful from gratitude kind and scorns the deceit of disguise vi all along on the slope by the side of a stream our hours we happily pass my head on her lap while my love is her theme and my looks i lift up to my lass vii enjoying the breeze from the fields of new hay we gather the summers sweet pride or point to the brook where the small fishes play and count them beneath the clear tide viii in rooms rich embellished with luxurys store let wealth pampered indolence yawn let wantonness act her deliriums over till dupes to her dungeon are drawn ix let commonplace fondness her blandishments spread and tempt by the toilets parade the squeeze the soft sigh wanton glance and sly tread are pantomine tricks of her trade x i have tried and can tell  i have frolickd away and followed the fashion of fun the same farce have acted that is played at this day and while the world wheels will be done song cxxviii give the devil his due tune  to take in good part the soft squeeze etc i there is one thing my friends i must offer to you it is give to old nick what to old nick is due what he owes to us i can venture to say like a demon of rank upon honor he will pay ii though you smile at my system and sneer at my song his worships allowed to be prince of bon ton now thus lies the business sirs as we are polite and practice good manners pray what is his right iii the devil is in yous a phrase daily used yet often by such language the devils abused though some hollow hearts may have much room to spare the devil himself would not choose to dwell there iv some people affect with this world to be sick and give themselves up in a pet to old nick devil fetch me they cry but if satan they knew his honor has much better business to do v though of darkness he is king he is a prince of the air and with his infernalship we should deal fair the cheerful days ruled by the angel of light and the devil lord bless us is monarch of night vi his torturing spirits around him await as watchmen attend on the constables state those imps of authority sally in shoals and pennyless strumpets drag in as damned souls vii the hell upon earth and lifes devilish disease is poverty sinning and seized on for fees deep in darkness that dross we call money was hid a proof that the use on it to us was forbid viii but pluto the devils old heathenish name brought it forth from below as a varnish for shame persuasion temptation attended the gold till all have been bid for and few are unsold ix we are devlishly odd in a devilish odd way since bribe as bribe can there is the devil to pay the devil of party makes damnable rout though the devil a bit can we tell what about x may satan seize those who by purchase deceive may they take the same road who such things receive but may we preserve honest men though they are few export all the rest give the devil his due song cxxix present taste tune  last night in my dream i beheld a brown lass i one day meeting momus it was upon change accosting the droll with  what news by the foot of alcides quoth he it is strange that the english should england abuse as locusts in swarms cross the seas for their prey as woodcocks first fleshless appear so shoals of imported illibrals this day  necessitys troop landed here ii not a stroller from france not a vagrant from rome not a swiss with a marmozet show but here men of science and breeding become outlandish folks every thing know the rich will receive them as flatterys imps servility grins in their looks and britishborn artists are elbowd by pimps by hairdressers dancers and cooks iii english merit in vain may attempt at the lead all the wit in the world we may waste but things from beyond sea are sure to succeed they hit the high fashion of taste to taste and to honor who has not a claim they are worn without any expense they are selfbestowd gifts they are egotists fame they are knavry and dunces defense iv english might be allowed in the rude days of yore such vulgars we caant now endure there is something so soft in the sound of signior and immensely polite in messieur how coarse sounds the sandbys in merit indeed those brothers embellish the age can such a rude name now as rooker succeed besides he belongs to the stage v all is vulgar and horrid low wretched and flat of us thus the connoissieur speaks but exquisite fine it is immense and all that when he talks about gothics and greeks perhaps my address a presumption may seem and received by the rich as a sneer but with all you are worth to be worthy esteem do justice to genius born here song cxxx nobody and nothing tune  geeho dobbin i a story or song you have left to my choice for one i have no humor for the other no voice in attempting a tune i like nobody bawl and as to a mimic i am nothing at all ii the wrinkldcheek critic called squire syntaxis pedantical speaking would bring into practice with classical gabble may wink and may sneer and beg i would make the thing nothing appear iii for schoolmasters conjugate derivate stuff i speak to be understood that is enough the phrase of like nobody they may condemn but as i sing nothing it is nothing to them iv now as to this nobody i dare to say although we see somebody always in play and sometimes that something may somehow be shown yet nobody only must many things own v the public is pestered with many gay forms like butterflies springing from grubs and from worms those welldressd necessities daily we view in nobodys business with nothing to do vi they have nothing to think on they have nothing to say nobodys all night and just nothing all day at nothing they laugh and at nothing they cry and nobody cares how they live or they dye vii it is nobody only can guess the game played when nobodys by betwixt master and maid unless indiscretion should alter their plan nobody knows nothing twixt mistress and man viii the romp too ripe grown unless gathered a spouse will fall the first shake from weak chastitys boughs dear captain she whispers somebody will hear us dear miss whispers he there is nobody near us ix but when she is betrayed by her passion to shame and parents and guardians begin with their blame who i sir  not i sir  no honor forbid it if i am with child it was nobody did it x the tread of gallant by cornuto is heard on tiptoe the lover from rendezvous scared who is there starts the husband it is thieves that i hear but wife pats his cheek and lisps nobody dear xi anybody may say if they please i am wrong evrybody find fault if they please with my song but careful lest somebody we should offend i with nothing began and with nobody end song cxxxi water tune  the bigbellyd bottle i our chorus to bacchus to bacchus well raise long corks be my garland instead of the bays with burgundys blessings my temples anoint and toast the first toper who drank a halfpint ii my song is to bacchus the god of the vine the engineer artist to spring beautys mine without him wit pines and love languidly fades cold water has kept the nine muses old maids iii quoth temperance waters the medicine of health and water quoth prudence will win a man wealth though odd it may seem as the storys not long once water helped bacchus and thus says the song iv it was when his harvest rejoiced the parched earth beneath the first vine love on wit begot mirth yet hate raised some rebels who broke from his sway and drunk with his bounty denied to obey v he harnessed his tigers he marshalled his force  silenus was sutler lord pan led the horse the ganges they crossed came in front of the foe and struck them all dead without striking a blow vi it was pan did the feat cast them into a fright he crept like a fox through their camp in the night all the wine he drew off while these ignorants snord and into the bottles foul ditch water poured vii each rebel next morn raised the flask to his head but chilled the first gulp in an aguefit fled fled trembling from monarch to meanest mechanic from hence came the phrase to put men in a paninic song cxxxii mediocrity tune  attempt to be happy but how can that be i in a neighbourly way with an honest mans fame unoffending i hope to succeed attend if you please if youre pleased with a name imprimis let probity lead ii be careful to keep on humilitys side nor ever lose gratitudes view obey not the envy of pique nor of pride nor pilfer from merit its due iii be assured that esteem is a noble estate  let not a fond smile make you proud nor rail at men merely because they are great be not dupd by the roar of a crowd iv shun flatterys phrase let not promise allure nor dangle for dinners in taste forget not old friends though perhaps they are poor nor make new acquaintance in haste v oh suffer not interest friendship to wean accept not servilitys treat nor silently witness iniquitys scene but open at once on deceit vi remember yourself spare the shame of your friend nor carry your wit to excess with spirit the cause of the absent defend and shrink not your arm from distress vii oppress not the low nor be high peoples slave nor ever despair nor be vain however inconsistent the world may behave mediocrity ever maintain viii his views let ambition extend over the state let avarice gluttonize wealth no nabobs i wish for i would not be great i only ask humbly for health ix how cheerful in health will my latter days pass unenvied unenvying live with the friends i have proved and my favorite lass and practice the precepts i give song cxxxiii the sweethearts tune  derry down i since the world is so old and the times are so new and every thing talked of except what is true among other stories my fable may pass of four or five sweethearts who courted a lass derry down etc ii the first was from france ala mode de paris all fashion all feather bien monsieur poudrie he bowed he took snuff cut a caper and then he bowed cut a caper and took snuff again iii a dutchman advanced when the lady he saw he dropped down his pipe and he waddld t yaw with hands hid in pocket and unpolished leer as frogs sing in courtship so croakd out mynheer iv from connaught itself another beau came macfinnin macgragh ballinbrough was his name he bowed to the lass and he stard at mounseer clapped hand on his sword and said ah  arrah my dear v the next a mess john of rank methodist taint who thought like a sinner but looked like a saint closed hands twirld his thumbs moving muckle his face then turned up his eyes as about to say grace vi a neat english sailor in holiday trim who long loved the lass and the lass had loved him athawrt them all stepped under arm tossed his switch squared his hat opened his pouch gave his trowsers a hitch vii he alongside her fell and he grappld on board she struck the first broadside of kisses he poured then he towed her to church and as to the rest what afterward followed is easily guessed derry down etc song cxxxiv a lesson of love tune  go on ye gay wantons etc etc i ye lexicon critics whose classical pride plain sense and plain english as moderns deride yet woman dear woman your minds could improve turn students to her take a lesson of love ii ye rustics who burst from the arms of embrace to beautys prefer the rude joys of the chase so savage a practice no more you will approve when once you have practiced a lesson of love iii at midnight ye topers when bumpring your toast be careful of who and to whom it is you boast if the tithe of those joys you pretend ye could prove wine would not have power to wean you from love iv ye soldiers who rush through the roughwork of war as statesmen may scheme or as sovereigns jarr engagements more glorious at home ye may prove so set up your standards and list under love v ye busy in traffic whose cent per cent lives can estimate justly all worth  but your wives while the interests of trade you so anxious improve you neglect their demands and are bankrupts to love vi the life of a man is inquietudes reign care dullness fatigue disappointment and pain but clasp the fond female those ills she will remove such witchcraft has woman such magic is love song the last or epilogue tune  lauras song in the chaplet i the wits were wont in ancient times to estimate their age by rhimes a ballad was their schooling we moderns may perhaps be wrong if not likewise also a song may fit us for our fooling ii imprimis there is the men of state but hold i will let alone the great lest i should gain a schooling for greatness was not formed for sport though some folks greatly make their court by greatly greatly fooling iii we play the fool we act the wise we barefaced walk or wear disguise as hopes and fears are ruling and yet with all our deeplaid wiles from john of nokes to tom of styles what is it all but fooling iv if men will think if men will see that all this to  or not to be is as we are hot or cooling today on expectations wing tomorrow off it is not the thing what is the thing  why fooling v fool on fool on for life at best is but halfbred twixt cry and jest as chance not reasons ruling to chance we owe our rights and wrongs to chance i dedicate these songs a balladmakers
