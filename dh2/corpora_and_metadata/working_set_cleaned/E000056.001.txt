the writings of james madison xlii   james madison august         nassau hall thomas martin to rev thomas martin  mad mss  nassau hall august         rev sir— i am not a little affected at hearing of your misfortune but cannot but hope the cure may be so far accomplished as to render your journey not inconvenient your kind advice  friendly cautions are a favour that shall be always gratefully remembered  i must beg leave to assure you that my happiness which you and your brother so ardently wish for will be greatly augmented by both your enjoyments of the like blessing i have been as particular to my father as i thought necessary for this time as i send him an account of the institution c c and of the college wrote by mr blair the gentleman formerly elected president of this place you will likewise find two pamphlets entitled britannias intercession for john wilks c which if you have not seen it perhaps may divert you   i am perfectly pleased with my present situation and the prospect before me of three years confinement however terrible it may sound has nothing in it but what will be greatly alleviated by the advantages i hope to derive from it the grammars which mr houston procured for you amount at   0 each to    your brothers account with plumb to    and sawneys expence    the whole       inclosed you have    the overplus of which you may let sawney have to satisfy those who may have been at any trouble on my account the near approach of examination occasions a surprising application to study on all sides and i think it very fortunate that i entered college immediately after my arrival tho i believe there will not be the least danger of my getting an irish hint as they call it yet it will make my future studies somewhat easier and i have by that means read over more than half horace and made myself pretty well acquainted with prosody both which will be almost neglected the two succeeding years the very large packet of letters for carolina i am afraid will be incommodious to your brother on so long a journey to whom i desire my compliments may be presented and conclude with my earnest request for a continuance of both your friendships and sincere wishes for your recovery and an agreeable journey to your whole company i am sir your obligd friend and hl ser james madison p s sawney tells me that your mother and   brothers are determined to accompany you to virginia my friendship and regard for you entitle them to my esteem and with the greatest sincerity i wish after a pleasant journey they may find virginia capable of giving them great happiness september  0th    nassau hall james madison to james madison  mad mss  nassau hall september  0th    hond sir— i received your letter by mr rossekrans and wrote an answer but as it is probable this will arrive sooner which i now write by doctor witherspoon i shall repeat some circumstances to avoid obscurity on wednesday last we had the usual commencement eighteen young gentlemen took their bachelors degrees and a considerable number their masters degrees the degree of doctor of law was bestowed on mr dickenson the farmer and mr galloway  the speaker of the pennsylvania assembly a distinguishing mark of honour as there never was any of that kind done before in america the commencement began at  0 oclock when the president walked first into the church a board of   trustees following and behind them those that were to take their masters degrees and last of all those that were to take their first degrees after a short prayer by the president the head oration which is always given to greatest scholar by the president  tutors was pronounced in latin by mr samuel smith  son of a presbyterian minister in pennsylvania then followed the other orations disputes and dialogues distributed to each according to his merit and last of all was pronounced the valedictory oration by mr john henry son of gentleman in maryland this is given to the greatest orator we had a very great assembly of people a considerable number of whom came from n york those at philadelphia were most of them detained by races which were to follow on the next day since commencement the trustees have been sitting about business relative to the college and have chosen for tutors for the ensuing year for the junior class mr houston from n carolina in the room of mr peream for the freshman class mr reeve a gentleman who has for several years past kept a school at elizabeth town in the room of mr pemberton the sophomore tutor mr thomson still retains his place remarkable for his skill in the sophomore studies having taken care of that class for several years past mr halsey was chose junior tutor but refused the trustees have likewise appointed   mr caldwell a minister at elizabeth town to take a journey through the southern provinces as far as georgia to make collections by which the college fund may be enabled to increase the library provide an apparatus of mathematical and philosophical instruments  likewise to support professors which would be a great addition to the advantages of this college doctr witherspoons business to virginia is nearly the same as i conjecture and perhaps to form some acquaintance to induce gentlemen to send their sons to this college i am very sorry to hear of the great drought that has prevailed with you but am in some hopes the latter part of the year may have been more seasonable for your crops your caution of frugality on consideration of the dry weather shall be carefully observed but i am under a necessity of spending much more than i was apprehensive for the purchasing of every small trifle which i have occasion for consumes a much greater sum than one would suppose from a calculation of the necessary expences i feel great satisfaction from the assistance my uncle has received from the springs and i flatter myself from the continuance of my mothers health that dr shores skill will effectually banish the cause of her late indisposition i recollect nothing more at present worth relating but as often as opportunity and anything worthy your attention shall occur be assured you shall hear from your affectionate son james madison   july   d    0 nassau hall james madison to james madison mad mss  nassau hall july   d    0 hond sir— i receivd yours dated june  th  have applied to mr hoops as you directed he says you must suit yourself in paying him  if you should let him have a bill of exchange it must be on your own terms forty pounds £ 0 new jersey currency is the sum i shall have of him before i get home my frugality has not been able to keep it below that consistent with my staying here to the best advantage i shall be glad if it should be convenient for you to have my next years stock prepared for me against i come home for i shall not be able to stay in virginia more than   weeks at most half jos—pass here to the greatest advantage i have spoken to several of the present senior class about living with you as tutor but they will determine on nothing unless they know what you would allow them as it would not be proper for them to remain in suspense till i should return here if you should receive this time enough to send me an answer by the middle of september  let me know the most you would be willing to give i think there would be a greater probability of my engaging one for you inclosed are the measure of my neck  rists i believe my mother need not hurry herself much about my shirts before i come for i shall not want more than three or four at most i should chuse she would not have them ruffled till i am present myself i have not yet procured a horse for my journey but think you had better not send me one as i cant wait long   enough to know whether or not youll have an opportunity without losing my chance most of the horses being commonly engaged by the students sometime before vacation begins if i should set off from this place as soon as i expect you may look for me in october perhaps a little before the middle if the weather should be good we have no publick news but the base conduct of the merchants in n york in breaking through their spirited resolutions not to import a distinct account of which i suppose will be in the virginia gazette before this arrives their letter to the merchants in philadelphia requesting their concurrence was lately burnt by the students of this place in the college yard all of them appearing in their black gowns  the bell tolling the number of students has increased very much of late there are about an hundred  fifteen in college  the grammar school twentytwo commence this fall all of them in american cloth with my love to all the family i am etc october  th      princeton james madison to james madison mad mss  princeton october  th      hond sir— in obedience to your requests i hereby send you an answer to yours of the   th of sept which i received this morning my letter by dr witherspoon who left this place yesterday week contains most of what you desire to be informed i am exceedingly rejoiced to hear of the happy deliverance of my mother  would fain hope your rheumatic   pains will not continue much longer the bill of exchange was very acceptable though i cannot say i have been as yet very much pressed by my creditors since i got the bill i have been making a calculation of my past  future expences  find it nothing more than a bare competency the reason of which i dare say you will not ascribe to extravagance when you read my letter of last week if i come home in the spring the purchase of a horse  travelling expences i am apprehensive will amount to more than i can reserve out of my present stock for those purposes so that it would not be amiss perhaps if you were to send a few halfjos by dr witherspoon or colo lewiss sons if they return or some safe hand afterwards as best suits you i should be glad if your health  other circumstances should enable you to visit d witherspoon during his stay in virginia i am persuaded you would be much pleased with him  that he would be very glad to see you if you should not be able to see him nor send to him colo lewis or any other gentleman in fredericksburgh would advance what money i am to have at the least intimation from you if you should ever send me any bills hereafter it will be best for you to make them payable to dr witherspoon which will give him an opportunity to endorse them  greatly help me in getting them if it should so happen that you see him please to mention it to him i am sorry mr chews mode of conveyance will not answer in virginia i expect to hear from him in a few days by return of a man belonging to this town from   new london  shall then acquaint him with it and get it remedied by the methods you propose mr james martin was here at commencement and had an opportunity of hearing from his brothers  friends in carolina by a young man lately come from thence to this college however i shall follow your directions in writing to him immediately  visiting him as soon as i find it convenient you may tell mrs martin he left his family at home all well if you think proper that i should come back to this place after my journey to virginia in the spring  spend the summer here you may send the cloth for my coat which i am extremely pleased with  could have wished it had come time enough to have used this summer past if you chuse rather i should remain in virginia next summer it will be unnecessary i am etc james madison november        orange virginia william bradford jr to william bradford jr  at the coffeehouse philadelphia—by the post orange virginia november        my dear b— you moralize so prettily that if i were to judge from some parts of your letter of october  0    i should take you for an old philosopher that had experienced the emptiness of earthly happiness and i am very glad that you have so early seen through the romantic paintings with which the world is sometimes set off by the sprightly imaginations of the ingenious you have happily supplied by reading and observation the want of experiment and therefore i hope you are sufficiently guarded against the allurements and vanities that beset us on our first entrance on the theatre of life yet however nice and cautious we may be in detecting the follies of mankind and framing our economy according to the precepts of wisdom and religion i fancy there will commonly remain with us some latent expectation of obtaining more than ordinary happiness and prosperity till we feel the convincing argument of actual disappointment though i will not determine whether we shall be much the worse for it if we do not allow it to intercept our views towards a future state because strong desires and great hopes instigate us to arduous enterprizes fortitude and perseverance nevertheless a watchful eye must be kept on ourselves lest while we are building ideal monuments of renown and bliss here we neglect to have our names enrolled in the annals of heaven these thoughts come into my mind because i am writing to you and thinking of you as to myself i am too dull and infirm now to look out for any extraordinary things in this world for i think my sensations for many months past have intimated to me not to expect a long or healthy life though it may be better with me after    some time but i hardly dare expect it and therefore have little spirit and alacrity to set about anything that is difficult in acquiring and useless in possessing after one has exchanged time for eternity but you have health youth fire and genius to bear you along through the high track of public life and so may be more interested and delighted in improving on hints that respect the temporal though momentous concerns of man i think you made a judicious choice of history and the science of morals for your winters study they seem to be of the most universal benefit to men of sense and taste in every post and must certainly be of great use to youth in settling the principles and refining the judgment as well as in enlarging knowledge and correcting the imagination i doubt not but you design to season them with a little divinity now and then which like the philosophers stone in the hands of a good man will turn them and every lawful acquirement into the nature of itself and make them more precious than fine gold as you seem to require that i should be open and unreserved which is indeed the only proof of true friendship i will venture to give you a word of advice though it be more to convince you of my affection for you than from any apprehension of your needing it pray do not suffer those impertinent fops that abound in every city to divert you from your business and philosophical amusements you may please them more by admitting them to the enjoyment of your company but you will make them    respect and admire you more by showing your indignation at their follies and by keeping them at a becoming distance i am luckily out of the way of such troubles but i know you are surrounded with them for they breed in towns and populous places as naturally as flies do in the shambles because there they get food enough for their vanity and impertinence i have undertaken to instruct my brothers and sisters in some of the first rudiments of literature but it does not take up so much of my time but i shall always have leisure to receive and answer your letters which are very grateful to me i assure you and for reading any performances you may be kind enough to send me whether of mr freneau  or anybody else i think myself happy in your correspondence and desire you will continue to write as often as you can as you see i intend to do by the early and long answer i send you you are the only valuable friend i have settled in so public a place and i must rely on you for an account of all literary transactions in your part of the world i am not sorry to hear of livingstons  getting a    degree i heartily wish him well though many would think i had but little reason to do so and if he would be sensible of his opportunities and encouragements i think he might still recover lucky  and his company after their feeble yet wicked assault upon mr erwin in my opinion will disgrace the catalogue of names but they are below contempt and i spend no more words about them and now my friend i must take my leave of you but with such hopes that it will not be long before i receive another epistle from you as make me more cheerfully conclude and subscribe myself your sincere and affectionate friend your direction was right however the addition of jr to my name would not be improper      act for opening  keeping in repair public roads  mad mss  freeholders of each

security be first for the charges james madison april         orange county virginia william bradford jr to william bradford jr orange county virginia april         dear b— i received your letter dated march the  st about a week ago and it is not more to obey your demands than to fulfil my own desires that i give you this early answer i am glad you disclaim all punctiliousness in our correspondence for my own part i confess i have not the face to perform ceremony in person and i equally detest it on paper though as tully says it cannot blush friendship like all truth delights in plainness and simplicity and it is the counterfeit alone that needs ornament and    ostentation i am so thoroughly persuaded of this that when i observe any one over complaisant to me in his professions and promises i am tempted to interpret his language thus as i have no real esteem for you and for certain reasons think it expedient to appear well in your eye i endeavor to varnish falsehood with politeness which i think i can do in so ingenious a manner that so vain a blockhead as you cannot see through it i would have you write to me when you feel as you used to do when we were under the same roof and you found it a recreation and release from business and books to come and chat an hour or two with me the case is such with me that i am too remote from the post to have the same choice but it seldom happens that an opportunity catches me out of a humor of writing to my old nassovian friends and you know what place you hold among them i have not seen a single piece against the doctors address i saw a piece advertised for publication in the philadelphia gazette entitled candid remarks c and that is all i know about it these things seldom reach virginia and when they do i am out of the way of them i have a curiosity to read those authors who write with all the rage of impotence not because there is any excellence or wit in their writings but because they implicitly proclaim the merit of those they are railing against and give them an occasion of shewing by their silence and contempt that they are invulnerable i am heartily obliged to you for your kind offer of sending me some of these performances i should also willingly accept freneaus    works and the sermons to doctors in divinity which i hear are published and whatever else you reckon worth reading please to note the cost of the articles for i will by no means suffer our acquaintance to be an expense on your part alone and i have nothing fit to send you to make it reciprocal in your next letter be more particular as to yourself your intentions present employments c erwin mcpherson c the affairs of the college is the lottery like to come to anything there has happened no change in my purposes since you heard from me last my health is a little better owing i believe to more activity and less study recommended by physicians i shall try if possible to devise some business that will afford me a sight of you once more in philadelphia within a year or two i wish you would resolve the same with respect to me in virginia though within a shorter time i am sorry my situation affords me nothing new curious or entertaining to pay you for your agreeable information and remarks you being at the fountain head of political and literary intelligence and i in an obscure corner you must expect to be greatly loser on that score by our correspondence but as you have entered upon it i am determined to hold you to it and shall give you some very severe admonitions whenever i perceive a remissness or brevity in your letters i do not intend this as a beginning of reproof but as a caution to you never to make it necessary at all if mr horton is in philadelphia give him my best thanks for his kindness in assisting mr wallace to do some business for        not long ago    i must reecho your pressing invitation to        do with the more confidence as i have complied i am dear sir your most unfeignedly james madison january the   th      william bradford jr to william bradford jr january the   th      my worthy friend— yours of the   th of last month came into my hands a few days past it gave singular pleasure not only because of the kindness expressed in it but because i had reason to apprehend the letter you received last from me had miscarried and i should fail in procuring the intelligence i wanted before the trip i designed in the spring i congratulate you on your heroic proceedings in philadelphia with regard to the tea  i wish boston may conduct matters with as much discretion as they seem to do with boldness they seem to have great trials and difficulties by reason of the obduracy and ministerialism of their governor however political contests are necessary sometimes as well as military to afford exercise and practice and to instruct in the art of defending liberty and property i verily believe    the frequent assaults that have been made on america boston especially will in the end prove of real advantage if the church of england had been the established and general religion in all the northern colonies as it has been among us here and uninterrupted tranquillity had prevailed throughout the continent it is clear to me that slavery and subjection might and would have been gradually insinuated among us union of religious sentiments begets a surprising confidence and ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance and corruption all of which facilitate the execution of mischievous projects but away with politics let me address you as a student and philosopher and not as a patriot now i am pleased that you are going to converse with the edwards and henrys and charleses c c who have swayed the british sceptre though i believe you will find some of them dirty and unprofitable companions unless you will glean instruction from their follies and fall more in love with liberty by beholding such detestable pictures of tyranny and cruelty i was afraid you would not easily have loosened your affection from the belles lettres a delicate taste and warm imagination like yours must find it hard to give up such refined and exquisite enjoyments for the coarse and dry study of the law it is like leaving a pleasant flourishing field for a barren desert perhaps i should not say barren either because the law does bear fruit but it is sour fruit that must be gathered and pressed and distilled before it can bring  0 pleasure or profit i perceive i have made a very awkward comparison but i got the thought by the end and had gone too far to quit it before i perceived that it was too much entangled in my brain to run it through and so you must forgive it i myself used to have too great a hankering after those amusing studies poetry wit and criticism romances plays c captivated me much but i began to discover that they deserve but a small portion of a mortals time and that something more substantial more durable and more profitable befits a riper age it would be exceedingly improper for a laboring man to have nothing but flowers in his garden or to determine to eat nothing but sweet meats and confections equally absurd would it be for a scholar and a man of business to make up his whole library with books of fancy and feed his mind with nothing but such luscious performances when you have an opportunity and write to mr brackenridge  pray tell him i often think of him and long to see him and am resolved to do so in the spring george luckey was with me at christmas and we talked so much about old affairs and old friends that i have a most insatiable desire to see you all luckey will accompany me and we are to set off on the  0th of april if no disaster befalls either of us i want again to breathe your free air i expect it will mend my constitution and confirm my principles    i have indeed as good an atmosphere at home as the climate will allow but have nothing to brag of as to the state and liberty of my country poverty and luxury prevail among all sorts pride ignorance and knavery among the priesthood and vice and wickedness among the laity this is bad enough but it is not the worst i have to tell you that diabolical hellconceived principle of persecution rages among some and to their eternal infamy the clergy can furnish their quota of imps for such business this vexes me the worst of anything whatever there are at this time in the adjacent country not less than five or six wellmeaning men in close jail for publishing their religious sentiments which in the main are very orthodox i have neither patience to hear talk or think of anything relative to this matter for i have squabbled and scolded abused and ridiculed so long about it to little purpose that i am without common patience so i must beg you to pity me and pray for liberty of conscience to all i expect to hear from you once more before i see you if time will admit and want to know when the synod meets and where what the exchange is at and as much about my friends and other matters as you can tell and think worthy of notice till i see you adieu n b our correspondence is too far advanced to require apology for bad writing and blots your letter to mr wallace is yet in my hands and shall be forwarded to you as soon as possible i hear nothing from him by letter or fame    james madison april        virginia orange county william bradford jr to william bradford jr virginia orange county april        my worthy friend— i have another favor to acknowledge in the receipt of your kind letter of march the  th i did not intend to have written again to you before i obtained a nearer communication with you but you have too much interest in my inclinations ever to be denied a request mr brackenridges illness gives me great uneasiness i think he would be a loss to america his merit is rated so high by me that i confess if he were gone i could almost say with the poet that his country could furnish such a pomp for death no more but i solace myself from finleys ludicrous descriptions as you do our assembly is to meet the first of may when it is expected something will be done in behalf of the dissenters petitions i hear are already forming among the persecuted baptists and i fancy it is in the thoughts of the presbyterians also to intercede for greater liberty in matters of religion for my own part i cannot help being very doubtful of their succeeding in the attempt the affair was on the carpet during the last session but such incredible and extravagant stories were told in the house of the monstrous effects of the enthusiasm prevalent among the sectaries and so greedily swallowed by their enemies that i believe they lost footing by it and the bad name they still have with those who pretend too much contempt to examine into their principles and conduct and are too much devoted to the ecclesiastical establishment to hear of the toleration of dissentients i am    apprehensive will be again made a pretext for rejecting their request the sentiments of our people of fortune and fashion on this subject are vastly different from what you have been used to  that liberal catholic and equitable way of thinking as to the rights of conscience which is one of the characteristics of a free people and so strongly marks the people of your province is but little known among the zealous adherents to our hierarchy we have it is true some persons in the legislature of generous principles both in religion and politics but number not merit you know is necessary to carry points there besides the clergy are a numerous and powerful body have great influence at home by reason of their connection with and dependence on the bishops and crown and will naturally employ all their art and interest to depress their rising adversaries for such they must consider dissenters who rob them of the good will of the people and may in time endanger their livings and security you are happy in dwelling in a land where those inestimable privileges are fully enjoyed and the public has long felt the good effects of this religious as well as civil liberty foreigners have been encouraged to settle among you industry and virtue have been promoted by mutual emulation and mutual inspection commerce and the arts have flourished    and i cannot help attributing those continual exertions of genius which appear among you to the inspiration of liberty and that love of fame and knowledge which always accompany it religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise every expanded prospect how far this is the case with virginia will more clearly appear when the ensuing trial is made i am making all haste in preparing for my journey it appears as if it would be the first of may before i can start which i can more patiently bear because i may possibly get no company before that time and it will answer so exactly with the meeting of the synod george luckey talks of joining me if i can wait till then i am resolutely determined to come if it is in my power if anything hinders me it will be most likely the indisposition of my mother who is in a very low state of health and if she should grow worse i am afraid she will be more unwilling to part with my brother as she will be less able to bear the separation if it should unfortunately happen that i should be forced off or give out coming luckey on his return to virginia will bring me whatever publications you think worth sending and among others caspapinis letters but whether i come or not be assured i retain the most ardent affection and esteem for you and the most cordial gratitude for your many generous kindnesses it gives me real pleasure when i write to you that i can talk in this language without the least affectation and without the suspicion of it and that if i should omit expressing my love for you your    friendship can supply the omission or if i make use of the most extravagant expressions of it your corresponding affection can believe them to be sincere this is a satisfaction and delight unknown to all who correspond for business and conveniency but richly enjoyed by all who make pleasure and improvement the business of their communications farewell j m p s you need no longer direct to the care of mr maury james madison july        william bradford jr to william bradford jr july        dear sir— i am once more got into my native land and into the possession of my customary employments solitude and contemplation though i must confess not a little disturbed by the sound of war blood and plunder on the one hand and the threats of slavery and oppression on the other from the best accounts i can obtain from our frontiers the savages are determined on the extirpation of the inhabitants and no longer leave them the alternative of death or captivity the consternation and timidity of the white people who abandon their possessions without making the least resistance are as difficult to be accounted for as they are encouraging to the enemy whether it be owing to the unusual cruelty of the indians the want of necessary implements or ammunition for war or to the ignorance and inexperience    of many who since the establishment of peace have ventured into those new settlements i can neither learn nor with any certainty conjecture however it is confidently asserted that there is not an inhabitant for some hundreds of miles back which have been settled for many years except those who are forted in or embodied by their military commanders the state of things has induced lord dunmore contrary to his intentions at the dissolution of the assembly to issue writs for a new election of members whom he is to call together on the   th of august as to the sentiments of the people of this colony with respect to the bostonians i can assure you i find them very warm in their favor the natives are very numerous and resolute are making resolves in almost every county and i believe are willing to fall in with the other colonies in any expedient measure even if that should be the universal prohibition of trade it must not be denied though that the europeans especially the scotch and some interested merchants among the natives discountenance such proceedings as far as they dare alledging the injustice and perfidy of refusing to pay our debts to our generous creditors at home this consideration induces some honest moderate folks to prefer a partial prohibition extending only to the importation of goods we have a report here that governor gage has sent lord dunmore some letters relating to public matters in which he says he has strong hopes that he shall be able to bring things at boston to an amicable settlement i suppose you know whether there be    any truth in the report or any just foundation for such an opinion in gage it has been said here by some that the appointed fast was disregarded by every scotch clergyman though it was observed by most of the others who had timely notice of it i cannot avouch it for an absolute certainty but it appears no ways incredible i was so lucky as to find dean tuckers tracts  on my return home sent by mistake with some other books imported this spring i have read them with peculiar satisfaction and illumination with respect to the interests of america and britain at the same time his ingenious and plausible defence of parliamentary authority carries in it such defects and misrepresentations as confirm me in political orthodoxy—after the same manner as the specious arguments of infidels have established the faith of inquiring christians i am impatient to hear from you and do now certainly earnestly renew the stipulation for that friendly correspondence which alone can comfort me in the privation of your company i shall be punctual in transmitting you an account of everything that can be acceptable but must freely absolve you from as strict an obligation which your application to more important business will not allow and which my regard for your ease and interests will not suffer me to enjoin i am dear sir your faithful friend    james madison january  0      virginia orange county william bradford jr to william bradford jr virginia orange county january  0       my worthy friend—    we are very busy at present in raising men and procuring the necessaries for defending ourselves and our friends in case of a sudden invasion the extensiveness of the demands of the congress and the pride of the british nation together with the wickedness of the present ministry seem in the judgment of our politicians to require a preparation for extreme events there will by the spring i expect be some thousands of welltrained highspirited men ready to meet danger whenever it appears who are influenced by no mercenary principles but bearing their own expenses and having the prospect of no recompense but the honor and safety of their country i suppose the inhabitants of your province are more reserved in their behavior if not more easy in their apprehension from the prevalence of quaker principles and politics the quakers are the only people with us who refuse to accede to the continental association i cannot forbear suspecting them to be under the control and direction of the leaders of the party in your quarter for i take those of them that we have to be too honest and simple to have any sinister or secret views and i do not observe anything in the association inconsistent with their religious principles when i say they refuse to accede to the    association my meaning is that they refuse to sign it that being the method used among us to distinguish friends from foes and to oblige the common people to a more strict observance of it i have never heard whether the like method has been adopted in the other governments i have not seen the following in print and it seems to be so just a specimen of indian eloquence and mistaken valor that i think you will be pleased with it you must make allowance for the unskilfulness of the interpreters the speech of logan a shawanese chief to lord dunmore i appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered logans cabin hungry and i gave him not meat if ever he came cold or naked and i gave him not clothing during the course of the last long and bloody war logan remained idle in his tent an advocate for peace nay such was my love for the whites that those of my country pointed at me as they passed by and said logan is the friend of white men i had even thought to live with you but for the injuries of one man col cressop the last spring in cold blood and unprovoked cut off all the relations of logan not sparing even my women and children there runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any human creature this called on me for revenge i have sought it i have killed many i have fully glutted my vengence for my country i rejoice at the beams of peace but do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear logan never felt fear he  0 will not turn on his heel to save his life who is there to mourn for logan—not one if you should see any of our friends from princeton a little before the time of your intending to write to me and could transmit any little intelligence concerning the health c of my little brother there it would be very acceptable to me and very gratifying to a fond mother but i desire it may only be done when it will cost you less than five words we had with us a little before christmas the rev moses allen on his return from boston to charlestown he told me he came through philadelphia but did not see you though he expresses a singular regard for you and left his request with me that you would let him hear from you whenever it is convenient promising to return the kindness with punctuality he travelled with considerable equipage for a dissenting ecclesiastic and seems to be willing to superadd the airs of the fine gentleman to the graces of the spirit i had his company for several days during which time he preached two sermons with general approbation his discourses were above the common run some degree and his appearance in the pulpit on on the whole was no discredit to        he retains too much of his pristine levity but promises amendment i wish he may for the sake of himself his friends and his flock i only add that he seems to be one of those geniuses that are formed for shifting in the world rather than shining in a college and that i really believe him to possess a friendly and generous disposition    you shall ere long hear from me again till then vive vale et lœtare james madison may        patrick henry address to captain patrick henry and the

accept their cordial thanks for this testimony of your zeal for the honor and interest of your country we take this opportunity also to give it as our opinion that the blow struck in the massachusetts

mss  journal of the virginia convention in      may  0 a representation from the committee of the county of augusta was presented to the convention setting forth the present unhappy situation of the country and from the ministerial measures of vengeance now pursuing representing the necessity of making the confederacy of the united colonies the most perfect independent and lasting and of framing an equal free and liberal government that may bear the test of all future ages ordered that the said representation be referred to the committee on the state of the colony quere as to the date of this representation and whether the document be on the public files may    the convention one hundred and twelve members being present unanimously agreed as follows forasmuch as all endeavours of the united colonies by the most decent representations and petitions to the king and parliament of great britain to restore peace and security to america under the british government and a reunion with that people upon just and liberal terms instead of a redress of grievances have produced—from an    imperious and vindictive administration increased insult oppression and a vigorous attempt to effect our total destruction by a late act all these colonies are declared to be in rebellion and out of the protection of the british crown our properties subjected to confiscation our people when captivated compelled to join in the murder and plunder of their relations and countrymen and all former rapine and oppression of americans delared legal and just fleets and armies are raised and the aid of foreign troops engaged to assist these destructive purposes the kings representative in this colony hath not only witheld all the powers of government from operating for our safety but having retired on board an armed ship is carrying on a piratical and savage war against us tempting our slaves by every artifice to resort to him and training and employing them against their masters in this state of extreme danger we have no alternative left but an abject submission to the will of those overbearing tyrants or a total separation from the crown and government of great britain uniting and exerting the strength of all america for defence and forming alliances with foreign powers for commerce and aid in war wherefore appealing to the searcher of hearts for the sincerity of former declarations expressing our desire to preserve the connexion with that nation and that we are driven from that inclination by their wicked councils and the eternal laws of selfpreservation resolved unanimously that the delegates appointed to represent this colony in general congress be instructed to propose to that respectable body to declare the united colonies free and independent states absolved from all allegiance to or dependence upon the crown or parliament of great britain and that they give the assent of this colony to such declaration and to whatever measures may be thought proper and necessary by the congress for forming foreign alliances and a confederation of the colonies as such times and in the manner as to them shall seem best provided that the power of forming government for and the regulations of the internal concerns of each colony be left to the respective colonial legislatures resolved unanimously that a committee be appointed to prepare a declaration of rights and such a plan of government    as will be most likely to maintain peace and order in this colony and secure substantial and equal liberty to the people and a committee was appointed of the following members viz archibald cary meriwether smith mr mercer mr henry lee mr treasurer—robert carter nicholas mr henry mr dandridge mr edmund randolph mr gilmer mr bland mr diggs mr carrington mr

convention and in the meantime is ordered to be printed for the perusal of the members a declaration of rights made by the representatives of the good people of virginia assembled in full and free convention which rights do pertain to us and our posterity as the basis and foundation of government   that all men are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent natural rights of which they cannot by any compact deprive their posterity among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty with the means of acquiring and possessing property and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety   that all power is vested in and consequently derived from the people that magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times amenable to them   that government is or ought to be instituted for the common benefit protection and security of the people nation or community of all the various modes and forms of government that is best which is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration and that whenever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes a majority of the community hath an indubitable unalienable and indefeasible right to reform alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal   that no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of publick services which not being descendible or hereditary the idea of a man born a magistrate a legislator or a judge is unnatural and absurd   that the legislative and executive powers of the state should be separate and distinct from the judicative and that the members of the two first may be restrained from oppression by feeling and participating the burdens of the people they should at fixed periods be reduced to a private station return into that body from which they were originally taken and the vacancies be supplied by frequent certain and regular elections   that elections of members to serve as representatives of the people in assembly ought to be free and that all men having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with and attachment to the community have the right of suffrage   that no part of a mans property can be taken from him or applied to publick uses without his own consent or that of his legal representatives nor are the people bound by any laws but such as they have in like manner assented to for their common good   that all power of suspending laws or the execution of laws by any authority without consent of the representatives of the people is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised   that laws having retrospect to crimes and punishing offences committed before the existence of such laws are generally oppressive and ought to be avoided  0 that in all capital or criminal prosecutions as man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation to be confronted with the accusers or witnesses to call for evidence in his favour and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself that no man be deprived of his liberty except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers    that excessive bail ought not to be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted    that warrants unsupported by evidence whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected places or to seize any person or persons his or their property not particularly described are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted    that in controversies respecting property and in suits between man and man the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other and ought to be held sacred    that the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty and can never be restrained but by despotick governments    that a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the proper natural and safe defence of a free state that standing armies in time of peace should be avoided as dangerous to liberty and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power    that the people have a right to uniform government and therefore that no government separate from or independent of the government of virginia ought of right to be erected or established within the limits thereof    that no free government or the blessings of liberty can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice moderation temperance frugality and virtue and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles    that religion or the duty which we owe to our creator and the manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction not by force or violence and therefore that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate unless under colour of religion any man disturb the peace the happiness or safety of society and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice christian forbearance love and charity

march saturdy       hond sir    the following odd affair has furnished the ct of this county with some very unexpected business two persons travelling from phila to the southward one of them a frenchman and an officer in the continental army and the other a man of decent figure came to the ct house on the evening of the ct day and immediately inquired for a member of the committee and being withdrawn with several members into a private room they gave information that they fell in with a man on the road a few miles from the ct house who in the course of conversation on public affairs gave abundant proof of his being an adherent to the king of g b and a dangerous enemy to the state that he ran into the most outrageous abuse of our proceedings and on their threatening to inform  0 agt him in the most daring manner bid defiance to committees or whoever should pretend to judge or punish him they said the man they alluded to had come with them to the ct house and they made no doubt but they could point him out in the crowd on their so doing the culprit appeared to be benjamin haley as the committee had no jurisdiction in the case it was referred to a justice of the peace every one seemed to be agreed that his conduct was a direct violation of law and called aloud for public notice but the witnesses being travellers and therefore unable to attend at a trial it was thought best not to undertake a prosecution which promised nothing but impunity and matter of triumph to the offender here the affair dropped and every one supposed was entirely at an end but as the frenchman was accidentally passing through the room where haley was he took occasion to admonish the people of his being a disaffected person and upbraided him for his tory principles this introduced a debate which was continued for some time with great heat on the part of the frenchman and great insolence on the part of haley at the request of the latter they at length both appeared before a justice of the peace haley at first evaded the charges of his antagonist but after some time said he scorned to be counterfeit and in answer to some questions that were put to him signified that we were in the state of rebellion and had revolted from our lawful sovereign and that if the king had justice done him his authority would still be in exercise among us this passed in the presence of  0    or  0 persons and rendered the testimony of the travellers needless a warrant for arresting him was immediately issued and executed the criminal went through his examination in which his very pleas seemed to aggravate his guilt witnesses were summoned sworn and their evidences taken and on his obstinate refusal to give security for his appearance he was committed to close gaol this happened about   oclock i have since heard he begged abt one oclock in the morning to be admitted to bail  went home but not without threats of revenge and making public declaration that he was king georges man i have

particularly dried fruit c c which mr madison is very fond of to make some little returns for the culinary favours i receive should any opportunity for this purpose offer i hope they will be sent you

unprovided with paper makes it necessary to leave this information for him with you j m jr although i well know how inconvenient and disagreeable it is to you to continue to act as lieutenant of the county  i cannot help informing you that a resignation at this juncture is here supposed to have a very unfriendly aspect on the execution of the draught and consequently to betray at least a want of patriotism and perseverence this is so much the case that a recommendation of cony lt this day received by the govr to supply the place of one who had resigned to the court produced a private verbal

in linen c we have no news here that can be depended it is said by mr king who is just from petersbg that a gentleman was at that place who informed that sundry persons had arrived at edenton which he was travelling from from providence island who affirmed that they saw in providence a london paper giving an account that burgoynes disaster had produced the most violent fermentation in england that the parliament had refused to grant the supplies for carrying on the war and that a motion for acknowledging our independence was overruled by a small majority only the people who bring this news to edenton as the story goes were prisoners wth the enemy at providence where they were released by a new england privateer which suddenly landed her men took possession of the small fort that commanded the harbour and secured several vessels that lay in it one of which was given up to these men to bring them to the continent i leave you to form your own judgment as to the credibility    of this report—i wish it carried stronger marks of truth the govr has just recd a letter from the capt of french frigate i mentioned in my last informing him of his safe arrival in n c with a rich cargo of various useful and important articles which will be offered for sale to us the frigate belongs to a company at nantes in france—we also hear but in a less authentic manner that  000 tents have arrived at martinique on their way from france to the grand army —salt at south quay sells at £   a illegible and is falling—a letter from yorktown this moment read informs us that an exchange of prisoners is

yours by him the assembly have not yet concluded their plan for complying with the requisitions from congress it may be relied on that that cannot be done without very heavy taxes on every species of property indeed it is thought questionable    whether it will not be found absolutely impossible no exertions however ought to be omitted to testify our zeal to support congress in the prosecution of the war it is also proposed to procure a large sum on loan by stipulating to pay the interest in tobo a tax on this article necessary for that purpose is to be collected being very imperfectly acquainted with the proceedings of the assembly on this matter i must refer you for the particulars to the return of majr moore or some future opportunity the law for escheats  forfeitures will be repealed as it respects orphans c the effects of the measures taken by the assembly on the credit of our money  the prices of things cannot be predicted if our expectations had not been so invariably disappointed they ought to be supposed very considerable but from the rapid progress of depreciation at present and the universal struggle among sellers to bring up prices i cannot flatter myself with the hope of any great reformation corn is already at £ 0  rising tobo is also rising pork will probably command any price imported goods exceed everything else many hundreds per cent i am much at a loss how to dispose of willey  i cannot think it would be expedient in the present state of things to send him out of the state from a new arrangement of the college here nothing is in future to be taught but the higher  rarer branches of science the preliminary studies must therefore be pursued in private schools or academies if the    academy at prince edward is so far dissolved that you think his return thither improper i would recommend his being put under the instruction of mr maury  rather than suffer him to be idle at home the languages including english geography  arithmetic ought to be his employment till he is prepared to receive a finish to his education at this place by the late change also in the college the former custom of furnishing the table for the president  professors is to be discontinued i am induced by this consideration to renew my request for the flour mentioned so often to you it will perhaps be the only opportunity i may have of requiting received  singular favours and for the reason just assigned will be extremely convenient i wish to know without any loss of time how far this supply may be reckoned   or  00lb at least i pursuade myself may be spared from your stock without encroaching on your own consumption perhaps mr r burnley would receive and store it for me capt wm anderson i believe also lives at that place and would probably do any favour of that sort i am desired by a gentleman here to procure for him   bear skins to cover the foot of his chariot if they can be bought anywhere in your neighborhood i beg you or ambrose will take the trouble to inquire for them  send them to capt anderson at hanover town if the flour should come down the same opportunity will serve for them    captain anderson may be informed that they are for mr norton if they can be got without too much trouble i should be glad of succeeding as he will rely on my promise to procure them for him having nothing to add under the head of news i subscribe myself

had introduced such disorder and perplexity into public affairs for the present and threatened to load the united states with such an intolerable burden of debt that congress have thought it expedient to convert the  00000000 of dollars now in circulation into a real debt of  000000 by establishing the exchange at  0 for   and taxes for calling it in during the ensuing year are to be payable at the option of the people in specie or paper according to that difference in order to carry on public measures in future money is to be emitted under the combined faith of congress and the several states secured on permanent and specific    funds to be provided by the latter this scheme was finally resolved on on saturday last it has not yet been printed but will be immediately i shall transmit a copy to you by the first opportunity the little time i have been here makes it impossible for me to enter into a particular delineation of it it will probably create great perplexity and complaints in many private transactions congress have recommended to the states to repeal their tender laws and to take measures for preventing injustice as much as possible it is probable that in the case of loans to the public the state of depreciation at the time they were made will be the rule of payment but nothing is yet decided on that point i expect to be more at leisure to write fully by next post james madison march       0 philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia march       0 dear sir— nothing under the title of news has occurred since i wrote last week by express except that the enemy on the first of march remained in the neighbourhood of charleston in the same posture as when the preceding account came away from the best intelligence from that quarter there seems to be great encouragement to hope that clintons operations will be again frustrated our great apprehensions at present flow from a very different quarter among the various conjunctures of alarm and distress which  0 have arisen in the course of the revolution it is with pain i affirm to you sir that no one can be singled out more truly critical than the present our army threatened with an immediate alternative of disbanding or living on free quarter the public treasury empty public credit exhausted nay the private credit of purchasing agents employed i am told as far as it will bear congress complaining of the extortion of the people the people of the improvidence of congress and the army of both our affairs requiring the most mature and systematic measures and the urgency of occasions admitting only of temporizing expedients and these expedients generating new difficulties congress recommending plans to the several states for execution and the states separately rejudging the expediency of such plans whereby the same distrust of concurrent exertions that has damped the ardor of patriotic individuals must produce the same effect among the states themselves an old system of finance discarded as incompetent to our necessities an untried and precarious one substituted and a total stagnation in prospect between the end of the former and the operation of the latter these are the outlines of the picture of our public situation i leave it to your own imagination to fill them up believe me sir as things now stand if the states do not vigorously proceed in collecting the old money and establishing funds for the credit of the new that we are undone and let them be ever so expeditious in doing this still the intermediate distress to our army and hindrance to public affairs    are a subject of melancholy reflection general washington writes that a failure of bread has already commenced in the army and that for any thing he sees it must unavoidably increase meat they have only for a short season and as the whole dependence is on provisions now to be procured without a shilling for the purpose and without credit for a shilling i look forward with the most pungent apprehensions it will be attempted i believe to purchase a few supplies with loanoffice certificates but whether they will be received is perhaps far from being certain and if received will certainly be a most expensive and ruinous expedient it is not without some reluctance i trust this information to a conveyance by post but i know of no better at present and i conceive it to be absolutely necessary to be known to those who are most able and zealous to contribute to the public relief james madison may      0 philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia may      0 dear sir— i am sorry that i can give you no other account of our public situation than that it continues equally perplexed and alarming as when i lately gave you a sketch of it our army has as yet been kept from starving and public measures from total stagnation by draughts on the states for the unpaid requisitions the great amount of these you may    judge of from the share that has fallen to virginia the discharge of debts due from the purchasing departments has absorbed a great proportion of them and very large demands still remain as soon as the draughts amount to the whole of the monthly requisitions up to the end of march they must cease according to the new scheme of finance we must then depend wholly on the emissions to be made in pursuance of that scheme which can only be applied as the old emissions are collected and destroyed should this not be done as fast as the current expenditures require or should the new emissions fall into a course of depreciation both of which may but too justly be feared a most melancholy crisis must take place a punctual compliance on the part of the states with the specific supplies will indeed render much less money necessary than would otherwise be wanted but experience by no means affords satisfactory encouragement that due and unanimous exertions will be made for that purpose—not to mention that our distress is so pressing that it is uncertain whether any exertions of that kind can give relief in time it occurs besides that as the ability of the people to comply with the pecuniary requisitions is derived from the sale of their commodities a requisition of the latter must make the former proportionably more difficult and defective congress have the satisfaction however to be informed that the legislature of connecticut have taken the most vigorous steps for supplying their quota both of money and commodities and that a body of their principal merchants    have associated for supporting the credit of the new paper for which purpose they have in a public address pledged their faith to the assembly to sell their merchandize on the same terms as if they were to be paid in specie a similar vigor throughout the union may perhaps produce effects as far exceeding our present hopes as they have heretofore fallen short of our wishes it is to be observed that the situation of congress has undergone a total change from what it originally was whilst they exercised the indefinite power of emitting money on the credit of their constituents they had the whole wealth and resources of the continent within their command and could go on with their affairs independently and as they pleased since the resolution passed for shutting the press this power has been entirely given up and they are now as dependent on the states as the king of england is on the parliament they can neither enlist pay nor feed a single soldier nor execute any other purpose but as the means are first put into their hands unless the legislatures are sufficiently attentive to this change of circumstances and act in conformity to it every thing must necessarily go wrong or rather must come to a total stop all that congress can do in future will be to administer public affairs with prudence vigor and economy in order to do which they have sent a committee to headquarters with ample powers in concert with the commanderinchief and the heads of the departments to reform the various abuses which prevail    and to make such arrangements as will best guard against a relapse into them james madison june      0 philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia june      0 dear sir— it appears from sundry accounts from the frontiers of new york and other northern states that the savages are making the most distressing incursions under the direction of british agents and that a considerable force is assembling at montreal for the purpose of wresting from us fort schuyler which covers the northwestern frontier of new york it is probable the enemy will be but too successful this campaign in exciting their vindictive spirit against us throughout the whole frontier of the united states the expedition of general sullivan against the six nations seems by its effects rather to have exasperated than to have terrified or disabled them and the example of those nations will add great weight to the exhortations addressed to the more southern tribes rivington has published a positive and particular account of the surrender of charleston on the twelfth ultimo said to be brought to new york by the iris which left charleston five days after there are notwithstanding some circumstances attending it which added to the notorious character for lying of the author leave some hope that it is fictitious the    true state of the matter will probably be known at richmond before this reaches you we have yet heard nothing further of the auxiliary armament from france however anxiously its arrival may be wished for it is much to be feared we shall continue to be so unprepared to cooperate with them as to disappoint their views and to add to our distress and disgrace scarce a week and sometimes scarce a day but brings us a most lamentable picture from headquarters the army are a great part of their time on short allowance and sometimes without any at all and constantly depending on the precarious fruits of momentary expedients general washington has found it of the utmost difficulty to repress the mutinous spirit engendered by hunger and want of pay and all his endeavours could not prevent an actual eruption of it in two connecticut regiments who assembled on the parade with their arms and resolved to return home or satisfy their hunger by the power of the bayonet we have no permanent resource and scarce even a momentary one left but in the prompt and vigorous supplies of the states the state of pennsylvania has it in her power to give great relief in the present crisis and a recent act of her legislature shows they are determined to make the most of it i understand they have invested the executive with a dictatorial authority from which nothing but the lives of their citizens are exempted i hope the good resulting from it will be such as to compensate for the risk of the precedent    james madison june       0 philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia june       0 dear sir— the fact is confirmed that clinton has returned to new york with part of the southern army and has joined kniphausen they are at present manœuvering for purposes not absolutely known but most probably in order to draw general washington to an action in which they suppose he might be disabled from giving the necessary cooperation to the french armament could they succeed in drawing him from his strong position the result indeed ought to be exceedingly feared he is weak in numbers beyond all suspicion and under as great apprehension from famine as from the enemy unless very speedy and extensive reinforcements are received from the eastern states which i believe are exerting themselves the issue of the campaign must be equally disgraceful to our councils and disgustful to our allies our greatest hopes of being able to feed them are founded on a patriotic scheme of the opulent merchants of this city who have already subscribed nearly £ and will very soon complete that sum the immediate object of which is to procure and transport to the army rations and three hundred hogsheads of rum congress for the support of this bank and for the security and indemnification of the subscribers have pledged the faith of the united states and agreed to deposit bills of exchange in europe to the amount of £  0000    sterling which are not however to be made use of unless other means of discharging this debt should be inadequate james madison september       0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia september       0  dear sir— congress have at length entered seriously on a plan for finally ratifying the confederation convinced of the necessity of such a measure to repress the hopes with which the probable issue of the campaign will inspire our enemy as well as to give greater authority and vigor to our public councils they have recommended in the most pressing terms to the states claiming unappropriated back lands to cede a liberal portion of them for the general benefit as these exclusive claims formed the only obstacle with maryland there is no doubt that a compliance with this recommendation will bring her into the confederation how far the states holding the back lands may be disposed to give them up cannot be so easily determined from the sentiments of the most intelligent persons which have come to my knowledge i    own i am pretty sanguine that they will see the necessity of closing the union in too strong a light to oppose the only expedient that can accomplish it another circumstance that ought greatly to encourage us under disappointed expectations from the campaign is the combination of the maritime powers in support of their neutral rights and particularly the late insolent and provoking violation of those rights by the english ships at st martins it is not probable that the injured will be satisfied without reparations and acknowledgments which the pride of britain will not submit to and if she can once be embroiled in an altercation with so formidable a league the result must necessarily be decisive in our favor indeed it is not to be supposed after the amazing resources which have been seen in great britain when not only deprived of but opposed by her ancient colonies and the success of the latter in resisting for so long a time the utmost exertion of these resources against her that the maritime powers who appear to be so jealous of their rights will ever suffer an event to take place which must very soon expose them to be trampled on at the pleasure of great britain james madison september       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia september       0 dear sir— yesterday was employed by congress in discussing the resolutions you left with them    the first and second were passed after undergoing sundry alterations  the clause in the second for allowing the expense of maintaining civil government within the ceded territory was struck out by the committee and an attempt to get it reinserted in the house was negatived it was surmised that so indefinite an expression might subject congress to very exorbitant claims with respect to virginia i believe that expense has not been so considerable as to be much worth insisting on the principal expenses may properly be included under the military head the consideration of the last resolution annulling indian purchases was postponed with an intention i believe of not resuming it it is supposed by some to be unnecessary by others to be improper as implying that without such previous assurance congress would have a right to recognize private claims in a territory expressly given up to them for the common benefit these motives prevailed i am persuaded with more than the real view of gratifying private interest at the public expense the states may annex what conditions they please to their cessions and by that means guard them against misapplication or if they only annul all pretended purchases by their own laws before the cessions are made congress are sufficiently precluded by their own general assurance that they shall be applied  0 to the common benefit from admitting any private claims which are opposed to it the vermont business has been two days under agitation and nothing done in it except rejecting a proposition for postponing the determination of congress till commissioners should enquire into the titles and boundaries of new hampshire and new york congress having bound themselves so strongly by their own act to bring it to an issue at this time and are pressed by new york so closely with this engagement that it is not possible any longer to try evasive expedients for my own part if a final decision must take place i am clearly of opinion that it ought to be made on principles that will effectually discountenance the erection of new governments without the sanction of proper authority and in a style marking a due firmness and decision in congress james madison sepr   th    0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philadr sepr   th    0 dear sir— i was in hopes when i wrote my last that i should be able by this post to congratulate you on the arrival of the french fleet from the w indies but so far is this from being the case that it comes from authority which seems to have a just claim to our faith that admiral rodney is actually at the hook with    sail of the line    frigates it is still said however that a french fleet is somewhere on the coast the arrival of rodney is certainly an evidence    that it had quited the islands and was suspected to be coming hither it is also given out at new york that a reinforcement of  000 troops will arrive next month from england another part of our reports is that   or  000 troops will embark at n york on the   th inst for virga or s carolina but it is not to be supposed that such a measure will be hazarded in the present ticklish state of things—   sail of the quebec fleet are carried prizes into n england i am dr sir with sincere respect yr obt friend  servt p s the mortality in this place exceeds any

add to the inclosed paper except that ternay is yet unreinforced graves at sea no one knows where or for what purpose and rodney with  0 ships of the line still at the hook though according to some private accounts he also is gone to sea in this state of uncertainty conjectures  speculations abound as usual i shall not trouble you with them because as far as they are founded in reason    they

prospect of a successful issue to this campaign the reports of the approach or arrival of a french fleet continue to be circulated and to prove groundless if any foreign operations are undertaken on the continent it will probably be against the floridas by the spaniards a spanish gentleman who resides in this city has received information from the governor of cuba that an armament would pass from the havannah to pensacola towards the end of last month and that  0 or    ships of the line and as many thousand troops would soon be in readiness for an expedition against st augustine it would be much more for the credit of that nation as well as for the common good if instead of wasting their time  resources in these separate and unimportant enterprises they would join heartily with the french in attacking the enemy where success would produce the desired effect the enclosed papers contain all the particulars which have been received concerning the apostacy  plot of arnold a variety of his iniquitous jobs prior to    this chef dœuvre of his villainy carried on under cover of his military authority have been detected among his papers and involve a number of persons both within

a few ships is at n york the remainder having joined graves  arbuthnot whom we know nothing about ternay is still at rhode island the main french fleet under guichen left the west indies about the time first mentioned with a large fleet of merchantmen under its convoy and has not since been heard of the residue of the french fleet is in the w indies but we do not hear of their being any way employed it is said an english expedition is preparing at jamaica against some of the spanish settlements the spanish expeditions against the floridas i believe i mentioned in my last    we have private accounts through a channel which has seldom deceived that a very large embarkation is still going on at n york i hope virginia will not be surprised in case she should be the meditated victim andré was hung as a spy on the  d inst clinton made a frivolous attempt to save him by pleading the passport granted by arnold he submitted to his fate in a manner that showed him to be worthy of a better one his coadjutor smith will soon follow him the hero of the plot although he may for the present escape an ignominious death must lead an ignominious life which if any of his feelings remain will be a sorer punishment it is said that he is to be made a brigadier and employed in some predatory expedition against the spaniards in which he may gratify his thirst for gold it is said with more probability that his baseness is universally despised by those who have taken advantage of it and yt some degree of resentment is mixed with their contempt on account of the loss of their darling

ought to have been here on monday week did not arrive till thursday that of the   th came yesterday according to expectation i know not how to account for your disappointment on the last post day having not    omitted to write once since the institution of our correspondence although the stroke of good fortune you mention does not appear to have been duly represented it was only mistaken for one of equal importance which i doubt not is fully known to you by this time our joy on this event has been somewhat abated by intelligence of an opposite complexion from the state of n york two parties from canada composed of regulars tories canadians and savages and amounting to about  000 each have entered their frontiers the one by the way of lake george the other by the way of the oneida lake they have already done some mischief and as they are pursuing their incendiary plan will involve the inhabitants in very great distress it being now the eve of winter unless a speedy check can be given to their progress it is supposed that this expedition was intended to take advantage of the consternation in that state expected to result from the success of arnolds treason we had information some days ago from genl washington that a fleet with about  000 troops on board had fallen down towards the hook which it was supposed was destined either for virginia or n carolina as nothing further has come from the general it is to be inferred that they have not yet sailed it is said the fleet consisting of upwards of  00 sail has at last safely arrived the capture of the british fleet from jamaica rests upon the same evidence as mentioned in my last i am dr sr affec yr obt servt    p s the president has just communicated a letter from mr harrison  at cadiz confirming the capture of the

troops for the east indies you will have the particulars by the next post   or   ships also attempting to get into gibralter with provisions have been taken by the spanish illegible stationed off that place  0 sail of french merchantmen had arrived safe from st domingo the post is this moment starting adieu james madison october    0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia october    0 dear sir— i wish it was in my power to enable you to satisfy the uneasiness of people with respect to the disappointment in foreign succours i am sensible of the advantage which our secret enemies take of it i am persuaded also that those who ought to be acquainted with the cause are sensible of it and as they give no intimations on the subject it is to be inferred that they are unable to give any that would prevent the mischief it is so delicate a subject that with so little probability of succeeding it would perhaps be hardly prudent to suggest it as    soon as any solution comes out you shall be furnished with it we continue to receive periodical alarms from the commissarys and quartermasters departments the season is now arrived when provision ought to be made for a season that will not admit of transportation and when the monthly supplies must be subject to infinite disappointments even if the states were to do their duty but instead of magazines being laid in our army is living from hand to mouth with a prospect of being soon in a condition still worse how a total dissolution of it can be prevented in the course of the winter is for any resources now in prospect utterly inexplicable unless the states unanimously make a vigorous and speedy effort to form magazines for the purpose but unless the states take other methods to procure their specific supplies than have prevailed in most of them the utmost efforts to comply with the requisitions of congress can be only a temporary relief this expedient as i take it was meant to prevent the emission of money our own experience as well as the example of other countries made it evident that we could not by taxes draw back to the treasury the emissions as fast as they were necessarily drawn out we could not follow the example of other countries by borrowing neither our own citizens nor foreigners being willing to lend as far as our wants extended to continue to emit ad infinitum was thought more dangerous than an absolute occlusion of the press under these circumstances the expedient of specific requisitions was    adopted for supplying the necessities of the war but it is clear the success of this expedient depends on the mode of carrying it into execution if instead of executing it by specific taxes state emissions or commissarys and quartermasters certificates which are a worse species of emissions are recurred to what was intended for our relief will only hasten our destruction as you are at present a legislator  i will take the liberty of hinting to you an idea that has occurred on this subject i take it for granted that taxation alone is inadequate to our situation you know as well as i do how far we ought to rely on loans to supply the defects of it specific taxes as far as they go are a valuable fund but from local and other difficulties will never be universally and sufficiently adopted purchases with state money or certificates will be substituted in order to prevent this evil and to ensure the supplies therefore i would propose that they be diffused and proportioned among the people as accurately as circumstances will admit that they be impressed with vigor and impartiality and paid for in certificates not transferable and to be redeemable at some period subsequent to the war at specie value and bearing an intermediate interest the advantage of such a scheme is this that it would anticipate during the war the future revenues of peace as our enemies and all other modern nations do it would be compelling the people to lend the    public their commodities as people elsewhere lend their money to purchase commodities it would be a permanent resource by which the war might be supported as long as the earth should yield its increase this plan differs from specific taxes in this that as an equivalent is given for what is received much less nicety would be requisite in apportioning the supplies among the people and they would be taken in places where they are most wanted it differs from the plan of paying for supplies in state emissions or common certificates in this that the latter produce all the evils of a redundant medium whereas the former not being transferable cannot have that effect and moreover do not require the same degree of taxes during the war james madison october       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia october       0 dear sir— the post having failed to arrive this week i am deprived of the pleasure of acknowledging a line from you congress have at length been brought to a final consideration of the clause relating to indian purchases by the land companies it was debated very fully and particularly and was in the result lost by a division of the house under the first impression of the chagrin i had determined to propose to my colleagues to state the whole matter to the assembly with all the circumstances and the  0 reasonings of the opponents to the measure but on cooler reflection i think it best to leave the fact in your hands to be made use of as your prudence may suggest i am the rather led to decline the first determination because i am pretty confident that whatever the views of particular members might be it was neither the wish nor intention of many who voted with them to favor the purchasing companies some thought such an assurance from congress unnecessary because their receiving the lands from the states as vacant and unappropriated excluded all individual claims and because they had given a general assurance that the cession should be applied to the common benefit others supposed that such an assurance might imply that without it congress would have a right to dispose of the lands in any manner they pleased and that it might give umbrage to the states claiming an exclusive jurisdiction over them all that now remains for the ceding states to do is to annex to their cessions the express condition that no private claims be complied with by congress perhaps it would not be going too far by virginia who is so deeply concerned to make it a condition of the grant that no such claim be admitted even within the grants of others because when they are given up to congress she is interested in them as much as others and it might so happen that the benefit of all other grants except her own might be transferred from the public to a few landmongers i cannot help adding however that i hope this incident in congress will not discourage any measures of the    assembly which would otherwise have been taken for the object of ratifying the confederation under the cautions i have suggested they may still be taken with perfect security congress have promoted col morgan to the rank of a brigadier on the representations in favor of it from governors rutledge and jefferson and general gates the latter is directed to be made a subject of a court of inquiry and general washington is to send a successor into the southern department the new arrangement of the army sent to the general for his revision has brought from him many judicious and valuable observations on the subject which with the arrangement are in the hands of a committee james madison ocr   th    0

which i have found you too punctual to doubt has been illegible the best news i have to give you is contained in the enclosed paper in a letter from eustatia which comes from a person known to many gentlemen here who say it may be fully credited the saratoga a continental vessel of    guns is just returned from a cruise on which she took several jamaica prizes with a prodigious quantity of rum  sugar on board she parted from them in a fog near the coast and as they have not yet been heard of it is feared they have fallen back into the possession of the enemy    baron stuben just come to town brings a report that an embarkation left n york on thursday but no confirmation has yet arrived from gl washington or any other official source adieu by a letter just recd from the continental agt as stated by the commercial committee the capture of the british fleet by the spaniards is brought pretty nearly to certainty instructions to john jay cont cong  boundaries and free navigation of the mississippi  oct       0 the committee appointed to draught a letter to the ministers plenipotentiary at the courts of versailles and madrid explaining the reasons and principles on which the instructions to mr jay of the  th inst are founded report the following to mr jay a copy of which with the resolution directing the draught to be also inclosed to dr franklin sir congress having in their instructions of the  th inst directed you to adhere strictly to their former instructions relating to the boundaries of the united states to insist on the navigation of the mississippi for the citizens of the united states in common with the subjects of his catholic majesty as also on a free port or ports below the northern limit of w florida  accessible to merchant ships for the use of the former and being sensible of the influence which these claims on the part of the united states may have on your negotiations with the court of madrid have thought it expedient to explain the reasons and principles on    which the same are founded that you may be enabled to satisfy that court of the equity and justice of their intentions with respect to the first of these articles by which the river miss is fixed as the boundary between the spanish settlements and the united states it is unnecessary to take notice of any pretentions founded on priority of discovery of occupancy or on conquest it is sufficient that by the definitive treaty of paris      art   all the territory now claimed by the united states was expressly and irrevocably ceded to the king of g britain—and that the united states are in consequence of revolution in their government entitled to the benefits of that cession the first of these positions is proved by the treaty itself to prove the last it must be observed that it is a fundamental principle in all lawful governments and particularly in the constitution of the british empire that all the rights of sovereignty are intended for the benefit of those from whom they are derived and over whom they are exercised it is known also to have been held for an inviolable principle by the united states whilst they remained a part of the british empire that the sovereignty of the king of england with all the rights  powers included in it did not extend to them in virtue of his being acknowledged and obeyed as king by the people of england or of any other part of the empire but in virtue of his being acknowledged and obeyed as king by the people of america themselves and that this principle was the basis first of their opposition to and finally of their abolition of his authority over them from these principles it results that all the territory lying within the limits of the states as fixed by the sovereign himself was held by him for their particular benefit and must equally with other rights and claims in quality of their sovereign be considered as having devolved on them in consequence of their resumption of the sovereignty to themselves in support of this position it may be further observed that all the territorial rights of the king of g britain within the limits of the united states accrued to him from the enterprises the risks the sacrifices the expence in blood and treasure of the present inhabitants and their progenitors if in latter times expences and exertions have been borne by any other part of the    empire in their immediate defence it need only be recollected that the ultimate object of them was the general security and advantage of the empire that a proportionate share was borne by the states themselves and that if this had not been the case the benefits resulting from an exclusive enjoyment of their trade have been an abundant compensation equity and justice therefore perfectly coincide in the present instance with political and constitutional principles no objection can be pretended against what is here said except that the king of g britain was at the time of the rupture with his catholic majesty possessed of certain parts of the territory in question and consequently that his c m had and still has a right to regard them as lawful objects of conquest in answer to this objection it is to be considered  st that these possessions are few in number and confined to small spots   that a right founded on conquest being only coextensive with the objects of conquest cannot comprehend the circumjacent territory   that if a right to the said territory depended on the conquest of the british posts within it the united states have already a more extensive claim to it than spain can acquire having by the success of their arms obtained possession of all the important posts and settlements on the illinois and wabash rescued the inhabitants from british domination and established civil government in its proper form over them they have moreover established a post on a strong and commanding situation near the mouth of the ohio whereas spain has a claim by conquest to no post above the northern bounds of w florida except that of natches nor are there any other british posts below the mouth of the ohio for their arms to be employed against   that whatever extent ought to be ascribed to the right of conquest it must be admitted to have limitations which in the present case exclude the pretentions of his catholic majesty by the king of g britain if the occupation of posts within the limits of the united states as defined by charters derived from the said king when constitutionally authorised to grant them makes them lawful objects of conquest to any other power than the united states it follows that every other part of the united states that is now or may hereafter fall into the hands of the enemy is equally an object of    conquest not only n york long island  the other islands in its vicinity but almost the entire states of s carolina and georgia might by the interposition of a foreign power at war with their enemy be forever severed from the american confederacy and subjected to a foreign yoke but is such a doctrine consonant to the rights of nations or the sentiments of humanity does it breathe that spirit of concord and amity which is the aim of the proposed alliance with spain would it be admitted by spain herself if it affected her own dominions were for example a british armament by a sudden enterprise to get possession of a sea port a trading town or maritime province in spain and another power at war with britain should before it could be reconquered by spain wrest it from the hands of britain would spain herself consider it as an extinguishment of her just pretentions or would any impartial nation consider it in that light the right of the united states to western territory as far as the mississippi having been shewn there are sufficient reasons for them to insist on that right as well as for spain not to wish a relinquishment of it in the first place the river mississippi be a more natural more distinguishable and more precise boundary than any other that can be drawn eastwardly of it and consequently will be less liable to become a source of those disputes which too often proceed from uncertain boundaries between nations secondly it ought to be conceeded that although the vacant territory adjacent to the mississippi should be relinquished by the united states to spain yet the fertility of its soil and its convenient situation for trade might be productive of intrusions by the citizens of the former which their great distance would render it difficult to restrain and which might lead to an interruption of that harmony which it is so much to the interest and wish of both should be perpetual thirdly as this territory be within the charter limits of particular states and is considered by them as no less their property than other territory within their limits congress could not relinquish it with out exciting discussions between themselves  these states concerning their respective rights and powers which    might greatly embarrass the public councils of the united states and give advantage to the common enemy fourthly the territory in question contains a number of inhabitants who are at present under the protection of the united states and have sworn allegiance to them these could not by voluntary transfer be subjected to a foreign jurisdiction without manifest violation of the common rights of mankind and of the genius and principles of the american governments fifthly in case the obstinacy and pride of g britain should for any length of time continue an obstacle to peace a cession of this territory rendered of so much value to the united states by its particular situation would deprive them of one of the material funds on which they rely for pursuing the war against her on the part of spain this territorial fund is not needed for and perhaps could not be applied to the purposes of the war and from its situation is otherwise of much less value to her than to the united states congress have the greater hopes that the pretentions of his catholic majesty on this subject will not be so far urged as to prove an insuperable obstacle to an alliance with the united states because they conceive such pretentions to be incompatible with the treaties subsisting between france and them which are to be the basis and substance of it by art    of the treaty of alliance eventual and defensive the possessions of the united states are guarantied to them by his most ils majesty by art    of the same treaty intended to fix more precisely the sense and application of the preceeding article it is declared that this guarantee shall have its full force and effect the moment a rupture shall take place between france and england all the possessions therefore belonging to the united states at the time of that rupture which being prior to the rupture between spain and england must be prior to all claims of conquest by the former are guarantied to them by his most ils majesty now that in the possessions thus guarantied was meant by the contracting parties to be included all the territory within the limits assigned to the united states by the treaty of paris may be inferred from art   of the treaty above mentioned which declares that if the united states should think fit to attempt the reduction of the british power remaining    in the northern parts of america on the islands of bermudas c those countries shall in case of success be considered with or dependent upon the united states for if it had not been understood by the parties that the western territory in question known to be of so great importance to the united states and a reduction of it so likely to be attempted by them was included in the general guarantee can it be supposed that no notice would have been taken of it when the parties extended their views not only to canada but to the remote  unimportant islands of bermudas it is true these acts between france and the united states are in no respect obligatory on his catholic majesty until he shall think fit to accede to them yet as they shew the sense of his most ils majesty on this subject with whom his c m is intimately allied as it is in pursuance of an express reservation to his c m in a secret act subjoined to the treaties aforesaid of a power to accede to those treaties that the present overtures are made on the part of the united states and as it is particularly stated in that act that any conditions which his c m shall think fit to add are to be analogous to the principal aim of the alliance and conformable to the rules of equality reciprocity  friendship congress entertains too high an oppinion of the equity moderation  wisdom of his c m not to suppose that when joined to these considerations they will prevail against any mistaken views of interest that may be suggested to him the next object of the instruction is the free navigation of the mississippi for the citizens of the united states in common with the subjects of his c m on this subject the same inference may be made from art   of the treaty of paris which stipulates this right in the amplest manner to the king of g britain and the devolution of it to the united states as was applied to their territorial claims of the latter nor can congress hesitate to believe that even if no such right could be inferred from that treaty that the generosity of his c m would suffer the inhabitants of these states to be put into a worse condition in this respect by their alliance with him in the character of a sovereign people than they were when subjects of a power who was always ready to turn their force against his majesty especially as one of the great objects of the proposed    alliance is to give greater effect to the common exertions for disarming that power of the faculty of disturbing others besides as the united states have an indisputable right to the possession of the east bank of the mississippi for a very great distance and the navigation of that river will essentially tend to the prosperity and advantage of the citizens of the united states that may reside on the mississippi or the waters running into it it is conceived that the circumstance of spains being in possession of the banks on both sides near the mouth cannot be deemed a natural or equitable bar to the free use of the river such a principle would authorize a nation disposed to take advantage of circumstances to contravene the clear indications of nature and providence and the general good of mankind the usage of nations accordingly seems in such cases to have given to those holding the mouth or lower parts of a river no right against those above them except the right of imposing a moderate toll and that on the equitable supposition that such toll is due for the expence and trouble the former may have been put to an innocent passage says vattel is due to all nations with whom a state is at peace and this duty comprehends troops equally with individuals if a right to a passage by land through other countries may be claimed for troops which are employed in the destruction of mankind how much more may a passage by water be claimed for commerce which is beneficial to all nations here again it ought not to be concealed that the inconvenience that must be felt by the inhabitants on the waters running westwardly under an exclusion from the use of the mississippi would be a constant and increasing source of disquietude on their part of more rigerous precautions on the part of spain and of an irritation on both parts which it is equally to the interest and duty of both to guard against but notwithstanding the equitable claim of the united states to the free navigation of the mississippi and its great importance to them congress have so strong a disposition to conform to the desires of his c m that they have agreed that such equitable regulations may be entered into as may be a requisite security    against contraband provided the point of right be not relinquished and a free port or ports below the   st degree of n l and accessible to merchant ships be stipulated to them the reason why a port or ports as thus described was required must be obvious without such a stipulation the free use of the mississippi would in fact amount to no more than a free intercourse with new orleans and the other ports of louisiana from the rapid current of this river it is well known that it must be navigated by vessels of a peculiar construction and which will be unfit to go to sea unless therefore some place be assigned to the u s where the produce carried down the river and the merchandise returning from abroad may be reposited till they can be respectively taken away by the proper vessels there can be no such thing as a foreign trade there is a remaining consideration respecting the navigation of the mississippi which deeply concerns the maritime powers in general but more particularly their most ils and catholic majesties the country watered by the ohio with its large branches having their sources near the lakes on one side and those running n westward and falling into it on the other side will appear from a single glance on a map to be of vast extent the circumstance of it being so finely watered added to the singular fertility of its soil and the other advantages presented by a new country will occasion a rapidity of population not easily conceived the spirit of emigration has already shewn itself in a very strong degree notwithstanding the many impediments which discourage it the principal of these impediments is the war with britain which can not spare a force sufficient to protect the emigrants against the incursions of the savages in a very few years after peace shall take place this country will certainly be overspread with inhabitants in like manner as in all other new settlements agriculture not manufactures will be their employment they will raise wheat corn beef pork tobacco hemp flax and in the southern parts perhaps rice and indigo in great quantities on the other hand their consumption of foreign manufactures will be in proportion if they can be exchanged for the produce of their soil there are but two channels through which such commerce can be carried on the first is on the river mississippi—the  0 other is up the rivers having their sources near the lakes thence by short portages to the lakes or the rivers falling into them and thence through the lakes and down the st lawrence the first of these channels is manifestly the most natural and by far the most advantageous should it however be obstructed the second will be found far from an impracticable if no obstructions should be thrown in its course down the mississippi the exports from this immense tract of country will not only supply an abundance of all necessaries for the w indies islands but serve for a valuable basis of general trade of which the rising spirit of commerce in france  spain will no doubt particularly avail itself the imports will be proportionally extensive and from the climate as well as other causes will consist in a great degree of the manufactures of the same countries on the other hand should obstruction on the mississippi force this trade into a contrary direction through canada france and spain and the other maritime powers will not only lose the immediate benefit of it to themselves but they will also suffer by the advantage it will give to g britain so fair a prospect should not escape the commercial sagacity of this nation she would embrace it with avidity she would cherish it with most studious care and should she succeed in fixing it in that channel the loss of her exclusive possession of the trade of the united states might prove a much less decisive blow to her maritime preeminence and tyranny than has been calculated the last clause of the instructions respecting the navigation of the waters running out of georgia through west florida not being included in the ultimatum nor claimed on a footing of right requires nothing to be added to what it speaks itself the utility of the privilege asked to the state of georgia and consequently to the union is apparent from the geographic representation of the country the motives for spain to grant it must be found in her equity generosity and disposition to cultivate our friendship and intercourse these observations you will readily discern are not communicated in order to be urged in all events and as they here stand in support of the claims to which they relate they are intended for your private information and use and are to be urged so far    and in such form only as will best suit the temper and sentiments of the court at which you reside and best fulfil the object of them james madison october       0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia october       0 dear sir— congress have felt a becoming resentment of the barbarous treatment of the gentlemen in captivity at charleston and have directed general washington to require of clinton an explanation of the matter nothing has yet been done in consequence of it except an application to clinton which as he had at that time not been officially informed of the fact he evaded by general assurances of the humanity c of cornwallis general washington had very luckily between the application and the answer received two of the earls bloody proclamations which he very handsomely communicated to sir henry james madison november    0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia november    0 dear sir— many attempts have been made to bring the vermont dispute to an issue but the diversity of opinions that prevail on one side and the dilatory artifices employed on the other have frustrated them all the evidence has been heard and the proposition for including it within the jurisdiction of some one of the states debated for some time but the decision was suspended an arrangement of the    army founded on general washingtons letter has passed congress and is now with the general for his observations on it it includes a recommendation to the states to fill up their quotas no arrangement of the civil departments has taken place a new medical system has been passed shippen is again at the head of it craig and cochran have not been forgotten the instructions relating to the mississippi have passed entirely to my satisfaction a committee is now preparing a statement of the reasons and principles on which they stand james madison november      0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia november      0 dear sir— doctor lee and mr izard particularly the latter have been here sometime and i believe are not very reserved in their reflections on the venerable philosopher at the court of versailles mr izard i understand is particularly open in his charges against him doctor lee on his arrival applied to congress for a hearing on the subject of mr deans allegations if any doubt remained of the falsehood and malice of them but nothing final has been done as yet in consequence of it i have had great anxiety lest the flame of faction which on a former occasion proved so injurious should be kindled anew but as far as i can judge the temper of congress is in general by no means prone to it although there may be individuals on both sides who would both wish and endeavour it    congress have just finished an estimate of supplies for the ensuing year requiring of the states the value of six millions of dollars in specie the principal part of the requisition consists of specific articles the residue of specie or the new emissions receivable as specie if the states fulfil this plan punctually there is no doubt that we shall go smoothly through another campaign and if they would forbear recurring to state emissions and certificates in procuring the supplies it may become a permanent and effectual mode of carrying on the war but past experience will not permit our expectations to be very sanguine the collection and transportation of specific supplies must necessarily be tedious and subject to casualties and the proceedings of separate popular bodies must add greatly to the uncertainty and delay the expense attending the mode is of itself a sufficient objection to it if money could by any possible device be provided in due quantity the want of this article is the source of all our public difficulties and misfortunes one or two millions of guineas properly applied would diffuse vigor and satisfaction throughout the whole military departments and would expel the enemy from every part of the united states it would also have another good effect it would reconcile the army and everybody else to our republican forms of government the principal inconveniences which are imputed to them being really the fruit of defective revenues what other states effect by money we are obliged to pursue by dilatory and indigested expedients which benumb all our operations    and expose our troops to numberless distresses if these were well paid well fed and well clothed they would be well satisfied and would fight with more success and this might and would be as well effected by our governments as by any other if they possessed money enough as in our moneyless situation the same embarrassments would have been experienced by any government james madison nov       0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philada nov       0 dear sir— your favor of the  th inst came to hand yesterday mr griffin by whom you appear also to have written has not yet arrived it gives me great pleasure to find that the enemys numbers are so much less formidable than was at first computed but the information from n york makes it not improbable that the blank in the computation may shortly be filled up genl washington wrote to congress on the  th inst that another embarkation was going on at that place and in another letter of the  th he says that although he had received no further intelligence on the subject he had reason still to believe that such a measure was in contemplation neither the amount nor the object of it however had been ascertained the inroads of the enemy on the frontier of n york have been distressing  wasteful almost beyond their own example they have totally laid in ashes a fine settlement called schoarie which was capable    genl washington says of yielding no less than  0000 bushels of grain for public consumption such a loss is inestimable and is the more to be regretted because both local circumstances and the energy of that govt left little doubt that it would have been applied to public use i fancy the taking of quebec was a mere invention your letter gave me the first account of such a report a different report concerning the  d division of the french fleet has sprung up as you will see by the enclosed paper it is believed here by many and some attention given to it by all it is also said that rodney has sailed from n york with  0 ships for europe if he has sailed at all  the first report be true also it is more likely that he has gone out to meet the french the late exchange has liberated abt   0 officers  all our privates at n y amounting to     g washington has acceded to a proposal of a further exchange of the convention officers without attaching any privates to them which will liberate almost the whole residue of our officers at that place i am sir etc james madison november       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia november       0 dear sir— i do not learn that any of the states are particularly attentive to prevent the evils arising from certificates and emissions from their own    treasury although they are unquestionably the bane of every salutary arrangement of the public finances when the estimate for the ensuing year was on the anvil in congress i proposed a recommendation to the states to discontinue the use of them and particularly in providing the specific articles required it met however with so cool a reception that i did not much urge it the objection against it was that the practice was manifestly repugnant to the spirit of the acts of congress respecting finance and if these were disregarded no effect could be expected from any additional recommendations the letters from general washington and the commissary general for some time past give a most alarming picture of the state and prospects of the magazines applications to the contiguous states on the subject have been repeated from every quarter till they seem to have lost all their force whether any degree of danger and necessity will rouse them to provide for the winter season now hastening upon us i am unwilling to decide because my fears dictate the worst the inroads of the enemy on the frontier of new york have been most fatal to us in this respect they have almost totally ruined that fine wheat country which was able and from the energy of their government was most likely to supply magazines of flour both to the main army and to the northwestern posts the settlement of schoharie which alone was able to furnish according to a letter from general washington eighty thousand bushels of grain for the public use has been totally laid in ashes    i make no apology for inaccuracies and bad writing because you know the manner in which we are obliged to write for the post and having been prevented by company from doing anything last night i am particularly hurried this morning james madison november       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia november       0 dear sir— i am glad to find you have at last got a house of delegates and have made so auspicious a beginning as an unanimous vote to fill up our line for the war this is a measure which all the states ought to have begun with i wish there may not be some that will not be prevailed on even to end with it it is much to be regretted that you are not in a condition to discontinue another practice equally destructive with temporary enlistments unless an end can by some means or other be put to state emission and certificates they must prove the bane of every salutary regulation the depreciation in this place has lately run up as high as one hundred for one and it cannot be satisfactorily accounted for on any other principle than the substitution of certificates in the payment of those taxes which were intended to reduce its quantity and keep up a demand for it the immediate cause of this event is said to have been the sudden conversion of a large quantity of paper into specie by some tories lately    ordered into exile by this state it is at present on the fall and i am told the merchants have associated to bring it down and fix it at    the fate of the new money is as yet suspended there is but too much reason however to fear that it will follow the fate of the old according to the arrangement now in force it would seem impossible for it to rise above one for forty the resolutions of congress which establish that relation between the two kinds of paper must destroy the equality of the new with specie unless the old can be kept down at forty for one in new jersey i am told the legislature has lately empowered the executive to regulate the exchange between the two papers according to the exchange between the old and the new in order to preserve the equality of the latter with specie the issue of this experiment is of consequence and may throw light perhaps on our paper finance the only infallible remedy whilst we cannot command specie for the pecuniary embarrassments we labor under will after all be found to be a punctual collection of the taxes required by congress i hope you will not forget to call the attention of the assembly as early as the preparations for defence will admit to the means of ratifying the confederation nor to remind it of the conditions which prudence requires should be annexed to any territorial cession that may be agreed on i do not believe there is any serious design in congress to gratify the avidity of land mongers but the best security for their virtue in this respect will be to keep it out of    their power they have been much infested since you left us with memorials from these people who appear to be equally alarmed and perplexed mr g morgan as agent for the indiana claimants after memorializing congress on the subject has honored the virginia delegates with a separate attention he very modestly proposes to them a reference of the controversy between the company and virginia to arbitration in the mode pointed out in the confederation for adjusting disputes between state and state we have given him for answer that as the state we represent had finally determined the question we could not with any propriety attend to his proposition observing at the same time that if we were less precluded we could not reconcile with the sovereignty and honor of the state an appeal from its own jurisdiction to a foreign tribunal in a controversy with private individuals james madison novr         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philada novr         dear sir— your favor of the   th came safe yesterday the past week has brought forth very little of consequence except the disagreeable and i fear certain information of the arrival of the cape fleet our last account of the embarkation at n york was that the ships had fallen down to the hook that the number of troops was quite unknown as well as their destination except in general that it was southwardly it is still said that philips is to command  00 this detachment if the projected junction between leslie  cornwallis had not been so opportunely frustrated by the gallant volunteers at kings mountain it is probable that philips would have reinforced the former as the great force in his rear would otherwise have rendered every advance hazardous at present it seems more likely that the declining state of their southern affairs will call their attention to that quarter they can it is well known regain at any time their present footing in virginia if it should be thought expedient to abandon it or to collect in their forces to a defensible point but every retrograde step they take towards charleston proves fatal to their general plan m j adams in a letter of the   d of augst from amsterdam received yesterday says that gen prevost had sailed from england with a few frigates for cape fear in order to facilitate the operations of their arms in n carolina and that the ministry were determined to make the southern states the scene of a very active winter campaign no intimation is given by mr adams of the number of troops under genl prevost the  d division of the french fleet mentioned in my last to have been off the bermudas has not yet made its appearance it is now rather supposed to have been a british one the death of genl woodford is announced in a n york paper of the   th i have not seen the paper but am told that no particulars are mentioned i suppose it will reach his friends before this will be recd through some other channel adieu  0  james madison november       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia november       0 dear sir— i informed you some time ago that the instructions to mr jay had passed congress in a form which was entirely to my mind i since informed you that a committee was preparing a letter to him explanatory of the principles and objects of the instructions this letter also passed in a form equally satisfactory i did not suppose that any thing further would be done on the subject at least till further intelligence should arrive from mr jay it now appears that i was mistaken the delegates from georgia and south carolina apprehensive that a uti possidetis may be obtruded on the belligerent powers by the armed neutrality in europe and hoping that the accession of spain to the alliance will give greater concert and success to the military operations that may be pursued for the recovery of their states and likewise add weight to the means that may be used for obviating a uti possidetis have moved for a reconsideration of the instructions in order to empower mr jay in case of necessity to yield to the claims of spain in consideration of her guaranteeing our independence and affording us a handsome subsidy the expediency of such a motion is further urged from the dangerous negotiations now on foot by british emissaries for detaching spain from the war wednesday last was assigned for the consideration of this motion  0  and it has continued the order of the day ever since without being taken up what the fate of it will be i do not predict but whatever its own fate may be it must do mischief in its operation it will not probably be concealed that such a motion has been made and supported and the weight which our demands would derive from unanimity and decision must be lost i flatter myself however that congress will see the impropriety of sacrificing the acknowledged limits and claims of any state without the express concurrence of such state obstacles enough will be thrown in the way of peace if it is to be bid for at the expense of particular members of the union the eastern states must on the first suggestion take the alarm for their fisheries if they will not support other states in their rights they cannot expect to be supported themselves when theirs come into question in this important business which so deeply affects the claims and interests of virginia and which i know she has so much at heart i have not the satisfaction to harmonize in sentiment with my colleague   0  he has embraced an opinion that we have no just claim to the subject in controversy between us and spain and that it is the interest of virginia not to adhere to it under this impression he drew up a letter to the executive to be communicated to the legislature stating in general the difficulty congress might be under and calling their attention to a revision of their instructions to their delegates on the subject i was obliged to object to such a step and in order to prevent it observed that the instructions  0  were given by the legislature of virginia on mature consideration of the case and on a supposition that spain would make the demands she has done that no other event has occurred to change the mind of our constituents but the armed neutrality in europe and the successes of the enemy to the southward which are as well known to them as to ourselves that we might every moment expect a third delegate here who would either adjust or decide the difference in opinion between us and that whatever went from the delegation would then go in its proper form and have its proper effect that if the instructions from virginia were to be revised and their ultimatum reduced it could not be concealed in so populous an assembly and that every thing which our minister should be authorized to yield would be insisted on that mr jays last despatches encouraged us to expect that spain would not be inflexible if we were so that we might every day expect to have more satisfactory information from him that finally if it should be thought expedient to listen to the pretensions of spain it would be best before we took any decisive step in the matter to take the counsel of those who best know the interests and have the greatest influence on the opinions of our constituents that as you were both a member of congress and of the legislature and were now with the latter you would be an unexceptionable medium for effecting this and that i would write to you for the purpose by the first safe conveyance these objections had not the weight with my  0  colleague which they had with me he adhered to his first determination and has i believe sent the letter abovementioned by mr walker who will i suppose soon forward it to the governor you will readily conceive the embarrassments this affair must have cost me all that i have to ask of you is that if my refusing to concur with my colleague in recommending to the legislature a revision of their instructions should be misconstrued by any you will be so good as to place it in its true light and if you agree with me as to the danger of giving express power to concede or the inexpediency of conceding that you will consult with gentlemen of the above description and acquaint me with the result i need not observe to you that the alarms with respect to the inflexibility of spain in her demands the progress of british intrigues at madrid and the danger of the uti possidetis may with no small probability be regarded as artifices for securing her object on the mississippi mr adams in a late letter from amsterdam a copy of which has been enclosed to the governor supposes that the pretended success of the british emissaries at madrid is nothing but a ministerial finesse to facilitate the loans and keep up the spirits of the people this will be conveyed by col grayson who has promised to deliver it himself or if any thing unforeseen should prevent his going to richmond to put it into such hands as will equally ensure its safe delivery  0  james madison november       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia november       0 dear sir— yours of the eighteenth came yesterday i am glad to find the legislature persist in their resolution to recruit their line of the army for the war though without deciding on the expediency of the mode under their consideration would it not be as well to liberate and make soldiers at once of the blacks themselves as to make them instruments for enlisting white soldiers  it would certainly be more consonant  0  to the principles of liberty which ought never to be lost sight of in a contest for liberty and with white officers and a majority of white soldiers no imaginable danger could be feared from themselves as there certainly could be none from the effect of the example on those who should remain in bondage experience having shewn that a freedman immediately loses all attachment and sympathy with his former fellowslaves we have enclosed to the governor a copy of an act of the legislature of connecticut ceding some of their territorial claims to the united states which he will doubtless communicate to the assembly they reserve the jurisdiction to themselves and clog the cession with some other conditions which greatly depreciate it and are the more extraordinary as their title to the land is so controvertible a one the association of the merchants for fixing the depreciation seems likely to prove a salutary measure it reduced it from  0 and  00 to    at once which is its present current rate although it is observed that many of the retailers elude the force of it by raising the price in hard money james madison decr  th    0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philada decr  th    0 dr sr—

melancholy picture of the effects of the late tempest martinique has suffered very considerably both in shipping  people not less than  00 houses have been destroyed in st vincents the spaniards in

system has taken place in their military policy we had letters yesterday from mr jay and mr carmichael as late as the fourth and ninth of september mr jay informs us that it is absolutely     necessary to cease drawing bills on him that   0000 dollars to be repaid in three years with some aid in clothing c is all that the court will advance for us the general tenor of the letters is that our affairs there make little progress that the court is rather backward that the navigation of the mississippi is likely to prove a very serious difficulty that spain has herself been endeavouring to borrow a large sum in france on which she meant to issue a paper currency that the terms and means used by her displeased mr neckar who in consequence threw such discouragements on it as in turn were not very pleasing to the spanish minister that mr cumberland is still at madrid laboring in concert with other secret emissaries of britain to give unfavorable impressions of our affairs that he is permitted to keep up a correspondence by his couriers with london that if negotiations for peace should be instituted this winter as spain has not yet taken a decided part with regard to america england will probably choose to make madrid rather than versailles the seat of it however unfavorable many of these particulars may appear it is the concurrent representation of the above ministers that our disappointment of pecuniary succor at madrid is to be imputed to the want of ability and not of inclination to supply us that the steadiness of his catholic majesty is entirely confided in by the french ambassador and that the mysterious conduct of mr cumberland and of the court of spain towards him seems to excite no uneasiness in the ambassador the letters add     that on the pressing remonstrances of france and spain portugal had agreed to shut her ports against english prizes but that she persisted in her refusal to accede to the armed neutrality the receipt of the foregoing intelligence has awakened the attention of the georgia delegates to their motion of which i informed you particularly by col grayson it has lain ever since it was made undisturbed on the table this morning is assigned for the consideration of it and i expect it will without fail be taken up i do not believe congress will adopt it without the express concurrence of all the states immediately interested both my principles and my instructions will determine me to oppose it virginia and the united states in general are too deeply interested in the subject of controversy to give it up as long as there is a possibility of retaining it and i have ever considered the mysterious and reserved behaviour of spain particularly her backwardness in the article of money as intended to alarm us into concessions rather than as the effect of a real indifference to our fate or to any alliance with us i am very anxious notwithstanding to have an answer to my letter by grayson james madison december       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia december       0 dear sir— agreeably to your favor of the second instant which came to hand yesterday i shall send     this to fredericksburg i am sorry that either your own health or that of your lady should oblige you to leave the legislature before the principal business of the session is finished i shall be more sorry if either of these causes should disappoint my hopes of your return to philadelphia at the promised time i am the more anxious for your return because i suppose it will supersede the proposed measure of sending an envoy to congress on the business you mention if the facts are transmitted by the speaker of the assembly or the executive may they not be laid before congress with as much efficacy by the established representatives of the state as by a special messenger and will not the latter mode in some measure imply a distrust in the former one and lower us in the eyes of congress and the public the application to the court of france has been anticipated congress have even gone so far as to appoint an envoy extraordinary to solicit the necessary aids colonel laurens was invested yesterday with that office i leave the measure to your own reflection how far it may be expedient to urge spain to assist us before she is convinced of the reasonableness of our pretensions ought to be well weighed before it be tried the liberty we took in drawing on her for money excited no small astonishment and probably gave an idea of our distress which confirmed her hopes of concession on our part accounts received since my last repeat her inflexibility with regard to the object  in question between us it is indispensable     that we should in some way or other know the ultimate sense of our constituents on this important matter mr laurens is certainly in captivity an irish paper tells us he was committed to the tower on the sixth of october under a warrant from the three secretaries of state portugal has acceded to the neutral league so far as to exclude the english from the privileges her armed vessels have hitherto enjoyed in her ports the ariel with paul jones and the clothing c on board was dismasted a day or two after she sailed and obliged to put back into port if general washington detaches no further aid to the southward it will be owing to the reduction of his force by the expiration of enlistments the pennsylvania line is mostly engaged for the war and will soon form almost the whole of the army under his immediate command mr sartine it seems has been lately removed from the administration of the naval department in consequence of his disappointing the general hopes formed from the great means put into his hands when it was mentioned to me by mr marbois i took occasion to ask whether the deception with regard to the second division ought to be ultimately charged upon him observing to him the use the enemies of the alliance had made of that circumstance from the explanation that was given i believe the blame rests upon his head and that his removal was the effect of it in a great measure though it is possible he may like many others have been sacrificed     to ideas of policy and particularly in order to cancel the unfavorable impression which the disappointment left on america a high character is given as might be expected of his successor the marquis de castries particularly with respect to those qualities in which mr sartine is charged with having been most deficient james madison december       0 philadelphia joseph jones to joseph jones  philadelphia december       0 dear sir— yours of the eighth instant came to hand yesterday i was sorry to find the assembly had not then taken up the recommendation of congress on the subject of the western lands its being postponed so late will i fear prevent the result of their deliberations from being communicated to maryland before the rising of their legislature in which case much time must be lost unless their delegates be authorized to accede to the confederation on a cession satisfactory to themselves—a liberality of proceeding hardly to be expected from that state after the jealousy and reserve it has shown i am no less sorry to find so little progress made in the plan for levying soldiers the regular force for the southern department must be principally it seems contributed by virginia the north carolina assembly having broken up without making any effectual provision of that sort one would have supposed that the fatiguing service exacted of the militia in that     state would have greatly facilitated such a measure and yet that is assigned as the obstacle to its practicability i wish anxiously to hear from you on the subject stated in my letter by grayson and in my subsequent one by the post circumstances which i do not choose unnecessarily to hazard by the post have made it expedient to lay the matter before the assembly that their former instructions may not be invalidated by a supposed effect of a change of situation or may be rescinded if real this went by w jones esquire on his return to north carolina who i suppose will not be at richmond till nearly christmas i wish it could have reached the assembly before your leaving it james madison decr       0 philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philada decr       0 dear sir— you preserve your character for punctuality so well that i always have the pleasure to begin with acknowledging the receipt of a favor from you that of the    instant came to hand yesterday as the sufferings of your militia are ascribed to the conduct of their commanding officer i hope the disgust will be only local a general disgust would be a very serious misfortune we are informed from good authority that an embarkation is taking place at n york from the number of regiments  corps mentioned it probably consists of about  000 troops knyphausen  philips     it is said are to have the command of them their course will without doubt be directed to the southern states we have a probable story from the southward corroborated by a paper from n york that tarlton has had an encounter with sumpter in which he lost upwards of  00 men including the wounded  received a mortal wound himself sumpter is said also to have been wounded but slightly and to have lost one man only the personal wound of tarlton is omitted in the n y paper but his loss otherwise is represented as greater than our own account makes it i am dr sr yrs sincerely james madison decr       0

situation to which i shall pay the necessary attention but cannot undertake to predict certain success the danish declaration with the step taken in consequence by the ct of london mentioned in the inclosed are the chief news of this week there is a report that arnold is gone up the sound with  000 troops towards n london wishing you the compliments of the season i am dr sr yours sincerely     james madison jany  d      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philada jany  d      dear sir— yesterdays post was the first that has failed to bring me a line from you since our correspondence commenced i hope it has not been owing to any cause which concerns your health we had it yesterday from under genl washingtons hand that another embarkation is actually departed from n york among torn to abt   00 troops there is little  torn that they will steer the same course with the preceding detachment congress are under great anxiety for the states ags which this accommodating force is to be directed and the more so as the principal means of their defence is so little in their power it is not so much the want of men as the want of subsistence arms  clothing which results from the want of money that gives the greatest alarm a disposition appears to do every thing practicable for their relief and defence mr harrison writes from cadiz that the combined fleets in that port including    ships from the w indies under guichen amounted to    ships of the line he offers no conjecture as to the manner in which they will be employed i am dr sir yrs sincerely james madison

recovery and particularly so of my mothers whose attack was unknown to me till the receipt of my fathers letter the inclosed papers will give you the late proceedings of congs more fully tho often very incorrectly than could be done in a letter the excise on spirits distilled in the country will probably take place in fact considering the aversion to direct taxes  that the imports are already loaded i see nothing else that can be done besides the duty on imported rum requires a proportional one on country rum  this a duty on other spirits the tax will i presume be so guarded as to operate on stills according to the quantity really distilled i have recd a letter from mr maury which says that the market of europe is very full of tobo  recommends it to me to save as much as possible on leaving home i desired my father to pay majr lee the sum due from me i shd have left the comission in your hands if you had been in the way being apprehensive that some delicacy might arise from unsettled transactions between him  my father i find accordingly that this has happened  that majr lee refuses the paymt on yt account i wish you to pay him if possible as i intended  promised tell capt dade that gen knox has not yet reported on his case  that i will let him know the event of his claim as soon as it happens adieu yrs affy   0 james madison january  th      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia january  th      dear sir— i have again the pleasure to begin with acknowledging the receipt of a favor from you that of the first having come to han yesterday on thursday last congress was informed by general potts and colonel johnston who came expresses for the purpose that a general mutiny had broken out on the morning of the new years day in the pennsylvania line which was cantoned near morristown apart from the rest of the army every effort was made by the officers to stifle it in its infancy but without effect several of them fell victims to the fury of the mutineers the next information came from general wayne who wrote from princeton whither the troops had marched in regular order on their way to philadelphia as they gave out with a determination not to lay down their arms nor to return to their obedience till a redress of grievances should be obtained they suffered none of their officers to be among them except general wayne and colonels steuart and butler and these they kept under close guard but in every other respect treated with the utmost decorum the grievances complained of were principally the detention of many in service beyond the term of enlistment and the sufferings of all from a deficient supply of clothing and subsistence and the long arrearage of pay several propositions and replies on the subject of redress     passed between a deputation of sergeants in behalf of the troops and general wayne but without any certain tendency to a favorable issue the affair at length began to take a very serious countenance and as a great proportion of that line are foreigners and not a few deserters from the british army and as they showed a disposition to continue at princeton from whence a refuge with the enemy who it was said were coming out in force for the purpose was at any moment practicable it was thought necessary notwithstanding the humiliation of the step to depute a committee of congress with powers to employ every expedient for putting a speedy end to the discontents the president of the state with a number of gentlemen from this place went up to interpose their influence by a letter from the committee who had proceeded as far as trenton received the evening before last it appears that the president who was ahead and had written to general wayne was likely to have a confidential reception the committee write that an emissary of clinton who had appeared among the soldiers with a paper setting forth the folly and danger of adhering to a cause which had already brought so much misery upon them promising a protection under the british government a body of troops to cover their escape and the payment of all arrears due from congress was seized and given up to general wayne who handed him with his guide over to the president of this state who placed them under the custody of his lighthorse this circumstance not only presages a fortunate issue     to the mutiny but is such a proof of attachment to the country in the most trying situation as must effectually repress the joy and encouragement which the enemy had taken from this threatening event the late detachment from new york which a letter from fredericksburg says is in the chesapeake is about one thousand six hundred strong and commanded by arnold james madison january         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia january         dear sir— i was very glad at not being disappointed in my expectation of a favor from you by yesterdays post several reports in quick succession of the arrival and progress of the predatory band under arnold had rendered us exceedingly anxious to hear the truth and particulars of the matter some letters by the post tell us that the governor and baron steuben were wholly engaged in removing and securing the arms and ammunition if so he was better employed than in writing to congress on the subject which from his usual punctuality was expected the enterprise against richmond at this season was certainly an audacious one and strongly marks the character which directed it having been long sensible that the security of the country as high up as the tidewater reaches has been owing more to the ignorance and caution of the enemy than to its own strength or inaccessibleness i was much less astonished at the news than many     others to those who are strangers to the sparse manner in which that country is settled and the easy penetration afforded by its long navigable rivers the rapid and unopposed advances of the enemy appear unaccountable and our national character suffers imputations which are by no means due to it congress have yet received no official report of the result of the conciliatory measures taken with the revolted soldiers at trenton from oral and circumstantial evidence there is no doubt that they have been successful a discharge of a part from the service and a supply of clothing and money to the rest is the price of their submission this much considered in itself was required by justice and is consequently consistent with dignity but considered with respect to the circumstances attending the negotiation there is but too much ground to suspect that it will be attributed to our fears and is therefore not a little mortifying happily the example as we understand by a letter from general washington received yesterday had not infected the other parts of the army as the same causes however which engendered this malignant humour in the pennsylvania line are known to exist in the other lines we cannot be sure that the same effects will not yet take place in the latter unless they be speedily removed as one step towards it congress are endeavouring to profit by the alarm which this event must have excited in the states by calling upon them for the means of immediately furnishing some pay to the troops of their respective lines     you ask me what i think of the delegate extraordinary to congress  i wish you had told me what you think of such an appointment it is pretty certain i believe that people in general will not consider it as a proof of confidence in the ordinary delegation as mr jones who i believe possesses the confidence of his country and i am sure will have as much weight in congress as any man that will be sent on such an occasion will come about the same time and having attended the legislature will be as well informed in every point of view i cannot deny that the appointment appears to me to be at least a supernumerary one i wish the good effects of it may show that i am mistaken the trade of this city has just suffered a very severe blow no less than seven fine vessels have been taken out of an outward bound fleet and carried into new york the emissary from clinton and his guide were executed on saturday morning last     james madison jany         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philada jany         dear sir— i have nothing new this week for you but two reports the first is that very great discontents prevail in n york among the german troops for causes pretty similar to those which produced the eruption in the pennsylvania line it is further said on this head that a party of  00 have deserted from long island  gone to rhode island the other report is that the british minister either has or proposes to carry a bill into parliamt authorizing the commanding officer in america to permit  promote a trade with us in british goods of every kind except linens  woollens this change of system is said to be the advice of some notable refugees with a view to revive an intercourse as far as possible between the two countries  particularly to check the habit that is taking place in the consumption of french manufactures whatever their public views may be it is certain that such a plan would open fine prospects to them in a private view we have recd no fresh or certain information of the designs of f and spain in assembling so great a force at cadiz there does not appear to be any object in that quarter except gibraltar should the attempts be renewed agst that place it will prove that the former has not that absolute sway in the cabinet of the latter which has been generally imagined nothing would have prevailed on the french to recall their fleets from the islands at the time they did but the necessity of humouring spain on the subject of her hobby horse     i am glad to hear that arnold has been at last fired at it sounded a little unfavorably for us in the ears of the people here that he was likely to get off without that proof of a hostile reception if he ventures an irruption in any other quarter i hope he will be made sensible that his impunity on james river was owing to the suddenness of his appearance  not to the want of spirit in the people i am etc james madison feby      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  philadr feby      dr sir— i have your favor of the  th instant by the post col harrison arrived here yesterday and as he mentions no circumstance which indicated an intended departure of the enemy i am afraid your intelligence on that subject was not well founded immediately on the receipt of your former letter relating to an exchange of c taylor i applied to the admiralty department and if such a step can be brought about with propriety i hope he will be gratified but considering the tenor of their treatment of naval prisoners and the resolutions with which it has inspired congress i do not think it probable that exchanges will go on easily and if this were less the case a mere passenger under the indulgence too of a parole can scarcely hope to be preferred to such as are suffering the utmost hardships and even made prisoners in public service a vessel arrived here a few days ago from cadiz which brings letters of as late date as the last of decr those that are official tell us that england is making     the most strenuous exertions for the current year  that she is likely to be but too successful in the great article of money the parliament have voted   000 seamen and a considerable land reinforcement for their southern army in america is sd to be in preparation private letters by the same conveyance mention that the blockage of gibraltar is going on with alacrity and that the garrison is in such distress as flatters the hope of a speedy capitulation if mr pendleton your nephew is still with you be pleased to return him my compliments with great respect i am etc james madison april  rd      philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia april  rd      dear sir— the letter from the delegation by the last post informed you of the arrival of the stores here which were to have been delivered in virginia by one of the french ships the infinite importance of them to the state especially since the arrival of a reinforcement to arnold  of which we are just apprized by the marquis has determined the delegates to forward them by land without loss of time this will be attempted in the first instance in the     channel of the quartermasters department and if it cannot be effected in that mode without delay we propose to engage private wagons for the purpose on the credit of the state should the latter alternative be embraced i find it will be necessary to stipulate instantaneous payment from the treasury on the arrival of the wagons at richmond in specie or old continental currency to the real amount thereof i mention this circumstance that you may be prepared for it the expense of the transportation will be between five and six hundred pounds virginia money the exchange between specie and the old paper at present is about one hundred and thirtyfive for one the delegates having understood that the refugees taken by captain tilley on his return to newport from the chesapeake consisted chiefly of persons who formerly lived in virginia some of whom were traitors who deserved exemplary punishment and others vindictive enemies to the state thought proper     to make the inclosed application to the french minister by conversation i have since had with him on the subject i doubt whether it will be deemed consistent with their general rules of conduct to give up to be punished as malefactors any of the captives made by their fleet which does not serve like their land army as an auxiliary to the forces of the united states if these persons had been taken by their land forces which serve as auxiliaries under the commanderinchief it seems there would have been no difficulty in the case however the application will certainly prevent the exchange or release to which it refers if the executive think it expedient to do so on the least intimation i am persuaded the apostates would be even sent over to france and secured in the most effectual manner during the war perhaps this would not be amiss as being not our prisoners no use can be made of them in redeeming our citizens from captivity james madison april         philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia april         dear sir— the inclosed paper is a copy of a report  from a committee now lying on the table of congress   0 for consideration the delicacy and importance of the subject makes me wish for your judgment on it before it undergoes the final decision of congress the necessity of arming congress with coercive powers arises from the shameful deficiency of some of the states which are most capable of yielding their apportioned supplies and the military exactions to which others already exhausted by the enemy and our own troops are in consequence exposed without such powers too in the general government the whole confederacy may be insulted and the most salutary measures frustrated by the most inconsiderable state in the union at a time when all the other states were submitting to the loss and inconvenience of an embargo on their exports delaware absolutely declined coming into the measure and not only defeated the general object of it but enriched herself at the expense of those who did their duty the expediency however of making the proposed     application to the states will depend on the probability of their complying with it if they should refuse congress will be in a worse situation than at present for as the confederation now stands and according to the nature even of alliances much less intimate there is an implied right of coercion against the delinquent party and the exercise of it by congress whenever a palpable necessity occurs will probably be acquiesced in it may be asked perhaps by what means congress could exercise such a power if the states were to invest them with it as long as there is a regular army on foot a small detachment from it acting under civil authority would at any time render a voluntary contribution of supplies due from a state an eligible alternative but there is a still more easy and efficacious mode the situation of most of the states is such that two or three vessels of force     employed against their trade will make it their interest to yield prompt obedience to all just requisitions on them with respect to those states that have little or no foreign trade of their own it is provided that all inland trade with such states as supply them with foreign merchandize may be interdicted and the concurrence of the latter may be enforced in case of refusal by operations on their foreign trade there is a collateral reason which interests the states who are feeble in maritime resources in such a plan if a naval armament was considered as the proper instrument of general government it would be both preserved in a respectable state in time of peace and it would be an object to man it with citizens taken in due proportions from every state a navy so formed and under the orders of the general council of the state would not only be a guard against aggressions and insults from abroad but without it what is to protect the southern states for many years to come against the insults and aggressions of their northern brethren james madison may        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  extract philadelphia may        dear sir— a letter which i received a few days ago from mr jefferson gives me a hope that he will lend his succor in defending the title of virginia he professes ignorance of the ground on which the     report of the committee places the controversy i have exhorted him not to drop his purpose and referred him to you as a source of copious information on the subject i wish much you and he could unite your ideas on it since you left us i have picked up several pamphlets which had escaped our researches among them are the examination of the connecticut claim and the charter of georgia bound up with that of maryland and four others presuming that a better use will be made of them i will send them by mr jones requesting however that they may be returned by the hands of him dr lee or yourself as the case may be james madison may        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia may        dear sir— the case of the vessel captured within north carolina was some time since remitted to congress by governor harrison i am glad to find your ideas correspond so exactly with those i had advanced on the subject the legislative power over captures and the judiciary in the last resort are clearly vested in congress by the confederation but the judiciary power in the first instance not being delegated is as clearly reserved to the admiralty courts of the particular states within which the captures are made captures made on the high seas must fall within the jurisdiction of the state into which it shall please the captor to carry them it will be sufficient i believe to insert in the instructions to privateers a clause for     preventing the grievance complained of by north carolina the anger of mr burke was erroneous in its principle as well as intemperate in its degree the offender being an officer of congress and not of virginia congress and not virginia should have been resorted to for redress  on a consultation before doctor lee left us it was determined that we ought to renew our attempts to obtain from congress a decision on the cession of virginia before the meeting of the legislature the attempt was accordingly made and produced all the perplexing and dilatory objections which its adversaries could devise an indisposition of the president which suspended the vote of maryland furnished an argument for postponing which it was prudent to yield to but which is now removed by the arrival of mr wright a new delegate from that state we shall call again on congress for a simple answer in the affirmative or the negative without going into any unnecessary discussions on the point of right and should the decision be postponed sine die we hope the state will consider itself at liberty to take any course which its interest shall suggest it happens very unluckily that virginia will only have two representatives present during the interesting business mr jones cannot be prevailed on to wait the event colonel bland thinks the validity of characters unimportant to the title of virginia and that the title of the natives militates against the claims of the companies is not my situation an enviable one     a further communication from the french minister informs us that the court of france laments the weakness of our army insinuates the idea of cooperation in expelling the enemy from the united states apprehends attempts to seduce the states into separate negotiations and hopes measures will be taken to frustrate such views i believe from this and other circumstances that the court of france begins to have serious suspicions of some latent danger it is extremely probable that as the enemy relax in their military exertions against this country they will redouble the means of seduction and division this consideration is an additional argument in favor of a full representation of the states in a multitude of counsellors there is the best chance for honesty if not of wisdom the subject of vermont has not yet been called up their agents and those of the landmongers are playing with great adroitness into each others hands mr jones will explain this game to you colonel bland is still schismatical on this point i flatter myself however that he will so far respect the united opinion of his brethren as to be silent mr lee entered fully into the policy of keeping the vote of vermont out of congress the refugees from new york have lately perpetrated one of the most daring and flagrant acts that has occurred in the course of the war a captain of militia of new jersey who unfortunately fell a captive into their hands was carried to new york confined successively in different prisons and treated     with every mark of insult and cruelty and finally brought over to the jerseys and in cold blood hanged a label was left on his breast charging him with having murdered one of their fraternity and denouncing a like fate to others the charge has been disproved by unexceptionable testimony a number of respectable people of new jersey have by a memorial called aloud on the commanderinchief for retaliation in consequence of which he has in the most decisive terms claimed of sir henry clinton a delivery of the offenders up to justice as the only means of averting the stroke of vengeance from the innocent head of a captive officer of equal rank to the jersey captain the answer of clinton was not received when general washington despatched a state of the transaction to congress james madison may         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia may         dear sir— the two circumstances relating to the proposed duty on trade mentioned in your favor of the first instant were subjects of discussion when the measure was on the anvil it was evident that the disposition of the states to invest congress with such a power would be influenced by the length of the term assigned for the exercise of it it was equally evident that no provision would satisfy the present creditors of the united states or obtain future loans that was not commensurate to all the public engagements in order to reconcile these     points the duration of the impost was limited but limited in so indefinite a manner as not to defeat the object of it should the increase of trade render the duty more productive than was estimated it must the sooner extinguish the public debts and cease the application of congress for such a power supposes indeed a confidence in them on the part of the states greater perhaps than many may think consistent with republican jealousy but if the states will not enable their representatives to fulfil their engagements it is not to be expected that individuals either in europe or america will confide in them the second objection you mention was also a subject of much discussion in congress on one side it was contended that the powers incident to the collection of a duty on trade were in their nature so municipal and in their operation so irritative that it was improbable that the states could be prevailed on to part with them and that consequently it would be most prudent to ask from the states nothing more than the duty itself to be collected by state officers and paid to a continental receiver and not the right of collecting it by officers of congress on the opposite side it was urged that as congress would be held responsible for the public debts it was necessary and would be expected that the fund granted for discharging them should be exclusively and independently in their hands that if the collectors were under the control of the states the urgency of their wants would be constantly diverting the revenue from its proper     destination that if the states were willing to give up the thing itself it was not likely they would cavil at any form that would be most effectual that the term proposed might be reconciled with their internal jurisdictions by annexing to the office of collector all the powers incident thereto and leaving to congress the right of appointing the officer how far it may be best to appoint the established naval officer i am not prepared to say but should that be found to be the case they will exercise their new functions not as naval officers of the state but as invested with a separate commission by congress in such manner that in the former respect they are wholly exempt from the jurisdiction of congress and in the latter from that of the state such a junction of powers derived from different sources in the same person certainly has its inconveniences but there will be many instances of it in our complex government i have met with so many interruptions this morning that i fear i may have not done justice to the subject in my explanation of it another consequence is that i must be very brief on the head of intelligence to make sure of the post james madison july        philadelphia philip mazzei to philip mazzei  philadelphia july         my dear friend— i have received two copies of your favor of the  th of december last and three     of that of the  0th of november preceding having neglected to bring with me from virginia the cypher concerted between you and the executive i still remain ignorant of the paragraph in your last which i suppose the best worth knowing the state of our affairs has undergone so many vicissitudes since you embarked for europe and i can so little judge how far you may have had intelligence of them that i am at a loss where i ought to begin my narrative as the present posture of them is the most interesting i shall aim at nothing further at present than to give you some idea of that referring to past events so far only as may be necessary to explain it the insuperable difficulties which opposed a general conquest of america seemed as early as the year      to have been felt by the enemy and to have led them into the scheme of directing their operations and views against the southern states only clinton accordingly removed with the principal part of his force from new york to south carolina and   0 laid siege to charleston which after an honorable resistance was compelled to surrender to a superiority of force our loss in men besides the inhabitants of the town was not less than two thousand clinton returned to new york cornwallis was left with about five thousand troops to pursue his conquests general gates was appointed to the command of the southern department in place of lincoln who commanded in charleston at the time of its capitulation he met cornwallis on the   th of august    0 near camden in the upper part of south carolina and on the border of north carolina a general action ensued in which the american troops were defeated with considerable loss though not without making the enemy pay a good price for their victory cornwallis continued his progress into north carolina but afterwards retreated to camden the defeat of gates was followed by so general a clamor against him that it was judged expedient to recall him greene was sent to succeed in command about the time of his arrival at the army cornwallis having been reinforced from new york resumed his enterprise into north carolina a detachment of his best troops was totally defeated by morgan with an inferior number and consisting of a major part of militia detached from greenes army five hundred were made prisoners between two and three hundred killed and wounded and about the like number escaped this disaster instead of checking the ardor of cornwallis afforded a new incentive to a rapid advance in the hope of recovering his prisoners     the vigilance and activity however of morgan secured them cornwallis continued his pursuit as far as the dan river which divides north carolina from virginia greene whose inferior force obliged him to recede this far before the enemy received such succors of militia on his entering virginia that the chase was reversed cornwallis in his turn retreated precipitately greene overtook him on his way to wilmington and attacked him although the ground was lost on our side the british army was so much weakened by the loss of five or six hundred of their best troops that their retreat towards wilmington suffered little interruption greene pursued as long as any chance of reaching his prey remained and then leaving cornwallis on his left took an oblique direction towards camden which with all the other posts in south carolina except charleston and ninetysix have in consequence fallen again into our possession his army lay before the latter when we last heard from him it contained seven or eight hundred men and large quantities of stores it is nearly two hundred miles from charleston and without some untoward accident cannot fail of being taken greene has detachments all over south carolina some of them within a little distance of charleston and the resentments of the people against their late insolent masters ensure him all the aids they can give in reestablishing the american government there great progress is also making in the redemption of georgia as soon as cornwallis had refreshed his troops at     wilmington abandoning his southern conquests to their fate he pushed forward into virginia the parricide arnold had a detachment at portsmouth when he lay on the dan philips had reinforced him so powerfully from new york that the juncture of the two armies at petersburg could not be prevented the whole force amounted to about six thousand men the force under the marquis de la fayette who commanded in virginia being greatly inferior did not oppose them but retreated into orange and culpeper in order to meet general wayne who was on his way from pennsylvania to join him cornwallis advanced northward as far as chesterfield in the county of caroline having parties at the same time at pages warehouse and other places in its vicinity a party of horse commanded by tarleton was sent with all the secrecy and celerity possible to surprise and take the general assembly and executive who had retreated from richmond to charlottesville the vigilance of a young gentleman who discovered the design and rode express to charlottsville prevented a complete surprise as it was several delegates were caught and the rest were within an hour of sharing the same fate among the captives was colonel lyon of hanover mr kinlock a member of congress from south carolina was also caught at mr john walkers whose daughter he had married some time before governor jefferson had a very narrow escape the members of the government rendezvoused at stanton where they soon made a house mr jeffersons year having expired     he declined a reelection and general nelson has taken his place tarletons party retreated with as much celerity as it had advanced on the junction of wayne with the marquis and the arrival of militia the latter faced about and advanced rapidly on cornwallis who retreated to richmond and thence precipitately to williamsburg where he lay on the   th ultimo the marquis pursued and was at the same time within twenty miles of that place one of his advanced parties had had a successful skirmish within six miles of williamsburg bellini has i understand abided patiently in the college the dangers and inconveniences of such a situation i do not hear that the consequences have condemned the experiment such is the present state of the war in the southern department in the northern operations have been for a considerable time in a manner suspended at present a vigorous siege of new york by general washingtons army aided by five or six thousand french troops under count de rochambeau is in contemplation and will soon commence as the english have the command of the water the result of such an enterprise must be very uncertain it is supposed however that it will certainly oblige the enemy to withdraw their force from the southern states which may be a more convenient mode of relieving them than by marching the troops from new york at this season of the year to the southward on the whole the probable conclusion of this campaign is at this juncture very flattering the enemy being on the defensive in every quarter     the vicissitudes which our finances have undergone are as great as those of the war the depreciation of the old continental bills having arrived at forty fifty and sixty for one congress on the   th of march    0 resolved to displace them entirely from circulation and substitute another currency to be issued on better funds and redeemable at a shorter period for this purpose they fixed the relative value of paper and specie at forty for one directed the states to sink by taxes the whole two hundred millions in one year and to provide proper funds for sinking in six years a new currency which was not to exceed ten millions of dollars which was redeemable within that period and to bear an interest of five per cent payable in bills of exchange on europe or hard money the loanoffice certificates granted by congress are to be discharged at the value of the money at the time of the loan a scale of depreciation being fixed by congress for that purpose this scheme has not yet been carried into full execution the old bills are still unredeemed in part in some of the states where they have depreciated to two three and four hundred for one the new bills which were to be issued only as the old ones were taken in are consequently in a great degree still unissued and the depreciation which they have already suffered has determined congress and the states to issue as few more of them as possible we seem to have pursued our paper projects as far as prudence will warrant our medium in future will be principally specie the states are already levying taxes in it as the paper     disappears the hard money comes forward into circulation this revolution will also be greatly facilitated by the influx of spanish dollars from the havannah where the spanish forces employed against the floridas consume immense quantities of our flour and remit their dollars in payment we also receive considerable assistance from the direct aids of our ally and from the money expended among us by his auxiliary troops these advantages as they have been and are likely to be improved by the skill of mr robert morris whom we have constituted minister of our finances afford a more flattering prospect in this department of our affairs than has existed at any period of the war the great advantage the enemy have over us lies in the superiority of their navy which enables them continually to shift the war into defenceless places and to weary out our troops by long marches the squadron sent by our ally to our support did not arrive till a reinforcement on the part of the enemy had counteracted their views they have been almost constantly blocked up at rhode island by the british fleet the effects of a hurricane in the last spring on the latter gave a temporary advantage to the former but circumstances delayed the improvement of it till the critical season was past mr destouches who commanded the french fleet nevertheless hazarded an expedition into chesapeake bay the object of it was to cooperate with the marquis     de la fayette in an attack against arnold who lay at portsmouth with about fifteen hundred british troops had he got into the bay and taken a favorable station the event would certainly have been adequate to our hopes unfortunately the british fleet which followed the french immediately from rhode island reached the capes of virginia first on the arrival of the latter a regular and fair combat took place it lasted for several hours and ended rather in favor of of our allies as the enemy however were nearest the capes and one of the french ships had lost her rudder and was otherwise much damaged the commander thought it best to relinquish his object and return to his former station the damage sustained by the enemy according to their own representation exceeded that of the french and as their number of ships and weight of metal were both superior it does great honor to the gallantry and good conduct of mr destouches congress and indeed the public at large were so sensible of this that their particular thanks were given him on this occasion no description can give you an adequate idea of the barbarity with which the enemy have conducted the war in the southern states every outrage which humanity could suffer has been committed by them desolation rather than conquest seems to have been their object they have acted more like desperate bands of robbers or buccaneers than like a nation making war for dominion negroes horses tobacco c not the standards and arms of their antagonists are the trophies which display their success rapes     murders and the whole catalogue of individual cruelties not protection and the distribution of justice are the acts which characterize the sphere of their usurped jurisdiction the advantage we derive from such proceedings would if it were purchased on other terms than the distresses of our citizens fully compensate for the injury accruing to the public they are a daily lesson to the people of the united states of the necessity of perseverance in the contest and wherever the pressure of their local tyranny is removed the subjects of it rise up as one man to avenge their wrongs and prevent a repetition of them those who have possessed a latent partiality for them as their resentment is embittered by their disappointment generally feel most sensibly their injuries and insults and are the foremost in retaliating them it is much to be regretted that these things are so little known in europe were they published to the world in their true colors the british nation would be hated by all nations as much as they have heretofore been feared by any and all nations would be sensible of the policy of abridging a power which nothing else can prevent the abuse of james madison july   st

for the discharge of my epistolary duty the only certain information we have lately had from europe is that the mediation tendered by russia in the dispute between england  holland has been referred by the former to the general pacification in which the mediation of the emperor will be joined with it as this step is not very respectful to russia it can only proceed from a distrust of her friendship  their hopes of a favorable issue to the campaign which an intercepted letter from ld g germain shews to be extravagantly sanguine there has been nothing from the w indies for several weeks

which the mediation of the emperor will be joined with that of russia as this step is not very respectful to russia it can only proceed from a distrust of her friendship and the hopes entertained by

washington is going on with his preparations  operations agst n york what the result will be can be decided by time alone we hope they will at least withdraw some of the invaders from virginia the french fleet is still at rhode island the british it is reported has lately left the hook augst  d—information has been recd from n york thro a channel that is thought a good one that orders are gone to virginia for a large part of the troops under cornwallis immediately to sail for that place should this be well founded the execution of the orders will announce it to you among other advantages attending an evacuation of virga it will not be the least that the communication with this place by the bay will supply the state with many necessary articles wch are now transported by land at so much expense  will enable you to pay for them easier by raising the price of your commodities it gives me pain to hear that so many of the people have incautiously sold or rather given away their tobo to speculators when it was in no danger from the enemy the destruction of that article which alarmed them   0 was an obvious cause of its future rise and a reason for their retaining it till the alarm should be over goods of all kinds particularly dry goods are rising here already salt in particular has risen within a few days from two dollars to a guinea per bushel i send you by this opportunity five english grammars  for mr w maury agreeably to his request this is the first that has offered although i have had them on hand for some months the price of the whole is a guinea the price of dr

madison august         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia august         dear sir— the controversy relating to the district called vermont the inhabitants of which have for several years claimed and exercised the jurisdiction of an independent state is at length put into a train of speedy decision notwithstanding the objections to such an event there is no question but they will soon be established into a separate and federal state a relinquishment made by massachusetts of her claims a despair of finally obtaining theirs on the part of new york and new hampshire the other     claimants on whom these enterprising adventures were making fresh encroachments the latent support afforded them by the leading people of the new england states in general from which they emigrated the just ground of apprehension that their rulers were engaging in clandestine negotations with the enemy and lastly perhaps the jealous policy of some of the little states which hope that such a precedent may engender a division of some of the large ones are the circumstances which will determine the concurrence of congress in this affair james madison september        philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia september        dear sir— i am favored with yours of the   th ultimo this letter will be the most agreeable of any i have long had the pleasure of writing i begin with informing you that the commanderinchief and the count rochambeau—the former with a part of the american army and the latter with the whole of the french—are thus far on their way for the southern department the american troops passed through the town yesterday the first division of the french army today the second will pass tomorrow nothing can exceed the appearance of this specimen which our ally has sent us of his army whether we regard the figure of the men or the exactness of their discipline yesterday also arrived from his special mission     to the court of france colonel john laurens although his success has not been fully commensurate to our wishes he has brought with him very substantial proofs of the determination of that court to support us besides a considerable quantity of clothing and other valuable articles there are upwards of sixteen thousand stand of arms it is rather unlucky that they found it expedient to put into boston instead of this place from whence the distribution of them would have been so much more easy i wish i could have concluded the intelligence without adding that admiral hood with thirteen sail of the line from the west indies lately arrived at new york and after being joined by graves with eight ships put again immediately to sea the french squadron under de barras had previously sailed from newport as the expected arrival of de grasse from the west indies could not be unknown to hood there is little doubt that his activity is directed against the junction of the two french fleets james madison sepr   th      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mass  philada sepr   th      dear sir— i was yesterday favored with yours of the  0th instant the various reports arrived of late from the chesapeake prepared us for a confirmation from our correspondents of a fortunate rencontre between the   fleets a continuation of these reports although unsupported by any authentic evidence     still keeps up the public anxiety we have not heard a word of de barras the arrival of digby is far from being certain and the circulating reports have reduced his force to six ships of the line the preparations at new york for some movement are pretty well attested the conjectures of many are directing it against this city as the most practicable  important object within the reach of clinton the successful blow struck by the parricide arnold against the town of new london is described as far as the particulars are known here in the enclosed gazette there have been several arrivals of late from europe with very little intelligence of any kind  with none from official sources it all relates to the junction of the french  spanish fleets for the purpose of renewing the investiture of gibraltar and enterprising something against minorca thus the selfish projects of spain not only withholds from us the cooperation of their armaments but divert in part that of our allies  yet we are to reward her with a cession of what constitutes the value of the finest part of america genl washington  the count de rochambeau with the forces under them have i presume by this time got within virginia this revolution in our military plan cannot fail to produce great advantages to the southern department and particularly to virginia even if the immediate object of it should be unexpectedly frustrated the presence of the commander in chief with the proportion of our forces which will always attend him will better protect the     country against the depredations of the enemy although he should be followed by troops from n y which wd otherwise remain there than it has hitherto been will leave the militia more at leisure to pursue their occupations at the same time that the demands of the armies will afford a sure market for the surplus provisions of the country will diffuse among them a share of the gold  silver of our ally  i may now say of our own of wch their northern brethren have hitherto had a monopoly which will be peculiarly grateful to them after having been so long gorged with depreciating paper and as we may suppose that the ships of our ally allotted for our service will so long as his troops remain in the u states be kept in the chesapeake it will revive the trade thro that channel reduce the price of imported necessaries  raise the staple of the country once more to its proper value i am etc james madison october        philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  phila october        dear sir— yours of the   th ulto came safe by yesterdays post in addition to the paper of this day i enclose you two of the preceding week in one of which you will find a very entertaining  interesting speech of mr fox and in the other a handsome forensic discussion of a case important in itself and which has some relation to the state of virginia our intelligence from n y through several channels confirms the sufferings of the b fleet from their rash visit to the capes of chesapeak the troops     which were kept in transports to await that event have since the return of the fleet been put on shore on staten island this circumstance has been construed into a preliminary to any expedition to this city which had revived till within a few days the preparation for a militia opposition but is better explained by the raging of a malignant fever in the city of n y digby we hear is now certainly arrived but with three ships of the line only it is given out that three more with a large number of transports came with him and that they only lay back till it was known whether they could proceed to n y with safety this is not improbably suspected to be a trick to palliate the disappointment and to buoy up the sinking hopes of their adherents the most staunch of whom give up lord cornwallis as irretrievably lost we have received some communications from europe relative to the general state of its affairs they all center in three important points the first is the obstinacy of g b the second the fidelity of our ally and the third the absolute necessity of vigorous  systematic preparations for war on our part in order to ensure a speedy as well as favorable peace the wisdom of the legislature of virginia will i flatter myself not only prevent an illusion from the present brilliant prospects but take advantage of the military ardor and sanguine hopes of the people to recruit their line for the war the introduction of specie will also i hope be made subservient to some salutary operations in their finances another great object which in my opinion claims an immediate attention from     them is some liberal provision for extending the benefits of government to the distant parts of the state i am not able to see why this cannot be done so as fully to satisfy the exigencies of the people and at the same time preserve the idea of unity in the state any plan which divides in any manner the sovereignty may be dangerous  precipitate an evil which ought  may at least be long procrastinated the administration of justice which is the capital branch may certainly be diffused sufficiently and kept in due subordination in every part to one supreme tribunal separate boards for auditing accounts may also be admitted with safety  propriety the same as to a separate depository for the taxes c and as to a land office the military powers of the executive may well be intrusted to militia officers of rank as far as the defence of the country  the custody of military stores make it necessary a complete organization of the militia in which genl officers would be erected would greatly facilitate this part of the plan such an one with a council of field officers might exercise without encroaching on the constitutional powers of the supreme executive all the powers over the militia which any emergency could demand i am etc james madison octr  th      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund

favor of the  th you will readily judge from the tenor of it what steps would be taken by the delegates  it necessarily submitted the fate of the object in question to the discretion and prospects of the gentleman  whom reports it seems have arraigned to you but who i am bound in justice to testify has entirely supported the character which he formerly held with you i am somewhat surprised that you never had before known of the resolution just mentioned especially as what is indeed more surprising it was both debated  passed with open doors and a full gallery this circumstance     alone must have defeated any reservations attached to it the n york papers and the intelligence from thence make it evident that they have no hope of relieving cornwallis unless it can be effected by some desperate naval experiment and that such an one will be made their force will probably amount to    sail of the line and if we are not misinformed as to the late arrival of three ships of the line to    sail the superiority still remaining on the part of our allies and the repeated proofs given of their skill  bravery on the water forbid any apprehension of danger at the same time we cannot help calculating that every addition to the british force proportionally diminishes the certainty of success a fleet of provisions amounting to about  0 sail convoyed by a       frigates have arrived at n york within the week past having sent all the papers containing the proceedings on the case of mr n agst v as they came out i shall to complete your view of it add the last effort in his favor

combined arms     at york and gloucester we have had from the commanderinchief an official report of the fact with a copy of the capitulation and a general intimation that the number of prisoners excluding seamen c would exceed five thousand but no detail of our gains if these severe doses of ill fortune do not cool the phrenzy and relax the pride of britain it would seem as if heaven had in reality abandoned her to her folly and her fate this campaign was grounded on the most intense exertion of her pecuniary resources upwards of twenty millions were voted by the parliament the king acknowledged that it was all he asked and all that was necessary a fair trial has been made of her strength and what is the result they have lost another army another colony another island and another fleet of her trade their possessions in the east indies which were so rich a source of their commerce and credit have been severed from them perhaps for ever their naval armaments the bulwarks of their safety and the idols of their vanity have in every contest felt the rising superiority of their enemies in no points have they succeeded except in the predatory conquest of eustatia of which they have lost the greatest part of every thing except the infamy and in the relief of gibraltar which was merely a negative advantage with what hope or with what view can they try the fortune of another campaign unless they can draw succour from the compassion or jealousy of other powers of which it does not yet appear that they have any wellfounded expectation it seems scarcely   0 possible for them much longer to shut their ears against the voice of peace i am sorry to find that the practice of impressing is still kept up with you it is partial and oppressive with respect to individuals and i wish it may not eventually prove so with respect to the state the zeal and liberality of those states which make undue advances may not find an equal disposition to reimburse them in others which have had more caution or less occasion for such exertions you are not mistaken in your apprehensions for our western interests an agrarian law is as much coveted by the little members of the union as ever it was by the indigent citizens of rome the conditions annexed by virginia to her territorial cession have furnished a committee of congress a handle for taking up questions of right both with respect to the ceding states and the great land companies which they have not before ventured to touch we have made every opposition and remonstrance to the conduct of the committee which the forms of proceedings will admit when a report is made we shall renew our efforts upon more eligible ground but with little hope of arresting any aggression upon virginia which depends solely on the inclination of congress since the close of the confederation however it has been understood that seven votes are necessary to carry every question this rule in proportion to the thinness of congress opposes a difficulty to those who attack it will therefore i believe be impossible for the enemies of virginia to obtain any positive injury     to her rights my greatest anxiety at present is lest the attempts for that purpose may exasperate the assembly into measures which will furnish new hopes to the british court to persevere in the war and new baits for the credulity of the british nation the good sense of the assembly will however i flatter myself temper every expression of their displeasure with due respect to this consideration it would be particularly unhappy if any symptoms of disunion among ourselves should blast the golden prospects which the events of the campaign have opened to us james madison november         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia november         dear sir— nothing definitive has taken place on the territorial cessions that of virginia will not i believe be accepted with the conditions annexed to it the opinion seems to be that an acceptance of the cession of new york will give congress a title which will be maintainable against all the other claimants in this however they will certainly be deceived and even if it were otherwise it would be their true interest as well as conformable to the plan on which the cessions were recommended to bury all further contentions by covering the territory with the titles of as many of the claimants as possible we are very anxious to bring the matter to issue that the state may know what course their honor and security require them to take the present thinness of congress     makes it but too uncertain when we shall be able to accomplish it will not the assembly pay some handsome compliments to the marquis for his judicious and zealous services whilst the protection of the country was entrusted to him his having baffled and finally reduced to the defensive so powerful an army as we now know he had to contend with and with so disproportionate a force would have done honor to the most veteran officer added to his other merits and services constitutes a claim on their gratitude which i hope will not be unattended to james madison november         philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia november         dear sir— by the conveyance through which you will receive this the delegates have communicated to the state the proceedings in congress to which the territorial cessions have given birth the complexion of them will i suppose be somewhat unexpected and produce no small irritation they clearly speak the hostile machinations of some of the states against our territorial claims and afford suspicions that the predominant temper of congress may coincide with them it is proper to recollect however that the report of the committee having not yet been taken into consideration no certain inference can be drawn as to its issue and that the report itself is not founded on the obnoxious doctrine of an inherent right in the united     states to the territory in question but on the expediency of clothing them with the title of new york which is supposed to be maintainable against all others it is proper also to be considered that the proceedings of the committee which we labored in vain to arrest were vindicated not by the pretext of a jurisdiction belonging to congress in such cases but alleged to have been made necessary by the conditions annexed to the cession of virginia although the cession of virginia will probably be rejected on the whole i do not think it probable that all the principles and positions contained in the report of the committee will be ratified the committee was composed of a member from maryland pennsylvania new jersey rhode island and new hampshire all of which states except the last are systematically and notoriously adverse to the claims of western territory and particularly those of virginia the opinion of the committee is therefore no just index of the opinion of congress and it is a rule observed since the confederation was completed that seven states are requisite in any question and there are seldom more than seven eight nine or ten states present even the opinion of a majority of congress is a very different thing from a constitutional vote i mention these particulars that you may be the better able to counteract any intemperate measures that may be urged in the legislature if the state wishes any particular steps to be pursued by the delegates it would be well for particular instructions to that effect to be given these will not only be a guide to us     but will give greater weight to whatever is urged by us i enclose you a paper containing two of the many letters lately published in new york with the subscription of mr deanes name the genuineness of some of them and particularly that to mr morris is generally doubted there are some who think the whole of them spurious however this may be there is through another channel indubitable proof that no injustice is done in ascribing to him the sentiments advanced in these letters either from pique interested projects of trade or a traitorous correspondence with the enemy he has certainly apostatized from his first principles james madison nov   th      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton mad mss  phila nov   th      dear sir— your favor of the   th instant

will be able to give congress very seasonable aid in settling the military establishment for the next year about which there is some diversity of opinion whatever the total requisition of men may be on the states i cannot but wish that virginia may take effectual measures for bringing into the field her proportion of them one reason for this wish is the calumnies which her enemies ground on her present deficiency but the principal one is the influence     that such an exertion may have in preventing insults  aggressions from whatever quarter they may be meditated by shewing that we are able to defy them the delegates have lately transmitted to the govr for the assembly all the proceedings which have taken place on the subject of the territorial cessions the tenor of them  the reception given them by the assembly will i doubt not be communicated to you by some of your correspondents in it there is pretty good reason to believe that a descent on minorca has actually taken place it is a little problematical with me whether successes against g b in any other quarter except america tend much to hasten a peace if they increase her general distress they at the same time increase those demands against her which are likely to impede negotiations  her hopes from the sympathy of other powers they are favorable to us however in making it more the interest of all the belligerent powers to reject the uti possidetis as the basis of a pacification the report of rodneys capture never deserved the attention it seems which was given to it i am etc james madison dr   th      philadelphia

whether they be supposed genuine or spurious or a mixture of both difficulties which cannot well be answered may be started there are however passages in some of them which can scarcely be imputed to any other hand but it is unnecessary to rely on these publications for the real character of the man there is evidence of his obliquity which has for a considerable time been conclusive congress have not resumed their proceedings on the western business they have agreed on a requisition on the states for  000000 of dollars  a completion of their lines according to the last establishment of the army we endeavored tho with very little effect to obtain deductions in the first article from the quota of virginia but we did not oppose the aggregate of the demand in either if we do not obtain a sufficiency of men  money from the states by regular  duly appointed calls we know by experience that the burden of the war will fall on the resources of the states wch happen to be subject of it mr

there will be in this in which i have little else to say than to tender you the compliments of the day perhaps indeed it will be new to you what appeared here in a paper several days ago that the success of comodore johnstone in taking   duch e india men homeward bound  destroying a  th is confirmed whatever may be thought of this stroke of fortune by him  his rapacious crew the ministry will hardly think it a compensation to the public for the danger to which the remains of their possessions in the east will be exposed by the failure of his expedition it gives me great pleasure to hear of the honorable acquittal of mr jefferson i know his abilities  i think i know his fidelity  zeal for his country so well that i am persuaded it was a just one we are impatient to know whether he will

the first time the bank instituted under the auspices of congress     its principal founder is mr robert morris who has certain prerogatives with respect to it in his quality of superintendent of finance it is pretty analogous in its principles to the bank of england the stock subscribed is  00000 dollars when the scheme was originally proposed to congress for their approbation and patronage a promise was given that as soon as it was ripe for operation the company should be incorporated a few days ago the fulfilment of the promise was claimed the competency of congress to such an act had been called in question in the first instance but the subject not lying in so near and distinct a view the objections did not prevail on the last occasion the general opinion though with some exceptions was that the confederation gave no such power and that the exercise of it would not bear the test of a forensic disquisition and consequently would not avail the institution the bank however supposing that such a sanction from congress would at least give it a dignity and preeminence in the public opinion urged the engagement of congress that on this engagement the subscriptions had been made and that a disappointment would leave the subscribers free to withdraw their names these considerations were reinforced by the superintendent of finance who relied on this institution as a great auxiliary to his department and in particular expected aid from it in a payment he is exerting himself to make to the army the immediate interposition of congress was rendered the more essential too by the sudden adjournment of the     assembly of this state to whom the bank might have been referred for the desired incorporation which it was the opinion of many would have given them a sufficient legal existence in every state you will conceive the dilemma in which these circumstances placed the members who felt on one side the importance of the institution and on the other a want of power and an aversion to assume it something like a middle way finally produced an acquiescing rather than an affirmative vote a charter of incorporation was granted with a recommendation to the states to give it all the necessary validity within their respective jurisdictions as this is a tacit admission of a defect of power i hope it will be an antidote against the poisonous tendency of precedents of usurpation in the ordinance lately passed for regulating captures which i presume you have seen a clause was inserted exposing to capture all merchandizes produced in great britain if coming into these states and within three leagues of the coast although the property of a neutral nation congress have now recommended to the states to subject them to seizure during the war if found on land within their respective limits these measures had become necessary to check an evil which was every day increasing and which both enabled and encouraged great britain to persevere in the war at the same time that it mortified our ally with daily seeing the fruits of his generosity to us remitted in payment to the rival of his nation and the enemy of both   0 james madison january         philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia january         dear sir— the result of the attack on your administration was so fully anticipated that it made little impression on me  if it had been consistent with your sentiments and views to engage in the service to which you were called it would have afforded me both unexpected and singular satisfaction not only from the personal interest i felt in it but from the important aid which the interest of the state would probably have derived from it what i particularly refer to is her claim to western territory the machinations which have long been practised by interested individuals against this claim are well known to you the late proceedings within the walls of congress in consequence of the territorial cessions produced by their recommendations to the states claiming the western country were many weeks ago transmitted for the legislature by a captain irish by the same conveyance i wrote to you on the subject we have the mortification to find by our latest letters from richmond that this gentleman had not at the date of them appeared there as it is uncertain whether that information may not have totally miscarried it will be proper to repeat to you that the states besides virginia from which the cessions came were connecticut and new york     the cession of the former consisted of all her claim west of new york as far as the mississippi that of the latter of all her claims beyond a certain western limit drawn on the occasion the cession of connecticut extended to the soil only expressly reserving the jurisdiction that of new york made no reservation these cessions with that of virginia and sundry memorials from the indiana and other land companies were referred to a committee composed of a member from new hampshire rhode island new jersey pennsylvania and maryland the ingredients of this composition prepared us for the complexion of their proceedings their first step was to investigate and discuss the respective titles of the states to the territory ceded as this was directly in the face of the recommendation of congress which professed to bury all such discussions and might prejudge future controversies between individual members of the union we refused to exhibit any evidence in favor of the title of virginia and endeavored though in vain to prevail on congress to interdict the committee from proceeding in the inquiry the next step of the committee was still more obnoxious they went fully into a hearing of the memorialists through their agent and received all the evidence adduced in support of their pretensions on this occasion we renewed our remonstrances to the committee and our complaints to congress but with as little effect as on the first occasion the upshot of the whole was a report to congress rejecting the cessions of connecticut and virginia and     accepting that of new york disallowing also the claims of the companies northwest of the ohio but justifying that of the indiana company the report seems to distrust the doctrine hitherto maintained of territorial rights being incident to the united states collectively which are not comprehended within any individual state substituting the expedient of recognizing the title of new york stretching over the whole country claimed by the other ceding states and then accepting a transfer of it to the united states in this state the business now rests—the report having never been taken into consideration nor do we wish it should till it shall have undergone the consideration of virginia in whatever light the policy of this proceeding may be viewed it affords an additional proof of the industry and perseverance with which the territorial rights of virginia are persecuted and of the necessity of fortifying them with every precaution which their importance demands as a very obvious and necessary one we long since recommended to the state an accurate and full collection of the documents which relate to the subject if the arrival of captain irish had taken place before the adjournment of the assembly and during your stay with it we flattered ourselves that the recommendation would have been attended to and that the task would have fallen on you as this was not the case we have no hope at present of being enabled from any other sources than the voluntary aid of individuals to contradict even verbally the misrepresentations and calumnies which are daily levelled     against the claims of virginia and which cannot fail to prepossess the public with errors injurious at present to her reputation and which may affect a future decision on her rights colonel masons industry and kindness have supplied us with some valuable papers and remarks mr jones has also received from mr pendleton some judicious remarks on the subject we are still notwithstanding far from possessing a complete view of it will you permit me to ask of you such information as your researches have yielded with the observations which you have made in the course of them i would not obtrude such a request on you if the subject were not of public importance and if it could have been addressed with equal prospect of advantage elsewhere indeed if you could prevail on yourself to spare as much time as would survey the whole subject beginning with the original charter pursuing it through the subsequent charters and other public acts of the crown through the government of virginia and referring to all the transactions with the indians which have been drawn into the question the public utility i am persuaded would sufficiently reward you for the labor james madison january         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia january         dear sir— congress are much occupied and perplexed at present with the case of vermont the pretensions of that settlement to the character of an     independent state with the grounds on which they are made and the countenance given them by congress are i presume pretty well known to you it has long been contended that an explicit acknowledgment of that character and an admission of them into the federal union was an act both of justice and policy the discovery made through several channels and particularly the intercepted letters of lord g germaine added such force to the latter of these considerations that in the course of last summer preliminary overtures were made on the part of congress for taking them into the confederation containing as one condition on the part of vermont that they should contract their claims within the bounds to which they were originally confined and guaranteeing to new york and new hampshire all the territory without those bounds to which their encroachments had been extended instead of complying with this condition they have gone on in their encroachments both on the new york and new hampshire sides and there is at this moment every symptom of approaching hostility with each of them in this delicate crisis the interposition of congress is again called for and indeed seems to be indispensable but whether in the way of military coercion or a renewal of former overtures or by making the first a condition of a refusal of the last is not so unanimously decided indeed with several members and i may say states in congress a want of power either to decide on their independence or to open the door of the confederacy to them is     utterly disclaimed besides which the danger of the precedent and the preponderancy it would give to the eastern scale deserve serious consideration these reasons nevertheless can only prevail when the alternative contains fewer evils it is very unhappy that such plausible pretexts if not necessary occasions of assuming power should occur nothing is more distressing to those who have a true respect for the constitutional modifications of power than to be obliged to decide on them james madison january         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia january         dear sir— the repeal of the impost act by virginia is still considered as covered with some degree of mystery colonel blands representations do not remove the veil indeed he seems as much astonished at it and as unable to penetrate it as any of us many have surmised that the enmity of doctor lee against morris is at the bottom of it but had that been the case it can scarcely be supposed that the repeal would have passed so quietly by this time i presume you will be able to furnish me with its true history and i ask the favor of you to do it virginia could never have cut off this source of public relief at a more unlucky crisis than when she is protesting her inability to comply with the continental requisitions she will i hope be yet made sensible of the impropriety of the step she has taken     and make amends by a more liberal grant congress cannot abandon the plan as long as there is a spark of hope nay other plans on a like principle must be added justice gratitude our reputation abroad and our tranquillity at home require provisions for a debt of not less than fifty millions of dollars and i pronounce that this provision will not be adequately met by separate acts of the states if there are not revenue laws which operate at the same time through all the states and are exempt from the control of each—the mutual jealousies which begin already to appear among them will assuredly defraud both our foreign and domestic creditors of their just claims the deputies of the army are still here urging the objects of their mission congress are thoroughly impressed with the justice of them and are disposed to do everything which depends on them but what can a virginia delegate say to them whose constituents declare that they are unable to make the necessary contributions and unwilling to establish funds for obtaining them elsewhere the valuation of lands is still under consideration james madison february        philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia february        dear sir— congress are still occupied with the thorny subject of vermont some plan for a general liquidation and apportionment of the public debts is     also under their consideration and i fear will be little less perplexing it is proposed that until justice and the situation of the states will admit of a valuation of lands the states should be applied to for power to substitute such other rule of apportioning the expenditures as shall be equitable and practicable and that commissioners be appointed by the concurrent act of the united states and each state to settle the accounts between them the scheme is not yet matured and will meet with many difficulties in its passage through congress i wish it may not meet with much greater when it goes down to the states a spirit of accommodation alone can render it unanimously admissible a spirit which but too little prevails but which in few instances is more powerfully recommended by the occasion than the present if our voluminous and entangled accounts be not put into some certain course of settlement before a foreign war is off our hands it is easy to see they must prove an exuberant and formidable source of intestine dissensions jaqueline ambler feb         james madison to james madison mad mss  feb         hond sir— a conveyance by a waggon returning to your neighbourhood this moment presenting itself i make use of it to forward a collection of papers which have accumulated since the last supply if there are any deficiencies be so good as to point them out to me by the same conveyance i send to     mr w maury   english grammars the price of which is   dollars which he is to remit thro you the disappointment in forwarding the money by mr brownlow has been sorely felt by me and the more so as the legislature has made no provision for the subsistence of the delegates that can be relyed on  i hope some opportunity will soon put it in your power to renew the attempt to transmit it  that the delay will have made considerable addition to it besides the necessity of this supply for the common occasions i have frequent opportunities here of purchasing many scarce  necessary books at ¼ of the price which if to be had at all they will hereafter cost me if an immediate conveyance does not present itself for the cash i wd recomend that a bill of exchange on some merchant here be got of mr hunter mr maury or other respectable merchant  forwarded by the post this is a safer method than the first and i make no doubt is very practicable i wish at all events the trial to be made  that speedily i recollect nothing new which is not contained in     some of the late papers present my affectionate regards to all the family i have not time to add more than that i am your dutiful son james madison february         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia february         dear sir— you have been misinformed i find with respect to that article in the scheme of the bank which claims for it the exclusive privilege of issuing circulating notes it is true congress have recommended to the states to allow it such privilege but it is to be considered only during the present war under such a limitation it was conceived both necessary to the success of the scheme and consistent with the policy of the several states it being improbable that the collective credit and specie of the whole would support more than one such institution or that any particular state would during the war stake its credit anew on any paper experiment whatever james madison march         philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia march         dear sir— i have met with a bundle of old pamphlets belonging to the public library here in which is a map  published in    0 which from this and other   0 circumstances i am pretty confident is of the same impression with that of dr smiths it represents the south sea at about ten days travel from the heads or falls i forget which of james river from the tenor however of the pamphlet to which it is immediately annexed and indeed of the whole collection there is just ground to suspect that this representation was an artifice to favor the object of the publications which evidently was to entice emigrants from england by a flattering picture of the advantages of this country one of which dwelt on in all the pamphlets is the vicinity of the south sea and the facility it afforded of a trade with the eastern world another circumstance which lessens much the value of this map to the antiquary is that it is more modern by twentyfive years than those extant in purchases pilgrim which are referred to in the negotiations between the british and french commissaries touching the bounds of nova scotia as the first of authenticity relating to this part of the world if notwithstanding these considerations you still desire that a copy be taken from the map above described i shall with pleasure execute your orders or if you wish that a copy of virginia or of the whole country may be taken from those in purchase your orders shall be equally attended to i much doubt however whether that book be so extremely scarce as to require a transcript from it for the purpose you seem to have in view     congress have taken no step in the business of the western territory since the report of the committee of which i have already given you an account and which we hear arrived at richmond on the day of the adjournment of the assembly we wish it to undergo their consideration and to receive their instructions before we again move in it james madison march         philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia march         dear sir— the ministerial speeches with other circumstances place it beyond a doubt that the plan for recovering america will be changed a separate peace with the dutch—a suspension of the offensive war here—an exertion of their resources thus disencumbered against the naval power of france and spain—and a renewal of the arts of seduction and division in the united states will probably constitute the outlines of the new plan whether they will succeed in the first article of it cannot be ascertained by the last intelligence we have from holland it is only certain that negotiations are on foot under the auspices of the empress of russia james madison march         philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia march         dear sir— a letter has been lately received from you by the president of congress accompanied by a     bundle of papers procured from the cherokees by colonel campbell as it appears that these papers were transmitted at the request of the late president it is proper to apprize you that it was made without any written or verbal sanction and even without the knowledge of congress and not improbably with a view of fishing for discoveries which may be subservient to the aggressions meditated on the territorial rights of virginia it would have been unnecessary to trouble you with this had it not appeared that colonel campbell has given a promise of other papers which if he should fulfil and the papers contain any thing which the adversaries of virginia may make an ill use of you will not suffer any respect for the acts of congress to induce you to forward hither march  0th      philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philada march  0th      hond sir— mr j walker has safely delivered to me three letters from you attended with the money therein specified he has also been so obliging as to undertake the conveyance of the several articles of medicine you wanted with a gallon keg filled with good port wine to all which i add a large packet of newspapers—and an almanack the last packet i sent was by a waggon returning to your neighborhood which brought me a letter from mr w maury by which i sent at the same time a small supply of bark for my mother     i mentioned to you in one of my former letters that i had a prospect of getting on very favorable terms a few scarce books from a library brought hither for sale by col lane my purchases of him have amounted in the whole to nineteen pounds three shillings of this currency as i had not the money here for him  he could not conveniently wait till it would be convenient for me to pay him i was obliged to give him a draught on you i hope you will be able to find means to satisfy it if it can not be otherwise done than by a deduction from the further supply you have in contemplation for me i must submit to it how far i shall depend on you for the resources necessary for my expenses here not included in the legal provision and for the arrearages into which i have unavoidably fallen will be known as soon as the assembly have finally decided on our accounts  the allowance which is to be made to us this i suppose will be done at their session in may next unless liberal principles prevail on the occasion i shall be under the necessity of selling    a negro the newspapers will give you in general the intelligence we have from europe as far as we are enabled to judge of the views of the british cabinet the misfortunes of one more campaign at least will be necessary to conquer their obstinacy they are attempting a separate peace with the dutch  talk of suspending their offensive war agst us  directing their whole resources agst the naval power of france  spain if this be their real plan we may be sure     they do not mean by it to abandon their pretensions to the u states but try another mode for recovering them during their offensive exertions agst our ally they can be practicing insidious ones agst us and if in the first they should be successful  in the latter disappointed a renewal of a vigorous war upon us will certainly take place the best security agst every artifice  every event will be such military preparations on our part as will be sufficient either to resist or expell them as the case may require with my affectionate regards for the family i am hond sir yr dutiful son james madison april        philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton  philadelphia april        dear sir— the only event with which the period since my last has enabled me to repay your favor of the twentyfifth ultimo is the arrival of four deputies from vermont with a plenipotentiary commission to accede to the confederacy the business is referred to a committee who are sufficiently devoted to the policy of gaining the vote of vermont into congress the result will be the subject of a future letter the thinness or rather vacancy of the virginia line and the little prospect of recruiting it are subjects of a very distressing nature if those on whom the remedy depends were sensible of the insulting comparisons to which they expose the state and of the wound they give to her influence in the general     councils i am persuaded more decisive exertions would be made considering the extensive interests and claims which virginia has and the enemies and calumnies which these very claims form against her she is perhaps under the strongest obligation of any state in the union to preserve her military contingent on a respectable footing and unhappily her line is perhaps of all in the most disgraceful condition the only hope that remains is that her true policy will be better consulted at the ensuing assembly and that as far as a proper sense of it may be deficient the expostulations of her friends and clamors of her enemies will supply the place of it if i speak my sentiments too freely on this point it can only be imputed to my sensibility to the honor and interest of my country james madison april        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia april        dear sir— i perceive by a passage cited in the examination of the connecticut claim to lands in pennsylvania that we have been mistaken in supposing the acquiescence of virginia in the defalcations of her chartered territory to have been a silent one it said that at a meeting of the privy council july  d      was taken into consideration the petition of the planters of virginia remonstrating that some grants had lately been obtained of a great proportion of the lands and territories within the limits     of the colony there and a day was ordered for further hearing the parties to wit lord baltimore and said adventurers and planters the decision against virginia is urged as proof that the crown did not regard the charter as in force with respect to the bounds of virginia it is clearly a proof that virginia at that time thought otherwise and made all the opposition to the encroachment which could then have been made to the arbitrary acts which gave birth to the present revolution if any monuments exist of the transactions of virginia at the period above mentioned or any of the successive periods at which these encroachments had been repeated you will have an opportunity of searching more minutely into them it is not probable however that after a failure in the first opposition any further opposition will be found to subsequent grants out of virginia james madison april         philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson  philadelphia april         dear sir— i entreat that you will not suffer the chance of a speedy and final determination of the territorial question by congress to affect your purpose of tracing the title of virginia to her claims it is in the first place very uncertain when a determination will take place even if it takes place at all and in the next it will assuredly not be a final one unless virginia means to be passive and silent under aggression on her rights in every event therefore it is     proper to be armed with every argument and document that can vindicate her title her adversaries will be either the united states or new york or both the former will either claim on the principle that the vacant country is not included in any particular state and consequently falls to the whole or will clothe themselves with the title of the latter by accepting its cession in both cases it will be alleged that the charter of   0  was annulled by the resumption of it into the hands of the crown and that the subsequent grants to maryland c denote this to have been the construction of it that the proclamation of      has constituted the alleghany ridge the western limit of virginia and that the letter of president nelson on the subject of a new colony on the ohio relinquishes on the part of virginia all interference with the authority of the crown beyond that limit in case the title of new york should alone be opposed to that of virginia it will be further alleged against the latter that the treaties of        0            and      between the government of the former and the six nations have annexed to it all the country claimed by these nations and their tributaries and that the expense of new york in defending and protecting them ought in equity to be reimbursed by this exclusive advantage the original title of new york is indeed drawn from the charter to the duke of york in       renewed after the treaty of westminister in      but this charter will not i believe reach any territory claimed by virginia     much stress will also be laid on the treaty of fort stanwix particularly as a bar to any corroboration of the claim of virginia from the treaties of lancaster and loggstown it is under this treaty that the companies of indiana and vandalia shelter their pretensions against the claims of virginia c c see the pamphlets entitled public good and plain facts as these pretentions can be of no avail unless the jurisdiction of congress or new york at least can be established they no otherwise deserve notice than as sources of calumny and influence in the public councils in both which respects it is the interest of virginia that an antidote should be applied james madison april         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia april         dear sir— congress have received from the minister of france some informal communications relative to the issue of the proposed mediation of vienna and petersburgh the answer of the british court to the preliminary articles is among them it rejects explicitly that part of the plan which requires concurrent negotiations between her and america and guaranties the result as incompatible with the relation of subjects to their sovereign and the essential interests of the empire alleging at the same time that a great part of the people are disposed to return to their allegiance and that such a treaty would supply the rebels with new pretexts for misleading     them the final answer of the mediating courts professes great impartiality and delicacy toward the belligerent parties adheres to the expediency of the first plan and hopes that it may still become under more favorable circumstances the basis of a general pacification another letter has come to hand from mr dana his proposed step was probably taken a few days after the date of it which was about the middle of october the committee on the last application from vermont have reported fully in their favor the consideration of the report will not be called for however till the pulse of nine states beats favorably for it this is so uncertain that the agents have returned the recognition of the independence of vermont is not fully stated in the report as a resolution antecedent went to authorizing a committee to treat with them on the terms of their admission you will know the object of this arrangement james madison may      philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia may      dear sir— the enclosed gazette details all the information which we have received relative to the parliamentary advances towards a negotiation with the united states the first reports which issued from the packet which brought them were of a very different complexion and raised high expectations of peace we now find the ideas of the opposition as   0 well as the ministry to be far short of the only condition on which it can take place those who are the farthest reconciled to concessions calculate on a dissolution of the compact with france the ministry will yield to the experiment and turn the result upon their adversaries our business is plain fidelity to our allies and vigor in military preparation—these and these alone will secure us against all political devices we have received no intelligence which speaks a danger of a separate peace between the dutch and great britain mr adams request of a categorical answer was taken ad referendum prior if i mistake not to the knowledge of cornwallis fate and it is not likely that after that event they would be less disposed to respect our overtures or reject those of the enemy we have letters from mr jay and mr carmichael of as late date as the twentyseventh of february they differ in nothing from the style of the former the conduct of the spanish court subsequent to the date of the letter received the day preceding your departure corresponds entirely with the tenor of it as therein related mr jones will inform you of the act of congress which that letter produced we have made no progress in the western subject we mean to desist after one or two more attempts and state the matter to the assembly by next post expecting that they will pursue such measures as their interest prescribes without regard to the resolutions which proposed the cession     i beg you to keep me punctually informed of every legislative step touching the western territory i suppose the cession cannot fail to be revoked or at least a day of limitation set to it the condition relative to the companies will certainly be adhered to in every event i find that those who have been against us do not wish to lose sight of the prospect altogether if the state is firm and prudent i have little doubt that she will be again courted previous to mr jones departure our opinions were united on the expediency of making the impost of five per cent subservient to an honorable adjustment of territory and accounts i have since discovered that varnum is left out the latter having promoted it and that chase is inflexible against it massachusetts also holds out the expedient therefore would not be efficacious and clamors would be drawn on virginia which it would be best should fall elsewhere show this to mr jones he will be with you about the twentieth instant james madison may         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia may         dear sir— the ceres manofwar we are informed by a new york paper arrived there in twentyfive days on the fifth instant having on board his excellency sir guy carleton commanderinchief c and commissioned for making peace or war in north america the intelligence brought by this     conveyance is that the vibrations of power between the ministry and their rivals had terminated in the complete dissolution of the former and organization of the latter what change of measures will follow this change of men is yet concealed from us the bill for empowering the king to conclude a peace or truce with the revolted colonies in north america had been brought into parliament on the twentyseventh of march the language of it is at the same time cautious and comprehensive and seems to make eventual provision for our independence without betraying any purpose of acknowledging it the terms peace and truce are scarcely applicable to any other conventions than national ones and the king is authorized to annul or suspend all acts of parliament whatever as far as they speak of the colonies he can therefore clearly remove any parliamentary bar to his recognition of our independence and i know of no other bar to his treating with america on that ground all this is however very different from a real peace the king will assuredly prefer war as long as his ministry will stand by him and the sentiments of his present ministry particularly of shelburne are as peremptory against the dismemberment of the empire as those of any of their predecessors they will at least try a campaign of negotiation against the united states and of war against their other enemies before they submit to it it is probable that the arrival of sir guy carleton will not long precede an opening of the first campaign congress will i am persuaded give a proper verbal     answer to any overtures with which he may insult them but the best answer will come from the states in such supplies of men and money as will expel him and all our other enemies from the united states we have at length brought our territorial business to an issue it was postponed sine die on the sixth instant we have transmitted the whole proceeding to the governor to be laid before the assembly there are various accounts from the west indies which render it pretty certain that an engagement has taken place between the two fleets the circumstances are not ascertained the issue seems at least to have been so far in favor of our allies as to leave them free to pursue their course with their convoy to hispaniola where a junction is to be made with the spaniards the object of this junction is universally supposed to be jamaica since i finished the above a letter has come to congress from general washington enclosing one to him from sir guy carleton announcing his commission in conjunction with admiral digby to treat of peace with this country and requesting a passport for his secretary mr morgan to bring a similar letter of compliment to congress the request will certainly be refused and general washington probably directed to receive and forward any despatches which may be properly addressed to congress a public audience was yesterday given to the minister of france in which he formally announced the birth of the dauphin it was deemed politic at this crisis to display every proper evidence of     tionate attachment to our ally the minister was accordingly received with military honors and the audience concluded with the discharge of cannon and a feu de joi of small arms a public entertainment followed and fireworks at night closed the scene the answer reported by the committee on mr danas letter gave him a cautionary instruction it afterwards went to the secretary of foreign affairs and thence i suppose in his dress to petersburg mr jones will give you more satisfactory information on this as also with respect to the answer to mr jays letter your surmises relative to a revival of paper currency alarms me it is impossible that any evil can render such an alternative eligible it will revive the hopes of the enemy increase the internal debility of the states and awaken the clamors of all ranks throughout the united states against her much more to virginias honor would it be to rescind the taxes

enclosed it with a large collection of newspapers for you which was to have been carried by mr j smith but which i have now put into the hands of capt walker whose return will be quicker little remains for me to add here our anxiety on account of the west india     news published at new york is still supported by contradictory reports and conjectures the account however to which rodneys name is prefixed renders our apprehensions too strong for our hopes rivington has been very bold in several of his spurious publications and at this conjuncture might venture as far to serve a particular turn as at any but it is scarcely credible that he would dare or be permitted to sport with so high an official name if mr jefferson will be so obliging as to superintend the legal studies of wm i think he cannot do better than prosecute the plan he has adopted the interruption occasioned by the election of mr j  although inconvenient in that respect is by no means a decisive objection agst it i did not know before that the letters which mr walker was to have carried last fall had met with the fate which it seems they did i shall be more cautious hereafter the papers missing in your list were i presume for i do not recollect contained in them the short notice does not leave me time to obtain the information you ask as to stiles i have never heard of iron stiles cast here nor do i know the price of copper ones if continental money passes here at all it is in a very small quantity at very great discount and merely to serve particular local  temporary ends it has at no time been more difficult for me to fix my probable return to virga at present all my colleagues have left congress except col bland and it     is a crisis which calls for a full representation from every state anxious as i am to visit my friends as long as i sustain a public trust i shall feel a principle which is superior to it the state of my finances also unless the assembly shall make a different provision for the delegates from what has hitherto been in force will be a serious bar to my removal from this place i shall i believe be under the necessity of purchasing a carriage of some kind besides discharging considerable arrears  where the means for effecting either are to be found is totally without my comprehension      i am etc james madison may         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia may         dear sir— your favor of the  0th was received yesterday i suspect that i have expressed myself ambiguously with respect to mr jefferson he does not allege ignorance of the report of the committee but of the title of new york which is the ground on which the report places the controversy with virginia the final report of our suit to congress for an answer to the western cession was sent by the last post mr jones can explain every thing relative to it i feel myself much disburdened by the termination of the business if it should be revived here in consequence of steps taken by the legislature i flatter myself it will be under circumstances less embarrassing     james madison may         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia may         dear sir— a letter from dr franklin of the fourth march informs the superintendent of finance that the court of france had granted an aid of six millions of livres to the united states for the present year it appears however that this aid has been wholly anticipated as well as the aids of the last year by bills of exchange by supplies for the army particularly those in holland by the debt of beaumarchais amounting to two millions and a half of livres by the interest money by the deduction on account of virginia computed at seven hundred thousand livres c the states must therefore by some means or other supply the demands of congress or a very serious crisis must ensue after the differences between the modes of feeding the army by contracts and by the bayonet have been experienced both by the army and the people a recurrence to the latter cannot be too much dreaded the province of friesland has instructed its delegates in the states general to concur in a public reception of mr adams the city of dort has done the same to theirs in the provincial assembly of holland the above letter came by the alliance which is arrived at rhode island captain barry i am told says that the marquis will come with a squadron for the american coast which was equipping if this be true barry is wrong in disclosing it i distrust it     a french cutter is since arrived after a short passage with despatches for the minister here he received them on saturday by an express from salem and has not yet communicated their contents to congress i understand through the secretary of foreign affairs that the court of london has lately proposed to the court of france a separate peace as the price of which she would place dunkirk in its former state make some sacrifices in the east indies and accede to a status quo in the west indies the answer of france was dictated by her engagements with the united states this insidious step taken at the same moment with the agency of mr carleton will i hope not long be withheld from the public we have heard nothing from this gentleman since the answer to his request of a passport for his secretary in order to explain our public affairs to the states and to urge the necessity of complying with the requisitions of congress we have determined to depute two members to visit the eastern states and two the southern the first are root and montgomery the others rutledge and clymer i put this in cypher because secrecy has been enjoined by congress the deputation will probably set off in a few days i find that the minister of france has been informed by some correspondent in virginia that the late intelligence from britain has produced very unfavorable symptoms in a large party he seems not a little discomposed at it the honor of the state     concurred with my own persuasion in dictating a consolatory answer to him for this reason as well as for others i think it would be expedient for the legislature to enter into an unanimous declaration on this point other states are doing this and such a mode of announcing the sense of the people may be regarded as more authentic than a declaration from congress the best form i conceive will be that of an instruction to the delegates do not fail to supply me with accurate and full information on the whole subject of this paragraph a letter from dr franklin of thirtieth of march enclosing a copy of one to him from mr adams at the hague was laid before congress subsequently to writing the above by these it appears not only that an essay has been made on the fidelity of france to the alliance but that the pulse of america has been at the same time separately felt through each of those ministers they both speak with becoming indignation on the subject attest the firmness of our ally and recommend decisive efforts for expelling the enemy from our country mr adams says ten or eleven cities of holland have declared themselves in favor of american independence and it is expected that today or tomorrow this province will take the decisive resolution of admitting me to my audience perhaps some of the other provinces may delay it for three or four weeks but the prince has declared that he has no hopes of resisting the torrent and therefore that he shall not attempt it the duke de la vauguyon has acted a very friendly and  00 honorable part in this business without however doing any ministerial act in it what was said above of friesland came from mr barclay the consul mr adams says nothing of that province although his letter is of later date the secretary of war has just given notice to congress that the department of finance is unable to supply the essential means of opening the campaign this shocks rather than surprises us it will be one article in the communications of the deputies above mentioned and adds force to the expediency of their mission the denial to congress of the right of granting flags is singular indeed may not the power of congress to agree to a truce be contested on the same grounds the former is a partial truce and if the silence of the confederation reserves it to the states the same silence reserves the latter admitting that congress had the right of granting flags was it not exercised to the advantage of virginia in procuring a vent to her staple and stopping the exportation of her specie james madison may         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia may         dear sir— i wrote you yesterday morning by the post fully and in cypher as i am told however the bearer will probably be in richmond before the post it may not be amiss to repeat to you that we  0  have heard nothing from carleton since our refusal of the passport to his secretary and that we have authentic information from europe that insidious attempts have been made both on doctor franklin and mr adams by british emissaries as well as tempting overtures employed to divide our ally from us these machinations have served no other end than to expose the meanness and impotence of our enemy and to supply fresh proofs of the indissoluble nature of the alliance mr adams begins to advance with considerable speed towards the object of his mission in holland the action in the west indies is still wrapt up in darkness the enclosed paper contains a specimen of the obscure and contradictory advices which have alternately excited our hopes and our apprehensions a copy of sundry resolutions of the house of delegates touching the exportation of tobacco in the flags was laid before congress yesterday by the superintendent of finance and referred to a committee on a review of the doctrine of the ninth article of confederation i believe the right of the state to prohibit in the present case the exportation of her produce cannot be controverted the states seem to have reserved at least a right to subject foreigners to the same imposts and prohibitions as their own citizens and the citizens of virginia are at present prohibited from such an exportation as is granted in favor of the british merchants this is a very interesting point and unless the division line between the authority of congress and the states be properly  0  ascertained every foreign treaty may be a source of internal as well as foreign controversy you will call to mind one now in negotiation which may be affected by the construction of this clause in the confederation congress have no authority to enter into any convention with a friendly power which would abridge such a right they cannot have a greater authority with respect to a hostile power on the other side it is equally clear that the state has no authority to grant flags for the exportation of its produce to the enemy armed vessels would not respect them nor would they be more respected in the courts of admiralty unless congress and the state therefore act in concert no tobacco can be remitted to new york and a further drain of specie must ensue when the matter was first opened in congress the impression was unfavorable to the right of the states and pretty free strictures were likely to be made on its opposition to the constitutional power of congress it became necessary therefore to recur to the law and the testimony which produced an acquiescence in the contrary doctrine their sentiments however with regard to the policy and consistency of the resolutions are very different the last resolution in particular compared with the preliminary doctrines produces animadversions which i need not recite to you there are several reasons which make me regret much this variation between congress and virginia of which a material one is that a great personage will be touched by it since it originates in his act and since a conference between  0  a committee and him and the superintendent he concurred in the expediency of granting the passports james madison june        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia june        dear sir— according to your request i send an authenticated extract from the journals of the vote of congress on the clause which interdicts british manufactures it has however been for some time in print and will probably be at richmond before you receive the manuscript copy the arguments urged against the measure appear to me in the same light in which you describe them the policy of great britain in the capture of st eustatia has been constantly reprobated by some of the wisest statesmen but whatever her policy might at that period be it is manifest that a very different one is now pursued british goods are issued from the enemys line with greater industry than they have ever been and as is universally believed with the knowledge if not at the instigation of those in power indeed they would counteract their new system in doing otherwise the sense of the eastern states will appear from the ayes and noes on the question mr adams in his last despatches ascribes much of the late pacific symptoms in the british nation and of the facilities which begin to attend the mission in holland to our proscription of the british merchandize  0  you have not sufficiently designated the papers from mr r morris from which you wish an extract i do not recollect nor can i find any letter which contains a state of the finances except his circular letters which may be found either among the legislative or executive archives if you should be disappointed in these researches i will on a renewal of your demands renew my researches my charity i own cannot invent an excuse for the prepense malice with which the character and services of this gentleman are murdered i am persuaded that he accepted his office from motives which were honorable and patriotic i have seen no proof of misfeasance i have heard of many charges which were palpably erroneous i have known others somewhat suspicious vanish on examination every member in congress must be sensible of the benefit which has accrued to the public from his administration no intelligent man out of congress can be altogether insensible of it the court of france has testified its satisfaction at his appointment which i really believe lessened its repugnance to lend us money these considerations will make me cautious in lending an ear to the suggestions even of the impartial to those of known and vindictive enemies very incredulous the same fidelity to the public interest which obliges those who are its appointed guardians to pursue with every rigor a perfidious or dishonest servant of the public requires them to confront the imputations of malice against the good and faithful one i have in the conduct of my colleague here a sure index of  0  the sentiments and objects of one of my colleagues who is absent relative to the department of finance the chevalier de la luzerne tells us he has written to the general on the subject of the transaction between them and has no doubt that the difficulties which attended it will be removed james madison june      philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia june      dear sir— general washington has transmitted to congress sundry informations he has received of preparations at new york for expediting from thence a considerable number of ships whether they are to convoy troops and whither or to bring off troops from other places is uncertain he has also transmitted to congress an answer to him from general carleton on a demand made at the instance of the legislature of south carolina of a retransportation of the exiles at the expense of the king of great britain this demand was instituted not executed during the command of clinton from whom an imperious refusal was calculated upon in pursuance of the views of the new system his successor weeps over the misfortunes of the exiles and in the most soothing language that could be framed engages to comply fully with the application this incident at once mortifies our pride and summons our vigilance we have nothing further from carleton on the main point  0  the communication expected in my last from the minister of france has been received and afforded a very seasonable occasion which was improved of renewing the assurances suited to the present crisis james madison june        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia june        dear sir— mr webb being detained till this morning i enclose the gazette of it you will find a singular extract from lord norths budget the speech was delivered on the eleventh of march it must have been mr rosss contract therefore and not mr morriss which supplied this article i am just told that the senate have put their veto on the resolutions of the house of delegates against the latter if an existing law however prohibits the exportation and one branch of the legislature protests against the authority of congress to dispense with it the executive will scarcely suffer the tobacco to be exported    the proviso in the resolutions in favor of the contract of the state agents furnishes i find a copious topic for antivirginian critics it is inconsistent with the laws of the state—with the ordinances of congress—with the treaty with france—with gratitude to our allies—for tobacco to be shipped to new york by mr morris for the advantage of the united states but if the  0  identical tobocco be shipped by mr ross for the advantage of virginia the inconsistency is done away in the eyes of the house of delegates of virginia james madison june         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia june         dear sir— i have your favor of the first instant i hope you have received mine although you do not acknowledge them my punctuality has not been intermitted more than once or twice since your departure and in no instance for a considerable time past i have written so fully concerning the flags that i have nothing to add on that subject but that i wish the senate may by their perseverance on this occasion exemplify the utility of a check to the precipitate acts of a single legislature having raised my curiosity by your hints as to certain manœuvres you will not forget your responsibility to gratify it the pleasure i feel at your being included in the commission for vindicating the claims of virginia is considerably impaired by my fears that it may retard your return hither great as my partiality is to mr jefferson the mode in which he seems determined to revenge the wrong received from his country does not appear to me to be dictated either by philosophy or patriotism  it argues  0  indeed a keen sensibility and strong consciousness of rectitude but this sensibility ought to be as great towards the relentings as the misdoings of the legislature not to mention the injustice of visiting the faults of this body on their innocent constituents sir guy carleton still remains silent the resolutions which the legislatures of the states are passing may perhaps induce him to spare british pride the mortification of supplicating in vain the forgiveness of rebels mr izard warm and notorious as his predilection for the lees is acknowledges and laments the opposition made by them to measures adapted to the public weal the letter in the first page of the gazette of this morning was written by mr marbois  in an evening of promiscuous conversation i suggested to him my opinion that the insidiousness of the british court and the good faith of our ally displayed in the late abortive attempt of the former to seduce the latter might with advantage be made known in some form  0  or other to the public at large he said he would think of the matter and next day sent me the letter in question with a request that i would revise and translate it for the press the latter of which was done i mention this that you may duly appreciate the facts and sentiments contained in this publication james madison june         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia june         dear sir— i received no letter from you yesterday nor shall i receive any for that week unless it be through the channel of rivingtons gazette the post having been robbed of his mail on saturday evening last in maryland i hope your letter did not contain anything not in cypher which is unfit for the public eye the policy however which seems to direct carletons measures renders it probable that he will decline the mean expedient pursued on such occasions by his predecessors for giving pain to individuals it will be proper for us to take from this accident an admonition to extend the use of our cypher the trade with new york begins to excite general indignation and threatens a loss of all our hard money the continued drains which it makes from the bank must at least contract its utility if it produces no greater mischief to it the legislature of new jersey are devising a remedy for this disgraceful and destructive traffic and a committee of congress are also employed in the same work i have   0 little expectation that any adequate cure can be applied whilst our foreign trade is annihilated and the enemy in new york make it an object to keep open this illicit channel james madison june         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia june         dear sir— your favor of the fifteenth being more fortunate than the preceding one came safe to hand yesterday the loss of the mail is the more provoking as it is said to have contained a packet from new york which had been intercepted on its passage to england and carried to north carolina the illicit trade with the british lines has been pushed so far under the encouragement of the enemy as to threaten a deep wound to our finances congress have renewed the exhortation to the states on this subject and recommended to the people through them a patriotic cooperation with the public measures this trade we have also discovered is carried on with considerable effect under collusive captures this branch of the iniquity falls properly within the purview of congress and an ordinance for its excision is in the hands of a committee a letter from mr adams of the eleventh of april informs his correspondent that five of the seven provinces had decided in favor of a treaty with the united states and that the concurrence of the remaining two might be expected in a few days a leyden paper     of a subsequent date reduces the exception to a single province it would seem from a memorial from the merchants to the states general that this resolution had been greatly stimulated by an apprehension that a sudden pacification might exclude their commerce from some of the advantages which england may obtain the memorial appeals to the effect of the american trade on the resources of france and to the short and indirect experience of it which holland enjoyed before the loss of st eustatia as proof of its immense consequence it observes also that the ordinance of congress against british manufactures presented a precious crisis for introducing those of other nations which ought to be the rather embraced as nothing would be so likely to dispose britain to the independence of america and a general peace as the prospect of her being supplanted in the commercial preference expected from the habits of her lost provinces the present conjecture with regard to the fleet mentioned in my late letters is that it conveyed a parcel of miserable refugees who are destined to exchange the fancied confiscations of their rebellious countrymen for a cold and barren settlement in nova scotia or penobscot james madison july        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia july        dear sir— the confidential and circumstantial communications in your favor of the twentieth of     june have afforded me much pleasure those which relate to the scheme of garbling the delegation were far from surprising me in a conversation with mr jones before he left philadelphia it was our joint inference from a review of certain characters and circumstances that such a scheme would be tried no addition has been made to our foreign intelligence in the course of the past week some of the republications from the european papers herewith sent throw light however on the general state of foreign affairs those which relate to ireland in particular are very interesting the empress of russia appears by the memorial of her ministers to be more earnest in forwarding a reconciliation between england and holland than is consistent with the delicate impartiality she has professed as mediatrix or with that regard which we flattered ourselves she felt for the interests of the united states one article of our late communications from france was that the interest on the certificates is no longer to be continued and that provision must be made within ourselves this has caused great commotion and clamor among that class of public creditors against congress who they believe or affect to believe have transferred the funds to other uses the best salve to this irritation if it could with truth be applied would be a notification that all the states had granted the impost of five per cent and that the collection and appropriation of it would immediately commence it is easy to see that the states whose jealousy and delays withhold this resource from the     united states will soon be the object of the most bitter reproaches from the public creditors rhode island and georgia are the only states in this predicament unless the acts of virginia and maryland should be vitiated by the limitations with which they are clogged no step has yet been taken in the instructions prepared before your departure i expostulated a few days ago with dr witherspoon on the subject and prevailed on him to move in the business but his motion only proved the watchfulness and inflexibility of those who think they advance towards their own objects in the same proportion as they recede from those of virginia i have since shown him the report and he is a confirmed advocate both for the innocence and expediency of it we are even at this day without official advice of the naval event of the twelfth of april in the west indies nor have we any advices of late date from that quarter there is little room to hope that the misfortune of our ally will be repaired by any subsequent enterprises congress are much perplexed by the nonappearance of connecticut at the time appointed for the meeting of her agents and those of pennsylvania we wish to avoid leaving her any pretext to revive the controversy and yet the reasons for her neglect cannot be pronounced sufficient her adversary professes a strong jealousy that she means by every artifice to parry a decision during the war and it cannot be denied that appearances but too well authorize it     report of the committee consisting of mr madison mr duane  mr clymer relative to the instructions of mr adams—july  th      mad mss  the comittee appointed to revise the instructions of mr adams c recommend that the minister plenipo at the hague be instructed in case no definitive steps shall have been taken by him in the proposed treaty of amity and commerce with the u provinces to engage them if possible in an express stipulation to furnish annually to the u states a loan of  with an interest not exceeding  the principal not to be demanded within years after the conclusion of the war and the payment of the interest to be suspended during the war or in case the u provinces shall refuse to stipulate such a loan that the said minister endeavor to obtain their engagements to authorize and countenance a loan from their subjects  to guaranty if requisite the due payment of the interest  repayment of the principal by the u states that in case definitive steps shall have been taken in the proposed treaty the said minister plenipo be instructed still to represent to the u provinces the great advantages which would result as well to them as to the u states from such pecuniary succours to the latter as would give stability to their finances and energy to their measures against the common enemy and to use his utmost address to prevail on them either to grant directly the loan abovementioned or to support by such responsibility as may be necessary the applications made to individuals for that purpose on the part of the u states the committee beg leave to observe that in the treaty between the u s  m ost c hristian majesty it is among other things stipulated that the subjects of the parties may by testament donation or otherwise dispose of their goods immoveable as well as moveable in favor of such persons as to them shall seem good and the heirs of the respective subjects wheresoever residing may succeed them ab intestato without being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization that the plan of the proposed treaty between the u s  the u p with which the minister plenipo of the former is furnished extends this privilege to the subjects of the latter under a general stipulation of the same privileges as are allowed to the most favord nation that as it is not probable that the u p have granted or will grant this privilege even to the most favored nation the said treaty if executed in its present form will engage the u s in a concession which will not be reciprocal and which if reciprocal would not be equally beneficial to the parties that in the opinion of the committee it is at least questionable whether the extension of this privilege to the subjects of other powers than france and spain will not encroach on the rights reserved by the federal articles to the individual states     that without enquiring into the inconveniences which may result from an indefinite permission to aliens to hold  transmit real estates within this country the apparent reluctance of some of the states notwithstanding the special clause in the federal articles with respect to france their favorable disposition towards her to pass the proper laws on this subject renders their compliance in case of a similar engagement to another power extremely precarious that in order to avoid these difficulties  consequences the committee recommend further that the sd minister plenipo be instructed in case no steps inconsistent therewith shall have been taken to decline stipulating to the subjects of the u provinces any right or privilege of holding any real estates within the u states  james madison july        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia july        dear sir— your favors of the twentyseventh were received this morning i sincerely regret that any reports should have prevailed injurious to the patriotism of williamsburg and particularly that my name should in any manner whatever be connected with them i informed mr jones that the minister of france had been made somewhat uneasy by some accounts from virginia and desired him to enable me to remove it by proper inquiries it must have been a very gross mistake that could have built the reports in question on this letter even if its contents had been known you saw i presume the letter i think i wrote you a letter to the same effect but i am not sure the trade with the enemy at new york has at length i am told produced spirited and successful     exertions among the people of new jersey for suppressing it the same alarm and exertions seem to be taking place in connecticut the ordinance of congress against collusive captures on water has not yet passed the mode of proof and the distribution of the effects occasioned some diversity of opinion and a recommitment ensued i am not very sanguine that any thing of efficacy will be done in the matter notwithstanding the supposed danger arising to the bank from the exportation of hard money to new york a dividend of four and a half per cent for the first half year has been advertised to the stockholders will not this be very captivating to the avarice of the dutchman in case his apprehensions shall be removed by a political connection between the two countries james madison july         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia july         dear sir— notwithstanding the defensive professions of the enemy they seem to be waging an active war against the postriders the mail for the eastward on wednesday last shared the same fate which the southern mail did a few weeks ago and it is said from the same identical villains this operation has withdrawn them from their southern stand and secured the arrival of the mail which brings your favor of the fifth instant i fully concur in the change of cypher which you suggest and understand the reference for a keyword i have been in some pain from     the danger incident to the cypher we now use the enemy i am told have in some instances published their intercepted cyphers on our first meeting i propose to prepare against another separation a cypher framed by mr livingston on a more enlarged and complicated plan than ours of which he has furnished me several blank printed copies your computation of the numbers in virginia tallies exactly with one transmitted by mr jefferson in an answer to several queries from mr marbois it is as accurate as the official returns to the executive of the militia would admit his proportion of the fencibles to the whole number of souls is stated precisely as your computation states it you will continue your information on the case of the flag and send me the acts of the legislature as fast as they are printed will you be so good also as to obtain from the auditors a state of the balance due on the principles established by law and let me know when and how it is to be applied for—as also what chance there is of obtaining a regular remittance of future allowance general washington and count rochambeau met here on saturday evening the object of their consultation is among the arcana of war a despatch from the commander in chief communicated to congress yesterday a late correspondence between him and general carleton principally on the subject of two traitors who under cover of a flag have exposed themselves to arrest in new jersey and had sentence of death passed upon them     general carleton among other observations on the subject says that in a civil war between people of one empire there can during the contest be no treason at all—and asks a passport for general robinson and mr ludlow to confer with general washington or persons appointed by him and to settle arrangements on this idea general washington declines the conference observing that the proposed subject of it is within civil resort whereupon general carleton asks—am i to apply to congress to admit persons to conferences at philadelphia can any deputation be sent by congress to your camp to meet persons appointed by me or will you sir undertake to manage our common interest the drift of all this need not be pointed out to you as a counterpart to it the british general proposes in order to remove all objection to an exchange of soldiers for seamen that the latter shall be perfectly free and the former subject to the condition of not serving against the thirteen provinces for one year within which period he is very sanguine that an end will be put to the calamities of the present war the same despatch informs congress that a party of the enemy have lately made a successful incursion upon the settlements of mohawk have reoccupied oswego and are extending themselves into the western country however little these movements may coincide with a defensive plan they coincide perfectly with ideas which will not fail to be urged at a pacification messrs montgomery and root returned yesterday     from their eastern deputation they have not yet made their report the former complains that several of the states are appropriating the taxes which they lay as their quota of the eight millions to internal uses he owns that the knowledge he has obtained of the case changed his mind on that head and that if the ground was to be trodden over again he should take a very different part in congress he adds that the current opinion is that a vessel arrived at quebec brings a royal charter for vermont that the people there are in much confusion and many of them disposed to reunite with new hampshire a letter to mr livingston from mr livermore corroborates this good news it imports that a very unexpected turn had taken place in the temper of the people between the river and the ridge that they were petitioning new hampshire to be restored to that state and that measures would be taken in concert with new york for that purpose the revolution in the sentiments of montgomery may be owing in part to the new relation in which pennsylvania stands to connecticut which he says is governed on this occasion by interested individuals the controversy between pennsylvania and connecticut will i suppose be now resumed and put into a course for decision the return of mr root having removed the cause which suspended it in the beginning of this month committees were appointed in pursuance of a previous resolution for such an appointment every halfyear to examine into the proceedings of the several executive departments   0 and make report to congress this plan was adopted not only to discharge the general duty of congress and to satisfy their constituents but also that such reports might shelter in some degree faithful officers from unmerited imputations and suspicions as well as expose to just censure those of an opposite character    this cypher i find is extremely tedious and liable to errors general carleton in his letter to general washington above quoted says with respect to lippencot only that the court had passed their judgment and that as soon as the length of the proceedings would admit a copy should be sent to him it is inferred that this murderer will not be given up and consequently a vicarious atonement must be made by the guiltless asgill james madison july         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia july         dear sir— i have at length the pleasure of presenting you with certain though not official intelligence of the recognition of our independence by the states general this event with other interesting particulars is contained in the enclosed gazettes among its salutary consequences to this country i hope the people of virginia will not be inattentive to its influence on the value of its staple on which it is very probable speculations will be attempted     the language and measures of the present administration will furnish you with copious matter for reflection if we had received fewer lessons of caution against sanguine expectations i should with confidence explain them by a scheme for a general pacification and for fathering on their predecessors all the obnoxious conditions which the public distresses may expose them to if this solution were a just one it ought at the same time to be remembered that the triumph of rodney may give a new turn to their politics it appears from the paper from which the enclosed intelligence is republished that this event had reached london that it was received with great rejoicings but that the public were still haunted with fears for jamaica other articles not included in the paper herewith sent are the capture of one if not two french seventyfours with a number of transports for the east indies by admiral barrington the capture of a british frigate with some transports by a dutch ship of war the capture of the valuable island of ceylon from the dutch by admiral hughes and of negapatam another of their important possessions on the coast of coromandel with two ships richly freighted with spices and other oriental productions ireland is likely to be indulged in every thing in addition to a free trade and a free legislation they have obtained the assent of the lord lieutenant to an act of parliament for emancipating the catholics from their shackles on their religious rights and on their tenures of real property your philanthropy will be gratified by my adding as other proofs of     the progress of light and freedom the abolition of the inquisitorial jurisdiction in sicily—the only part of the neapolitan dominions where it was in force—and the inefficiency of the popes visit to vienna in checking the liberal innovations of the emperor in his ecclesiastical polity    general washington is still here i have nothing to add to my last on the subject of lippencot and asgill james madison august        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia august        dear sir— extract of a letter from carleton and digby to general washington august the second we are acquainted sir by authority that negotiations for a general peace have already commenced at paris and that mr grenville is invested with full powers to treat with all parties at war and is now at paris in execution of his commission and we are likewise sir further made acquainted that his majesty in order to remove all obstacles to that peace which he so ardently wishes to restore has commanded his ministers to direct mr grenville that the independency of the thirteen provinces should be proposed by him instead of making it a condition of a general treaty however not without the highest confidence that the loyalists shall be restored to their possessions or a full compensation made them for whatever confiscations may have taken place     this is followed by information that transports are preparing to convey all american prisoners in england to the united states and a proposition for a general exchange in which seamen are to be placed against seamen as far as they will go and the balance in favor of great britain to be redeemed by land prisoners—the former to be free the latter not to serve in war against the thirteen provinces for one year an embarcation is taking place at new york for charleston either to reinforce that garrison or replace it the preceding letter was published in new york at the same time it was sent to general washington i commit this intelligence to your discretion making no other remark than that it clearly calls for our watchfulness at the same time that it flatters our expectations james madison august         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia august         dear sir— i transmitted to you a few days ago by express the contents of a letter from general carleton and admiral digby to general washington announcing the purpose of the british court to acknowledge the independence of the thirteen provinces our expected advices on this head from europe are not yet arrived a mr blake an opulent citizen of south carolina who came from great britain under a passport from mr laurens to new     york and thence hither assures us that the administration are serious with respect to peace and the independence of this country that the point however was carried in the cabinet by a majority of two voices only that their finances are so disordered that a continuance of the war is in a manner impracticable that the militia at new york have been thanked for their past services and told explicitly that they would not be wanted in future that the evacuation of the united states will certainly take place this fall and that a large number of transports are coming from england to remove the british garrisons probably to the west indies that these transports will contain about two thousand five hundred germans who it is supposed in case of such an evacuation will have the same destination that carleton told him and desired him to mention it at large that he was a real friend to america and wished her to be powerful rich united and happy and secure against all her enemies that he also intimated in the course of conversation that canada would probably be given up as a fourteenth member of the confederacy you will draw such conclusions from these particulars as you think fit the gentlemen of south carolina vouch for the veracity of mr blake it appears to me much more clear that the ministry really mean to subscribe to our independence than that they have renounced the hope of seducing us from the french connection the motion for revoking the power given to france has been made again and pushed with the expected     earnestness but was parried and will issue i believe in an adoption of your report with a representation thereupon to the court of france among other means of revenue the back lands have on several late occasions been referred to and at length recommended by a grand committee to the consideration of congress a motion for assigning a day to take up the report was negatived by a small majority the report has been repeated by the committee but a second experiment has not been made in congress several of the middle states seem to be facing about maryland however preserves its wonted jealousy and obstinacy in compiling the evidence of our title i suppose you will of course be furnished with all mr jeffersons lights i have lately seen a fact stated by him which shows clearly the ideas entertained by virginia with respect to her territorial limits subsequent to the resumption of the charter in a convention between commissioners on the part of the commonwealth of england and of the grand assembly of virginia in      by which the latter submit to the new government it is stipulated that virginia shall enjoy the ancient bounds and limits granted by the charters of the former kings and that a new charter shall be issued from the parliament against any that shall have entrenched upon the rights thereof     james madison august  0      philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia august  0      dear sir— in my last i informed you that the motion to rescind the control given to france over the american ministers had been parried and would probably end in an adoption of your report it was parried by a substitute so expressed as to give a committee sufficient latitude in reporting without implying on the part of congress a design to alter past instructions the composition of the committee appointed according well with the object of the substitute a report was made that the expository report should be referred to the secretary of foreign affairs to be by him revised and transmitted to the ministers in europe and that the latter should communicate so much thereof as they might judge fit to his most christian majesty    james madison august         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia august         dear sir— your favor of the sixteenth came duly to hand yesterday the hints which it gives with regard to merchandizes imported in returning flags and the intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other states merit attention the latter subject has on several occasions been mentioned in congress but i believe no committee has ever reported a remedy for the abuse a uniform rule of naturalization ought     certainly to be recommended to the states their individual authority seems if properly exerted to be competent to the case of their own citizens    we are still left without information concerning negotiations in europe so long a silence of our ministers at so interesting a crisis grows equally distressing and inexplicable the french fleet has gone into boston harbour the arrival of a british fleet on this coast is reported but disbelieved by many the french army is on its way northward from baltimore it is to proceed in five divisions the first of which is to be here about friday next congress received yesterday a letter from general washington enclosing one to him from carleton with the proceedings of the courtmartial in the case of lippencot it appears that this culprit did not deny the fact charged upon him but undertook to justify it as a necessary retaliation and as warranted by verbal orders from the board of refugees the court decided this warrant to be insufficient but acquitted him on the pretext that no malicious intention appeared carleton explicitly acknowledges and reprobates the crime and promises to pursue it in other modes complaining at the same time of irregularity in the step taken by general washington of selecting and devoting to execution an innocent and even capitulant officer before satisfaction had been formally demanded and refused general washington seems to lean to the side of compassion but asks the direction of congress what that will be may perhaps be communicated in my next     the consideration of your territorial report has been resumed the expedient which was meant to conciliate both sides proved as often happens a means of widening the breach the jealousies announced on the side mentioned in my last were answered with reciprocal jealousies from the other and the report between the two was falling to the ground when a commitment as a lesser evil was proposed and agreed to mr jones and his family arrived on sunday at germantown without halting in this city himself his lady and little son were all extremely sick during the whole journey mrs jones is still very much indisposed and mr jones considerably so they do not propose to come into the city till the salubrity of germantown shall have enabled them to encounter its noise and polluted atmosphere i cannot in any way make you more sensible of the importance of your kind attention to pecuniary remittances for me than by informing you that i have for some time past been a pensioner on the favor of haym salomon a jew broker will not the agent of mr morris give a draft payable to me for notes payable to the bearer or may not the notes be so endorsed as in case of accident to prevent payment to another in either of those cases a remittance of notes if they can be procured for me by the post will be safe but my present situation renders such a conveyance preferable to delay even if neither of the foregoing expedients be practicable show this paragraph to mr ambler if you please     james madison september        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia september        dear sir— you will again be disappointed at the opening of this since it contains no european intelligence on the subject of peace among other reasons which render it astonishing that we should be long uninformed a material one is that neither the court of france nor our ministers can be insensible of the inexpediency of leaving the people at large so exposed to misrepresentations of the enemy i am happy to find by your letter of the twentyfourth and those received from my other correspondents by yesterdays post that so cautious an ear is given to every thing which comes from them of a flattering aspect the enclosed handbill published a few days ago will inform you of the steps taken at charleston towards an evacuation of that place it is said to have given fresh violence to the fermentations in new york another petition from kentucky has been received by congress contending for the right of congress to create new states and praying for an exertion of it in their behalf a copy will be sent to the governor by the delegates mr lee moved that the original should be referred to him by congress the debate which ensued was terminated by an adjournment and has not been revived general washington writes to congress that carleton had concurred in the proposition for a   0 general cartel so far as to appoint a commissioner for that purpose there is little probability however that he has authority to settle such a cartel on the principles which congress had in view namely those of a national convention it was thought by some that this would put to the test the sincerity of their professions on the subject of independence i believe i did not acquaint you on a former occasion that the prisoners who had lately returned from captivity in england were discharged in consequence of an agreement by franklin that a like number of the army of cornwallis should be given for them this bold step at first gave much offence compassion however for the patriotic captive stifled reproaches they will probably come out yet unless subsequent events discountenance them there are it seems three letters in the postoffice from carleton to the governor which do not appear to have been licensed nor is it known how they got into that channel the curiosity of people on this point is inconceivable a very unlucky accident has happened to one of the fleet of our allies after it got safe into the harbour of boston the unskilfulness or negligence of a pilot suffered a seventyfour to strike on a rock the wound occasioned by which proved mortal most of the furniture has been saved i have not yet presented the note to cohen which you have been so good as to enclose me the general obstacle to advances here to be replaced in virginia has been the balance in trade against the     latter this is the current answer to attempts to negotiate drafts on virginia my next will inform you of the result of the experiment of your note if its success depends merely on a confidence in your credit it will certainly be productive mr ross has unlimited credit in this place may it not be made instrumental to our supply at least it would be well to consult him when an occasion presents his bills on whiteside will command any sum that may be wanted the french army has been passing through this place for several days northward the last division will pass tomorrow or the day after the praises bestowed on their discipline and sobriety in virginia are repeated here with equal cordiality and justice james madison september  0      philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia september  0      dear sir— the loss of the french seventyfour in boston harbour presented an occasion which was embraced by congress of making a small requital to their ally for his benevolent exertions in behalf of the united states they have directed the agent of marine to replace the loss by presenting in the name of the united states the ship america to the chevalier de la luzerne for the service of his most christian majesty the states were unanimous in this vote the dissenting members were bland and jones of virginia     the report of the grand committee that the western lands if ceded to the united states would be an important fund c was the subject of the deliberations of congress on thursday and friday last after the usual discussion of the question of right and a proposal of opposite amendments to make the report favor the opposite sides a turn was given to the debate to the question of expediency in which it became pretty evident to all parties that unless a compromise took place no advantage could ever be derived to the united states even if their right were ever so valid the number of states interested in the opposite doctrine rendered it impossible for the title of the united states ever to obtain a vote of congress in its favor much less any coercive measures to render the title of any fiscal importance whilst the individual states having both the will and the means to avail themselves of their pretensions might open their land offices issue their patents and if necessary protect the execution of their plans without any other molestation than the clamors of individuals within and without the doors of congress this view of the case had a manifest effect on the most temperate advocates of the federal title witherspoon moved a set of resolutions recommending to the states which had made no cessions to take up the subject and to the states whose cessions were not entirely conformable to the plan of congress to reconsider their acts and declaring that in case of a compliance of the several states claiming the back lands none of their determinations with regard to     private property within their cessions shall be reversed or altered without their consent except in cases falling within the ninth article of the confederation on this motion the report was postponed and these resolutions committed the report of the committee on the last article will probably determine the ultimate sense of congress on the pretensions of the companies every review i take of the western territory produces fresh conviction that it is the true policy of virginia as well as of the united states to bring the dispute to a friendly compromise a separate government cannot be distant and will be an insuperable barrier to subsequent profits if therefore the decision of the state on the claims of companies can be saved i hope her other conditions will be relaxed james madison september         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia september         dear sir— the gentleman by whom i wrote this morning having waited till i had the opportunity of knowing the contents of the despatches from holland i take advantage of it to add that we are disappointed by their silence with regard to peace those from mr adams relate chiefly to his transactions with the states general a letter from mr laurens of the thirtieth of may informs us that he is returning to the united states having declined the service of minister for peace there is an     uninteresting part of a letter from mr dana the first pages of it having been omitted mr berkley writes on the thirteenth of july that the mail from england subsequent to the resignation of fox burke c breathes war he confirms the success of the combined fleets against the quebec c and the sailing of a fleet from the texel consisting of eleven sail of the line five or six frigates c to cruise in the north seas and the retreat of admiral howe into port a new york paper of the seventh contains a very interesting conversation on the — july in the house of lords between shelburne and the duke of richmond on the subject of ministerial politics in which the latter assigns his reasons for not following the example of fox c and both their sentiments with respect to american independence the duke of richmond seems tolerably well reconciled to it but shelburne speaks out his antipathy without depriving himself of the plea of necessity he professes to adhere however to the principles which the administration carried into office relative to the war against america i have written this in extreme haste you will be very sensible of it by its incorrectness james madison september         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia september         dear sir— my letters by a private hand subsequent to the last post have anticipated the chief     intelligence from holland which i had allotted for the post of this week i have however one important article which at that date lay under an injunction of secrecy which has been since taken off mr adams we are informed has contracted with a mercantile house in holland for the negotiation of a loan of five millions of guilders or about ten millions of livres for which he is to give five per cent interest and four and a half per cent for commission and other douceurs and charges which will raise the interest to about six per cent the principal is to be discharged in five annual payments commencing with the tenth year from the date of the loan when the despatches left holland upwards of a million and a half of guilders had been subscribed and upwards of one million actually received the contractors however make it a condition that none of the money should be paid to the united states until the contract should be ratified by congress this ratification passed on saturday and its arrival in holland will place under the orders of mr morris the money which shall then have been procured how far the amount will by that time have been augmented is uncertain the contractors seemed to be tolerably sanguine but not absolutely sure of getting the whole sum the partial subscription already secured is a most seasonable relief to the department of finance which was struggling under the most critical difficulties in addition to the preceding fund congress have been led by a despair of supplies from the states to     sue for a further loan of four millions of dollars for the service of the ensuing and the deficiencies of the present year this demand will be addressed in the first instance to the court of france in case of miscarriage there an experiment will be made on the liberality of our new friends the legislature of rhode island has broke up without according to the impost of five per cent congress have apportioned one million two hundred thousand dollars on the states for the payment of interest to the public creditors virginia is rated somewhat lower in this requisition than in the last not however without complaints from some quarters on these subjects you will have full information from mr lee who will set off in a few days he says for virginia in order to be at the october session i should have told you that some progress had been made by mr adams in the treaty of amity and commerce with their high mightinesses his propositions with the remarks and amendments of the college of admiralty had been taken ad referendum it is somewhat extraordinary that he should omit to send us a copy of those propositions and remarks he had taken no steps towards a treaty of alliance the debates and explanations produced by the resignation of mr fox and his adherents have unveiled some of the arcana of the british cabinet i enclose them for you complete as far as they have been published here if there be any sincerity     in the party remaining in office it would seem that the war is not to be pursued against the united states nor the independence suffered to be a bar to peace we shall be able to judge better of this sincerity when the proceedings of mr grenville come to our knowledge mr cohen has advanced me fifty pounds of this currency which he says is the utmost that his engagements and the scarcity of money will permit i have given him an order on you for that sum in favor of his partner at richmond september    on friday two large french frigates bringing money c for the french army and despatches for congress and the french minister came into delaware bay for want of pilots in time they got entangled among the bars which perplex the navigation of this bay the appearance and bearing of the british fleet after pilots were obtained rendered it impossible for them to return into the proper channel the only expedient that remained was to push forward and attempt under the advantage of high water to force a passage through the shoal which obstructed them in this attempt one of them succeeded the other stuck in the sand and was lost all the public stores particularly the money on board have however been fortunately saved the captain and crew we fear have fallen into the hands of the enemy the ship it is supposed cannot be raised by them having been scuttled before they took possession of her the frigate which escaped is up at     chester we expect the despatches will be here today the marquis viominil and twenty or thirty other french officers have returned in these ships james madison september         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia september         dear sir— the substance of the despatches brought by the french frigates mentioned in my last is that mr oswald first and afterwards mr grenville had been deputed to versailles on a pacific mission that the latter was still twentyninth of june at versailles that his proposals as to the point of independence were at first equivocal but at length more explicit that he associated with the preliminary that the treaty of paris of      should be the basis of the treaty in question that as to this proposition he was answered that as far as the treaty of    might be convenient for opening and facilitating a pacification it would be admitted as a basis but that it could not be admitted in any sense that should preclude his most christian majesty from demanding such equitable arrangements as circumstances might warrant and particularly in the east indies and on the coast of africa that upon these grounds there was at first a prospect that negotiations would be opened with mutual sincerity and be conducted to a speedy and happy issue but that the success of the british navy in the west indies had     checked the ardor of the ministry for peace and that it was pretty evident they meant to spin out the negotiation till the event of the campaign should be decided you will take notice that this is a recital from memory and not a transcript of the intelligence the frigate laigle whose fate was not completely determined at the date of my last we hear has been raised by the enemy and carried to new york captain de la touche and the crew were made prisoners besides merchandize to a great value nearly fifty thousand dollars were lost most of which fell into the hands of the captors the loss of this ship is to be the more regretted as it appears that the two were particularly constructed and destined for the protection of the trade of this country our ally has added another important link to the chain of benefits by which this country is bound to france he has remitted to us all the interest which he has paid for us or was due to him on loans to us together with all the charges attending the holland loan and has moreover postponed the demand of the principal till one year after the war and agreed to receive it then in twelve successive annual payments these concessions amount to a very considerable reduction of the liquidated debt the fresh and large demand which we are about to make on him will i fear be thought an unfit return for such favors it could not however be avoided the arrears to the army in january next will be upwards of six millions of dollars taxes cannot be relied on without money there is some reason to surmise that it may   0 be as difficult to disband an army as it has been to raise an army my last informed you that mr laurens had declined serving in the commission for peace his proceedings during his captivity as stated by himself are far from unexceptionable congress nevertheless were prevailed on to assent to a resolution informing him that his services could not be dispensed with a few days after this resolution had passed several numbers of the parliamentary register were received at the office of foreign affairs in one of which was published the enclosed petition the petition was introduced by mr burke was a subject of some debate and finally ordered to lie on the table the extreme impropriety of a representative of the united states addressing that very authority against which they had made war in the language of the address determined mr jones and myself to move that the resolution above referred to should not be transmitted until the further order of congress in support of the motion it was observed that however venial the fault might be in a private view it evidently rendered mr laurens no longer a fit depository for the public dignity and rights which he had so far degraded and that if congress should reinstate him against his own desire and with this fact before their eyes it would seem as if they meant to ratify instead of disowning the degradation the motion was opposed on two grounds—first that the character of mr laurens and the silence of his letter overbalanced the testimony of the register and     rendered the fact incredible secondly that the fact although faulty ought to have no influence on the public arrangements the first objection was the prevailing one the second was abetted by but few several professed a readiness to renounce their friend in case the authenticity of the paper should be verified on the question there were five noes three ayes two divided two half votes aye the petition had been published some time ago at new york and had made some noise in new jersey but was ultimately regarded as spurious there are so many circumstances relating to this gentleman during his captivity which speak a bias towards the british nation and an undue cordiality with its new leaders that i dread his participation in the work of peace your favor of the seventh which had not arrived last postday came a few days afterwards the post having been detained by sickness the subsequent one came to hand yesterday in due time the expedient of drawing bills here on funds in virginia even the most unquestionable has been often tried by us but in vain the balance is so much against virginia that no one wants money there and the evil will increase as the prospect of peace retires your credit with mr cohen which procured me fifty pounds with two hundred dollars transmitted by mr ambler have been of much service to me but i am relapsing fast into distress the case of my brethren is equally alarming as some of mr laurenss friends strenuously maintain that the petition enclosed is spurious i     would not wish it to be made public through me until the matter be ascertained or he be present to explain it james madison september  0      philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia september  0      dear sir— the remittance to colonel bland is a source of hope to his brethren i am almost ashamed to reiterate my wants so incessantly to you but they begin to be so urgent that it is impossible to suppress them the kindness of our little friend in front street near the coffeehouse is a fund which will preserve me from extremities but i never resort to it without great mortification as he obstinately rejects all recompense the price of money is so usurious that he thinks it ought to be extorted from none but those who aim at profitable speculations to a necessitous delegate he gratuitously spares a supply out of his private stock no addition has been made to our stock of intelligence from europe since the arrival of the french frigates some letters from the marquis de la fayette and others have since come to hand but they are all of the same date with the despatches then received one of the marquiss paragraphs indeed signifies the tergiversation of mr grenville which had been only in general mentioned to us before on the communication made by this gentleman to the count de vergennes of the object of his mission     he proposed verbally the unconditional acknowledgment of american independence as a point to which the king had agreed the count de vergennes immediately wrote it down and requested him to put his name to the declaration mr grenville drew back and refused to abide by any thing more than that the king was disposed to grant american independence this illustrates the shade of difference between shelburne and fox james madison october        philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia october        dear sir— your favor of the twentyseventh of september came to hand yesterday and is a fresh instance of the friendly part you take in my necessities in consequence of the hint in your last of a pressing representation to the executive our public letter of last week touched on that subject but the letter received yesterday from the governor which seems to chide our urgency forbids much expectation from such an expedient the letter from mr ambler enclosed for me a second bill on mr holker for two hundred dollars which very seasonably enabled me to replace a loan by which i had anticipated it about three hundred and fifty more and not less would redeem me completely from the class of debtors i omitted in my last to inform you that the swedish minister at versailles had announced to dr     franklin the wish of his king to become an ally of the united states and that the treaty might be negotiated with the doctor in particular a plenipotentiary commission has in consequence issued for that purpose the model transmitted by congress is pretty analogous to the treaty with france but is limited in duration to fifteen years james madison october         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia october         dear sir— the offensive paragraph in the correspondence of mr l with mr p spoken of in your favor of the fifth was as you supposed communicated to me by mr jones i am however but very imperfectly informed of it we have not yet received a second volume of the negotiations at versailles nor any other intelligence from europe except a letter from mr carmichael dated about the middle of june which is chiefly confined to the great exertions and expectations with respect to gibraltar whilst the siege is depending it is much to be apprehended that the court of madrid will not accelerate a pacification extract of a letter from sir guy carleton to general washington dated new york september twelfth      partial though our suspension of hostilities may be called i thought it sufficient to have prevented those cruelties in the jerseys avowed which i have     had occasion to mention more than once but if war was the choice i never expected this suspension should operate further than to induce them to carry it on as is practised by men of liberal minds i am clearly of opinion with your excellency that mutual agreement is necessary for a suspension of hostility and without this mutual agreement either is free to act as each may judge expedient yet i must at the same time frankly declare to you that being no longer able to discern the object we contend for i disapprove of all hostilities both by sea and land as they only tend to multiply the miseries of individuals when the public can reap no advantage from success as to the savages i have the best assurances that from a certain period not very long after my arrival here no parties of indians were sent out and that messengers were despatched to recall those who had gone forth before that time and i have particular assurances of disapprobation of all that happened to your party on the side of sandusky except so far as was necessary for selfdefence it would seem from this paragraph that the insidious object of a separate convention with america was still pursued the symptoms of an evacuation of new york became every day less apparent our next intelligence from charleston will probably confirm our expectations as to that metropolis     james madison october         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia october         dear sir— by the vessel spoken of in my last congress have received a letter from mr adams dated hague august the eighteenth which enclosed a copy of the plenipotentiary commission issued to mr fitzherbert the british minister at brussells the following skeleton of the commission will give you an idea of its aspect towards america georgius tertius etc omnibus etc salutem cum belli incendio jam nimis diu diversis orbis terrarum partibus flagrante in id quam maxime incumbamus ut tranquillitas publica tot litibus etc rite compositis reduci etc possit—cumque eâ de causa virum quendam tanto negotio parem ad bonum fratrem nostrum regem chrismum mittere decrevimus sciatis igitur quod nos fide etc alleini fitzherbert etc confisi eundem nominavimus etc nostrum plenipotentiarum dantes etc eidem omnem potestatem etc nec non mandatum generale

quorumcunque principum et statuum quorum interesse poterit sufficiente auctoritate instructis tam singulatim ac divisim quam aggregatim ac conjunctim congrediendi etc atque cum ipsis de pace concordia etc præsentibus etc etc in palatio nostro etc    julii          the only further circumstance contained in his letter relative to the business of a pacification is the appointment of a plenipotentiary by the states general who was to set out for paris in about three weeks after the date of the letter the states of holland and west friesland had determined upon the proposed treaty of commerce and mr adams expected to have a speedy conference with the states general in order to bring it to a conclusion the secretary of war lately communicated to congress an extract of a letter from general washington of a very unwelcome tenor it paints the discontents of the army in very unusual colors and surmises some dangerous eruption unless a payment can be effected within the present year the secretary is gone to headquarters at the request of the general how far their joint precautions will calm the rising billows must be left to the result congress have reduced the estimate for the ensuing year to six millions of dollars and the requisitions on the states for the present to onethird of that sum a call for the residue is suspended till the result of the applications for loans shall be known the combined fleets have certainly gone to support the siege of gibraltar the dutch has returned to the texel according to the preconcerted plan it was to have proceeded north after disposing of its convoy and have reinforced the combined fleet the disappointment is traced up to the machinations of the prince of orange whose attachment to the     enemies of the republic seems to be fatal to all her exertions for other particulars taken from foreign gazettes i refer to those herewith enclosed and those enclosed to mr ambler james madison october         philadelphia edmund randolph to edmund randolph  philadelphia october         dear sir— some intelligence has been received from the frontiers of new york which revives the apprehensions of further inroads from canada and cooperation on the part of the vermonters the tenor of carletons letter to general washington on this subject and other circumstances render this article at least extremely doubtful the british fleet at new york has been busy in preparing for sea and will probably soon depart from that station the west indies most naturally occur as the object of its destination it is said their preparations have been much expedited by the most direct and undisguised supplies from the people of new jersey congress have been occupied for several days past with the case of lippencot referred to them by general washington on one side it was urged that the disavowal and promises by the british commander the abolition of the obnoxious board of refugees and the general change of circumstances rendered retaliation unnecessary and inexpedient on the other side it was contended that a departure     from the resolution so solemnly adopted and repeated by general washington with equal solemnity ratified by congress would be an indelible blot on our character that after the confessions on the part of the enemy of the deed complained of a greater inflexibility on our part would be looked for that after such confessions too the enemy would never suffer the innocent to perish if we persisted in demanding the guilty and finally that if they should suffer it the blood would be on their heads not on ours no definitive resolution has yet passed on the subject all the intermediate steps have been very properly entered on the secret journals general lincoln has just returned from the army he has not yet made a report to congress he says i understand that his visit has had a very salutary operation but that some pay must be found for the army where it is to be found god knows the state of the public finances has already compelled the superintendant to give a discharge to the former contractors and to accept of a new contract by which thirty per cent is added to the price of a ration in consideration of credit for three months he has on this occasion written a pressing exhortation to the states which i suppose is accessible to you mr carroll moved yesterday a resolution for accepting the territorial cession of new york it stands the order for today i regret much on this occasion the absence of mr jones   0 debates in the congress of the confederation from november  th      to

the    ocr  as highly dishonorable to congress especially as that declaration was made in order to compel the enemy to a national convention with the u s all exchanges had been previously made on the part of the former by the military authority of their generals after the letter of genl carleton  admiral digby notifying the purpose of the british king to acknowledge our independence it was thought expedient by congress to assume a higher tone it was supposed also at the time of changing this mode that it would be a test of the enemys sincerity with regard to independence as the trial had been made  the british com̃ander either from a want of power or of will had declined treating of a cartel on national ground it would be peculiarly preposterous  pusilanimous in congress to return to the former mode an adjournment suspended the vote on the question for referring the case to the sey  general to take order wednesday novr  th no congress thursday novr   on the reconsideration of the resol for exchanging the two for officers its repeal was unanimously agreed to a motion was made by mr osgood to assign an early day for filling up the vacancy in the court of appeals it was opposed on the principle of economy and the expedient suggested by mr duane of empowering a single judge to make a court until the public finances would better bear the expense in favor of the motion it was argued   that the proceedings of the court were too     important to be confided to a single judge   that the decisions of a single judge would be less satisfactory in cases where a local connection of the judge subsisted with either of the parties   that a single judge would be more apt by erroneous decisions to embroil the u s in disputes with foreign powers   that if there were more than one judge  one formed a court there might at the same time be two interfering jurisdictions and that if any remedy could be applied to this difficulty the course of decisions would unavoidably be less uniform  the provision of the confederation for a court of universal appellant jurisdiction so far contravened   as there was little reason to expect that the public finances wd during the war be more equal to the public burdens than at present and as the cases within the cognizance of this court would cease with the war the qualification annexed to the expedient ought to have no effect the motion was disagreed to  a committee which had been appointed to prepare a new ordinance for constituting the court of appeals was filled up  instructed to make report—on the above motion an opinion was maintained by mr rutledge that as the court was according to the ordinance in force to consist of three judges any two of whom to make a court unless three were in actual appointment the decisions of two were illegal congress went into the consideration of the report of the com̃ittee on the case of capt asgill the british officer allotted to suffer retaliation for the murder of capt huddy the report proposed that considering the letter of the   th of july last from the count de vergennes to genl washington interceding for capt asgill the commanderinchief be directed to set him at liberty previous to the receipt of this letter from the count de vergennes congress had been much divided as to the propriety of executing the retaliation after the professions on the part of the british commanders of a desire to carry on the war on humane principles and the promises of sr g carleton to pursue as effectually as possible the real authors of the murder some supposing that these circumstances had so far changed the ground that congress ought to recede from their denunciations others supposing     that as the condition of the menace had not been complied with and the promises were manifestly evasive a perseverance on the part of congress was essential to their honor  that moreover it would probably compel the enemy to give up the notorious author of the confessed murder after the receipt of the letter from the count de vergennes congress were unanimous for a relaxation two questions however arose on the report of the committee the  st was on what considerations the discharge of cap asgill ought to be grounded on this question a diversity of opinions existed some concurred with the committee in resting the measure entirely on the intercession of the french court alledging that this was the only plea that could apologize to the world for such a departure from the solemn declaration made both by congress and the commander in chief others were of opinion that this plea if publicly recited would mark an obsequiousness to the french court and an impeachment of the humanity of congress which greatly outweighed the circumstance urged in its favor and that the disavowal of the outrage by the british genl and a solemn promise to pursue the guilty authors of it afforded the most honorable ground on which congress might make their retreat others again contended for an enumeration of all the reasons which led to the measure lastly others were against a recital of any reasons  for leaving the justification of the measure to such reasons as would occur of themselves this last opinion after considerable discussions prevailed and the resol left as it stands on the journals the  d question was whether this release of cap asgill should be followed by a demand on gel carleton to fulfil his engagement to pursue with all possible effect the authors of the murder on one side it was urged that such a demand would be nugatory after the only sanction which could enforce it had been relinquished that it would not be consistent with the letter of the count de vergennes which solicited complete oblivion and that it would manifest to the public a degree of confidence in british faith which was not felt and ought not to be affected on the opposite side it was said that after the confession  promise of justice by gel carleton the least that could be done by gel washington would be to claim a fulfilment that the     intercession of the ct de vergennes extended no farther than to prevent the execution of capt asgill and the substitution of any other innocent victim and by no means was meant to shelter the guilty that whatever blame might fall on congress for seeming to confide in the promises of the enemy they would be more blamed if they not only dismissed the purpose of retaliating on the innocent but at the same time omitted to challenge a promised vengeance on the guilty that if the challenge was not followed by a compliance on the part of the enemy it would at least promulge and perpetuate in justification of the past measures of congress the confessions  promises of the enemy on which the challenge was grounded  would give weight to the charges both of barbarity and perfidy which had been so often brought agst them in the vote on this question   states were in favor of the demand  the others either divided or against it friday novr   the preceding question having been taken again on a further discussion of the subject there were in favor of the demand n h r i n y pa del maryd virga  of the other states some were divided a motion was made by mr rutledge of s c that the comder in chief  of the s department be respectively directed whenever the enemy shall commit any act of cruelty or violence contrary to the laws  usage of war on the citizens of these states to demand adequate satisfaction for the same and in case such satisfaction shall not be immediately given but refused or evaded under any pretext whatsoever to cause suitable retaliation to be forthwith made on british officers without waiting for directions from congress on the subject when this motion was first made it was espoused by many with great warmth in particular by the delegates of n c  s c as necessary to prevent the delays  uncertainties incident to a resort by the military commanders to congress and to convince     the enemy that notwithstanding the dismission of capt asgill the general purpose of retaliation was firmly retained  against the motion it was objected   that the time  place in which it stood would certainly convey an indirect reprehension of genl washington for bringing before congress the case of capt asgill  huddy   that it manifested a distrust in congress which however well founded it might be with respect to retaliation ought not to be proclaimed by themselves   that political  national considerations might render the interference of the supreme authority expedient of wch the letter from the ct de vergennes in the late case furnished an instance that the resort of the military commanders to the sover̃ign for direction in great and difficult cases such as those of retaliation would often prove was a right of which they ought not to be deprived but in the exercise of which they ought rather to be countenanced these objections reduced the patrons of the motion to the delegates of n c  s c alone or nearly so in place of it the declaratory motion on the journals was substituted this again was objected to as implying that in the cases of retaliation taken up by the mily commanders they had proceeded on doubtful authority to remove this objection the amendment was proposed limiting the preamble to the single act of discharging capt asgill this however was not entirely satisfactory because that particular act could have no constructive influence on the reputed authority of the generals it was acceded to by the votes of several who were apprehensive that in case of rejecting it the earnestness of some might obtrude a substitute less harmless or that the resolution might pass without the preamble  be more offensive to the commander in chief the first apprehension was the prevailing motive with many to agree to the proposition on the final question     this day a letter was recd from gel washington inclosing one of the    of ocr from sr g carleton relative to the demand made on him for a liquidation of accts and payment of the balance due for the maintenance of prisoners of war in which the latter used an asperity of language so much the reverse of his preceding correspondence that many regard it as portending a revival of the war against the u s saturday  monday no congress tuesday    novr the reappointment of mr jefferson as minister plenipo for negotiating peace was agreed to unanimously and without a single adverse remark  the act took place in consequence of its being   0 suggested that the death of mrs j had probably changed the sentiments of mr j with regard to public life  that all the reasons which led to his original appointment still existed and indeed had acquired additional force from the improbability that mr laurens would actually assist in the negotiation a motion was made by mr rutledge declaring that when a matter was referred to any of the departments to take order it was the sense  meaning of congress that the same should be carried into execution on this motion some argued that such reference amounted to an absolute injunction others insisted that it gave authority but did not absolutely exclude discretion in the executive departments the explanation that was finally acquiesced in as most rational  conformable to practice was that it not only gave authority but expressed the sense of congress that the measure ought to be executed leaving it so far however in the discretion of the executive department as that in case it differed in opinion from congress it might suspend execution  state the objections to congress that their final direction might be given in the course of debate it was observed by mr madison that the practice of referring matters to take order especially where money was to be issued was extremely exceptionable inasmuch as no entry of such proceedings was made on the journals but only noted in a memorandum book kept by the secretary and then sent to the department with the reference to take order indorsed by the secy but not signed by him so that the transaction even where public in its nature never came before the public eye  the dept was left with a precarious voucher for its justification the motion was in the end withdrawn the mover alledging that as he only aimed at rendering an uncertain point clear  this had been brought about by a satisfactory explanation he did not wish for any resolution on the subject wednesday    novr no congress     thursday    novr the proceedings were confined to the report of the committee on the case of vermont entered on the journals as it was notorious that vermont had uniformly disregarded the recommendation of congress of      the report which ascribed the evils prevalent in that district to a late act of n y which violated that recommendation was generally admitted to be unjust  unfair mr howel was the only member who openly supported it the delegates from n y denied the fact that any violation had been committed on the part of that state the temper of congress on this occasion as the yeas  nays shew was less favorable to vermont than on any preceding one—the effect probably of the territorial cession of n york to the u s in the course of the debate mr howel cited the case of kentucky as somewhat parallel to that of vermont said that the late creation of a separate court by virga for the former resembled the issuing of commissions by n y to the latter that the jurisdiction would probably be equally resisted  the same violences would follow as in vermont he was called to order by mr madison the president  the plurality of congress supported and enforced the call no congress till  novr monday    × the journals sufficiently explain the proceedings of those days  tuesday

the case lately decided by the court of appeals—mad mss     wednesday novr  0th congress went into consideration of the report of a committee consisting of mr carrol mr mckean  mr howel on two memorials from the legislature of pennsylvania the memorials imported a disposition to provide for the creditors of the u s within the state of pena out of the revenues allotted for congress unless such provision could be made by congress the report as an answer to the memorials acknowledged the merit of the public creditors professed the wishes of congress to do them justice referring at the same time to their recommendation of the impost of   per ct which had not been acceded to by all the states to the requisition of   00000 drs for the payment of one years interest on the public debt and to their acceptance of the territorial cession made by n y after some general conversation in which the necessity of the impost as the only fund on which loans could be expected  the necessity of loans to supply the enormous deficiency of taxes were urged as also the fatal tendency of the plan intimated in the memorials as well to the union itself as to the system actually adopted by congress the report was committed      a motion was made by mr rutledge  ded by mr williamson to instruct the committee to report the best mode of liquidating the domestic debts and of obtaining a valuation of the land     within the several states as the article of confederation directs—the first part of the instruction was negatived provision having been previously made on that head in place of it the superintendt of finance was instructed to report the causes which impede that provision the  d part was withdrawn by the mover a committee however was afterwards appointed consisting of mr rutledge mr nash mr duane mr osgood  mr madison to report the best scheme for a valuation thursday novr    a report was made by a committee to whom had been referred several previous reports  propositions relative to the salaries of foreign ministers delivering it as the opinion of the committee that the salaries allowed to ministers plenipoty to wit £  00 sterlg would not admit of reduction but that the saly allowed to secretaries of legations to wit £ 000 sterlg ought to be reduced to £ 00 this committee consisted of mr duane mr izard  mr madison the last of whom disagreed to the opinion of his colleagues as to the reduction of the £  00 allowed to mrs plenipoy agst a reduction it was argued that not only justice but the dignity of the u s required a liberal allowance to foreign servants that gentlemen who had experienced the expence of living in europe did not think that a less sum would be sufficient for a decent style and that in the instance of mr a lee the expences claimed by him  allowed by congress exceeded the fixed salary in question in favor of a reduction were urged the poverty of the u s the simplicity of republican governments the inconsistency of splendid allowances to ministers whose chief duty lay in displaying the wants of their constituents and soliciting a supply of them and above all the policy of reconciling the army to the economical arrangements inposed on them by extending the reform to every other department the result of this discussion was a reference of the report to another committee consisting of mr williamson mr osgood  mr carrol     a motion was made by mr howel  ded by mr arnold recommending to the several states to settle with  satisfy at the charge of the u s all such temporary corps as had been raised by them respectively with the approbation of congress the repugnance which appeared in congress to go into so extensive  important a measure at this time led the mover to withdraw it a motion was made by mr madison seconded by mr jones that the secy of f affairs be authorized to communicate to forn ministers who may reside near congress all such articles of intelligence recd by congress as he shall judge fit  that he have like authority with respect to acts  resolutions passed by congress reporting nevertheless the communications which in all such cases he shall have made it was objected by some that such a resolution was unnecessary the secy being already possessed of the authority it was contended by others that he ought previously to such communication to report his intention to do so others again were of opinion that it was unnecessary to report at all the motion was suggested by casual information from the secy that he had not com̃unicated to the french minister the reappointment of mr jefferson no act of congress having empowered or instructed him to do so the motion was committed to mr williamson mr madison  mr peters friday novr    a considerable time previous to this date a letter had been recd by congress from mr h laurens informing them of his discharge from captivity and of his having authorized in the british ministry an expectation that earl cornwallis sd in his turn be absolved from his parole shortly after a letter from docr franklin informed congress that at the pressing instance of mr l and in consideration of the offer of genl burgoyne for mr l by congress as well as the apparent reasonableness of the thing he had executed an instrument setting cornwallis at liberty from his parole until the pleasure of congress should be known these papers had been committed to mr rutledge mr     mongomery  mr madison who reported in favor of the ratification of the measure against the opinion however of mr r the first member of the committee the report after some discussion had been recommitted  had lain in their hands until being called for it was thought proper by the committee to obtain the sense of congress on the main question whether the act sd be ratified or annulled in order that a report might be made correspondent thereto with this view a motion was this day made by mr m  ded by mr osgood that the committee be instructed to report a proper act for the ratification of the measure in support of this motion it was alledged that whenever a public minister entered into engagements without authority from his sovereign the alternative which presented itself was either to recall the minister or to support his proceedings or perhaps both that congress had by their resolution of the seventeenth day of september refused to accept the resignation of mr l and had insisted on his executing the office of a minister plenipo and that on the twentieth day of september they had rejected a motion for suspending the said resolution that they had no option therefore but to fulfil the engagement entered into on the part of that minister that it would be in the highest degree preposterous to retain him in so dignified and confidential a service and at the same time stigmatize him by a disavowal of his conduct and thereby disqualify him for a proper execution of the service that it was improper to send him into negotiations with the enemy under an impression of supposed obligations that this reasoning was in a great degree applicable to the part which docr franklin had taken in the measure that finally the marquis de la fayette who in consequence of the liberation of cornwallis had undertaken an exchange of several officers of his family would also participate in the mortification that it was overrating far the importance of cornwallis to sacrifice all these considerations to the policy or gratification of prolonging his captivity on the opposite side it was said that the british govt having treated mr l as a traitor not as a prisoner of war having refused to exchange him for genl burgoyne and having declared by the british genl at n york that he had been freely discharged neither mr l nor congress would be bound either in honor or justice to     render an equivalent and that policy absolutely required that so barbarous an instrumt of war and so odious an object to the people of the u s should be kept as long as possible in the chains of captivity that as the latest advices rendered it probable that mr l was on his return to america the commission for peace would not be affected by any mark of disapprobation which might fall on his conduct that no injury could accrue to docr franklin because he had guarded his act by an express reservation for the confirmation or disallowance of congress that the case was the same with the marquis de la fayette that the declaration agst partial exchanges until a cartel on national principles sd be established wd not admit even an exchange antecedt thereto these considerations were no doubt with some the sole motives for their respective votes there were others however who at least blended with them on one side a personal attachment to mr l and on the other a dislike to his character and a jealousy excited by his supposed predilection for g b by his intimacy with some of the new ministry by his frequent passing to  from g b by the eulogiums pronounced on him by mr burke in the house of commons and by his memorial whilst in the tower to the parliamt the last consideration was the chief ground on which the motion had been made for suspending the resolution which requested his continuance in the commission for peace in this stage of the business a motion was made by mr duane  ded by mr rutledge to postpone the consideration of it which being lost a motion was made by mr williamson to substitute a resolution declaring that as the b govt had treated mr l with so unwarrantable a rigor  even as a traitor and cornwallis had rendered himself so execrable by his barbarities congress could not ratify his exchange—an adjournment was called for in order to prevent a vote with so thin  divided a house monday novr    no congress till a letter from the lt govr of r i was read containing evidence that some of the leaders in vermt and particularly luke nolton     who had been deputed in the year    0 to congress as agent for that party opposed to its independence but who had since changed sides had been intriguing with the enemy in n y the letter was committed see nor    the consideration of the motion for ratifying the discharge of cornwallis was resumed mr williamson renewed his motion which failed mr mckean suggested the expedient of ratifying the discharge on condition that a general cartel should be acceded to this was relished at first by several members but a development of its inefficacy and inconsistency with national dignity stifled it a motion was made by mr rutledge  ded by mr ramsay that the discharge should be ratified in case mr l should undertake the office of commissioner for peace this proposition was generally considered as of a very extraordinary nature and after a brief discussion withdrawn in the course of these several propositions most of the arguments stated on friday last were repeated col hamilton who warmly  urgently espoused the ratification as an additional argument mentioned that some intimations had been given by colonel l of the army with the privity of genl w to cornwallis previous to his capitulation that he might be exchanged for his father then in the tower the rept of the committee on mr ms motion on the    inst relative to the secy of f affairs passed without opposition tuesday novr    no congress but a grand committee composed of a member from each state the states of n h  massts having redeemed more than their quota of the emissions prior to the   th of march    0 had called on congress to be credited for the surplus on which the superintendt of finance reported that they ought to be credited at the rate of   dollar specie for  0 of the sd emission according to the act of march aforesaid  this report being judged by congress     unjust as the money had been called in by those states at a greater depreciation was disagreed to whereupon a motion was made by mr osgood that the states who had redeemed a surplus should be credited for the same according to its current value at the time of redemption this motion with a letter afterwards recd from the state of mass on the same subject was referred to the grand committee in question the committee were unanimous that justice required an allowance to the states who sd sink a surplus to be apportioned on the different states the different expedients were   that congress sd renew their call on the states to execute the acts of the   th of m    0 and leave it to the states to level the money by negotiations among themselves this was mr hamiltons idea the objections against it were that either nothing wd be done in the case or the deficient states wd be at the mercy of the hoarding states altho the former were perhaps prevented from doing their part by invasions  the prosperity of the latter enabled them to absorb an undue proportion by mr madison it was proposed that congress should declare that whenever it sd appear that the whole of the bills emitted prior to the   th of m    0 shall have been collected into the treasuries of the several states congress wd proceed to give such credit for any surplus above the quotas assigned as equity might require and debit the deficient states accordingly in favor of this expedient it was supposed that it would give a general encouragement to the states to draw the money outstanding among individuals into the public treasuries and render a future equitable arrangemt by congress easy the objections were that it gave no satisfaction immediately to the complaining states  would   0 prolong the internal embarrassments which have hindered the states from a due compliance with the requisitions of congress it was lastly proposed by mr fitzsimmons that the commissioners appointed to traverse the u s for the purpose of settling accounts should be empowered to take up all the outstanding old money and issue certificates in place of it in specie value according to a rule to be given them by congress the amount of the certificates to be apportioned on the states as part of the public debt the same rule to determine the credit for redemptions by the states this proposition was on the whole generally thought by the committee least objectionable and was referred to a subcommittee composed of mr rutledge mr fitzsimmons  mr hamilton to be matured  laid before the g come one consideration suggested by mr hamilton in its favor was that it would multiply the advocates for federal funds for discharging the public debts and tend to cement the union      wednesday novr   th the report of the committee on the letter from the lt govr of r island see novr    was made  taken into consideration     it was moved by mr mckean to insert in the first clause on the journal after directing the apprehension by genl w in order that the sd persons may be brought to trial the reason urged for the motion was that it might appear that the interposition was not meant to supersede civil process further than the necessity of the case required agst the motion it was urged that it would lead to discussions extremely perplexing  dilatory  that it would be more proper after the apprehension sd have taken place—the motion was lost   states only being for it with respect to the main question it was agreed on all sides that it was indispensable to the safety of the u s that a traitorous intercourse between the inhabitants of vermont  the enemy should be suppressed there were however two modes proposed for the purpose viz the direct  immediate interposition of the military force according to the report and  dly a reference in the first instance to the acting authority in vermont to be followed in case of refusal or neglect of justice on the offenders by an exertion of compulsive measures against the whole body in favor of the  st mode it was sd that it would be the only effectual one  the only one consistent with the part congress had observed with regard to vermont since a reference to the authority of vermont which had itself been suspected  accused would certainly be followed at the best by a mere mock trial and would moreover be a stronger recognition of its independence than congress had made or meant to make in favor of the  d mode it was alledged that the body of the people in vermont were well attached to the revolution that a sudden march of military force into the country might alarm them that if their rulers abetted the traitors it wd disgrace them in the eyes of their own people and that congress would be justified in that event to split vermont up among the other states this expression as well as the arguments on this side in general came from mr howell of r i whose object was to render the proceedings of congress as favorable as possible to the independence of vermont in order to compromise the matter mr arnold moved that the comander in chief sd be directed to make a previous communication of his intentions  the evidence on which they were founded     to the persons exercising authority within the district in question it was suggested by mr madison as a better expedient that he sd be authorized to make the communication if he should deem it conducive to the more certain apprehension of the suspected persons the delegates from n y said they would agree that after the apprehension should have been effected the commander might give notice thereof to the persons exercising authority in vermont it was finally compromised as it stands on the journal in the course of the debate mr clark informed congress that the delegates of n jersey could not vote for any act which might oppose force to the authority of vermont the legislature of that state having so construed the resolutions of the     0th of aug as to be incompatible therewith  accordingly instructed their delegates the communication directed to the states on this occasion thro the commander in chief was objected to by several members as an improper innovation the object of it was to prevent the risk of discovery if sent before the plans which might be taken by genl w were sufficiently advanced of which he was the proper judge thursday novr   th no congress mr livingston secy of f affairs called upon me  mentioned his intention to resign in a short time his office observing that as he ultimately was decided to prefer his place of chancellor in n york to the other and the two had become incompatible by the increase of business in the former he thought it expedient not to return to phila after a visit to n y which was required by this increase in the course of conversation he took notice that the expence of his appoint under congress had exceeded his salary about  000 dollrs per annum he asked me     whether it was probable mr jefferson would accept the vacancy or whether he would accept mr jays place in spain and leave the vacancy to the latter i told him i thought mr j wd not accept it himself  doubted whether he would concur in the latter arrangement as well as whether congress would be willing to part with mr jays services in the negotiations of peace but promised to sound mr j on these points by the first opportunity  monday decr  d no congress untill the secy of foreign affairs resigned his office assigning as a reason the increase of business in his office of chancellor of n y whereby it was become impossible for him to execute the duties of both informing congress at the same time as a rule for providing for his successor that his expences exceeded his salary upwards of  000 dollrs per annum the letter of resignation was committed to mr mckean mr osgood c      tuesday decr   after a verbal report of the committee above mentioned who acquainted congress that in conference with mr livingston he professed a willingness to remain in office till the  st of jany to give time for the choice of a successor mr mckean proposed the resolution which stands on the secret journals several alterations having been made however in the course of its consideration with respect to the preamble particularly a change took place as it was first moved it recited as the ground of the resignation the incompatibility of the office of foreign affairs with the chancellorship of n y to this recital it was objected by mr madison that such a publication of preference of the office of chancellor of a particular state to the office of foreign affairs under the u s tended to degrade the latter whereupon the preamble on the journal was substituted in the course of this business the expediency of augmenting the salary was suggested but not much supported mr howel  mr clark opposed it strenuously the report of the committee on the case of vermont mentioned on thursday the    of novr was called for by mr mckean  postponed on his motion to make way for a set of resolutions declaring that as vermont in contempt of the authority of congress  their recommendations of —       exercised jurisdiction over sundry persons professing allegiance to the state of n y banishing them and stripping them of their possessions the former be required to make restitution c and that in case of refusal or neglect congress will enforce the same c a motion was made by mr clark  nd by mr howel to strike out the latter clause in favor of which it was said that such a menace ought to be suspended until vermont should refuse     to comply with the requisition especially said mr howel as the present proceeding being at the instance of phelps  other exiles was an ex parte one against the motion for expunging the clause it was observed that a requisition on vermont without such a menace wd have no effect that if congress interposed they ought to do it with a decisive tone that as it only enforced restitution in cases where spoliations had been committed and therefore was conditional the circumstance of its being ex parte was of no weight especially as congress cd not call on vermt to appear as a party after her repeated protestations agst appearing on this occasion mr carroll informed congress that he had entirely changed his opinion with regard to the policy requisite with regard to vermt being thoroughly persuaded that its leaders were perfidious men  that the interest of the u s required their pretensions to be discountenanced that in this opinion he was not a little confirmed by a late conversation with genl whipple of n hampshire at trenton in which this gentleman assured him that the governing party in vermont were perfidiously devoted to the british interests  that he had reason to believe that a british com̃ission for a govr of that district had come over  was ready to be produced at a convenient season some of the members having gone out of congress  it being uncertain whether there would be more than six states for the clause an adjournment was moved for  voted the proceedings on this subject evinced still more the conciliating effect of the territorial cession of n york on several states  the effect of the scheme of an ultramontane state within pennsa on the latter state the only states in congress which stood by vermont were rhode island which is supposed to be interested in lands in vermt and n jersey whose delegates were under instructions on the subject wednesday decr   after the passing of the resolution concerning cap p jones      a motion was made by mr madison to reconsider the same that it might be referred to the agent of marine to take order as a better mode of answering the same purpose since it did not become the sovereign body to give public sanction to a recommendation of capt jones to the commander of the french squadron especially as there was no written evidence that the latter had signified a disposition to concur in the project of capt jones the motion was lost a few states only being in favor of it the reason assigned by those who voted against the promotion of cols to brigads according to districts was that such a division of the u s tends to foster local ideas and might lead to a dismemberment the delegates from penna reminded congress that no answer had been given to the memorials see novr  0 from that state that the legislature were proceeding in the measure intimated in the said memorials and that they meant to finish it  adjourn this evening  the reasons mentioned by the delegates as prevailing     with the legislature were  st the delay of congress to give an answer which was deemed disrespectful  d the little chance of any funds being provided by congress for their internal debts  dly the assurance given by one of their members mr jos mont—g—y mentioned privately not on the floor that no impediment to the support of the war cd arise from it since congress had provided means for that purpose in europe a committee consisting of mr rutledge mr madison  mr hamilton was appointed to confer immediately with a committee from the legislature on the subject of the memorials  were instructed to make such communications relative to our affairs abroad as would correct misinformations the comittee which met them on the part of the legislature were mr jos montgomery mr hill  mr jacob rush the committee of congress in the conference observed that the delay of an answer had proceeded in part from the nature of so large an assembly of which the comittee of the legislature cd not be insensible but principally from the difficulty of giving a satisfactory one until rhode island sd accede to the impost of       per ct of which they had been in constant expectation that with respect to the prospect from congress for the public creditors congress had required of the states interest for the ensuing year had accepted the territorial cession of n y and meant still to pursue the scheme of the impost that as to their affairs in europe the loan of   millions of livres only last year had been procured from france by dr franklyn in place of    asked by him the whole of which had been applied that the loan of  000000 guilders opened by mr adams had advanced to about  ½ million only and there seemed little progress to have been made of late that the application for   million as part of the estimate for the ensuing year was not founded on any previous information in its favor but against every intimation on the subject  was dictated entirely by our necessities so that if even no part of the requisitions from the states sd be denied or diverted the support of the war the primary object might be but deficiently provided for that if this example which violated the right of appropriation delegated to congress by the federal articles should be set by pa it would be both followed by other states  extended to other instances that in consequence our system of administration and even our bond of union wd be dissolved that the enemy would take courage from such a prospect and the war be prolonged if not the object of it be endangered that our national credit would fail with other powers  the loans from abroad which had been our chief resource fail with it that an assumption by individual states of the prerogative of paying their own citizens the debts of the u s out of the money required by the latter was not only a breach of the federal system but of the faith pledged to the public creditors since payment was mutually guaranteed to each  all of the creditors by each  all of the states and that lastly it was unjust with respect to the states themselves on whom the burden would fall not in proportion to their respective abilities but to the debts due to their respective citizens and that at least it deserved the consideration of pa whether she would not be loser by such an arrangement on the side of the other comittee it was answered that the measure cd not violate the confederation because the requisition   0 had not been founded on a valuation of land that it would not be the first example n h  n y havg appropriated money raised under requisitions of congress that if the other states did their duty in complying with the demands of congress no inconvenience would arise from it that the discontents of the creditors wd prevent the payment of taxes mr hill finally asking whether it had been considered in congress how far delinquent states cd be eventually coerced to do justice to those who performed their part to all which it was replied that a valuation of land had been manifestly impossible during the war—that the apportionments made had been acquiesced in by pa and therefore the appropriation could not be objected to that altho other states might have set previous examples these had never come before congress  it wd be more honorable for pa to counteract than to abet them especially as the example from her weight in the union  the residence of congress wd be so powerful that if other states did their duty the measure wd be superfluous that the discontents of the creditors might always be answered by the equal justice  more pressing necessity which pleaded in favor of the army who had lent their blood  services to their country and on whom its defence still rested that congress unwilling to presume a refusal in any of the states to do justice cd not anticipate it by a consideration of the steps wch such refusal might require  that ruin must ensue if the states suffered their policy to be swayed by such distrusts the comittee appeared to be considerably impressed with these remarks  the legislature suspended their plan thursday decr  th      mr lowel  mr reed were elected judges of the court of appeals mr p smith of n jersey had the vote of that state and mr merchant  of rhode island the vote of that state the resolutions respecting vermont moved by mr mckean on the twentyseventh day of november were taken into consideration they were seconded by mr hamilton as entered on the journal of this day previous to the question on the     coercive clause mr madison observed that as the preceding clause was involved in it  the federal articles did not delegate to congress the authority about to be enforced it would be proper in the first place to amend the recital in the previous clause by inserting the ground on which the authority of congress had been interposed some who voted against this motion in this stage having done so from a doubt as to the point of order it was revived in a subsequent stage when that objection did not lie the objections to the motion itself were urged chiefly by the delegates from rhode island and with a view in this as in all other instances to perplex  protract the business the objections were  st that the proposed insertion was not warranted by the act of n hampshire which submitted to the judgment of congress merely the question of jurisdiction  dly that the resolutions of aug      concerning vermont havg been acceded to by vermont annulled all antecedent acts founded on the doubtfulness of its claim to independence in answer to the  st objn the act of n h was read wch in the utmost latitude adopted the resolus of congress which extended expressly to the preservation of peace  order  prevention of acts of confiscation by one party agst another to the  d objn it was answered  st that the sd resons of aug being conditional not absolute the accession of vermont cd not render them definitive but  dly that prior to this accession vermont havg in due form rejected the resolns and notified the rejection to congress the accession could be of no avail unless subsequently admitted by congress  dly that this doctrine had been maintained by vermont itself wch had declared that inasmuch as the resolns of aug did not correspond wth their overtures previously made to congress these had ceased to be obligatory wch act it was to be observed was merely declaratory not creative of the annulment the original motion of mr mckean  mr hamilton was agreed to seven states voting for it r i  n j in the negative friday   decr an ordinance extending the privilege of franking letters to the heads of all the departments was reported  taken up various ideas were thrown out on the subject at large some contending     for the extension proposed some for a partial adoption of it some for a total abolition of the privilege as well in members of congress as in others some for a limitation of the privilege to a definite number or weight of letters those who contended for a total abolition represented the privilege as productive of abuses as reducing the profits so low as to prevent the extension of the establishment throughout the u s and as throwing the whole burden of the establishment on the mercantile intercourse—on the other side it was contended that in case of an abolition the delegates or their constitutents would be taxed just in proportion to their distance from the seat of congress which was neither just nor politic considering the many other disadvantages which were inseparable from that distance that as the correspondence of the delegates was the principal channel through which a general knowledge of public affairs was diffused any abridgment of it would so far confine this advantage to the states within the neighbourhood of congress  that as the correspondence at present however voluminous did not exclude from the mail any private letters which wd be subject to postage and if postage was extended to letters now franked the no  size of them would be essentially reduced the revenue was not affected in the manner represented the ordinance was disagreed to  the subject recommitted wth instruction to the committee giving them ample latitude for such report as they should think fit a boston newspaper containing under the providence head an extract of a letter purporting to be written by a gentleman in philada and misrepresenting the state of our loans as well as betraying the secret proposal of the swedish court to enter into a treaty with the u s with the view of disproving to the people of r island the necessity of the impost of   p ct had been handed about for several days from the style and other circumstances it carried strongly the appearance of being written by a member of congress the unanimous suspicions were fixed on mr howel the mischievous tendency of such publications  the necessity of the interposition of congress were also general subjects of conversation it was imagined too that a detection of the person suspected would destroy in his state that influence which he exerted in misleading its counsels with respect to the     impost these circumstances led mr williamson to move the proposition on this subject  it was opposed by no one mr clark supposing it to be levelled in part at him rose  informed congress that not considering the article relative to sweden as secret in its nature and considering himself at liberty to make any communications to his constituents he had disclosed it to the assembly of n jersey he was told that the motion was not aimed at him but the doctrine advanced by him was utterly inadmissible mr rutledge observed that after this frankness on the part of mr clarke as well as from the respect due from every member to congress  to himself it might be concluded that if no member present should own the letter in question no member present was the author of it mr h was evidently perturbated but remained silent the conference with the committee of the legislature of penna with subsequent information had rendered it very evident that unless some effectual measures were taken against separate appropriations  in favor of the public creditors the legislature of that state at its next meeting would resume the plan which they had suspended mr rutledge in pursuance of this conviction moved that the superintendt of finance be instructed to represent to the several states the mischiefs which such appropriations would produce it was observed with respect to this motion that however it might be as one expedient it was of itself inadequate that nothing but a permanent fund for discharging the debts of the public would divert the states from making provision for their own citizens that a renewal of the call on r island for the impost ought to accompany the motion that such a combination of these plans would mutually give efficacy to them     since r island would be solicitous to prevent separate appropriations  the other states would be soothed with the hope of the impost these observations gave rise to the motion of mr hamilton which stands on the journal  agst mr rutledges part of the motion no objection was made but the sending a deputation to rhode island was a subject of considerable debate in which the necessity of the impost in order to prevent separate appropriations by the states to do equal justice to the public creditors to maintain our national character  credit abroad to obtain the loans essential for supplying the deficiencies of revenue to prevent the encouragement which a failure of the scheme would give the enemy to persevere in the war was fully set forth the objections except those wch came agst the scheme itself from the delegates of r island were drawn from the unreasonableness of the proposition congress ought it was said to wait for an official answer to their demand of an explicit answer from r i before they could with propriety repeat their exhortations to which it was replied that altho this objection might have some weight yet the urgency of our situation and the chances of giving a favorable turn to the negotiations on foot for peace rendered it of little comparative significance the objections were finally retracted and both the propositions agreed to the deputation elected were mr osgood mr mifflin  mr nash taken from different parts of the u s  each from states that had fully adopted the impost and would be represented in congress wthout them except mr osgood whose state he being alone was not represented without him     saturday decr   no congress the grand committee met again on the business of the old paper emissions and agreed to the plan reported by the subcommittee in pursuance of mr fitzsimmons motion vz that the outstanding bills should be taken up  certificates issued in place thereof at the rate of   real dollar for — nominal ds and that the surpluses redeemed by particular states shod be credited to them at the same rate mr carrol alone dissented to the plan alledging that a law of maryland was adverse to it which he considered as equipollent to an instruction for filling up the blank several rates were proposed  st   for  0 on which the votes were no except mr howell  d   for    no mr white  mr howell ay  d   for  00 no mr hamilton  mr fitzsimmons ay  th   for   0 no mr fitzsimmons ay the reasons urged in favor of   for  0 were—first an adherence to public faith secondly that the depreciation of the certificates would reduce the rate sufficiently low they being now negotiated at the rate of three or four for one the reason for   for    that the bills passed at that rate when they were called in in the eastern states for   for  00—that as popular ideas were opposed to the stipulated rate and as adopting the current rate might hurt the credit of other securities which derived their value from an opinion that they would be strictly redeemed it was best to take an arbitrary rate leaning to the side of liberality—for   for   0 that this was the medium depreciation when the circulation ceased the opposition to these several rates came from the southern delegates in some of whose states none in others but little had been redeemed  in all of which the depreciation had been much greater on this side it was observed by mr madison that the states which had redeemed a surplus or even their quotas had not done it within the period fixed by congress but in the last stages of depreciation  in a great degree even after the money had ceased to circulate that since the supposed cessation the money had generally changed hands at a value far below any rate that had been named that the principle established by     the plan of the   th of march    0 with respect to the money in question was that the holder of it sd receive the value at which it was current  at which it was presumed he had received it that a different rule adopted with regard to the same money in different stages of its downfall wd give general dissatisfaction the committee adjourned without coming to any decision monday  th decr no congress tuesday  0 decr a motion was made by mr ramsay directing the secy at war who was abt to visit his family in massachusetts to take vermont in his way  deliver the resolutions passed a few days since to mr chittenden for the motion it was urged that it would ensure the delivery would have a conciliating effect and would be the means of obtaining true and certain knowledge of the disposition  views of that people on the opposite side it was exclaimed agst as a degradation of so high a servt of the u s as exposing him to the temerity of leaders who were on good ground suspected of being hostile to the u s and as treating their pretensions to sovereignty with greater complaisance than was consistent with the eventual resolutions of congress the motion was rejected a motion was made by mr gilman that a day be assigned for determining finally the affair of vermont the opposition made to the motion itself by rhode island  the disagreement as to the day among the friends of the motion prevented a decision  it was suffered to lie over for the letter of the

british prisoners to hire themselves out on condition of a bond from the hirers for their return the measure was not opposed but was acquiesced in by some only as conformable to antecedent principles established by congress on this subject col hamilton in particular made this explanation mr wilson made a motion referring the transmission of the resolutions concerning vermont to the secy at war in such words as left him an option of being the bearer without the avowed sanction of congress the votes of virga  n york negatived it the presidt informed congress that he should send the resolutions to the commander in chief to be forwarded thursday decr    the report made by mr williamson mr carrol and mr madison touching the publication in the boston paper supposed to be written by mr howel passed with the concurrence of r island mr howel hesitating  finally beckoning to mr collins his collegue who answered for the state in the affirmative as the report stood the executive of massachusetts as well as of rho island was to be written to the gazette being printed at boston on the motion of mr osgood who had seen the original publication in the providence gazette and apprehended a constructive imputation on the mass delegates by such as would be ignorant of the circumstances the executive of massts was expunged friday decr   th mr howel verbally acknowledged himself to be the writer of the letter from which the extract was published in the providence gazette at his instance the subject was postponed until monday     saturday decr   th no congress monday december   th the answer to the objections of rho island  as to the impost penned by mr howel passed without opposition   states being present of which rho isd was one a few trivial alterations only being made in the course of discussion mr howell contrary to expectation was entirely silent as to his affair tuesday decr   th mr carrol in order to bring on the affair of mr howel moved that the secy of foreign affairs be instructed not to write to the govt of rhode island on the subject the state in wch such a vote would leave the business unless the reason of it was expressed being not adverted to by some and others being unwilling to     move in the case this motion was incautiously suffered to pass the effect of it however was soon observed and a motion in consequence made by mr hamilton to subjoin the words mr howel having in his place confessed himself to be the author of the publication mr ramsay thinking such a stigma on mr howel unnecessary  tending to place him in the light of a persecuted man whereby his opposition to the impost might have more weight in his state proposed to substitute as the reason congress havg recd the information desired on that subject the yeas  nays being called for by mr hamilton mr howell grew very uneasy at the prospect of his name being thereby brought on the journals and requested that the subject might be suspended until the day following this was agreed to  took place on condition that the negatived counter direction to the secy of f a should be reconsidered  lie over also wednesday decr   th this day was chiefly spent on the case of mr howel whose behaviour was extremely offensive and led to a determined opposition to him those who were most inclined to spare his reputation if the affair could have been closed without an insertion of his name on the journal he seemed willing to withdraw his protest but the impropriety which appeared to some  particularly to mr hamilton in suppressing the name of the author of a piece wch congress had so emphatically reprobated when the author was found to be a member of congress prevented a relaxation as to the yeas  nays mr howell therefore as his name was necessarily to appear on the journal adhered to the motion which inserted his protest thereon  the indecency of this paper and   0 the pertinacity of mr howell in adhering to his assertions with respect to the nonfailure of any application for foreign loans excited great  excepting his colleagues or rather mr arnold universal indignation and astonishment in congress and he was repeatedly premonished of the certain ruin in wch he wd thereby involve his character  consequence and of the necessity wch congress wd be laid under of vindicating themselves by some act which would expose and condemn him to all the world thursday decr   th see journals friday decr  0th a motion was made by mr hamilton for revising the requisitions of the preceding and present years in order to reduce them more within the faculties of the states in support of the motion it was urged that the exorbitancy of the demands produced a despair of fulfilling them which benumbed the efforts for that purpose on the other side it was alledged that a relaxation of the demand would be followed by a relaxation of the efforts that unless other resources were substituted either the states would be deluded by such a measure into false expectations or in case the truth sd be disclosed to prevent that effect that the enemy wd be encouraged to persevere in the war agst us the motion meeting with little patronage it was withdrawn     the report of the committee on the motion of mr hamilton proposed that the secy of congress should transmit to the executive of rhode island the several acts of congress with a state of foreign loans the object of the committee was that in case rho island should abet or not resent the misconduct of their representative as wd most likely be the event congress should commit themselves as little as possible in the mode of referring it to that state when the report came under consideration it was observed that the presidt had always transmitted acts of congress to the executives of the states and that such a change on the present occasion might afford a pretext if not excite a disposition in rho island not to vindicate the honor of congress the matter was compromised by substituting the secy of f a who ex officio corresponds with the governors c within whose department the facts to be transmitted as to foreign loans lay no motion or vote opposed the report as it passed saturday    decr the committee to confer wth mr livingston was appointed the preceding day in consequence of the unwillingness of several states to elect either genl schuyler mr clymer or mr read the gentlemen previously put into nomination and of a hint that mr l might be prevailed on to serve till the spring the committee found him in this disposition and their report was agreed to without opposition  see the journal monday    decr the motion to strike out the words accruing to the use of the u s was grounded on a denial of the principle that a capture  possession by the enemy of moveable property extinguished or effected the title of the original owners on the other side this principle was asserted as laid down by the most approved writers and conformable to the practice of all nations to which was added that if a contrary doctrine were established by congress innumerable     claims would be brought forward by those whose property had on recapture been applied to the public use  see journal letters were this day recd from dr franklin mr jay  the marquis de la fayette they were dated the   th of ocr that from the first inclosed copy of the  d comission to mr oswald with sundry prelimy articles and distrusted the british court that from the  d expressed great jealousy of the french govt  referred to an intercepted letter from mr marbois opposing the claim of the u s to the fisheries this despatch produced much indignation agst the author of the intercepted letter and visible emotions in some agst france it was remarked here that our ministers took no notice of the distinct comons to fitzherbert  oswald that altho on a supposed intimacy and joined in     the same comon they the ministers wrote separately  breathed opposite sentiments as to the views of france mr livingston told me that the letter of the ct de vergennes as read to him by the chevr luzerne very delicately mentioned  complained that american ministers did not in the negotiations with the british ministers maintain the due com with those of france mr livingston inferred on the whole that france was sincerely anxious for peace the presidt acquainted congress that ct rochambeau had communicated the intended embarkation of the french troops for the w indies with an assurance from the king of france that in case the war sd be renewed agst u s they should immediately be sent back     tuesday    decr the letter from mr jay inclosing a copy of the intercepted letter from marbois was laid before congress  the tenor of it with the comments of mr jay affected deeply the sentiments of congress with regard to france the policy in particular manifested by france of keeping us tractable by leaving the british in possession of posts in this country awakened strong jealousies corroborated the charges on that subject and with concomitant circumstances may engender the opposite extreme of the gratitude  cordiality now felt towards france as the closest friends on a     rupture are apt to become the bitterest foes much will depend however on the course pursued by britain the liberal one oswald seems to be pursuing will much promote an alienation of temper in america from france it is not improbable that the intercepted letter from marbois came thro oswalds hands if g b therefore yields the fisheries  the back territory america will feel the obligation to her not to france who appears to be illiberal as to the  st  favorable to spain as to the  d object and consequently has forfeited the confidence of the states interested in either of them candor will suggest however that the situation of france is and has been extremely perplexing the object of     her blood  money was not only the independence but the commerce and gratitude of america the commerce to render independence the more useful the gratitude to render that commerce the more permanent it was necessary therefore she supposed that america should be exposed to the cruelties of her enemies and be made sensible of her own weakness in order to be grateful to the hand that relieved her this policy if discovered tended on the other hand to spoil the whole experience shews that her truest policy would have been to relieve america by the most direct  generous means  to have mingled with them no artifice whatever with respect to spain also the situation of france has been as peculiarly delicate the claims  views of spain  america interfere the former attempts of britain to seduce spain to a separate peace  the ties of france with the latter whom she had drawn into the war required her to favor spain at least to a certain degree at the expence of america of this g b is taking advantage if france adheres to spain g b espouses the views of america  endeavours to draw her off from france if france adheres to america in her claims b might espouse those of spain  produce a breach between her  france and in either case britain wd divide her enemies if france acts wisely she will in this dilemma prefer the friendship of america to that of spain if america acts wisely she will see that she is with respect to her great interests more in danger of being seduced by britain than sacrificed by france the deputation to r i had set out on the   d  proceeded ½ days journey mr nash casually mentioned a private letter from mr pendleton to mr madison  informing     that the legislature of virga had in consequence of the final refusal of r i repealed her law for the impost as this circumstance if true destroyed in the opinion of the deputies the chief argt to be used by them viz the unanimity of the other states they determined to return  wait for the southern post to know the truth of it the post failing to arrive on the   d the usual day the deputies on this day came into congress  stated the case mr madison read to congress the paragraph in the letter from mr pendleton congress verbally resolved that the departure of the deputies for r i sd be suspended until the further order of congress mr madison promising to give any information he might receive by the post the arrival of the post immediately ensued a letter to mr madison from mr randolph confirmed the fact  was communicated to congress the most intelligent members were deeply affected  prognosticated a failure of the     impost scheme  the most pernicious effects to the character the duration  the interests of the confederacy it was at length notwithstanding determined to persist in the attempt for permanent revenue and a committee was appointed to report the steps proper to be taken a motion was made by mr rutledge to strike out the salvage for recaptures on land on the same principle as he did the words accruing to the use of the united states as the latter had been retained by barely   states and one of these was not present the motion of mr rutledge succeeded some of those who were on the other side in consequence voted agst the whole resolution  it failed by compromise it passed as reported by the committee the grand committee reported after another meeting with respect to the old money that it should be rated at  0 for   the chair decided on a question raised that according to rule the blank sd not have been filled up by the comittee so the rate was expunged from tuesday    of decr the journals suffice untill monday  0 decr a motion made by mr clarke seconded by mr rutledge to revise the instructions relative to negotiations for peace with a view to exempt the american plenipotentiaries from the obligation to conform to the advice of france this motion was the effect of impressions left by mr jays letters  the intercepted one from marbois this evidence of separate views in our ally and the inconsistency of that instruction with our national dignity were urged in support of the motion in opposing the motion many considerations were suggested and the original expediency of submitting the commission for peace to the councils of france descanted upon the reasons assigned for this expediency were that at the juncture when that measure took place the american affairs were in the most deplorable situation the southern states being overrun  exhausted by the enemy  and the others more inclined to repose after their own fatigues than to exert their resources     for the relief of those which were the seat of the war that the old paper currency had failed  with it public credit itself to such a degree that no new currency could be substituted  that there was then no prospect of introducing specie for the purpose our trade being in the most ruinous condition  the intercourse with the havana in particular unopened in the midst of these distresses the mediation of the two imperial courts was announced the general idea was that the two most respectable powers of europe would not interpose without a serious desire of peace and without the energy requisite to effect it the hope of peace was therefore mingled with an apprehension that considerable concessions might be exacted from america by the mediators as a compensation for the essential one which britain was to submit to congress on a trial found it impossible from the diversity of opinions  interests to define any other claims than those of independence  the alliance a discretionary power therefore was to be delegated with regard to all other claims mr adams was the sole minister for peace he was personally at variance with the french ministry his judgment had not the confidence of some nor his partiality in case of an interference of claims espoused by different quarters of the u s the confidence of others a motion to associate with him two colleagues to wit mr franklin  mr jay had been disagreed to by congress the former of these being interested as one of the land companies in territorial claims which had less chance of being made good in any other way than by a repossession of the vacant country by the british crown the latter belonging to a state interested in such arrangements as would deprive the u s of the navigation of the mississippi  turn the western trade through n y and neither of them being connected with the so states the idea of having five ministers taken from the whole union was not suggested until the measure had been adopted and communicated to the chevr de luzerne to be forwarded to france when it was too late to revoke it it was supposed also that mr laurens then in the tower would not be out  that mr jefferson wd not go  that the greater no of ministers the greater the danger of discords  indiscretions it was added that as it was expected that nothing would be yielded by g b which was not extorted by the  00 address of france in managing the mediators and as it was the intention of congress that their minister should not oppose a peace recommended by them  approved by france it was thought good policy to make the declaration to france  by such a mark of confidence to render her friendship the more responsible for the issue at the worst it could only be considered as a sacrifice of our pride to our interest these considerations still justified the original measure in the view of the members who were present  voted for it all the new members who had not participated in the impressions which dictated it and viewed the subject only under circumstances of an opposite nature disapproved it in general however the latter joined with the former in opposing the motion of mr clarke arguing with them that supposing the instruction to be wrong it was less dishonorable than the instability that wd be denoted by rescinding it that if g b was disposed to give us what we claimed france could not prevent it that if g b struggled agst those claims our only chance of getting them was thro the aid of france that to withdraw our confidence would lessen the chance  degree of this aid that if we were in a prosperous or safe condition compared with that in which we adopted the expedient in question this change had been effected by the friendly succors of our ally  that to take advantage of it to loosen the tie would not only bring on us the reproach of ingratitude but induce france to believe that she had no hold on our affections but only in our necessities that in all possible situations we sd be more in danger of being seduced by g b than of being sacrificed by france the interests of the latter in the main necessarily coinciding with ours and those of the former being diametrically opposed to them that as to the intercepted letter there were many reasons which indicated that it came through the hands of the enemy to mr jay that it ought therefore to be regarded even if genuine as communicated for insidious purposes but that there was strong reason to suspect that it had been adulterated if not forged and that on the worst supposition it did not appear that the doctrines maintained or the measures recommended in it had been adopted by the french ministry and consequently that they ought not to be held responsible for them  0  upon these considerations it was proposed by mr wolcott  ded by mr hamilton that the motion of mr clarke should be postponed which took place without a vote mr madison moved that the letter of docr franklin of the    octr      should be referred to a committee with a view of bringing into consideration the preliminary article proposing that british subjects  american citizens sd reciprocally have in matters of commerce the privilege of natives of the other party and giving to the american ministers the instruction which ensued on that subject this motion succeeded and the committee appointed consisted of mr madison mr rutledge mr clarke mr hamilton  mr osgood the contract of genl wayne  was confirmed with great reluctance being considered as being improper with respect to its being made with individuals as admitting of infinite abuses as out of his military line and as founded on a principle that a present commerce with g b was favorable to the u s a principle reprobated by congress  all the states congress however supposed that these considerations ought to yield to the necessity of supporting the measures which a valuable officer from good motives had taken upon himself tuesday decr         the report of the committee made in consequence of mr madisons motion yesterday instructing the ministers plenipo on the article of commerce passed unanimously as follows resolved that the ministers plenipo for negotiating peace be  0  instructed in any commercial stipulations with g b which may be comprehended in a treaty of peace to endeavour to obtain for the citizens and inhabitants of the u s a direct commerce to all parts of the british dominions  possessions in like manner as all parts of the u s may be opened to a direct commerce of british subjects or at least that such direct commerce be extended to all parts of the british dominions  possessions in europe  the west indies and the said ministers are informed that this stipulation will be particularly expected by congress in case the citizens  subjects of each party are to be admitted to an equality in matters of commerce with natives of the other party wednesday jany  st      the decision of the controversy between con  penna was reported the communications made from the minister of france concurred with other circumstances in effacing the impressions made by mr jays letter  marboiss inclosed the vote of thanks to ct rochambeau passed with unanimity  cordiality  afforded a fresh proof that the resentment against france had greatly subsided thursday jany  d nothing requiring notice friday  d jany the vote of thanks to the minister of france which passed yesterday was repealed in consequence of his having expressed to the president a desire that no notice might be taken of his conduct as to the point in question  of the latters communicating the same to congress the temper of congress here again manifested the transient nature of their irritation agst france the motion of mr howel put on the secret journal gave congress a great deal of vexation the expedient for baffling his scheme of raising a ferment in his state  exposing the foreign  0  transactions was adopted only in the last resort it being questioned by some whether the articles of confederation warranted it the answer to the note of the french minister passed unanimously  was a further testimony of the abatement of the effects of mr jays letter c the proceedings of the court in the dispute between cont  pa were after debates as to the meaning of the confederation in directing such proceeding to be lodged among the acts of congress entered at large on the journals it was remarked that the delegates from cont particularly mr dyer were more captious on the occasion than was consistent with a perfect acquiescence in the decree monday jany  th the memorial from the army was laid before congress and referred to a grand committee this reference was intended as a mark of the important light in which the memorial was viewed  mr berkley having represented some inconveniences incident to the plan of a consular convention between france  u s particularly the restriction of consuls from trading  his letter having been committed a report was made purposing that the convention should for the present be suspended to this it had been objected that as the convention might already be concluded such a step was improper and as the end might be obtained by authorizing the minister at versailles to propose particular alterations  0  that it was unnecessary by mr madison it had been moved that the report should be postponed to make place for the consideration of an instruction  authority to the sd minister for that purpose and this motion had in consequence been brought before congress on this day the business revived the sentiments of the members were various some wishing to suspend such part of the convention only as excluded consuls from commerce others thought this exclusion too important to be even suspended others again thought the whole ought to be suspended during the war  others lastly contended that the whole ought to be new modelled the consuls having too many privileges in some respects  too little power in others it was observable that this diversity of opinions prevailed chiefly among the members who had come in since the convention had been passed in congress the members originally present adhering to the views which then governed them the subject was finally postponed   states only being represented    being requisite for such a question even to have suspended the convention after it had been proposed to the court of france  possibly acceded to would have been indecent and dishonorable and at a juncture when g b was courting a commercial intimacy to the probable uneasiness of france of very mischievous tendency but experience constantly teaches that new members of a public body do not feel the necessary respect or responsibility for the acts of their predecessors and that a change of members  of circumstances often proves fatal to consistency and stability of public measures some conversation in private by the old members with the most judicious of the new in this instance has abated the fondness of the latter for innovations and it is even problematical whether they will be again urged in the evening of this day the grand committee met and agreed to meet again the succeeding evening for the purpose of a conference with the superintendt of finance tuesday jany  th      see the journals in the evening the grand committee had the assigned conference with mr morris who informed them explicitly that it was  0  impossible to make any advance of pay in the present state of the finances to the army and imprudent to give any assurances with respect to future pay until certain funds should be previously established he observed that if even an advance could be made it wd be unhappy that it sd appear to be the effect of demands from the army as this precedent could not fail to inspire a distrust of the spontaneous justice of congress  to produce repetitions of the expedient he said that he had taken some measures with a view to a payment for the army which depended on events not within our command that he had communicated these measures to genl washington under an injunction of secrecy that he could not yet disclose them without endangering their success that the situation of our affairs within his department was so alarming that he had thoughts of asking congress to appoint a confidential committee to receive communications on that subject and to sanctify by their advice such steps as ought to be taken much loose conversation passed on the critical state of things the defect of a permanent revenue  the consequences to be apprehended from a disappointment of the mission from the army which ended in the appointment of friday evening next for an audience to general mcdougall col brooks  col ogden the deputies on the subject of the memorial the superintendt to be present wednesday jany   thursday jany  th  friday jany  0 on the report  for valuing the land conformably to the rule laid down in the federal articles the delegates from connecticut contended for postponing the subject during the war alledging the impediments arising from the possession of n y c by the enemy but apprehending as was supposed that the flourishing state of connecticut compared with the southern states would render a valuation at the crisis unfavorable to the former others particularly mr hamilton and mr madison were of  0  opinion that the rule of the confederation was a chimerical one since if the intervention of the individual states were employed their interests would give a bias to their judgments or that at least suspicions of such bias wd prevail and without their intervention it could not be executed but at an expense delay  uncertainty which were inadmissible that it would perhaps be therefore preferable to represent these difficulties to the states  recommend an exchange of this rule of dividing the public burdens for one more simple easy  equal the delegates from s carolina generally  particularly mr rutledge advocated the propriety of the constitutional rule  of an adherence to it and of the safety of the mode in question arising from the honor of the states the debates on the subject were interrupted by a letter from the superintendent of finance informing congress that the situation of his department required that a committee sd be appointed with power to advise him on the steps proper to be taken and suggesting an appointment of one consisting of a member from each state with authority to give their advice on the subject this expedient was objected to as improper since congress wd thereby delegate an incommunicable power perhaps and would at any rate lend a sanction to a measure without even knowing what it was not to mention the distrust which it manifested of their own prudence  fidelity it was at length proposed  agreed to that a special committee consisting of mr rutledge mr osgood  mr madison should confer with the superintendt of finance on the subject of his letter and make report to congress after the adjournment of congress this com̃ittee conferred with the superintendt who after being apprized of the difficulties which had arisen in congress stated to them that the last account of our money affairs in europe shewed that contrary to his expectations and estimates there were  ½ millions of livres short of the bills actually drawn that further drafts were indispensable to prevent a stop to the public service that to make good this deficiency there was only the further success of mr adams loan and the friendship of france to depend on that it was necessary for him to decide on the expediency of his staking the public credit on those contingent funds by further drafts and that in making this decision he wished for the sanction  0  of a committee of congress that this sanction was preferable to that of congress itself only as it wd confide the risk attending bills drawn on such funds to a smaller number and as secrecy was essential in the operation as well to guard our affairs in general from injury as the credit of the bills in question from debasement it was supposed both by the superintendt  the comittee that there was in fact little danger of bills drawn on france on the credit of the loan of   millions of dollars applied for being dishonored since if the negotiations on foot were to terminate in peace france would prefer an advance in our favor to exposing us to the necessity of resorting to g b for it and that if the war sd continue the necessity of such an aid to its prosecution would prevail the result was that the committee should make such report as would bring the matter before congress under an injunction of secrecy and produce a resolution authorizing the superintendt to draw bills as the public service might require on the credit of applications for loans in europe the report of the committee to this effect was the next day accordingly made  adopted unanimously mr dyer alone at first opposed it as an unwarrantable  dishonorable presumption on the ability  disposition of france being answered however that without such a step or some other expedt which neither he nor any other had suggested our credit would be stabbed abroad and the public service wrecked at home and that however mortifying it might be to commit our credit our faith  our honor to the mercy of a foreign nation it was a mortification wch cd not be avoided without endangering our very existence he acquiesced and the resolution was entered unanimously the circumstance of unanimity was thought of consequence as it wd evince the more the necessity of the succour and induce france the more readily to yield it on this occasion several members were struck with the impropriety of the late attempt to withdraw from france the trust confided to her over the terms of peace when we were under the necessity of giving so decisive a proof of our dependence upon her it was also adverted to in private conversation as a great unhappiness that during negotiations for peace when an appearance of vigor  resource were so desirable such a proof of our poverty  imbecility could not be avoided  0  the conduct of mr howel c had led several  particularly mr peters into an opinion that some further rule  security ought to be provided for concealing matters of a secret nature on the motion of mr peters a committee composed of himself mr williamson c was appointed to make a report on the subject on this day the report was made it proposed that members of congress should each subscribe an instrument pledging their faith  honor not to disclose certain enumerated matters the enumeration being very indistinct and objectionable and a written engagement being held insufficient with those who without it wd violate prudence or honor as well as marking a general distrust of the prudence  honor of congress the report was generally disrelished and after some debate in which it was faintly supported by mr williamson the committee asked  obtained leave to withdraw it a discussion of the report on the mode of valuing the lands was revived it consisted chiefly of a repetition of the former debates in the evening according to appt on tuesday last the grand committee met as did the superintendt of finance the chairman mr wolcot informed the committee that cols ogden  brooks two of the deputies from the army had given him notice that genl mcdougal the first of the deputation was so indisposed with the rheumatism as to be unable to attend and expressed a desire that the comittee would adjourn to his lodging at the indian queen tavern the deputies being very anxious to finish their business among other reasons on acct of the scarcity of money with them at first the com̃ittee seemed disposed to comply but it being suggested that such an adjournment by a comittee of a member from each state would be derogatory from the respect due to themselves especially as the mission from the army was not within the ordinary course of duty the idea was dropped in lieu of it they adjourned to monday evening next on the ostensible reason of the extreme badness of the weather which had prevented the attendance of several members  0  monday jany    report on the valuation of land was referred to a grand committee a motion was made by mr peters  ded by mr madison that a comite be appointed to consider the expediency of making further applications for loans in europe  to confer with the superint of finance on the subject in support of this motion mr p observed that notwithstanding the uncertainty of success the risk of appearing unreasonable in our demands on france and the general objections agst indebting the u s to foreign nations the crisis of our affairs demanded the experiment that money must if possible be procured for the army and there was ground to expect that the ct of france wd be influenced by an apprehension that in case of her failure  of a pacification g b might embrace the opportunity of substituting her favors mr madison added that it was expedient to make the trial because if it failed our situation cd not be made worse that it would be prudent in france  therefore it might be expected of her to afford the u s such supplies as would enable them to disband their army in tranquillity lest some internal convulsions might follow external peace the issue of which ought not to be hazarded that as the affections  gratitude of this country as well as its separation from g b were her objects in the revolution it would also be incumbent on her to let the army be disbanded under the impression of deriving their rewards through her friendship to their country since their temper on their dispersion through the several states and being mingled in the public councils would much affect the general temper towards france and that if the pay of the army could be converted into a consolidated debt bearing interest the requisitions on the states for the principal might be reduced to requisitions for the interest and by that means a favorable revolution so far introduced into our finances the motion was opposed by mr dyer because it was improper to augment our foreign debts  would appear extravagant to france several others assented to it with reluctance and several others expressed serious scruples as honest men agst levying   0 contributions on the friendship or fears of france or others whilst the unwillingness of the states to invest congress with permanent funds rendered a repayment so precarious the motion was agreed to and the committee chosen—mr gorham mr peters mr izard in the evening according to appointment the grand committee gave an audience to the deputies of the army  viz genl mcdougal  cols ogden  brooks the first introduced the subject by acknowledging the attention manifested to the representations of the army by the appt of so large a com̃ittee his observations turned chiefly on the   chief topics of the memorial namely an immediate advance of pay adequate provision for the residue and halfpay—on the first he insisted on the absolute necessity of the measure to soothe the discontents both of the officers  soldiers painted their sufferings  services their successive hopes  disappointments throughout the whole war in very highcolored expressions and signified that if a disappointment were now repeated the most serious consequences were to be apprehended that nothing less than the actual distresses of the army would have induced at this crisis so solemn     an application to their country but yt the seeming approach of peace and the fear of being still more neglected when the necessity of their services should be over strongly urged the necessity of it his two colleagues followed him with a recital of various incidents  circumstances tending to evince the actual distresses of the army the irritable state in which the deputies left them and the necessity of the consoling influence of an immediate advance of pay colonel ogden said he wished not indeed to return to the army if he was to be the messenger of disappointment to them the deputies were asked  st what particular steps they supposed would be taken by the army in case no pay cd be immediately advanced to which they answered that it was impossible to say precisely that although the sergeants  some of the most intelligent privates had been often observed in sequestered consultations yet it was not known that any premeditated plan had been formed that there was sufficient reason to dread that at least a mutiny would ensue and the rather as the temper of the officers at least those of inferior grades would with less vigor than heretofore struggle agst it they remarked on this occasion that the situation of the officers was rendered extremely delicate  had been sorely felt when called upon to punish in soldiers a breach of engagements to the public which had been preceded by uniform  flagrant breaches by the latter of its engagements to the former general mcdougal said that the army were verging to that state which we are told will make a wise man mad and col brooks said that his apprehensions were drawn from the circumstance that the temper of the army was such that they did not reason or deliberate cooly on consequences  therefore a disappointment might throw them blindly into extremities they observed that the irritations of the army had resulted in part from the distinctions made between the civil  military lists the former regularly receiving their salaries and the latter as regularly left unpaid they mentioned in particular that the members of the legislatures would never agree to an adjournment without paying themselves fully for their services in answer to this remark it was observed that the civil officers on the average did not derive from their appointments more than the means of their subsistence and that the military altho not furnished with their     pay properly so called were in fact furnished with the same necessaries on the  d point to wit adequate provision for the general arrears due to them the deputies animadverted with surprise and even indignation on the repugnance of the states some of them at least to establish a federal revenue for discharging the federal engagements they supposed that the ease not to say affluence with wch the people at large lived sufficiently indicated resources far beyond the actual exertions and that if a proper application of these resources was omitted by the country  the army thereby exposed to unnecessary sufferings it must naturally be expected that the patience of the latter wd have its limits as the deputies were sensible that the general disposition of congress strongly favored this object they were less diffuse on it genl mcdougal made a remark wch may deserve the greater attention as he stepped from the tenor of his discourse to introduce it and delivered it with peculiar emphasis he said that the most intelligent  considerate part of the army were deeply affected at the debility and defects in the federal govt and the unwillingness of the states to cement  invigorate it as in case of its dissolution the benefits expected from the revolution wd be greatly impaired and as in particular the contests which might ensue amg the states would be sure to embroil the officers which respectively belong to them on the  d point to wit halfpay for life they expressed equal dissatisfaction at the states which opposed it observing that it formed a part of the wages stipulated to them by congress  was but a reasonable provision for the remnant of their lives which had been freely exposed in the defence of their country and would be incompatible with a return to occupations  professions for which military habits of   years standing unfitted them they complained that this part of their reward had been industriously and artfully stigmatized in many states with the name of pension altho it was as reasonable that those who had lent their blood and services to the public sd receive an annuity thereon as those who had lent their money and that the officers whom new arrangements had from time to time excluded actually labored under the opprobrium of pensioners with the additional mortification of     not receiving a shilling of the emolums they referred however to their memorial to show that they were authorized  ready to commute their halfpay for any equivalent  less exceptionable provision after the departure of the deputies the grand committee appointed a subcommittee consisting of mr hamilton mr madison  mr rutledge to report arrangements in concert with the superintendt of finance for their consideration tuesday jany   th   th      congress adjourned for the meeting of the grand committee to whom was referred the report concerning the valuation of the lands and who accordingly met the committee were in general strongly impressed with the extreme difficulty  inequality if not impracticability of fulfilling the article of the confederation relative to this point mr rutledge however excepted who altho he did not think the rule so good a one as a census of inhabitants thought it less impracticable than the other members and if the valuation of land had not been prescribed by ye federal articles the committee wd certainly have preferred some other rule of appointment particularly that of numbers under certain qualifications as to slaves as the federal constitution however left no option  a few  only were disposed to recommend to the states an alteration of it it was necessary to proceed  st to settle its meaning— dly to settle the least objectionable mode of valuation on the first point it was doubted by several members wher the returns which the report under consideration required from the states would not be final and whether the arts of confn wd allow congress to alter them after they had fixed on this mode on this point no vote was taken a  d question afterwards raised in the course of the discussion was how far the art required a specific valuation and     how far it gave a latitude as to the mode on this point also there was a diversity of opinions but no vote taken  dly as to the mode itself referred to the gd come it was strongly objected to by the delegate from cont mr dyer—by mr hamilton—by mr wilson by mr carol  by mr madison as leaving the states too much to the bias of interest as well as too uncertain  tedious in the execution in favr of the rept was mr rutledge the father of it who thought the honor of the states  their mutual confidence a sufficient security agst frauds  the suspicion of them mr ghoram favd the report also as the least impracticable mode and as it was necessary to attempt at least some compliance with the federal rule before any attempt could be properly made to vary it an opinion entertained by massachusetts that she was comparatively in advance to the u s made her anxious for a speedy settlement of the mode by which a final apportionment of the common burden cd be effected the sentiments of the other members of the committee were not expressed mr hamilton proposed in lieu of a reference of the valuation to the states to class the lands throughout the states under distinctive descriptions viz arable pasture wood c and to annex a uniform rate to the several classes according to their different comparative value calling on the states only for a return of the quantities  descriptions this mode would have been acceptable to the more compact  populous states but was totally inadmissible to the southern states mr wilson proposed that returns of the quantity of land  of the number of inhabitants in the respective states sd be obtained and a rule deducted from the combination of these data this also would have affected the states in a similar manner with the proposition of mr hamilton on the part of the s states it was observed that besides its being at variance with the text of the confederation it would work great injustice as would every mode which admitted the quantity of lands within the states into the measure of their comparative wealth and abilities lastly it was proposed by mr madison that a valuation shd be attempted by congress without the intervention of the states he observed that as the expense attending the operation would come ultimately from the same pockets it was not very material     whether it was borne in the first instance by congress or the states and it at least deserved consideration whether this mode was not preferable to ye proposed reference to the states the conversation ended in the appt of a subcommittee consisting of mr madison mr carol  mr wilson who were desired to consider the several modes proposed to confer with the superintendt of finance  make such report to the gd come as they shd judge fit wednesday jany    a letter dated the   th of december from genl greene was recd notifying the evacuation of charleston it was in the first place referred to the secy of congs for publication excepting the passage which recited the exchange of prisoners which being contrary to the resolution of the    of ocr agst partial exchanges was deemed improper for publication it was in the next place referred to a come in order that some complimentary report might be made in favor of genl greene  the southn army docr ramsay havg come in after this reference and being uninformed of it moved that a committee might be appointed to devise a proper mode of expressing to genl greene the high sense entertained by congress of his merits  services in support of his motion he went into lavish praises of gl greene and threw out the idea of making him a lieutent general his motion being opposed as somewhat singular and unnecessary after the reference of genl greenes letter he withdrew it a letter was red from genl washington inclosing a certificate from mr chittenden of vermont acknowledging the receipt of the communication which gl washington had sent him of the proceedings of congress on the fifth of december      thursday jany    mr rutledge informed congress that there was reason to apprehend that the train of negotiation in europe had been so misrepresented in the state of s carolina as to make it probable that an attempt might be made in the legislature to repeal the confiscation laws of that state  even if such attempt shd fail the misrepresentations cd not fail to injure the sale of property confiscated in that state in order therefore to frustrate these misrepresentations he moved that the delegates of s carolina might be furnished with an extract from the letter of the   th of oct from docr franklin so far as it informed congress that something had been mentioned to the american plenipotentiaries relative to the refugees  to english debts but not insisted on it being answered on their part that this was a matter belonging to the individual states and on which congress cd enter into no stipulations the motion was  ded by mr jarvais  supported by mr ramsay it was opposed by mr ellsworth  mr wolcott as improper since a communication of this intelligence might encourage the states to extend confiscations to british debts a circumstance which wd be dishonorable to the u s  might embarrass a treaty of peace mr fitzsimmons expressed the same apprehensions so did mr ghoram his colleague mr osgood was in favr of the motion by mr madison the motion was so enlarged and varied as to leave all the delegates at liberty to communicate the extract to their constents in such form  under such cautions as they shd judge prudent the motion so varied was adopted by mr rutledge  substituted in place of the original one i was however still opposed by the opponents of the original motion mr madison observed that as all the states had espoused in some degree the doctrine of confiscations  as some of them had given instructions to their delegates on the subject it was the duty of congress without inquiring into the expediency of confiscations to prevent as far as they cd any measures which might impede that object in negotiations for peace by inducing an opinion that the u s were not firm with respect to it that in this view it was of consequence to prevent the repeal  even the attempt of a repeal of     the confiscation law of one of the states and that if a confidential communication of the extract in question would answer such a purpose it was improper for congress to oppose it on a question the motion was negatived congress being much divided thereon several of those who were in the negative were willing that the delegates of s carolina shd be licensed to transmit to their state what related to the refugees omitting what related to british debts and invited mr rutledge to renew his motion in that qualified form others suggested the propriety of his contradicting the misrepresentations in general without referring to any official information recd by congress mr r said he wd think further on the subject and desired that it might lie over friday jany   th the com̃ite on the motion of mr peters of the thirteenth day of january relative to a further application for foreign loans reported that they had conferred with the superintendt of finance  concurred in opinion with him that the applications already on foot were as great as could be made prudently until proper funds should be established the latent view of this report was to strengthen the argt in favr of such funds and the report it was agreed should lie on the table to be considered along with the report which might be made on the memorial from the army  which wd involve the same subject the report thanking genl greene for his services was agreed to without opposition or observation several however thought it badly composed and that some notice ought to have been taken of majr burnet aid to gl g who was the bearer of the letter announcing the evacuation of charleston mr webster  mr judd agents for the deranged officers of the massachusetts  cont lines were heard by the gd committee in favr of their constituents the sum of their representations was that the sd officers were equally distressed for entitled to

january    congress adjourned to give the come on the treaty  convention time to prepare a report thereon thursday january    the report of the come last mentioned consisting of a state of the variations in the treaty of amity  commerce with the states general from the plan proposed by congress of a form of ratification of the sd treaty  of the convention  of a proclamation comprehending both was accepted  passed the variations excepted wch were not meant to be entered on the journals both the committee  congress were exceedingly chagrined at the extreme incorrectness of the american copies of these national acts and it was privately talked of as necessary to admonish mr adams thereof  direct him to procure with the concurrence of the other party a more correct  perspicuous copy the report of the come as agreed to havg left a blank in the act of ratification for the insertion of the treaty  convention  these being contained both in the dutch  american languages the former column signed by the dutch plenipos only  the latter by mr adams only the secy asked the direction of congress whether both columns or the american only ought to be inserted on this point several observations were made  different opinions expressed in general the members seemed to disapprove of ye mode used  wd he preferred ye use of a neutral language as to the request of the secy mr wilson was of opinion that the american columns only sd be inserted several others concurred in this opinion supposing     that as mr adams had only signed those columns our ratifications ought to be limited to them those who were of a different opinion considered the two parts as inseparable  as forming one whole  consequently that both ought to be inserted the case being a new one to congress it was proposed  admitted that the insertion might be suspended till the next day by which time some authorities might be consulted on the subject a come consisting of mr madison mr mifflin  mr williamson reported in consequence of a motion of mr bland a list of books proper for the use of congress and proposed that the secy should be instructed to procure the same in favr of the rept it was urged as indispensable that congress shd have at all times at com̃and such authors on the law of nations treaties negotiations c as wd render their proceedings in such cases conformable to propriety and it was observed that the want of this information was manifest in several important acts of congress it was further observed that no time ought to be lost in collecting every book  tract which related to american antiquities  the affairs of the u s since many of the most valuable of these were every day becoming extinct  they were necessary not only as materials for a hist of the u s but might be rendered still more so by future pretensions agst their rights from spain or other powers which had shared in the discoveries  possessions of the new world agst the report were urged  st the inconvenience of advancing even a few hundred pounds at this crisis  dly the difference of expence between procuring the books during the war  after a peace these objections prevailed by a considerable majority a motion was then made by mr wilson  ded by mr madison to confine the purchase for the present to the most essential part of the books this also was negatived friday jany   th some days prior to this sundry papers had been laid before congress by the war office shewing that a cargo of supplies which had arrived at wilmington for the british  german prisoners of war under a passport from the comander in chief and which were thence proceeding by land to their destination had   0 been seized by sundry persons in chester county under a law of pennsa which required in such cases a license from the executive authority which exposed to confiscation all articles not necessary for the prisoners  referd the question of necessity to the judgment of its own magistrates congress unanimously considered the violation of the passport issued under yr authority as an encroachment on their constitutional  essential rights but being disposed to get over the difficulty as gently as possible appointed a come consisting of mr rutledge mr wolcot  mr madison to confer with the executive of pa on the subject in the first conference the executive represented to the committee the concern they felt at the incident their disposition to respect  support the dignity  rights of the federal sovereignty and the embarrassments in which they were involved by a recent  express law of the state to which they were bound to conform the come observed to them that the power of granting passports for the purpose in question being inseparable from the general power of war delegated to congress  being essential for conducting the war it could not be expected that congress wd acquiesce in any infractions upon it that as pa had concurred in the alienation of this power to congress any law whatever contravening it was necessarily void and cd impose no obligation on the executive the latter requested further time for a consideration of the case  laid it before the legislature then sitting in consequence of which a come of their body was appd jointly with the executive to confer with the committe of congress in this  d conference the first remarks made by the come of congress were repeated the come of the legislature expressed an unwillingness to entrench on the jurisdiction of congress but some of them seemed not to be fully satisfied that the law of the state did so mr montgomery lately a member of congress observed that altho the general power of war was given to congress yet that the mode of exercising that power might be regulated by the states in any manner which wd not frustrate the power  which their policy might require to this it was answered that if congress had the power at all it could not either by the articles of confederation or the reason of things admit of such a controuling power in each of the states  that to admit such a construction     wd be a virtual surrender to the states of their whole federal power relative to war the most essential of all the powers delegated to congress the come of the legisre represented as the great difficulty with them that even a repeal of the law wd not remedy the case without a retrospective law which their constitution wd not admit of  expressed an earnest desire that some accommodating plan might be hit upon they proposed in order to induce the seizors to waive their appeal to the law of the state that congress wd allow them to appt one of two persons who sd have authority to examine into the supplies  decide whether they comprehended any articles that were not warranted by the passport the come of congress answered that whatever obstacles might lie in the way of redress by the legislature if no redress proceeded from them equal difficulties wd lie on the other side since congress in case of a confiscation of the supplies under the law which the omission of some formalities reqd by it wd probably produce would be obliged by honor  good faith to indemnify the enemy for their loss out of the common treasury that the other states wd probably demand a reimbursement to the u s from pa  that it was impossible to say to what extremity the affair might be carried they observed to the come of the legre and the executive that altho congress was disposed to make all allowances and particularly in the case of a law passed for a purpose recom̃ended by themselves yet they cd not condescend to any expedient which in any manner departed from the respect wch they owed to themselves  to the articles of union the come of congress however suggested that as the only expedient wch wd get rid of the clashing of the power of congress  the law of the state wd be the dissuading the seizors from their appeal to the latter it was probable that if the seizors wd apply to congress for redress such steps wd be taken as wd be satisfactory the hint was embraced  both the executive  the come of the legre promised to use their influence with the persons of most influence among the seizors for that purpose in consequence thereof a memorial from  see journal was sent in     to congress com̃ited to the same come of congress  their report of this day agreed to in wch the presidt of pa is requested to appt one of ye referees it is proper to observe that this business was conducted with great temper  harmony  that presidt dickinson in particulr manifested throughout the course of it as great a desire to save the rights  dignity of congress as those of the state over which he presided as a few of the seizors only were parties to ye memorial to congress it is still uncertain wher others may not adhere to their claims under the law in wch case all the embarrassments will be revived in a late report which had been drawn up by mr hamilton and made to congress in answr to a memorial from the legislature of pa among other things shewing the impossibility congress had been under of payg their creditors it was observed that the aid afforded by the ct of france had been appropriated by that court at the time to the immediate use of the army this clause was objected to as unnecessary  as dishonorable to congress the fact also was controverted mr hamilton  mr fitzsimmons justified the expediency of retaing it in order to justify congress the more completely in failing in their engagements to the public creditors mr wilson  mr madison proposed to strike out the words appropriated by france  substitute the words applied by congress to the immediate  necessary support of the army this proposition wd have been readily approved had it not appeared on examination that in one or two small instances  particularly in the paymt of the balance due to a lee esqr other applications had been made of the aid in question the report was finally recommitted a letter from the supert of finance was received  read acquainting congress that as the danger from the enemy which led him into the dept was disappearing  that he saw little prospect of provision being made without which injustice wd take place of which he wod never be the minister he proposed not to serve longer than may next unless proper provision sd be made this letter made a deep  solemn impression on congress it was considered as the effect of despondence in mr morris of seeing justice done to the public credrs or the public finances placed on an honorable establisht as a source of fresh hopes to the enemy     when known as ruinous both to domestic  foreign credit  as producing a vacancy which none knew how to fill  which no fit man wd venture to accept mr ghoram after observing that the administration of mr morris had inspired great confidence and expectation in his state  expressing his extreme regret at the event moved that the letter sd be com̃it̃ed this was opposed as unnecessary  nugatory by mr wilson since the known firmness of mr morris after deliberately taking a step wd render all attempts to dissuade him fruitless and that as the memorial from the army had brought the subject of funds before congress there was no other object for a come the motion to commit was disagd to mr wilson then moved that a day might be assigned for the consideration of the letter agst the propriety of this was observed by mr madison that the same reasons which opposed a comitmt opposed ye assignment of any day since congress cd not however anxious their wishes or alarming their apprehensions might be condescend to solicit mr morris even if there were a chance of its being successful  since it wd be equally improper for congress however cogent a motive it might add in ye mind of every member to struggle for substantial funds to let such a consideration appear in their public acts on that subject the motion of mr wilson was not passed congress supposing that a knowledge of mr morriss intentions wd anticipate the ills likely to attend his actual resignation ordered his letter to be kept secret nothing being said to day as to the mode of insertion of the treaty  convention with the states general the secy proceeded in retaining both columns  in consequence of the report to the grand come on the memorial from the army by the subcome the following report was made by the former to congs and came under consideration today the grand come having considered the contents of the meml presented by the army find that they comprehend five different articles       present pay   a settlement of accts of the arrearages of pay and security for what is due   a commutation of the half pay allowed by differt resolutions of congress for an equivalent in gross   a settlemt of the accts of deficiencies of rations and compensation   a settlement of accounts of deficiencies of cloathing  compensation the come are of opinion with respt to the  st that the superintendt of finance be directed conformably to measures already taken for that purpose as soon as the state of the public finances will permit to make such payt  in such manner as he shall think proper till the further order of congress with respect to the  d art so far as relates to the settlement of accts that the several states be called upon to compleate the settlemt without delay with their respective lines of the army up to the — day of aug    0 that the supt be also directed to take such measures as shall appear to him most proper  effectual for accomplishing the object in the most equitable  satisfactory manner havg regard to former resolutions of congs  to the settlets made in consequence thereof—and so far as relates to the providing of security for what shall be found due on such settlemt resolved that the troops of the united states in common with all the creditrs of the same have an undoubted right to expect such security—and that congress will make every effort in their power to obtain from the respective states general  substantial funds adequate to the object of funding the whole debt of the u s and that congs ought to enter upon an immediate  full consideration of the nature of such funds  the most likely mode of obtaining them with respect to the  d article the comme are of opinion that it will be expedient for congs to leave it to the option of all officers entitled to half pay either to preserve their claim to that provision as it now stands by the several resolutions of congs upon that subject or to accept—years full pay to be paid to them in one year after the conclusion of the war in money or placed upon good funded security bearing an annual interest of   pr ct provided     that the allowance to widows  orphans of such officers as have died or been killed or may die or be killed in the service during the war shall remain as established by the resolution of the — day of — with respect to the      arts the come beg leave to delay their report untill they have obtained more precise information than they now possess on the subject the  st clause of this report relative to immediate pay passed without opposition the supt had agreed to make out   months pay indeed long before the arrival of the deputies from the army he had made contingent  secret provision for that purpose and to ensure it now he meant if necessary to draw bills on the late application for loans the words conformably to measures already taken referred to the above secret provision and were meant to shew that the payment to the army did not originate in the memol but in an antecedent attention to the wants of the army in the discussion of the  d clause the epoch of aug    0 was objected to by the eastern delegates their states havg settled with their lines down to later periods they wished now to obtain the sanction of congress to them after some debate a compromise was proposed by mr hamilton by substituting the last day of decr    0 this was agreed to without opposition altho several members disliked it the latter part of the clause beginning with the word resolved c was considered as a very solemn point and the basis of the plans by which the public engagements were to be fulfilled  the union cemented a motion was made by mr bland to insert after the words in their power the words consistent with the articles of confederation this amendment as he explained it was not intended to contravene the idea of funds extraneous to ye federal articles but to leave those funds for a consideration subsequent to providing constitutional ones mr arnold however eagerly  ded it no question however was taken on it congress deeming it proper to postpone the matter till the next day as of the most solemn nature and to have as full a representation as possible with this view  to get rid of mr blands motion they adjourned  ordering all the members not present  in town to be summoned     saturday jany    the secy of congress havg suggested to a member that the contract with the ct of france specifying sums due from the u s altho extremely generous on the part of the former had been ratified without any such acknowledgmts by the latter that this was the first instance in which such acknowledgmts had been omitted  that the omission wd be singularly improper at a time when we were soliciting further aids these observations being made to congress the ratification was reconsidered and the words impressed with c inserted the rept on the memorial was resumed by mr hamilton mr fitzsimmons  one or two others who had conversed with mr morris on the change of the last day of decr for the — day of augst it was suggested that the change entirely contravened the measures pursued by his department and moved for a reconsideration of it in order to inquire into the subject without going into details they urged this a reason sufficient the eastern delegates altho they wished for unanimity  system in future proceedings relative to our funds  finances were very stiff in retaining the vote wch coincided with the steps taken by their constituents of this much complaint was made mr rutledge on this occasion alledging that congress ought not to be led by general suggestions derived from the office of finance joined by mr gervais voted agst the reconsideration the consequence was yt s carola was divided  six votes only in favr of the reconsideration mr hamilton havg expressed his regret at the negative  explained more exactly the interference of the change of the epoch with the measures  plans of the office of finance wch had limited all state advances  settlemts to aug    0 mr rutledge acknowledged the sufficiency of the reasons  at his instance the latter date was reinstated on this  d question cont also voted for augst      congress proceeded to the  rd clause relative to the commutation of half pay a motion was made by mr hamilton to fill the blank with six this was in conformity to tables of dr price estimating the officers on the average of good lives liberality in the rate was urged by several as necessary to give satisfaction  prevent a refusal of the offer for this motion there were   ayes   noes the southern states  new york being in the affirmative the eastern  n j in the negative col bland proposed  ½ erroneously supposing the negative of   to have proceeded from its being too low it was on the contrary rather doubtful whether the east states wd concur in any arrangemt on this head so averse were they to what they call pensions several having calculated that the annual amount of halfpay was between     00000 drs and the interest of the gross sum funded at the rate of   years nearly ⅔ of that sum congress were struck with the necessity of proceeding with more caution  for that purpose committed the report to a committee of  —mr osgood mr fitzsimmons mr gervais mr hamilton and mr wilson  monday    jany      a letter from genl washington was recd notifying the death of lord stirling  inclosing a report of the officer sent to apprehend knowlton and wells the following is an extract from the report he one israel smith further sd that knowlton  wells had recd a letter from jonathan arnold esqr at congress part of which was made public which informed them that affairs in congress were unfavorable to them  wd have them to look out for themselves what other information this letter contained he cd not say i found in my march thro the state that the last mentioned gentleman was much in favor with all the principal men in that state i had any conversation with     mr arnold being present at the reading informed congress that he was surprised how such a notion should have prevailed with respect to him that he had never held any correspondence with either knowlton or wells and requested that he might be furnished with ye extract above in this he was indulged without opposition but it was generally considered notwithstanding his denial of the correspondence that he had at least at second hand conveyed ye intelligence to vermont a long petition was read signed as alledged by near two thousand inhabitants but all in the same handwriting of the territory lately in controversy between pa  va complaining of the grievances to which their distance from public authority exposed them  particularly of a late law of pena interdicting even consultations about a new state within its limits and praying that congress wd give a sanction to their independence  admit them into the union the petition lay on the table without a single motion or remark relative to it the order of the day was called for to wit the resolution of saturday last in favor of adequate  substantial funds the subject was introduced by mr wilson with some judicious remarks on its importance  the necessity of a thorough  serious discussion of it he observed that the u states had in the course of the revolution displayed both an unexampled activity in resisting the enemy and an unexampled patience under the losses  calamities occasioned by the war in one point only he said they had appeared to be deficient  that was a cheerful payment of taxes in other free govts it had been seen that taxation had been carried further  more patiently borne than in states where the people were excluded from the govts the people considering themselves as the sovereign as well as the subject  as receiving with one hand what they paid with the other the peculiar repugnance of the people of the u s to taxes he supposed proceeded first from the odious light in which they have been under the old govt in the habit of regarding them  dly from the direct manner in wch taxes in this country had been laid whereas in all other countries taxes were paid in a way that was little felt at the time that it could not proceed altogether from inability he said must be obvious nay that the     ability of the u s was equal to the public burden might be demonstrated according to calculations of the best writers the inhabitants of g b paid before the present war at the annual rate of at least   s sterlg per head according to like calculations the inhabitants of the u s before the revolution paid indirectly  insensibly at the rate of at least  0s sterlg per head according to the computed depreciation of the paper emissions the burden insensibly borne by the inhabitants of the u s had amounted during the first three or four years of the war to not less than twenty millions of dollars per annum a burden too which was the more oppressive as it fell very unequally on the people an inability therefore could not be urged as a plea for the extreme deficiency of the revenue contributed by the states which did not amount during the past year to ½ a million of dollars that is to ⅙ of a dollar per head some more effectual mode of drawing forth the resources of the country was necessary that in particular it was necessary that such funds should be established as would enable congress to fulfill those engagements which they had been enabled to enter into it was essential he contended that those to whom was delegated the power of making war  peace should in some way or other have the means of effectuating these objects that as congress had been under the necessity of contracting a large debt justice required that such funds should be placed in their hands as would discharge it that such funds were also necessary for carrying on the war and as congress found themselves in their present situation destitute both of the faculty of paying debts already contracted and of providing for future exigencies it was their duty to lay that situation before their constitutents and at least to come to an éclaircissement on the subject  he remarked that the establisht of certain   0 funds for payg wd set afloat the public paper adding that a public debt resting on general funds would operate as a cement to the confederacy and might contribute to prolong its existence after the foreign danger ceased to counteract its tendency to dissolution he concluded with moving that it be resold that it is the opinion of congress that complete justice cannot be done to the creditors of the united states nor the restoration of public credit be effected nor the future exigencies of the war provided for but by the establishment of general funds to be collected by congress this motion was seconded by mr fitzsimmons mr bland desired that congress wd before the discussion proceeded farther receive a communication of sundry papers transmitted to the virga     delegates by the executive of that state two of which had relation to the question before congress these were  st a resolution of the genl assembly declaring its inability to pay more than £ 0000 va currency towards complying with the demands of congress  dly the act repealing the act granting the impost of   per ct these papers were received and read mr wolcot expressed some astonishment at the inconsistency of these two acts of va supposed that they had an unfavorable aspect on the business before congress  proposed that the latter sd be postponed for the present he was not seconded mr ghoram favored the general idea of the motion animadverting on the refusal of virga to contribute the necessary sums      at the same moment repealing her concurrence in the only scheme that promised to supply a deficiency of contributions he thought the motion however inaccurately expressed since the word general might be understood to refer to every possible object of taxation as well as to the operation of a particular tax through out the states he observed that the nonpayment of the   00000 drs demanded by congress for paying the interest of the debts for the year—demonstrated that the constitutional mode of annual requisitions was defective he intimated that lands were already sufficiently taxed  that polls  commerce were the most proper objects at his instance the latter part of the motion was so amended as to run establishment of permanent  adequate funds to operate generally throughout the u states mr hamilton went extensively into the subject the sum of it was as follows he observed that funds considered as permanent sources of revenue were of two kinds  st such as would extend generally  uniformly throughout the u s  wd be collected under the authority of congs  dly such as might be established separately within each state  might consist of any objects which were chosen by the states and might be collected either under the authority of the states or of congs funds of the  st kind he contended were preferable as being  st more simple the difficulties attending the mode of fixing the quotas laid down in the confederation rendering it extremely complicated  in a manner insuperable  dly as being more certain since the states according to the secd plan wd probably retain the collection of the revenue and a vicious system of collection prevailed generally throughout the u s a system by which the collectors were chosen by the people  made their offices more subservient to their popularity than to the public revenue  d as being more economical since the collection would be effected with fewer officers under the management of congress than under that of the states mr ghoram observed that mr hamilton was mistaken in the representation he had given of the collection of taxes in several of the states particularly in that of massachusetts where the collection was on a footing which rendered it sufficiently certain mr wilson having risen to explain some things which had fallen from him threw out the suggestion that several branches of the     revenue if yielded by all the states would perhaps be more just  satisfactory than any single one for example an impost on trade combined with a land tax mr dyer expressed a strong dislike to a collection by officers appointed under congress  supposed the states would never be brought to consent to it mr ramsay was decidedly in favor of the proposition justice he said entitled those who had lent their money  services to the u s to look to them for payment that if general  certain revenues were not provided the consequence wd be that the army  public creditors would have soon to look to their respective states only for satisfaction that the burden in this case wd fall unequally on the states that rivalships relative to trade wd impede a regular impost  would produce confusion amg the states that some of the states would never make of themselves provision for half pay and that the army wd be so far defrauded of the rewards stipulated to them by congress that altho it might be uncertain whether the states wd accede to plans founded on ye proposition before the house yet as congress was convinced of its truth  importance it was their duty to make the experiment mr bland thought that the ideas of the states on the subject were so averse to a general revenue in the hands of congs that if such a revenue were proper it was unattainable that as the deficiency of the contributions from the states proceeded not from their complaints of their inability  but of the inequality of the apportionments it would be a wiser course to pursue the rule of the confederation towit to ground the requisition on an actual valuation of lands that congress wd then stand on firm ground  try a practicable mode tuesday jany   th      the subject yesterday under discussion was resumed a division of the question was called for by mr wolcott so as to leave a distinct question on the words to be collected by congress wch he did not like     mr wilson considered this mode of collection as essential to the idea of a general revenue since without it the proceeds of the revenue wd depend entirely on the punctuality energy  unanimity of the states the want of which led to the present consideration mr hamilton was strenuously of the same opinion mr fitzsimmons informed congress that the legislature of penna had at their last meeting been dissuaded from appropriating their revenue to the payment of their own citizens creditors of the u s instead of remitting it to ye continental treasury merely by the urgent representations of a committee of congress  by the hope that some general system in favr of all the public creditors would be adopted that the legislature were now again assembled and altho sensible of the tendency of such an example thought it their duty  meant in case the prospect of such a system vanished to proceed immediately to the separate appropriations formerly in contemplation on the motion of mr madison the whole proposition was newmodelled as follows that it is the opinion of congress that the establishment of permanent  adequate funds to operate generally throughout the u states is indispensably necessary for doing complete justice to the creditors of the u s for restoring public credit and for providing for the future exigencies of the war the words to be collected under the authority of congress were as a separate question left to be added afterwards mr rutledge objected to the term generally as implying a degree of uniformity in the tax which would render it unequal he had in view particularly a land tax according to quañty as had been proposed by the office of finance he thought the prejudices of the people opposed the idea of a general tax  seemed on the whole to be disinclined to it himself at least if extended beyond an impost on trade urging the necessity of pursuing a valuation of land and requisitions grounded thereon mr lee  ded the opposition to the term general he contended that the states wd never consent to a uniform tax because it wd be unequal that it was moreover repugnant to the articles of confederation and by placing the purse in the same hands with the     sword was subversive of the fundamental principles of liberty he mentioned the repeal of the impost by virga himself alone opposing it  that too on the inexpediency in point of time — as proof of the aversion to a general revenue he reasoned upon the subject finally as if it was proposed that congress sd assume  exercise a power immediately  without the sanction of the states of levying money on them in consequence mr wilson rose  explained the import of the motion to be that congress should recommend to the states the investing them with power he observed that the confederation was so far from precluding that it expressly provided for future alterations that the power given to congress by that act was too little not too formidable that there was more of a centrifugal than centripetal force in ye states  that ye funding of a common debt in the manner proposed would produce a salutary invigoration and cement to the union mr elseworth acknowledged himself to be undecided in his opinion that on one side he felt the necessity of continental funds for making good the continental engagements but on the other desponded of a unanimous concurrence of the states in such an establishment he observed that it was a question of great importance how far the federal govt can or ought to exert coercion against delinquent members of the confederacy  that without such coercion no certainty could attend the constitutional mode which referred every thing to the unanimous punctuality of thirteen different councils considering therefore a continental revenue as unattainable and periodical requisitions from congress as inadequate he was inclined to make trial of the middle mode of permanent state funds to be provided at the recommendation of congs and appropriated to the discharge of the common debt mr hamilton in reply to mr elseworth dwelt long on the inefficacy of state funds he supposed too that greater obstacles would arise to the execution of the plan than to that of a general revenue as an additional reason for the latter to be collected by officers under the appointment of congress he signified that as the energy of the federal govt was evidently short of the degree necessary for pervading  uniting the states it was expedient to     introduce the influence of officers deriving their emoluments from  consequently interested in supporting the power of congress  mr williamson was of opinion that continental funds altho desirable were unattainable at least to the full amount of the public exigencies he thought if they could be obtained for the fereign debt it would be as much as could be expected and that they would also be less essential for the domestic debt mr madison observed that it was needless to go into proofs of the necessity of payg the public debts that the idea of erecting our national independence on the ruins of public faith and national honor must be horrid to every mind which retained either honesty or pride that the motion before congress contained a simple proposition with respect to the truth of which every member was called upon to give his opinion that this opinion must necessarily be in the affirmative unless the several objects of doing justice to the public creditors c c could be compassed by some other plan than the one proposed that the   last objects depended essentially on the first since the doing justice to the creditors alone wd restore public credit  the restoration of this alone could provide for ye future exigencies of the war is then a continental revenue indispensably necessary for doing complete justice c this is the question to answer it the other plans proposed must first be reviewed in order to do complete justice to the public creditors either the principal must be paid off or the interest paid punctually the  st is admitted to be impossible on any plan the only plans opposed to the continl one for the latter purpose are   periodical requisitions according to the federal articles  dly permanent funds established by each state within itself  the proceeds consigned to the discharge of public debts will ye  st be adequate to the object the contrary seems to     be maintained by no one if reason did not sufficiently premonish experience has sufficiently demonstrated that a punctual  unfailing compliance by    separate  independent govts with periodical demands of money from congress can never be reckoned upon with the certainty requisite to satisfy our present creditors or to tempt others to become our creditors in future  dly will funds separately established within each state  the amount submitted to the appropriation of congress be adequate to the object the only advantage which is thought to recommend this plan is that the states will be with less difficulty prevailed upon to adopt it its imperfections are  st that it must be preceded by a final and satisfactory adjustment of all accts between the u s and individual states and by an apportionment founded on a valuation of all the lands throughout each of the states in pursuance of the law of the confederation for although the states do not as yet insist on these prerequisites in ye case of annual demands on them with wch they very little comply  that only in the way of an open acct yet these conditions wd certainly be exacted in case of a permanent cession of revenue and the difficulties  delays to say the least incident to these conditions can escape no one  dly the produce of the funds being always in the first instance in the hands  under the control of the states separately might at any time  on various pretences be diverted to state objects  dly that jealousy which is as natural to the states as to individuals  of which so many proofs have appeared that others will not fulfil their respective portions of the common obligations will be continually  mutually suspending remittances to the common treasury until it finally stops them altogether these imperfections are too radical to be admitted into any plan intended for the purposes in question it remains to examine the merits of a plan of a general revenue operating throughout ye u s under the superindtildeence of congress one obvious advantage is suggested by the last objection to separate revenues in the different states that is it will exclude all jealousy among them on that head since each will know whilst it is submitting to the tax that all the others are necessarily at the same instant bearing their respective portions of the burden     again it will take from the states the opportunity as well as the temptation to divert their incomes from the general to internal purposes since these incomes will pass directly into the treasury of the u s another advantage attending a general revenue is that in case of the concurrence of the states in establishing it it would become soonest productive and would consequently soonest obtain the objects in view nay so assured a prospect would give instantaneous confidence and content to the public creditors at home  abroad and place our affairs in a most happy train the consequences with respect to the union of omitting such a provision for the debts of the union also claims particular attention the tenor of the memorial from penna and of the information just given on the floor by one of its delegates mr fitzsimmons renders it extremely probable that that state would as soon as it sd be known that congress had declined such provision or the states rejected it appropriate the revenue required by congress to the payment of its own citizens  troops creditors of the u s the irregular conduct of other states on this subject enforced by such an example could not fail to spread the evil throughout the whole continent what then wd become of the confederation what wd be the authority of congress wt the tie by which the states cd be held together what the source by which the army could be subsisted  clothed what the mode of dividing  discharging our foreign debts what the rule of settling the internal accts what the tribunal by which controversies amg the states could be adjudicated it ought to be carefully remembered that this subject was brought before congress by a very solemn appeal from the army to the justice  gratitude of their country besides immediate pay they ask for permanent security for arrears is not this request a reasonable one will it be just or politic to pass over the only adequate security that can be devised  instead of fulfilling the stipulations of the u s to them to leave them to seek their rewards separately from the states to which they respectively belong the patience of the army has been equal to their bravery but that patience must have its limits and the result of despair cannot be foreseen nor ought to be risked     it has been objected agst a general revenue that it contravenes the articles of confederation these articles as has been observed have presupposed the necessity of alterations in the federal system  have left a door open for them they moreover authorize congress to borrow money now in order to borrow money permanent  certain provision is necessary  if this provision cannot be made in any other way as has been shewn a general revenue is within the spirit of the confederation it has been objected that such a revenue is subversive of the sovereignty  liberty of the states if it were to be assumed without the free gift of the states this objection might be of force but no assumption is proposed in fact congress are already invested by the states with the constitutional authority over the purse as well as the sword a general revenue would only give this authority a more certain  equal efficacy they have a right to fix the quantum of money necessary for the common purposes the right of the states is limited to the mode of supply a requisition of congress on the states for money is as much a law to them as their revenue acts when passed are laws to their respective citizens if for want of the faculty or means of enforcing a requisition the law of congress proves inefficient does it not follow that in order to fulfil the views of the federal constitution such a change sd be made as will render it efficient without such efficiency the end of this constitution which is to preserve order  justice among the members of the union must fail as without a like efficiency would the end of state constitutions wch is to preserve like order  justice among their respective members it has been objected that the states have manifested such aversion to the impost on trade as renders any recommendations of a general revenue hopeless  imprudent it must be admitted that the conduct of the states on that subject is less encouraging than were to be wished a review of it however does not excite despondence the impost was adopted immediately  in its utmost latitude by several of the states several also which complied partially with it at first have since complied more liberally one of them after long refusal has complied substantially two states only have failed altogether  as to one of them it is not   0 known that its failure has proceeded from a decided opposition to it on the whole it appears that the necessity  reasonableness of the scheme have been gaining ground among the states he was aware that one exception ought to be made to this inference an exception too wch it peculiarly concerned him to advert to the state of virga as appears by an act yesterday laid before congress has withdrawn its assent once given to the scheme this circumstance cd not but produce some embarrassment in a representative of that state advocating the scheme one too whose principles were extremely unfavorable to a disregd of the sense of constituents but it ought not to deter him from listening to considerations which in the present case ought to prevail over it one of these considerations was that altho the delegates who compose congress more immediately represented  were amenable to the states from which they respectively come yet in another view they owed a fidelity to the collective interests of the whole  dly although not only the express instructions but even the declared sense of constituents as in the present case were to be a law in general to their representatives still there were occasions on which the latter ought to hazard personal consequences from a respect to what his clear conviction determines to be the true interest of the former and the present he conceived to fall under this exception lastly the part he took on the present occasion was the more fully justified to his own mind by his thorough persuasion that with the same knowledge of public affairs which his station commanded the legislature of va would not have repealed the law in favor of the impost  would even now rescind the repeal the result of these observations was that it was the duty of congress under whose authorytilde the public debts had been contracted to aim at a general revenue as the only means of discharging them  that this dictate of justice  gratitude was enforced by a regard to the preservation of the confederacy to our reputation abroad  to our internal tranquillity mr rutledge complained that those who so strenuously urged the necessity  competency of a general revenue  operating     throughout all the states at the same time declined specifying any general objects from which such a revenue could be drawn he was thought to insinuate that these objects were kept back intentionally untill the general principle cd be irrevocably fixed when congs would be bound at all events to go on with the project whereupon mr fitzsimmons expressed some concern at the turn wch the discussion seemed to be taking he said that unless mutual confidence prevailed no progress could be made towards the attainment of those ends wch all in some way or other aimed at it was a mistake to suppose that any specific plan had been preconcerted among the patrons of a general revenue mr wilson with whom the motion originated gave his assurances that it was neither the effect of preconcert with others nor of any determinate plan matured by himself that he had been led into it by the declaration on saturday last by congs that substantial funds ought to be provided by the memorial of the army from which that declaration had resulted by the memorial from the state of pa holding out the idea of separate appropriations of her revenue unless provision were made for the public creditors by the deplorable  dishonorable situation of public affairs which had compelled congress to draw bills on the unpromised  contingent bounty of their ally and which was likely to banish the superintt of finance whose place cd not be supplied from his department he observed that he had not introduced detail s into the debate because he thought them premature until a general principle should be fixed and that as soon as the principle sd be fixed he would altho not furnished with any digested plan contribute all in his power to the forming such a one mr rutledge moved that the proposition might be committed in order that some practicable plan might be reported before congress sd declare that it ought to be adopted mr izard  ded the motion from a conciliatory view mr madison thought the commitment unnecessary and would have the appearance of delay that too much delay had already taken place that the deputation of the army had a right to expect an answer to their memorial as soon as it could be decided by congress he differed from mr wilson in thinking that a     specification of the objects of a general revenue would be improper and thought that those who doubted its practicabily had a right to expect proof of it from details before they cd be expected to assent to the general principle but he differed also from mr rutledge who thought a commitment necessary for the purpose since his views would be answered by leaving the motion before the house and giving the debate a greater latitude he suggested as practicable objects of a general revenue  st an impost on trade  dly a poll tax under certain qualifications  dly a landtax under do  mr hamilton suggested a house  windowtax he was in favor of the mode of conducting the business urged by mr madison on the motion for the commt   states were in favor of it    agst it so it was lost in this vote the merits of the main proposition very little entered mr lee said that it was a waste of time to be forming resolutions  settling principles on this subject he asked whether these wd ever bring any money into the public treasury his opinion was that congress ought in order to guard agst the inconvenience of meetings of the different legislatures at different  even distant periods to call upon the executives to convoke them all at one period  to lay before them a full state of our public affairs he said the states would never agree to those plans which tended to aggrandize congress that they were jealous of the power of congress  that he acknowledged himself to be one of those who thought this jealousy not an unreasonable one that no one who had ever opened a page or read a line on the subject of liberty could be insensible to the danger of surrendering the purse into the same hands which held the sword the debate was suspended by an adjournment     wednesday jany   th      mr fitzsimmons reminded congress of the numerous inaccuracies  errors in the american column of the treaty with holland and proposed that a revision of it as ratified should take place in order that some steps might be taken for redressing this evil he added that an accurate comparison of it with the treaty with france ought also to be made for the purpose of seeing whether it consisted in all its parts with the latter  he desired the committee who had prepared the ratification to give some explanation on the subject to congress mr madison as first on that committee informed congress that the inaccuracies  errors consisting of misspelling foreign idioms  foreign words obscurity of the sense c were attended to by the committee  verbally noted to congress when their report was under consideration that the committee did not report in writing as the task was disagreeable and the faults were not conceived to be of sufficient weight to affect the ratification he thought it wd be improper to reconsider the act as had been suggested for the purpose of suspending it on that or any other acct but had no objection if congress were disposed to instruct mr adams to substitute with the consent of the other party a more correct counterpart in the american language the subject was dropped nobody seeming inclined to urge it on the motion of mr rutledge  for the purpose of extending the discussion to particular objects of general revenue congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole to consider of the most effectual means of restoring public credit and the proposition relative to general revenue was referred to the committee mr carroll was elected into the chair  the proposition taken up      mr bland proposed to alter the words of the proposition so as to make it read establisht of funds on taxes or duties to operate generally c this was agreed to as a more correct phraseology mr hamilton objected to it at first supposing thro mistake that it might exclude the back lands which was a fund in contemplation of some gentlemen mr madison having adverted to the jealousy of mr rutledge of a latent scheme to fix a tax on land according to its quantity moved that between the words generally  to operate might be inserted the words and in just proportion mr wilson said he had no objection to this amendmt but that it might be referred to the taxes individually  unnecessarily fetter congress since if the taxes collectively should operate in just proportion it wd be sufficient he instanced a landtax  an impost on trade the former of which might press hardest on the southn  the latter on the eastn but both together might     distribute the burden pretty uniformly from this consideration he moved that the words on the whole might be prefixed to the words in just proportion this amendt to the amendment of mr madison was  ded by mr boudinot  agreed to without opposition as was afterwards the whole amendmt mr wilson in order to leave the scheme open for the back lands as a fund for paying the public debts moved that the proposition might be further altered so as to read indispensably necessary towards doing complete justice c—the motion was  ded by mr boudinot  passed without opposition the main proposition by mr wilson as thus amended then passed without opposition in the words following that it is the opinion of congress that the establishment of permanent  adequate funds on taxes or duties which shall operate generally  on the whole in just proportion throughout the u s are indispensably necessary towards doing complete justice to the public creditors for restoring public credit  for providing for the future exigencies of the war mr bland proposed as the only expedient that cd produce immediate relief to the public creditors that congress sd by a fixed resolution appropriate to the payment of interest all the monies which should arise from the requisitions on the states he thought this would not only give immediate relief to the public creditors but by throwing into circulation the stagnant securities enliven the whole business of taxation this proposition was not  ded mr wilson proceeded to detail to congress his ideas on the subject of a continental revenue he stated the internal debt liquidated  unliquidated at    million of dollrs the foreign debt at   million the actual deficiency of      at   million the probable deficiency of    at   million making in the whole    million which in round numbers  probably without exceeding the reality may be called  0 million the interest of this debt at   per ct is   00000 drs to which it will be prudent to add  00000 which if the war continues will be needed and in case of peace may be applied to a navy an annual revenue of   million of drs then is the sum to be aimed at and which ought to be under the management of congs one of the objects already     mentioned from wch this revenue was to be sought was a poll tax this he thought was a very proper one but unfortunately the constitution of maryland which forbids this tax is an insuperable obstacle salt he thought a fit article to be taxed as it is consumed in a small degree by all and in great quantities by none it had been found so convenient a subject of taxation that among all nations which have a system of revenue it is made a material branch in england a considerable sum is raised from it in france it is swelled to the sum of   000000 of livres he thought it would be improper to levy this tax during the war whilst the price wd continue so high but the necessary fall of price at the conclusion of it wd render the tax less sensible to the people the suspension of this particular tax during the war would not be inconvenient as it might be set apart for the debt due to france on which the interest would not be called for during the war he computed the quantity of salt imported into the u s annually at   million of bushels  proposed a duty of ⅓ of a dollar per bushel which wd yield  00000 drs this duty he observed wd press hardest on the eastern states on acct of the extraordinary consumption in the fisheries the next tax which he suggested was on land   dollar on every  00 acres according to the computation of the superintendt of finance would produce  00000 dollrs this computation he was persuaded might be doubled since there could not be less than  00 millions of acres comprehended within the titles of individuals which at   dr per  00 acres yields  000000 of dollars this tax could not be deemed too high  would bear heaviest not on the industrious farmer but on the great landholder as the tax on salt would fall with most weight on the eastern states the equilibrium would be restored by this which would be most felt by the middle and southern states the impost on trade was another source of revenue which altho it might be proper to vary it somewhat in order to remove particular objections ought to be again  again urged upon the states by congress the office of finance has rated this at  00000 dollars he thought a peace would double it in which case the sum of  000000 drs would be made up if these computations however should be found to be too high there will still be other     objects which would bear taxation an excise he said had been mentioned in general this species of taxation was tyrannical  justly obnoxious but in certain forms had been found consistent with the policy of ye freest states in massachusetts a state remarkably jealous of its liberty an excise was not only admitted before but continued since the revolution the same was the case with penna also remarkable for its freedom an excise if so modified as not to offend the spirit of liberty may be considered as an object of easy  equal revenue wine  imported spirits had borne a heavy excise in other countries and might be adopted in ours coffee is another object which might be included the amount of these three objects is uncertain but materials for a satisfactory computation might be procured these hints  remarks he acknowledged to be extremely imperfect  that he had been led to make them solely by a desire to contribute his mite towards such a system as would place the finances of the u s on an honorable and prosperous footing mr ghoram observed that the proposition of mr bland however salutary its tendency might be in the respects suggested could never be admitted because it would leave our army to starve and all our affairs to stagnate during its immediate operation he objected to a duty on salt as not only bearing too heavily on the eastn states but as giving a dangerous advantage to rivals in the fisheries salt he sd exported from england for the fisheries is exempted particularly from duties he thought it would be best to confine our attention for the present to the impost on trade which had been carried so far towards an accomplishment and to remove the objections which had retarded it by limiting the term of its continuance leaving to the states the nomination of the collectors and by making the appropriation of it more specific mr rutledge was also for confining our attention to the impost  to get that before any further attempts were made in order to succeed in getting it however he thought it ought to be asked in a new form few of the states had complied with the recommendation of congs literally georgia had not yet complied rhode island had absolutely refused to comply at all virga which at first complied but partially has since     rescinded even that partial compliance after enumerating the several objections urged by the states agst the scheme he proposed in order to remove them the following resolution viz that it be earnestly recommended to the several states to impose  levy a duty of   per ct ad valorem at the time  place of importation on all goods wares  merchandizes of foreign growth  manufacture wch may be imported into the said states respectively except goods of the u s or any of them and a like duty on all prizes  prize goods condemned in the court of admiralty of said states that the money arising from such duties be paid into the continental treasury to be appropriated  applied to the payment of the interest and to sink the principal of the money which the u s have borrowed in europe  of what they may borrow for discharging the arrears due to the army  for the future support of the war  to no other use or purpose whatsoever that the said duties be continued for    years unless the debts above md be discharged in the mean time in which case they shall cease  determine that the money arising from the said duties  paid by any state be passed to the credit of such state on account of its quota of the debt of the u states the motion was seconded by mr lee mr woolcot opposed the motion as unjust towards those states which having few or no ports receive their merchandize through the ports of others repeating the observation that it is the consumer  not the importer who pays the duty he again animadverted on the conduct of virga in first giving  afterwards withdrawing her assent to the impost recommended by congress mr elseworth thought it wrong to couple any other objects with the impost that the states would give this if any thing and that if a land tax or an excise were combined with it the whole scheme would fail he thought however that some modification of the plan recommended by congs would be necessary he supposed when the benefits of this continl revenue should be experienced it would incline the states to concur in making additions to it he abetted the opposition of mr woolcot to the motion of mr rutledge which proposed that each state should be credited for the duties collected within its ports dwelt on     the injustice of it said that connecticut before the revolution did not import   0 perhaps not   00 part of the merchandize consumed within it and pronounced that such a plan wd never be agreed to he concurred in the expediency of newmodelling the scheme of the impost by defining the period of its continuance by leaving to the state the nomination  to congress the appointment of collectors or vice versa and by a more determinate appropriation of the revenue the first object to which it ought to be applied was he thought the foreign debt this object claimed a preference as well from the hope of facilitating further aids from that quarter as from the disputes into wch a failure may embroil the u s the prejudices agst making a provision for foreign debts which sd not include the domestic ones was he thought unjust  might be satisfied by immediately requiring a tax in discharge of which loanoffice certificates should be receivable state funds for the domestic debts would be proper for subsequent consideration he added as a further objection against crediting the states for the duties on trade respectively collected by them that a mutual jealousy of injuring their trade by being foremost in imposing such a duty would prevent any from making a beginning mr williamson said that mr rutledges motion at the same time that it removed some objections introduced such as would be much more fatal to the measure he was sensible of the necessity of some alterations particularly in its duration  the appointment of the collectors but the crediting the states severally for the amount of their collections was so palpably unjust  injurious that he thought candor required that it should not be persisted in he was of opinion that the interest of the states which trade for others also required it since such an abuse of the advantage possessed by them would compel the states for which they trade to overcome the obstacles of nature  provide supplies for themselves n carolina he said would probably be supplied pretty much thro virga if the latter forbore to levy a tax on the former but in case she did not forbear the ports of n c which are nearly as deep as those of holland might  probably wd be substituted the profits drawn by the more commercial states from the business they carry on   0 for the others were of themselves sufficient  ought to satisfy them mr ramsay differed entirely from his colleague mr rutledge he thought that as the consumer pays the tax the crediting the states collecting the impost unjust n carolina maryland n jersey  connecticut would suffer by such a regulation and would never agree to it mr bland was equally agst the regulation he thought it replete with injustice  repugnant to every idea of finance he observed that this point had been fully canvassed at the time when the impost was originally recommended by congress  finally exploded he was indeed he said opposed to the whole motion of mr rutledge nothing would be a secure pledge to creditors that was not placed out of the countrol of the grantors as long as it was in the power of the states to repeal their grants in this respect suspicions would prevail  wd prevent loans money ought to be approatildeted by the states as it is by the parliament of g b he proposed that the revenue to be solicited from the states should be irrevocable by them without the consent of congress or of nine of the states he disapproved of any determinate limitation to the continuance of the revenue because the continuance of the debt could not be fixed and that was the only rule that could be proper or satisfactory he said he should adhere to these ideas in the face of the act of virga repealing her assent to the impost that it was trifling with congs to enable them to contract debts  to withhold from them the means of fulfilling their contracts mr lee said he seconded the motion of mr rutledge because he thought it most likely to succeed that he was persuaded the states would not concur in the impost on trade without a limitation of time affixed to it with such a limitation and the right of collection he thought virga r island  the other states probably wd concur the objection of his colleague mr bland he conceived to be unfounded no act of the states could be irrevocable because if so called it might notwithstanding be repealed but he thought there wd be no danger of a repeal observing that the national faith was all the security that was given in other countries or that could be given he was sensible that     something was of necessity to be done in the present alarming crisis and was willing to strike out the clause crediting the states for their respective collections of the revenue on trade as it was supposed that it wd impede the measure mr hamilton disliked every plan that made but partial provision for the public debts as an inconsistent  dishonorable departure from the declaration made by congs on that subject he said the domestic creditors would take the alarm at any distinctions unfavorable to their claims that they would withhold their influence from any such measures recommended by congress and that it must be principally from their influence on their respective legislatures that success could be expected to any application from congs for a general revenue thursday  0 jany the answer to the memorials from the legislature of penna was agreed to as it stands on the journal n jersey alone dissenting  in the course of its discussion several expressions were struck out which seemed to reprehend the states for the deficiency of their contributions in favor of these expressions it was urged that they were true and ought to be held forth as the cause of the public difficulties in justification of congress on the other side     it was urged yt congress had in many respects been faulty as well as the states particularly in letting their finances become so disordered before they began to apply any remedy and that if this were not the case it would be more prudent to address to the states a picture of the public distresses  danger than a satire on their faults since the latter would only irritate them whereas the former wd tend to lead them into the measures supposed by congress to be essential to the public interest the propriety of mentioning to the legislature of penna the expedt into which congress had been driven of drawing bills on spain  holland without previous warrant the disappt attending it and the deductions ultimately ensuing from the aids destined to the u s by the ct of france was also a subject of discussion on one side it was represented as a fact which being dishonorable to congress ought not to be proclaimed by them  that in the present case it cd answer no purpose on the other side it was contended that it was already known to all the world that as a glaring proof of the public embarrassmts it would impress the legislature with the danger of making those separate appropriations which wd increase the embarrassments and particularly would explain in some degree the cause of the discontinuance of the french interest due on the loan office certificates mr rutledge  some other members having expressed less solicitude about satisfying or soothing the creditors within pa through the legislature than others thought ought to be felt by every one mr wilson adverting to it with some warmth declared     that if such indifference should prevail he was little anxious what became of the answer to the memorials pena he was persuaded would take her own measures without regard to those of congress and that she ought to do so she was willing he said to sink or swim according to the common fate but that she would not suffer herself with a millstone of  000000  of the continl debt about her neck to go to the bottom alone friday jany    the instruction to the va delegates from that state relative to tobo exported to n y under passport from the secy of congress was referred to a committee mr fitzsimmons moved that the information received from sd state of its inability to contribute more than — towards the requisitions of congress sd be also committed mr bland saw no reason for such commitment mr ghoram was in favr of it he thought such a resolution from va was of the most serious import especially if compared with her withdrawal of her assent to the impost he said with much earnestness that if one state should be connived at in such defaults others would think themselves entitled to a like indulgence massts he was sure had a better title to it than va he said the former had expended immense sums in recruiting her line which composed almost the whole northn army that   00000 £ dollar at  s had been laid out  that without this sum the army would have been disbanded mr fitzsimmons abetting the animadversions on virga took notice that of — dollars reqd by congress from her for the year      she had paid the paltry sum only of   000 drs and was notwithstanding endeavouring to play off from further contributions—the com̃itment took place without opposition the subcommittee consisting of mr madison mr carroll  mr wilson had this morning a conference with the superintendt of finance on the best mode of estimating the value of land through the u s the superintendt was no less puzzled on the subject than the committee had been he thought some essay     ought to be made for executing the confederation if it sd be practicable  if not to let the impracticability appear to the states he concurred with the sub committee also in opinion that it would be improper to refer the valuation to the states as mutual suspicions of partiality if not a real partiality would render the result a source of discontent and that even if congs should expressly reserve to themselves a right of revising  rejecting it such a right could not be exercised without giving extreme offence to the suspected party to guard agst these difficulties it was finally agreed  the sub committee accordingly reported to the g comittee that it is expedient to require of the several states a return of all surveyed  granted land within each of them and that in such return the land be distinguished into occupied  unoccupied that it also was expedient to appoint one commissr for each state who should be empowered to proceed without loss of time into the several states  to estimate the value of the lands therein according to the returns above mentioned  to such instructions as should from time to time be given him for that purpose this report was hurried in to the grand com̃itee for two reasons  st it was found that mr rutledge mr bland  several others relied so much on a valuation on land and connected it so essentially with measures for restoring public credit that an extreme backwardness on their part affected all these measures whilst the valuation of land was left out a  d reason was that the subcommittee were afraid that suspicions might arise of intentional delay in order to confine the attention of congs to general funds as affording the only prospect of relief the grand committee for like reasons were equally impatient to make a report to congress and accordingly after a short consultation the question was taken whether the above report of the subcome or the report referred to them sd be preferred in favor of the  st were mr wilson mr carrol mr madison mr elmore mr hamilton in favor of the  d were mr arnold mr dyer mr hawkins mr ghoram mr rutledge  mr gilman so the latter was immediately handed in to congress      referred to a committee of the whole into which they immediately resolved themselves a motion was made by mr bland  ded by mr madison that this report sd be taken up in preference to the subject of general funds mr wilson opposed it as irregular  inconvenient to break in on an unfinished subject and supposed that as some further experiment must be intended than merely a discussion of the subject in congress before the subject of genl funds would be seriously resumed he thought it unadvisable to interrupt the latter mr madison answered that the object was not to retard the latter business but to remove an obstacle to it that as the two subjects were in some degree connected as means of restoring public credit  inseparably connected in the minds of many members it was but reasonable to admit one as well as the other to a share of attention that if a valuation of land sd be found on mature deliberation to be as efficacious a remedy as was by some supposed it wd be proper at least to combine it with the other expedient or perhaps to substitute it altogether if the contrary should become apparent its patrons wd join the more cordially in the object of a general revenue mr hamilton concurred in these ideas  wished the valuation to be taken up in order that its impracticability  futility might become manifest the motion passed in the affirmative  the report was taken up the phraseology was made more correct in several instances a motion was made by mr boudinot  ded by mr elseworth to strike out the clause requiring a return of the names of the owners as well as the quantity of land mr elseworth also contended for a less specific return of the parcels of land the objection agst the clause were that it would be extremely troublesome  equally useless mr bland thought these specific returns wd be a check on frauds  the suspicion of them mr williamson was of the same opinion as were also mr lee mr ghoram  mr ramsay  the motion was withdrawn by mr boudinot saturday  monday no congress     tuesday feb   an indecent  tart remonstrance was red from vermont agst the interposition of congs in favor of the persons who had been banished  whose effects had been confiscated a motion was made by mr hamilton  ded by mr dyer to commit it mr wolcot who had always patronized the case of vermont wished to know the views of a committment mr hamilton said his view was to fulfill the resolution of congress wch bound them to enforce the measure mr dyer sd his was that so dishonorable a menace might be as quickly as possible renounced he said genl washington was in favour of vermont that the principal people of n england were all supporters of them and that congress ought to rectify the error into which they had been led without longer exposing themselves to reproach on this subject it was committed without dissent mr wilson informed congress that the legislature of pena having found the ordinance of congs erecting a court for piracies so obscure in some points that they were at a loss to adapt yr laws to it had appointed a come to confer with a come of congress he accordingly moved in behalf of the pa delegation that a come might be appd for that purpose after some objections by mr madison agst the impropriety of holding a communication with pa through committees when the purpose might be as well answered by a memorial or an instruction to its delegates a come was appd consisting of mr rutledge mr madison  mr wilson the report proposing a commutation for the halfpay

proposed  ¼  called for the yeas  nays messrs wolcot  dyer observed yt they were bound by instructions on this subject mr arnold said the case was the same with him they also     queried the validity of the act of congs which had stipulated half pay to the army as it had passed before the confederation and by a vote of less than seven states mr madison sd that he wished if the yeas  nays were called it might be on the true calculation and not on an arbitrary principle of compromise as the latter standing singly on the journal wd not express the true ideas of the yeas and might even subject them to contrary interpretations he sd that the act was valid because it was decided according to the rule then in force  that as the officers had served under the faith of it justice fully corroborated it  that he was astonished to hear these principles controverted he was also astonished to hear objections agst a commutation come from states in compliance with whose objections agst the half pay itself this expedt had been substituted mr wilson expressed his surprise also that instructions sd be given which militated agst the most peremptory  lawful engagements of congs and said that if such a doctrine prevailed the authority of the confederacy was at an end mr arnold said that he wished the report might not be decided on at this time that the assembly of r i was in session  he hoped to receive their further advice mr bland enforced the ideas of mr madison  mr wilson—mr gilman thought it wd be best to refer the subject of ½ pay to the several states to be settled between them  their respective lines by general consent the report lay over mr lee communicated to congress a letter he had received from mr samuel adams dated boston decr         introducing mr — from canada as a person capable of giving intelligence relative to affairs in canada  the practicability of uniting that province with the confederated states the letter was committed in come of the whole on the report concerning a valuation of the lands of the u states— a motion was made by mr rutledge wch took the sense of congs on this question whether the rule of apportionment to be grounded on the proposed valuation sd continue in force until revoked by congs or a period be now fixed beyond which it sd not continue in force the importance of the distinction lay in the necessity of having seven votes on every act of congs     the eastern states were generally for the latter supposing that the southern states being impoverished by the recent havoc of the enemy would be underrated in the first valuation the southern states were for the same reason interested in favor of the former on the question there were   ays only which produced a dispute whether in a committee of the whole a majority wd decide or whether   votes were necessary in favor of the first rule it was contended by mr ghoram  others that in committees of congress the rule always is that a majority decides in favr of the latter it was contended that if the rule of other committees applies to a come of the whole the vote sd be individual per capita as well as by a majority that in other deliberative assemblies the rules of voting were not varied in commes of the whole  that it wd be inconvenient in practice to report to congs as the sense of the body a measure approved by   or   states since there could be no reason to hope that in the same body in a different form   states wd approve it and consequently a waste of time would be the result come rose  cons adjourned wednesday febry    thursday feby   in order to decide the rule of voting in a come of the whole before congrs should go into the said come mr bland moved that the rule sd be to vote by states  the majority of states in come to decide mr wilson moved to postpone mr bs motion in order to resolve that the rule be to vote by states and according to the same rules which govern congress as this genl question was connected in the minds of members with the particular question to which it was to be immediately applied the motion for postponing was negatived chiefly by the eastern states a division of the question on mr blands motion was then called for  the first part was agreed to as on the journal the latter clause to wit a majority to decide was negatived so nothing as to the main point was determined in this uncertainty mr osgood proposed that congrs should resolve itself into a come of the whole mr carroll as chairman observed that as the same     difficulty would occur he wished congs would previously direct him how to proceed mr hamilton proposed that the latter clause of mr blands motion shd be reconsidered and agreed to wrong as it was rather than have no rule at all in opposition to which it was sd that there was no more reason why one  that not the minor side sd wholly yield to the inflexibility of the other yn vice versa and that if they sd be willing to yield on the present occasion it wd be better to do it tacitly than to saddle themselves with an express  perpetual rule which they judged improper this expedient was assented to and congress accordingly went into a committee of the whole the points arising on the several amendmts proposed were  st the period beyond wch the rule of the first valuation sd not be in force on this point mr collins proposed   years mr bland  0 years mr boudinot   years n jersey havg instructed her delegates thereon the cont delegates proposed   years on the question for   years n h no mas no r i ay cont ay all the other states no on the question for   years all the states ay except cont the  d point was whether  how far the rule sd be retrospective on this point the same views operated as on the preceding some were agst any retrospection others for extending it to the whole debt and others for extendg it so far as was necessary for liquidating and closing the accounts between the united states and each individual state the several motions expressive of these different ideas were at length withdrawn with a view that the point might be better digested  more accurately brought before congress so the rept was agreed to in the come  made to congress when the question was about to be put mr madison observed that the report lay in a great degree of confusion that several points had been decided in a way too vague  indirect to ascertain the real sense of congs that other points involved in the subject had not recd any decision and proposed the sense of congs shod be distinctly  successively taken on all of them  the result referred to a special come to be digested c the question was however put  negatived the votes being as they appear on the journal the reasons on which mr hamiltons motion was grounded appear from its preamble   0 friday feby   on motion of mr lee who had been absent when the report was yesterday negatived the matter was reconsidered the plan of taking the sense of congs on the several points as yesterday proposed by mr madison was generally admitted as proper the first question propd in come of the whole by mr madison was q shall a valuation of land within the u s as directed by the articles of confederation be immediately attempted—  ays n y only no the states present were n h mas cont n y n j pa va n c s c r i   member mard   do by mr wilson q shall each state be called on to return to the u s in congs assd the no of acres granted to or surveyed for any person and also the no of buildings within it   ayes—n c no—supposing this not to accord with the plan of referring the valuation to the states which was patronized by that delegation a supplement to this question was suggested as follows q shall the male inhabitants be also returned the blacks  whites being therein distinguished ay n c no for the same reason as above cont divided by mr madison q shall the states be called on to return to congs an estimate of the value of its lands with the buildings  improvements within each respectively after some discussion on this point in whch the inequalities which wd result from such estimates were set forth at large and effects of such an experiment in virga had been described by mr mercer and a comparison of an average valuation in pa  va which amounted in the latter to  0 pct more than in the former altho the real value of land in the former was confessedly thrice that of the latter had been quoted by mr madison the apprehensions from a reference of any thing more to the states than a report of simple facts increased and on the vote the states were as follows n h mas n j pa va no mr bland ay mr lee silent cont n c s c ay n y divd so it passed in the negative by mr madison     q shall a period be now fixed beyond which the rule to be eventually estabd by congs shall not be in force ay unanimously by mr madison q what shall that period be cont was again for   years which being rejd   yrs passed unanimously by mr madison q shall the rule so to be estabd have retrospective operation so far as may be necessary for liquidating  closing the accts between the u s  each particular state ay—cont no mr dyer  mr mercer understood this as making the amt of the several requisitions of congs and not of the paymts by ye states the standard by which the accts were to be liquidated and thought the latter the just quantum for retrospective appointment their reasoning however was not fully comprehended saturday feby   come of the whole mr mercer revived the subject of retrospective operation and after it had been much discussed  the difference elucidated wch might happen between apportiong according to the first valuation which sd be made merely the sums paid on the requisitions of congs  apportiong the whole requisitions consisting of the sums paid  the deficiencies which might not be pd until some distant day when a different rule formed under different circumstances of the states sd be in force the assent to the last question put yesterday was reversed  there was added to the preceding question after   years—and shall operate as a rule for apportioning the sums necessary to be raised for supporting the public credit  other contingent expenses  for adjusting all accounts between the u states  each particular state for monies paid or articles furnished by them  for no other purpose whatsoever on this question there were   ays—so it became a vote of the come of the whole     monday feby  0 for the report of the committee on the resolutions of va concerning the contract under which tobo was to be exported to n y  and the admission of circumstantial proof of accts agst the u s where legal vouchers had been destroyed by the enemy see the journal of this date mr mercer informed congress that this matter had made much noise in va that she had assented to the export of the first quantity merely out of respect to congs and under an idea that her rights of sovereignty had been encroached upon and that as a further quantity had been exported without the license of the state the question was unavoidable whether the authority of congs extended to the act he wished therefore that congress wd proceed to decide the question mr fitzsimmons in behalf of the committee observed that they went no further than to examine whether the proceedings of the officers of congs were conformable to the resoln of congs  not whether the latter were within the power of congs mr lee sd the rept did not touch the point that the additional quantity had been exported without application to the state altho the first quantity was licensed by the state with great reluctance in consequence of the request of congs and of assurances agst a repetition and that the superintendt  secy of congs ought at any rate to have made application to the executive before they proceeded to further exportations mr rutledge sd the rept went to the very point that v suspected the resols of congs had been abused by the officers of congs and the rept shewed that no such abuse had taken place that if this information was not satisfactory and the state sd contest the right of congs in the case it wd then be proper to answer it on that point but not before he sd if the gentleman mr lee meant that the come authorized by congs on the—day of—to make explanations on the subject to the legislature of va had given the assurances he mentioned he must be mistaken     for none such had been given he had he sd formed notes of his remarks to the lege but accordg to his practice had destroyed them after the occasion was over and therefore cd only assert this from memory that nevertheless his memory enabled him to do it with certainty mr lee in explanation sd he did not mean the come that the abuse complained of was not that the resoluns of congs had been exceeded but that the export had been undertaken without the sanction of the state if the acts were repeated he said great offence wd be given to va the report was agd to as far as the tobo was concerned without a dissenting voice mr lee uttering a no but not loud enough to be heard by congress or the chair the part relating to the loss of vouchers was unanimously agd to come of the whole the rept for the valuation of land was amended by the insertion of distinguishing dwelling houses from others the come adjourned  the report was made to congs mr lee  mr jervais moved that the report might be postponed to adopt another plan to wit to call on the states to return a valuation and to provide that in case any return sd not be satisfactory to all parties persons sd be appd by congs  others by the states respectively to adjust the case finally—on this question n h was divd mas no r i ay cont no n y divd n j no pa no va no mr madison  mr jones no—mr lee  mr bland ay n c ay s c ay so the motion failed tuesday feby    the rept made by the come of the whole havg decided that ye mode to be grounded on the return of facts called for from ye states ought now to be ascertained mr rutledge proposed  d by mr gilman that ye states sd be required to name comrs each of them one who or any nine of them sd be appd  empowerd by congs to settle the valuation mr ghoram was agst it as parting with a power which might be turned by the states agst congs mr wolcot agst it declares his     opinion that the confederation ought to be amended by substituting numbers of inhabitants as the rule admits the difference between freemen  blacks and suggests a compromise by including in the numeration such blacks only as were within      0 years of age mr wilson was agst relinquishing such a power to the states proposes that the commissioners be appd by congs and their proceedings subject to the ratification of congs mr mercer was for submitting them to the revision of congs  this amendment was recd mr peters agst the whole scheme of valuation as holding out false lights  hopes to the public mr rutledge thinks comrs appd by the states may be trusted as well as comrs appd by congs or as congs themselves mr wilson observes that if appd by the states they will bring with them the spirit of agents for their respective states—if appd by congs they will consider themselves as servants of the u s at large  be more impartial mr ghoram  ded by mr wilson proposes to postpone in order to require the states to appt comrs to give congs information for a basis for a valuation—on the question n h no mas ay r i ay cont ay n y ay n j ay pa ay va no n c no s c no so it was decided in the negative to make the resolution more clear after the words or any nine of them the words

cont ay n y no n j no pa ay va ay mr madison no n c ay s c ay so it was agreed to  the resolution declaring that a mode sd now be fixed struck out as executed the whole report was then committed to a special come consisting of mr rutledge mr ghoram  mr gilman to be formed into a proper act      wednesday feby    the declaration of congs as to genl funds passed of jany the    as appears on the journals   congress resolved itself into a come of the whole in order to consider the funds to be adopted and recommended to the states on motion of mr mifflin the impost of   per ct was taken into consideration as it seemed to be the general opinion that some variations from the form in which it had been first recomended wd be necessary for reconciling the objecting states to it it was proposed that the sense of the come should be taken on that head the following questions were accordingly propounded que   is it expedient to alter the impost as recommended on the — day of —      mr lee said the states particularly virga wd never concur in the measure unless the term of years were limited the collection left to the states  the appropriation annually laid before ym     mr wolcot thought the revenue ought to be commensurate in point of time as well as amount to the debt that there was no danger in trusting congs considering the responsible mode of its appt and that to alter the plan wd be a mere condescension to the prejudices of the states mr ghoram favored the alteration for the same reason as mr lee he said private letters informed him that the opposition to the impost law was gaining ground in massts and the repeal of virga would be very likely to give that opposition the ascendance he said our measures must be accommodated to the sentiments of the states whether just or unreasonable mr hamilton dissented from the particular alterations suggested but did not mean to negative the question mr bland was for conforming to the ideas of the states as far as wd in any manner consist with the object on the question the affirmative was unanimous excepting the voice of mr wolcot que  d shall the term of duration be limited to    years mr mercer professed a decided opposition to the principle of general revenue observed that the liberties of engd had been preserved by a separation of the purse from the sword that untill the debts sd be liquidated  apportioned he wd never assent in congs or elsewhere to the scheme of the impost mr bland proposed an alternative of    years or until the requisitions of congs according to the articles of confedn shall be found adequate on this proposition the votes were of n h divd r i no cont no n y no n j no pa no virga ay n c divd s c ay so the proposition was not agreed to on the main question for    years it was voted in the

report to congs the alterations yesterday agreed on with respect to the   per ct impost the deputy secy at war reported to congress the result of the inquiry directed by them on the   th day of january into the seizure of goods destined for the british prisoners of war under passport from genl washington from this report it appeared that some of the seizors had pursued their claim under the law of the state  that in consequence the goods had been condemned  ordered for sale the papers were referred to a come consisting of mr rutledge mr ghoram  mr lee who after havg retired for a few moments reported that the secy of war should be authorized  directed to cause the goods to be taken from the places where they had been deposited to employ such force as wd be sufficient and that the duke de lauzun whose legion was in the neighbourhood should be requested to give the secy such aid as he might apply for this report was generally regarded by congs as intemperate and the proposed recourse to the french legion as flagrantly imprudent mr hamilton said that if the object had been to embroil the country wth their allies the expedient would have been well conceived  he added that the exertion of force would not under these circumstances meet the sense of the people at large mr ghoram sd he denied this with respect to the people of massachusetts mr lee on the part of the come said that the d de lauzun had been recurred to as being in the neighbourhood  having cavalry under his command which would best answer the occasion     and that the report was founded on wise  proper considerations mr mercer mr williamson mr ramsay mr wilson  mr madison strenuously opposed the report as improper altogether as far as it related to the french legion and in other respects so until the state of pa sd on a summons refuse to restore the articles seized mr rutledge with equal warmth contended for the expediency of the measures reported mr mercer  mr madison at length proposed that congress sd assert the right on this subject  summon the state of pena to redress the wrong immediately the report was recommitted with this proposition  mr wilson  mr mercer added to ye come the speech of the k of g b on the  th of decr      arrived  produced great joy in general except among the merchts who had great quantities of merchandize in store the price of which immediately  materially fell the most judicious members of congs however suffered a great diminution of their joy from the impossibility of discharging the arrears  claims of the army  their apprehensions of new difficulties from that quarter  friday feby    mr jones mr rutledge  mr wilson to whom had been referred on tuesday last a letter from mr jefferson stating     the obstacles to his voyage reported that they had conferred with the agent of marine who sd there was a fit vessel ready for sea in this port but was of opinion the arrival of the british kings speech would put a stop to the sailing of any vessels from the ports of america untill something definite should take place and that if congress judged fit that mr jefferson sd proceed immediately to europe it would be best to apply to the french minister for one of the frigates in the chesapeake the general opinion of congs seemed to be that under present circumstances he sd suspend his voyage untill the further order of congs and on motion of mr ghoram seconded by mr wolcot the secy of foreign affairs was accordingly without opposition directed to make this known to mr jefferson the report of the come for obtaining a valuation of land was made  considered see the journal of this date monday feby    the report respecting a valuation of land being lost as appears from the journal it was revived by the motion of mr dyer seconded by mr mercer as it stands  the appointment of commissrs by congs for adjusting the quotas being changed for a grand committee consisting of a delegate present from each state for that purpose a motion was made to strike out the clause requiring the concurrence of nine voices in the report to congress and on the question shall the words stand the states being equally divided the clause was expunged it was thereafter reconsidered  reinserted   0 the whole report was agreed to with great reluctance by almost all by many from a spirit of accommodation only  the necessity of doing something on the subject some of those who were in the negative particularly mr madison thought the plan not within the spirit of the confederation that it would be ineffectual and that the states would be dissatisfied with it a motion was made by mr hamilton  ded by mr fitzsimmons to renew the recommendation of the — feby      for vesting congress with power to make abatements in favor of states parts of which had been in possession of the enemy it was referred to a committee tuesday feby    come of the whole on the subject of genl funds mr rutledge  mr mercer proposed that the impost of   per ct as altered  to be recommended to the states should be appropriated exclusively first to the interest of ye debt to the army  then in case of surplus to the principal mr rutledge urged in support of this motion that it would be best to appropriate this fund to the army as the most likely to be obtained as their merits were superior to those of all other creditors and as it was the only thing that promised what policy absolutely required some satisfaction to them mr wilson replied that he was so sensible of the merits of the army that if any discrimination were to be made among the public creditors he should not deny them perhaps a preference but that no such discrimination was necessary that the ability of the public was equal to the whole debt and that before it be split into different descriptions the most vigorous efforts ought to be made to provide for it entire that we ought first at least to see what funds could be provided to see how far they would be deficient and then in the last necessity only to admit discriminations mr ghoram agreed with mr wilson he said an exclusive appropriation to the army would in some places be unpopular and would prevent a compliance of those states whose citizens were     the greatest creditors of the united states since without the influence of the public creditors the measure could never be carried through the states and these if excluded from the appropriation would be even interested in frustrating the measure  keeping by that means their cause a common one with the army mr mercer applauded the wisdom of the confederation in leaving the provision of money to the states said that when this plan was deviated from by congress their objects should be such as were best known  most approved that the states were jealous of one another  wd not comply unless they were fully acquainted with  approved the purpose to which their money was to be applied that nothing less than such a preference of the army would conciliate them that no civil creditor would dare to put his claims on a level with those of the army and insinuated that the speculations which had taken place in loan office certificates might lead to a revision of that subject on principles of equity that if too much were asked from the states they would grant nothing he said that it had been alledged that the large public debt if funded under congress would be a cement of the confederacy he thought on the contrary it would hasten its dissolution as the people would feel its weight in the most obnoxious of all forms that of taxation      on the question the states were all no except s carolina which was ay  a motion was made by mr rutledge  ded by mr bland to change the plan of the impost in such a manner as that a tariff might be formed for all articles that would admit of it and that a duty ad valorem sd be collected only on such articles as would not admit of it in support of such an alteration it was urged that it would lessen the opportunity of collusion between collector  importer  would be more equal among the states on the other side it was alledged that the states had not objected to that part of the plan and a change might produce objections—that the nature  variety of imports would require necessarily the collection to be advalorem on the greater part of them that the forming of a book of rates wd be attended with great difficulties  delays and that it would be in the power of congress by raising the rate of the article to augment the duty beyond the limitation of   per ct and that this consideration would excite objections on the part of the states—the motion was negatived— a motion was made by mr hamilton  ded by mr wilson that whereas congres was desirous that the motives  views of their     measures sd be known to their constituents in all cases where the public safety wd admit that when the subject of finances was under debate the doors of congs sd be open congs adjourned it being the usual hour  the motion being generally disrelished—the pa delegates said privately that they had brought themselves into a critical situation by dissuading their constituents from separate provision for creditors of u s within pena hoping that congs wd adopt a general provision  they wished their constituents to see the prospect themselves  to witness the conduct of their delegates perhaps the true reason was that it was expected the presence of public creditors numerous  weighty in philada wd have no influence  that it wd be well for the public to come more fully to the knowledge of the public finances letter recd from wm lee at ghent notifying the desire of the emperor of austria to form a commercial treaty with the u s and to have a residt from them comd to mr izard ghoram  wilson wednesday february    the motion made yesterday by mr hamilton for opening the doors of congress when the subject of the finances should be under debate was negatived penna alone being ay a motion was made by mr hamilton seconded by mr bland to postpone the clause of the report made by the come of the whole for altering the impost viz the clause limiting its duration to    years in order to substitute a proposition declaring it to be inexpedient to limit the period of its duration first because it ought to be commensurate to the duration of the debt  dly because it was improper in the present stage of the business and all the limitation of which it wd admit had been defined in the resolutions of—      mr hamilton said in support of his motion that it was in vain to attempt to gain the concurrence of the states by removing the objections publickly assigned by them against the impost that these were the ostensible  not the true objections that the true objection on the part of r i was the interference of the impost     with the opportunity afforded by their situation of levying contributions on cont c which recd foreign supplies through the ports of r i that the true objection on the part of va was her having little share in the debts due from the u s to which the impost would be applied that a removal of the avowed objections would not therefore remove the obstructions whilst it would admit on the part of congs that their first recommendation went beyond the absolute exigencies of the public that congs having taken a proper ground at first ought to maintain it till time should convince the states of the propriety of the measure mr bland said that as the debt had been contracted by congress with the concurrence of the states and congs was looked to for payment by the public creditors it was justifiable  requisite in them to pursue such means as would be adequate to the discharge of the debt  that the means would not be adequate if limited in duration to a period within which no calculations had shewn that the debt wd be discharged on the motion the states were n hampshire divided masts no r island ay cont divd n york ay n jersey ay pena ay virga no mr bland ay n carolina ay s carolina ay mr rutledge said he voted for postponing not in order to agree to mr hamiltons motion but to move  he accordingly renewed the motion made in come of the whole viz that the impost should be appropriated exclusively to the army this motion was seconded by mr lee mr hamilton opposed the motion strenuously declared that as a friend to the army as well as to the other creditors  to the public at large he could never assent to such a partial distribution of justice that the different states being differently attached to different branches of the public debt would never concur in establishg a fund wch was not extended to every branch that it was impolitic to divide the interests of the civil  military creditors whose joint efforts in the states would be necessary to prevail on them to adopt a general revenue mr mercer favored the measure as necessary to satisfy the army  to avert the consequences which would result from their disappointment on this subject he pronounced that the army would not disband until satisfactory provision should be made      that this was the only attainable provision but he reprobated the doctrine of permanent debt supported by a general  permanent revenue  said that it would be good policy to separate instead of cementing the interests of the army  the other public creditors insinuating that the claims of the latter were not supported by justice  said that the loan office certificates ought to be revised mr fitzsimmons observed that it was unnecessary to make a separate appropriation of the impost to one particular debt since if other funds sd be superadded there would be more simplicity  equal propriety in an aggregate fund for the aggregate debt funded and that if no other funds should be superadded it wd be unjust  impolitic that the states whose citizens were the chief creditors of the u s wd never concur in such a measure that the mercantile interest which comprehended the chief creditors of pena had by their influence obtained the prompt  full concurrence of that state in the impost and if that influence were excluded the state would repeal its law he concurred with those who hoped the army wd not disband unless provision sd be made for doing them justice mr lee contended that as every body felt and acknowledged the force of the demands of the army an appropriation of the impost to them wd recommend it to all the states that distinct  specific appropriations of distinct revenue was the only true system of finance and was the practice of all other nations who were enlightened on this subject that the army had not only more merit than the mercantile creditors but that the latter would be more able on a return of peace to return to the business which would support them mr madison said that if other funds were to be superadded as the gentleman mr rutledge who made the motion admitted it was at least premature to make the appropriation in question that it wd be best to wait till all the funds were agreed upon  then appropriate them respectively to those debts to which they sd be best fitted that it was probable the impost would be judged best adapted to the foreign debt as the foreign creditors could not like the domestic ever recur to particular states for separate payments and that as this wd be a revenue little felt it would be     prudent to assign it to those for whom the states wd care least leaving more obnoxious revenues for those creditors who wd excite the sympathy of their countrymen and cd stimulate them to do justice mr williamson was agst the motion said he did not wish the army to disband until proper provision should be made for them that if force sd be necessary to excite justice the sooner force was applied the better mr wilson was against the motion of mr rutledge he observed that no instance occurred in the british history of finance in which distinct appropriations had been made to distinct debts already contracted that a consolidation of funds had been the result of experience that an aggregate fund was more simple  would be most convenient that the interest of the whole funded debt ought to be paid before the principal of any part of it and therefore in case of surplus of the impost beyond the interest of the army debt it ought at any rate to be applied to the interest of the other debts and not as the motion proposed to the principal of the army debt he was fully of opinion that such a motion would defeat itself that by dividing the interest of the civil from that of the military creditors provision for the latter would be frustrated on the question on mr rutledges motion the states were n h no mass no cont no n j no virga no mr lee and mr mercer ay n c no s carolina

the gentlemen who were in the     negative desponding of an indefinite grant of it from the states the motion was reconsidered mr wolcot  mr hamilton repeat the inadequacy of a definite term mr ramsay  mr williamson repeat the improbability of an indefinite term being acceded to by the states  the expediency of preferring a limited impost to a failure of it altogether mr mercer was against the impost altogether but would confine his opposition within congress he was in favor of the limitation as an alleviation of the evil mr fitzsimmons animadverted on mr mercers insinuation yesterday touching the loanoffice creditors  the policy of dividing them from the military creditors reprobated every measure which contravened the principles of justice  public faith and asked whether it were likely that mas  pa to whose citizens half the loan office debt was owing would concur with virga whose citizens had lent but little more than three hundred thousand dollars in any plan that did not provide for that in common with other debts of the u s he was against a limitation to    years mr lee wished to know whether by loan office creditors were meant the original subscribers or the present holders of the certificates as the force of their demands may be affected by this consideration mr fitzsimmons saw the scope of the question and said that if another scale of depreciation was seriously in view he wished it to come out that every one might know the course to be taken mr ghoram followed the sentiments of the gentleman who last spoke expressed his astonishment that a gentleman mr lee who had enjoyed such opportunities of observing the nature of public credit should advance such doctrines as were fatal to it he said it was time that this point sd be explained that if the former scale for the loan office certificates was to be revised and reduced as one member from virga mr mercer contended or a further scale to be made out for subsequent depreciation of certificates as seemed to be the idea of the other member mr lee the restoration of public credit was not only     visionary but the concurrence of the states in any arrangemts whatever was not to be expected he was in favor of the limitation as necessary to overcome the objections of the states mr mercer professed his attachment to the principles of justice but declared that he thought the scale by which the loans had been valued unjust to the public  that it ought to be revised  reduced on the question for the period of    years it was decided in the affirmative seven states being in favor of it n jersey  n york only being no mr mercer called the attention of congress to the case of the goods seized under a law of pena on which the come had not yet reported and wished that congs would come to some resolution declaratory of their rights  which would lead to an effectual interposition on the part of the legislature of pena after much conversation on the subject in which the members were somewhat divided as to the degree of peremptoriness with which the state of pa should be called on the resolution on the journal was finally adopted having been drawn up by the secy  put into the hands of a member the resolution  passed without any dissent  the evening of this day was spent at mr fitzsimmons by mr     ghoram mr hamilton mr peters mr carrol  mr madison the conversation turned on the subject of revenue under the consideration of congress and on the situation of the army the conversation on the first subject ended in a general concurrence mr hamilton excepted in the impossibility of adding to the impost on trade any taxes that wd operate equally throughout the states or be adopted by them on the second subject mr hamilton  mr peters who had the best knowledge of the temper transactions  views of the army informed the company that it was certain that the army had secretly determined not to lay down their arms until due provision  a satisfactory prospect should be afforded on the subject of their pay that there was reason to expect that a public declaration to this effect would soon be made that plans had been agitated if not formed for subsisting themselves after such declaration that as a proof of their earnestness on this subject the com̃ander was already become extremely unpopular among almost all ranks from his known dislike to every unlawful proceeding that this unpopularity was daily increasing  industriously promoted by many leading characters that his choice of unfit  indiscreet persons into his family was the pretext and with some the real motive but the substantial one a desire to displace him from the respect  confidence of the army in order to substitute genl erased  illegible as the conductor of their efforts to obtain justice mr hamilton said that he knew genl washington intimately and perfectly that his extreme reserve mixed sometimes with a degree of asperity of temper both of which were said to have increased of late had contributed to the decline of his popularity but that his virtue his patriotism  his firmness would it might be depended upon never yield to any dishonorable or disloyal plans into which he might be called that he would sooner suffer himself to be cut to pieces that he mr hamilton knowing this to be his true character wished him to be the conductor of the army in their plans for redress in order that they might be moderated  directed to proper objects  exclude some other leader who might foment and misguide their councils that with this view he had taken the liberty to write to the genl on this subject and to recommend such a policy to him   0 friday feby    mr mercer made some remarks tending to a reconsideration of ye act declaring general funds to be necessary which revived the discussion of that subject mr madison said that he had observed throughout the proceedings of congress relative to the establishment of such funds that the power delegated to congress by the confederation had been very differently construed by different members  that this difference of construction had materially affected their reasonings  opinions on the several propositions which had been made that in particular it had been represented by sundry members that congress was merely an executive body and therefore that it was inconsistent with the principles of liberty  the spirit of the constitution to submit to them a permanent revenue which wd be placing the purse  the sword in the same hands that he wished the true doctrine of the confederation to be ascertained as it might perhaps remove some embarrassments and towards that end would offer his ideas on the subject he said that he did not conceive in the first place that the opinion was sound that the power of congress in cases of revenue was in no respect legislative but merely executive and in the second place that admitting the power to be executive a permanent revenue collected  dispensed by them in the discharge of the debts to wch it sd be appropriated would be inconsistent with the nature of an executive body or dangerous to the liberties of the republic as to the first opinion he observed that by the articles of confederation congs had clearly  expressly the right to fix the quantum of revenue necessary for the public exigencies  to require the same from the states respectively in proportion to the value of their land that the requisitions thus made were a law to the states as much as the acts of the latter for complying with them were a law to their individual members that the federal constitution was as sacred and obligatory as the internal constitutions of the several states and that nothing could justify the states in disobeying acts warranted by it but some previous abuse and infraction on the part of congs that as a proof that     the power of fixing the quantum  making requisitions of money was considered as a legislative power over the purse he would appeal to the proposition made by the british minister of giving this power to the b parliamt  leaving to the american assemblies the privilege of complying in their own modes  to the reasonings of congress  the several states on that proposition he observed further that by the articles of confederation was delegated to congs a right to borrow money indefinitely and emit bills of credit which was a species of borrowing for repayment  redemption of which the faith of the states was pledged  their legislatures constitutionally bound he asked whether these powers were reconcileable with the idea that congress was a body merely executive he asked what would be thought in g b from whose constitution our political reasonings were so much drawn of an attempt to prove that a power of making requisitions of money on ye parliament  of borrowing money for discharge of which the parlt sd be bound might be annexed to the crown without changing its quality of an executive branch and that the leaving to the parliamt the mode only of complying with the requisitions of the crown would be leaving to it its supreme  exclusive power of legislation as to the second point he referred again to the british constitution  the mode in which provision was made for the public debts observing that although the executive had no authority to contract a debt yet that when a debt had been authorized or admitted by the parliament a permanent  irrevocable revenue was granted by the legislature to be collected  dispensed by the executive and that this practice had never been deemed a subversion of the constitution or a dangerous association of a power over the purse with the power of the sword if these observations were just as he conceived them to be the establishment of a permanent revenue not by any assumed authority of congress but by the authority of the states at the recommendation of congs to be collected  applied by the latter to the discharge of the public debts could not be deemed inconsistent with the spirit of the federal constitution or subversive of the principles of liberty and that all objections drawn from such a supposition ought to be withdrawn whether other objections of     sufficient weight might not lie agst such an establisht was another question for his part although for various reasons  he had wished for such a plan as most eligible he had never been sanguine that it was practicable  the discussions which had taken place had finally satisfied him that it would be necessary to limit the call for a general revenue to duties on commerce  to call for the deficiency in the most permanent way that could be reconciled with a revenue established within each state separately  appropriated to the common treasury he said the rule which he had laid down to himself in this business was to concur in every arrangemt that sd appear necessary for an honorable  just fulfilment of the public engagements  in no measure tending to augment the power of congress which sd appear to be unnecessary and particularly disclaimed the idea of perpetuating a public debt mr lee in answer to mr madison said the doctrine maintained by him was pregnant with dangerous consequences to the liberties of the confederated states that notwithstanding the specious arguments that had been employed it was an established truth that the purse ought not to be put into the same hands with the sword that like arguments had been used in favor of ship money     in the reign of charles i it being then represented as essential to the support of the govt that the executive should be assured of the means of fulfilling its engagements for the public service he said it had been urged by several in behalf of such an establishment for public credit that without it congress was nothing more than a rope of sand on this head he would be explicit he had rather see congress a rope of sand than a rod of iron he urged finally as a reason why some states would not  ought not to concur in granting to congress a permanent revenue that some states as virga would receive back a small part by paymt from the u s to its citizens whilst others as pena wd receive a vast surplus  consequently by draining the former of its wealth mr mercer said if he conceived the federal compact to be such as it had been represented he would immediately withdraw from congress  do every thing in his power to destroy its existence that if congs had a right to borrow money as they pleased and to make requisitions on the states that wd be binding on them the liberties of the states were ideal that requisitions ought to be consonant to the spirit of liberty that they should go frequently  accompanied with full information that the states must be left to judge of the nature of them of their abilities to comply with them  to regulate their compliance accordingly he laid great stress on the omission of congs to transmit half yearly to the states an acct of the monies borrowed by them c and even insinuated that this omission had absolved the states in some degree from the engagements he repeated his remarks on the injustice of the rule by which loan office certificates had been settled  his opinion that some defalcations would be necessary mr holten was opposed to all permanent funds and to every arrangement not within the limits of the confederation mr hamilton enlarged on the general utility of permanent funds to the federal interests of this country  pointed out the difference between the nature of the constitution of the british executive  that of the u s in answer to mr lees reasoning from the case of ship money mr ghoram adverted with some warmth to the doctrines advanced by mr lee  mercer concerning the loan office creditors he said the union could never be maintained on any other     ground than that of justice that some states had suffered greatly from the deficiencies of others already that if justice was not to be obtained through the federal system  this system was to fail as would necessarily follow it was time this should be known that some of the states might be forming other confederacies adequate to the purposes of their safety this debate was succeeded by a discharge of the committee from the business of devising the means requisite for restoring public credit c c and the business referred to a come consisting of mr ghoram mr hamilton mr madison mr fitzsimmons  mr rutledge      tuesday february    no congress till in favor of the motion of mr gilman see the journal of this date to refer the officers of the army for their halfpay to their respective states it was urged that this plan alone would secure to     the officers any advantage from that engagement  since congress had no independent fund out of which it could be fulfilled and the states of cont  r i in particular would not comply with any recommendation of cong nor even requisition for that purpose it was also said that it would be satisfactory to the officers and that it would apportion on the states that part of the public burden with sufficient equality mr dyer said that the original promise of congress on that subject was considered by some of the states as a fetch upon them and not within the spirit of the authority delegated to congress mr wolcot said the states wd give congs nothing whatever unless they were gratified in this particular mr collins said r i had expressly instructed her delegates to oppose every measure tending to an execution of the promise out of monies under the disposition of congress on the other side it was urged that the half pay was a debt as solemnly contracted as any other debt and was consequently as binding under the   th article of the confederation on the states  that they could not refuse a requisition made for that purpose that it would be improper to countenance a spirit of that sort by yielding to it that such concessions on the part of congs wd produce compliances on the part of the states in other instances clogged with favorite conditions that a reference of the officers to the particular states to whose lines they belong would not be     satisfactory to the officers of those states who objected to half pay and would increase the present irritation of the army that to do it without their unanimous consent would be a breach of the contract by which the u s collectively were bound to them and above all that the proposed plan which discharged any particular state which should settle with its officers on this subject altho other states might reject the plan from its proportion of that part of the public burden was a direct and palpable departure from the law of the confederation according to this instrument the whole public burden of debt must be apportioned according to a valuation of land nor cd any thing but a unanimous concurrence of the states dispense with this law according to the plan proposed so much of the public burden as the ½ pay sd amount to was to be apportioned according to the number of officers belonging to each line the plan to take effect as to all those states which should adopt it without waiting for the unanimous adoption of the states and that if congress had authority to make the number of officers the rule of apportioning one part of the public debt on the states they might extend the rule to any other part or to the whole or might substitute any other arbitrary rule which they should think fit the motion of mr gilman was negatived see the ays  noes on the journal  wednesday feby    mr lee observed to congress that it appeared from the newspapers of the day that sundry enormities had been committed by the refugees within the state of delaware as it was known that like enormities had been committed on the shores of the chesapeak notwithstanding the pacific professions of the enemy that it was probable howẽr that if complaint were to be made to the british commander at n york the practice would be restrained he accordingly moved that a committee might be appointed to take into consideration the means of restraining such practices     the motion was  ded by mr peters by mr fitzsimmons the motion was viewed as tending to a request of favors from sr guy carleton it was apprehended by others that as genl washington  the commanders of separate armies had been explicitly informed of the sense of congress on this point any fresh measures thereon might appear to be a censure on them and that congress cd not ground any measure on the case in question having no official information relative to it the motion of mr lee was negatived but it appearing from the vote to be the desire of many members that some step might be taken by congress the motion of mr madison  mr mercer as it stands on the journal was proposed and agreed to as free from all objections  a motion was made by mr hamilton to give a brevet comm̃ion to majr burnet aid to genl greene  messenger of the evacuation of charleston of l colonel there being six ayes only the motion was lost n h no mr lee  mercer no the committee consisting of mr lee c to whom had been referred the motion of mr hamilton recommending to the states to authorize congress to make abatements in the retrospective apportionment by a valuation of land in favor of states whose ability from year to year had been most impaired by the war reported that it was inexpedient to agree to such motion because one state virga having disagreed to such a measure on a former recom̃endation to congress it was not probable that another recommendation would produce any effect and because the difficulties of making such abatements were greater than the advantages expected from them mr lee argued in favor of the report  the reasons on which it was grounded the eastern delegations were for leaving the matter open for future determination when an apportionment should be in question mr madison said he thought that the principle of the motion was conformable to justice  within the spirit of the confederation     according to which apportionmts ought to have been made from time to time throughout the war according to the existing wealth of each state but that it would be improper to take up this case separately from other claims of equity which would be put in by other states that the most likely mode of obtaining the concurrence of the states in any plan wd be to comprehend in it the equitable interests of all of them a comprehensive plan of that sort would be the only one that would cut off all sources of future controversy among the states that as soon as the plan of revenue sd be prepared for recom̃endation to the states it would be proper for congs to take into consideration  combine with it every object  which might facilitate its progress  for a complete   0 provision for the tranquillity of the u states the question on mr hamiltons motion was postponed the letter from mr morris requesting that the injunction of secrecy might be withdrawn from his preceding letter signifying to congress his purpose of resigning was committed to thursday february   th on the report of the come on mr morriss letter the injunction of secrecy was taken off without dissent or observation the attention of congress was recalled to the subject of half     pay by messrs dyer  wolcot in order to introduce a reconsideration of the mode of referring it separately to the states to provide for their own lines mr mercer favored the reconsideration representing the commutation proposed as tending in common with the funding of other debts to establish  perpetuate a monied interest in the u s that this monied interest would gain the ascendance of the landed interest would resort to places of luxury  splendor and by their example  influence become dangerous to our republican constitutions he said however that the variances of opinion  indecision of congress were alarming  required that something should be done that it wd be better to newmodel the confederation or attempt any thing rather than to do nothing     mr madison reminded congs that the commutation proposed was introduced as a compromise with those to whom the idea of pensions was obnoxious  observed that those whose scruples had been relieved by it had rendered it no less obnoxious than pensions by stigmatizing it with the name of a perpetuity he said the public situation was truly deplorable if the payment of the capital of the public debts was suggested it was said  truly said to be impossible if funding them  paying the interest was proposed it was exclaimed agst as establishing a dangerous moneied interest as corrupting the public manners as administering poison to our republican constitutions he said he wished the revenue to be established to be such as would extinguish the capital as well as pay the interest within the shortest possible period and was as much opposed to perpetuating the public burdens as any one but that the discharge of them in some form or other was essential and that the consequences predicted therefrom could     not be more heterogeneous to our republican character  constitutions than a violation of the maxims of good faith and common honesty it was agreed that the report for commuting ½ pay should lie on the table till tomorrow in order to give an opportunity to the delegates of connecticut to make any proposition relative thereto which they should judge proper the report of the comme consisting of mr ghoram mr hamilton mr madison mr rutledge  mr fitzsimmons was taken up it was proposed that in addition to the impost of   per ct ad valorem the states be requested to enable congs to collect a duty of ⅛ of a dollar per bushel on salt imported of   0 per gallon on all wines do and of   0 per gallon on all rum  brandy do on the first article it was observed on the part of the east states that this would press peculiarly hard on them on acct of the salt consumed in the fisheries and that it would besides be injurious to the national interest by adding to the cost of fish and a drawback was suggested on the other side it was observed that the warmer climate  more dispersed settlements of the southern states required a greater consumption of salt for their provisions that salt might  would be conveyed to the fisheries without previous importation that the effect of the duty was too inconsiderable to be felt in the cost of fish  that the rum in the n e states being in a great degree manufactured at home they would have greater advantage in this respect than the other states could have in the article of salt that a drawback could not be executed in our complicated governt with ease or certainty mr mercer on this occasion declared that altho he thought those who opposed a general revenue right in their principles yet as they appeared to have formed no plan adequate to the public exigencies and as he was convinced of the necessity of doing something he should depart from his first resolution and strike in with those who were pursuing the plan of a general revenue mr holten said he had come lately into congress with a predetermination against any measures for discharging the public engagements other than those pointed out in the confederation  that he had hitherto acted accordingly but that he saw now so clearly the necessity of making provision for that object and     the inadequacy of the confederation thereto that he should concur in recommending to the states a plan of a general revenue a question being proposed on the duties on salt there were   ays n h alone being no r i not present it was urged by some that the duty on wine should be augmented but it appeared on discussion  some calculations that the temptation to smuggling wd be rendered too strong  the revenue thereby diminished mr bland proposed that instead of a duty on the gallon an advalorem duty should be laid on wine and this idea after some loose discussion was agreed to few of the members interesting themselves therein and some of them having previously retired from congress friday february    a motion was made by mr wolcot and mr dyer to refer the half pay to the states little differing from the late motion of mr gilman except that it specified   years whole pay as the proper ground of composition with the officers of the respective lines on this proposition the arguments used for and agst mr gilmans motion were recapitulated it was negatived cont alone answering in the affirmative and no division being called for on the question to agree to the report for a commutation of   years whole pay there being   ays only it was considered whether this was an appropriation or a new ascertainment of a sum of money necessary for the public service some were of opinion at first that it did not fall under that description viz of an appropriation finally the contrary opinion was deemed almost unanimously safest as well as the most accurate another question was whether   or   votes were to decide doubts whether   or   were requisite on any question some were of opinion that the secretary ought to make an entry according to his own judgment and that that entry sd stand unless altered by a positive instruction from congs to this it was objected that it wd make the secy the sovereign in many cases since a reversal of his entry wd be impossible whatever that entry might be that particularly he might enter   votes to be affirmative on a question where       were necessary and if supported in it by a few states it wd be irrevocable it was said by others that the safest rule wd be to require   votes to decide in all cases of doubt whether   or   were necessary to this it was objected that one or two states and in any situation   states might by raising doubts stop seven from acting in any case which they disapproved fortunately on the case in question there were   states of opinion that nine were requisite so the difficulty was got over for the present on a reconsideration of the question whether the duty on wine should be on the quantity or on the value the mode reported by the come was reinstated and the whole report recom̃itted to be included with the   per ct ad valorem in an act of recom̃endation to the states monday march  d the comme on revenues reported in addition to the former articles recommended by them a duty of ⅔ of a dollar per     lbs on all brown sugar   dollar on all powdered lumped  clayed sugars other than loaf sugar  ⅓ dollar per     lbs on all loaf sugars   0 of a dollar per lb on all bohea teas and     of a dollar on all finer indian teas this report without debate or opposition was recommitted to be incorporated with the general plan tuesday march    wednesday march   the motion of mr hamilton on the journal relative to the abatement of the quotas of distressed states  was rejected partly because the principle was disapproved by some and partly because it was thought improper to be separated from other objects to be recommended to the states the latter motive produced the motion for postponing which was lost     the committee to whom had been referred the letters of resignation of mr morris reported as their opinion that it was not necessary for congs immediately to take any steps thereon they considered the resignation as conditional and that if it sd eventually take place at the time designated there was no necessity for immediate provision to be made mr bland moved that  c see journal of mar   this motion produced on these two days lengthy  warm debates mr lee  mr bland on one side disparaging the administration of mr morris and throwing oblique censure on his character they considered his letter as an insult to congs  mr lee declared that the man who had published to all the world such a picture of our national character  finances was unfit to be a minister of the latter on the other side mr wilson  mr hamilton went into a copious defence  panegyric of mr morris the ruin in which his resignation if it sd take effect wd involve public credit and all the operations dependent on it and the decency altho firmness of his letters the former observed that the declaration of mr morris that he wd not be the minister of injustice cd not be meant to reflect on congs because they had declared the funds desired by mr morris to be necessary and that the friends of the latter could not wish for a more honorable occasion for his retreat from public life if they did not prefer the public interest to considerations of friendship other members were divided as to the propriety of the letters in question in general however they were thought reprehensible as in general also a conviction prevailed of the personal merit  public importance of mr morris all impartial members foresaw the most     alarming consequences from his resignation the prevailing objection to mr blands motion was that its avowed object  tendency was to reestablish a board in place of a single minister of finance those who apprehended that ultimately this might be unavoidable thought it so objectionable that nothing but the last necessity would justify it the motion of mr bland was lost and a comme appointed generally on the letters of mr morris  thursday march   the come on revenue made a report which was ordered to be printed for each member and to be taken up on monday next friday march   printed copies of the report abovementioned were delivered to each member as follows viz   resolved that it be recommended to the several states as indispensably necessary to the

majority of the whole army should concur others preferring the plan expressed on the journal and not agreed to  tuesday march    the report entered on friday the   of march was taken into consideration it had been sent by order of congs to the supt of finance for his remarks which were also on the table these remarks were in substance that it wd be better to turn the   per ct ad valorem into a tariff founded on an enumeration of the several classes of imports to which ought to be added a few articles of exports that instead of an apportionment of the residue on the states other general revenues from a land tax reduced to ¼ of a dollar per hundred acres with a house tax regulated by the numbers of windows and an excise on all spirituous liquors to be collected at the place of distillery ought  0  to be substituted and as well as the duties on trade made coexistent with the public debts the whole to be collected by persons appd by congs alone and that an alternative ought to be held out to ye states either to establish these permanent revenues for the interest or to comply with a constitutional demand of the principal within a very short period in order to ascertain the sense of cons on these ideas it was proposed that the following short questions sd be taken   shall any taxes to operate generally throughout the states be recommended by congs other than duties on foreign commerce   shall the   per c ad valorem be exchanged for a tariff   shall the alternative be adopted as proposed by the superintendt of finance on the  st question the states were n h no mas no cont no n j no maryd no virga no   noes    ays on the  d question there were   ays the  d question was not put its impropriety being generally proclaimed in consequence of

in line   was inserted agreeably to the resolution of the    of decr last a motion was made by mr hamilton and mr wilson to strike out the limitation of    years and to make the revenue coexistent

clauses relative to the appointment of collectors and to provide that the collectors sd be inhabitants of the states within which they sd collect should be nominated by congs and appointed by the states and in case such nomination should not be accepted or rejected within — days it should stand good on this question there were   ayes and   noes   0  wednesday    th    f    s    of march these days were employed in reading the despatches brought on wednesday morning by capt barney commanding the washington packet they were dated from decr   to    from the ministers plenipo for peace with journals of preceding transactions and were accompanied by the preliminary articles signed on the  0th of novr between the said ministers  mr oswald the british minister the terms granted to america appeared to congs on the whole extremely liberal  it was observed by several however that the  0  stipulation obliging congs to recommend to the states a restitution of confiscated property altho it could scarcely be understood that the states would comply had the appearance of sacrificing the dignity of congs to the pride of the british king the separate  secret manner in which our ministers had proceeded with respect to france  the confidential manner with respect to the british ministers affected different members of congs very differently many of the most judicious members thought they had all been in some measure ensnared by the dexterity of the british minister and particularly disapproved of the conduct of mr jay in submitting to the enemy his jealousy of the french without even the knowledge of dr franklin and of the unguarded manner in which he mr a  dr f had given in writing sentiments unfriendly to our ally and serving as weapons for the insidious policy of the enemy the separate article was most offensive being considered as obtained by g b  0  not for the sake of the territory ceded to her but as a means of disuniting the u s  france as inconsistent with the spirit of the alliance and a dishonorable departure from the candor rectitude  plain dealing professed by congs the dilemma in wch congs were placed was sorely felt if they sd communicate to the f minister every thing they exposed their own ministers destroyed all confidence in them on the part of france  might engage them in dangerous factions agst congs which was the more to be apprehended as the terms obtained by their management were popular in their nature if congs sd conceal every thing  the f court sd either from the enemy or otherwise come to the knowledge of it all confidence wd be at an end between the allies the enemy might be encouraged by it to make fresh experiments  the public safety as well as the national honor be endangered upon the whole it was thought  observed by many that our ministers particularly mr jay instead of making allowances for  affording facilities to france in her delicate situation between spain  the u s had joined with the enemy in taking advantage  0  of it to increase her perplexity  that they had made the safety of their country depend on the sincerity of ld shelburne which was suspected by all the world besides and even by most of themselves see mr ls letter decr   th the displeasure of the french court at the neglect of our ministers to maintain a confidential intercourse  particularly to communicate the preliminary articles before they were signed was not only signified to the secy of f a but to sundry members by the chevr de la luzerne to the former he shewed a letter from ct de vergennes directing him to remonstrate to congs agst the conduct of the american ministers which a subsequent letter countermanded alledged that docr f had given some explanations that had been admitted  told mr livingston that the american ministers had deceived him de vergennes by telling him a few days before the preliminary articles were signed that the agreement on them was at a distance that when he carried the articles signed into council the king expressed great indignation  asked if the americans served him thus before peace was made  whilst they were begging for aids what was to be expected after peace c to several members he mentioned that the king had been surprised  displeased  that he said he did not think he had such allies to deal with to one of them who asked whether the ct of f meant to complain of them to congs m marbois answered that great powers never complained but that they felt  remembered it did not appear from any circumstances that the separate article was known to the court of f or to the chevr de la luzerne the publication of the preliminary articles excepting the separate article in the newspaper was not a deliberate act of congs a hasty question for enjoining secrecy on certain parts of the despatches which included those articles was lost and copies havg been taken by members  some of them handed to the delegates of pena one of them reached the printer when the publication appeared congs in general regretted it not only as tending too much to lull the states but as leading france into suspicions that congress favored the premature signature of the articles and were at least willing to remove in the minds of the people the blame of delaying peace from g b to france  0  monday march    a letter was recd from genl washington inclosing two anonymous  inflammatory exhortations to the army to assemble for the purpose of seeking by other means that justice which their country shewed no disposition to afford them the steps taken by the genl to avert the gathering storm  his professions of inflexible adherence to his duty to congress  to his country excited the most affectionate sentiments towards him by private letters from the army  other circumstances there appeared good ground for suspecting that the civil creditors were intriguing in order to inflame the army into such desperation as wd produce a general provision for the public debts these papers were committed to mr gilman mr dyer mr clark mr rutledge  mr mercer the appt of these gentlemen was brought about by a few members who wished to saddle with this embarrassment the men who had opposed the measures necessary for satisfying the army viz the half pay  permanent funds agst one or other of which the individuals in question had voted this alarming intelligence from the army added to the critical situation to wch our affairs in europe were reduced by the variance of our ministers with our ally and to the difficulty of establishing the means of fulfilling the engagemts  securing the

pork to be paid or allowed to the exporter thereof at the port from which they shall be so exported the arguments urged by mr wilson in behalf of his motion see journal for a land tax of ¼ of a dollar for  00 acres other than those heretofore generally urged were that it was more moderate than had been paid before the revolution  it cd not be supposed the people wd grudge to pay as the price of their liberty what they formerly paid to their oppressors that if it was unequal this inequality wd be corrected by the states in other taxes—that as the tax on trade would fall chiefly on the inhabitants of the lower country who consumed the imports the tax on land would affect those who were remote from the sea  consumed little on the opposite side it was alledged that such a tax was repugnant to the popular ideas of equality  particularly wd never be acceded to by the s states at least unless they were to be respectively credited for the amount and if such credit were to be given it wd be best to let the states chuse such taxes as would best suit them   0 a letter came in  was read from the secy of f a stating the perplexing alternative to which congs were reduced by the secret article relating to west florida either of dishonoring themselves by becoming a party to the concealment or of wounding the feelings  destroying the influence of our ministers by disclosing the article to the french court and proposing as advisable on the whole   that he be authorized to communicate the article in question to the french minister in such manner as would best tend to remove the unfavorable impressions which might be made on the ct of f as to the sincerity of congress or their ministers   that the sd ministers be informed of this communication and instructed to agree that the limit for w f proposed in the separate article be allowed to whatever power the said colony may be confirmed by a treaty of peace   that it be declared to be the sense of congress that the

letter wednesday march    a letter was read from the superintendt of finance inclosing letters from docr franklin accompand with extracts from the ct de vergennes relative to money affairs the supt thereupon declaring roundly that our credit was at an end  that no further pecuniary aids were to be expected from europe mr rutledge denied these assertions  expressed some indignation at them mr bland said that as the supt was of this opinion it would be absurd for him to be minister of finance and moved that the come on his motion for arranging the department might be instructed to report without loss of time this motion was     negatived as censuring the come but it was understood to be the sense of congs that they sd report the order of the day viz the letter from the secretary of f a was taken up mr wolcot conceived it unnecessary to waste time on the subject as he presumed congs would never so far censure the ministers who had obtained such terms for this country as to disavow their conduct mr clarke was decided agst communicating the separate article which wd be sacrificing meritorious ministers  wd rather injure than relieve our national honor he admitted that the separate article put an advantage into the hands of the enemy but did not on the whole deem it of any great consequence he thought congress ought to go no farther than to inform the ministers that they were sorry for the necessity which had led them into the part they had taken  to leave them to get rid of the embarrassmt as to the separate article in such a way as they sd judge best this expedient would save congress  spare our ministers who might have been governed by reasons not known to congress mr mercer said that not meaning to give offence any where he should speak his sentiments freely he gave it as his clear  decided opinion that the ministers had insulted congress by sending them assertions without proof as reasons for violating their instructions  throwing themselves into the confidence of g b he observed that france in order to make herself equal to the enemy had been obliged to call for aid  had drawn spain agst her interest into the war that it was not improbable that she had entered into some specific engagements for that purpose that hence might be deduced the perplexity of her situation of which advantage had been taken by g b an advantage in which our ministers had concurred for sowing jealousies between f  u s  of which further advantage wd be taken to alienate the minds of the people of this country from their ally by presenting him as the obstacle to peace the british court he said havg gained this point may easily frustrate the negotiation  renew the war agst divided enemies he approved of the conduct of the count de vergennes in promoting a treaty under the  st comissn to oswald as preferring the substance to the shadow  proceeding     from a desire of peace the conduct of our ministers throughout particularly in giving in writing every thing called for by the british minister expressive of distrust of france was a mixture of follies which had no example was a tragedy to america  a comedy to all the world beside he felt inexpressible indignation at their meanly stopping as it were to lick the dust from the feet of a nation whose hands were still dyed with the blood of their fellowcitizens he reprobated the chicane  low cunning wch marked the journals transmitted to congress and contrasted them with the honesty  good faith which became all nations  particularly an infant republic they proved that america had at once all the follies of youth and all the vices of old age thinks it wd be necessary to recall our ministers fears that france may be already acquainted with all the transactions of our ministers even with the separate article  may be only waiting the reception given to it by congs to see how far the hopes of cutting off the right arm of g b by supporting our revolution may have been well founded and in case of our basely disappointing her may league with our enemy for our destruction and for a division of the spoils he was aware of the risks to which such a league wd expose france of finally losing her share but supposed that the british islands might be made hostages for her security he said america was too prone to depreciate political merit  to suspect where there was no danger that the honor of the king of f was dear to him that he never wd betray or injure us unless he sd be provoked  justified by treachery on our part for the present he acquiesced in the proposition of the secy of fn as but when the question should come to be put he sd be for a much more decisive resolution mr rutledge said he hoped the character of our ministers would not be affected much less their recall produced by declamations agst them and that facts would be ascertained  stated before any decision sd be passed that the ct de vergennes had expressly declared to our ministers his desire that they might treat apart alluded to  animadverted upon the instruction which submitted them to french councils was of opinion that the separate article did not concern france  therefore there was no necessity for communicating it to her  that as to spain she     deserved nothing at our hands she had treated us in a manner that forfeited all claim to our good offices or our confidence she had not as has been supposed entered into the present war as an ally to our ally for our support but as she herself had declared as a principal  on her own account he sd he was for adhering religiously to the spirit  letter of the treaty with france that our ministers had done so  if recalled or censured for the part they had acted he was sure no man of spirit would take their place he concluded with moving that the letter from the secy of f a might be referred to a special comme who might inquire into all the facts relative to the subject of it mr holten  ded the motion mr williamson was opposed to harsh treatment of the ministers who had shown great ability he said they had not infringed the treaty and as they had received the concurrence of the ct de vergennes for treating apart they had not in that respect violated their instructions he proposed that congress sd express to the ministers their concern at the separate article  leave them to get over the embarrassment as they shd find best mr mercer in answer to mr rutledge said that his language with respect to the ministers was justified by their refusal to obey instructions censured wth great warmth the servile confidence of mr jay in particular in the british ministers he said the separate article was a reproach to our character and that if congress wd not themselves disclose it he would disclose to his constituents who would disdain to be united with those who patronize such dishonorable proceedings he was called to order by the presidt who said that the article in question was under an injunction of secrecy  he could not permit the order of the house to be trampled upon mr lee took notice that obligations in national affairs as well as others ought to be reciprocal  he did not know that france had ever bound herself to like engagements as to concert of negotiation with those into which america had at different times been drawn he thought it highly improper to censure ministers who had negotiated well said that it was agreeable to practice  necessary to the end proposed for ministers in particular emergencies to swerve from strict instructions france he said wanted     to sacrifice our interests to her own or those of spain that the french answer to the british memorial contained a passage which deserved attention on this subject she answered the reproaches of perfidy contained in that memorial by observing that obligations being reciprocal a breach on one side absolved the other the ct de vergennes he was sure was too much a master of negotiation not to approve the management of our ministers instead of condemning it no man lamented more than he did any diminution of the confidence between this country  france but if the misfortune should ensue it could not be denied that it had originated with france who had endeavoured to sacrifice our territorial rights those very rights which by the treaty she had guarantied to us he wished the preliminary articles had not been signed without the knowledge of france but was persuaded that in whatever light she might view it she was too sensible of the necessity of our independence to her safety ever to abandon it but let no censure fall on our ministers who had upon the whole done what was best he introduced the instruction of june         proclaimed it to be the greatest opprobrium and stain to this country which it had ever exposed itself to and that it was in his judgment the true cause of that distrust  coldness which prevailed between our ministers  the french court inasmuch as it could not be viewed by the former without irritation  disgust he was not surprised that those who considered france as the patron rather than the ally of this country should be disposed to be obsequious to her but he was not of that number mr hamilton urged the propriety of proceeding with coolness and circumspection he thought it proper in order to form a right judgment of the conduct of our ministers that the views of the french  british courts should be examined he admitted it as not improbable that it had been the policy of france to procrastinate the definite acknowledgmt of our independence on the part of g b in order to keep us more knit to herself  untill her own interests could be negotiated the arguments how̃er urged by our ministers on this subject although strong were not conclusive as it was not certain that this policy  not a desire of excluding obstacles to peace had produced ye opposition of     the french court to our demands caution  vigilance he thought were justified by the appearance  that alone but compare this policy with that of g b survey the past cruelty  present duplicity of her councils behold her watching every occasion  trying every project for dissolving the honorable ties which bind the u s to their ally  then say on which side our resentments  jealousies ought to lie with respect to the instructions submitting our ministers to the advice of france he had disapproved it uniformly since it had come to his knowledge but he had always judged it improper to repeal it he disapproved highly of the conduct of our ministers in not shewing the preliminary articles to our ally before they signed them and still more so of their agreeing to the separate article this conduct gave an advantage to the enemy which they would not fail to improve for the purpose of inspiring france with indignation  distrust of the u s he did not apprehend with mr mercer any danger of a coalition between f  g b against america but foresaw the destruction of mutual confidence between f  the u s which wd be likely to ensue  the danger which would result from it in case the war should be continued he observed that spain was an unwise nation her policy narrow  jealous her king old her court divided  the heir apparent notoriously attached to g b from these circumstances he inferred an apprehension that when spain shd come to know the part taken by america with respect to her a separate treaty of peace might be resorted to he thought a middle course best with respect to our ministers that they ought to be commended in general but that the communication of the separate article ought to take place he observed that our ministers were divided as to the policy of the ct of france but that they all were agreed in the necessity of being on the watch against g b he apprehended that if the ministers were to be recalled or reprehended that they would be disgusted  head  foment parties in this country he observed particularly with respect to mr jay that altho he was a man of profound sagacity  pure integrity yet he was of a suspicious temper  that this trait might explain the extraordinary jealousies which he professed he finally proposed that the ministers sd be commended and the separate article communicated this motion     was  ded by mr osgood as compared however with the proposition of the secry for f a and so far only as to be referred to a committee mr peters favored a moderate course as most advisable he thought it necessary that the separate article should be communicated but that it wd be less painful to the feelings of the ministers if the doing it was left to themselves and was also in favor of giving the territory annexed by the separate art to w florida to such power as might be vested with that colony in the treaty of peace mr bland said he was glad that every one seemed at length to be struck with the impropriety of the instruction submitting our ministers to the advice of the french court he represented it as the cause of all our difficulties  moved that it might be referred to the come with the several propositions which had been made mr lee  ded the motion mr wilson objected to mr blands motion as not being in order when moved in order perhaps he might not oppose the substance of it he said he had never seen nor heard of the instruction it referred to until this morning and that it had really astonished him that this country ought to maintain an upright posture between all nations but however objectionable this step might have been in congs the magnanimity of our ally in declining to obtrude his advice on our ministers ought to have been a fresh motive to their confidence and respect altho they deserved commendation in general for their services in this respect they do not he was of opinion that the spirit of the treaty with france forbade the signing of the preliminary articles without her consent and that the separate article ought to be disclosed but as the merits of our ministers entitled them to the mildest  most delicate mode in which it cd be done he wished the communication to be left to themselves as they wd be the best judges of the explanation which ought to be made for the concealment  their feelings wd be less wounded than if it were made without their intervention he observed that the separate article was not important in itself  became so only by the mysterious silence in which it was wrapt up a candid and open declaration from our ministers of the circumstances under which they acted  the necessity     produced by them of pursuing the course marked out by the interest of their country wd have been satisfactory to our ally wd have saved their own honor and would not have endangered the objects for which they were negotiating mr higginson contended that the facts stated by our ministers justified the part they had taken mr madison expressed his surprise at the attempts made to fix the blame of all our embarrassments on the instruction of june         when it appeared that no use had been made of the power given by it to the ct of france that our ministers had construed it in such a way as to leave them at full liberty and that no one in congs pretended to blame them on that acct for himself he was persuaded that their construction was just the advice of france having been made a guide to them only in cases where the question respected the concessions of the u s to g b necessary  proper for obtaining peace  an acknowledgt of indepe not where it respected concessions to other powers  for other purposes he reminded congress of the change which had taken place in our affairs since that instruction was passed  and remarked the probability that many who were now perhaps the loudest in disclaiming would under the circumstances of that period have been the foremost to adopt it he admitted that the change of circumstances had rendered it inapplicable but thought an express repeal of it might at this crisis at least have a bad effect the instructions he observed for disregarding which our ministers had been blamed and which if obeyed would have prevented the dilemma now felt were those which required them to act in concert  in confidence with our ally  these instructions he said had been repeatedly confirmed in every stage of the revolution by unanimous votes of congress several of the gentlemen present  who now justified our ministers having concurred in them and one of them  having penned two of the acts in one of     which congs went farther than they had done in any preceding act by declaring that they would not make peace until the interests of our allies and friends as well as of the u s sd be provided for as to the propriety of communicating to our ally the separate article he thought it resulted clearly from considerations both of national honor  national security he said that congress having repeatedly assured their ally that they would take no step in a negotiation but in concert and in confidence with him and havg even published to the world solemn declarations to the same effect would if they abetted this concealment of their ministers be considered by all nations as devoid of all constancy  good faith unless a breach of these assurances and declarations cd be justified by an absolute necessity or some perfidy on the part of france that it was manifest no such necessity could be pleaded  as to perfidy on the part of france nothing but suspicions  equivocal circumstances had been quoted in evidence of it and even in these it appeared that our ministers were divided that the embarrassmt in which france was placed by the interfering claims of spain  the u s must have been foreseen by our ministers and that the impartial public would expect that instead of cooperating with g b in taking advantage of this embarrassment they ought to have made every allowance  given every facility to it consistent with a regard to the rights of their constituents that admitting every fact alledged by our ministers to be true it could by no means be inferred that the opposition made by france to our claims was the effect of any hostile or ambitious designs agst them or of any other design than that of reconciling them with those of spain that the hostile aspect wch the separate art as well as the concealment of it bore to spain would be regarded by the impartial world as a dishonorable alliance with our enemies against the interests of our friends but notwithstanding the disappointments  even indignities which the u s had recd from spain it could neither be denied nor concealed that the former had derived many substantial advantages from her taking part in the war  had even obtained some pecuniary aids that the u s had made professions corresponding with these obligations that they had testified the     important light in which they considered the support resulting to their cause from the arms of spain by the importunity with which they had courted her alliance by the concessions with which they had offered to purchase it and by the anxiety which they expressed at every appearance of her separate negotiations for a peace with the common enemy that our national safety would be endangered by congress making themselves a party to the concealment of the separate article he thought could be questioned by no one no definitive treaty of peace he observed had as yet taken place the important articles between some of the belligerent parties had not even been adjusted our insidious enemy was evidently laboring to sow dissensions among them the incaution of our ministers had but too much facilitated them between the u s and france a renewal of the war therefore in some form or other was still to be apprehended  what would be our situation if france  spain had no confidence in us and what confidence could they have if we did not disclaim the policy which had been followed by our ministers he took notice of the intimation given by the british minister to mr adams of an intended expedition from n york agst w florida as a proof of the illicit confidence into which our ministers had been drawn  urged the indispensable duty of congs to communicate it to those concerned in it he hoped that if a come sd be appd for wch however he saw no necessity that this wd be included in their report  that their report wd be made with as little delay as possible in the event the lettr from the secy of f a with all the despatches  the several propositions which had been made were committed to mr wilson mr ghoram mr rutledge mr clarke  mr hamilton thursday march  0 an instruction from the legislature of virga to their delegates agst admitting into the treaty of peace any stipulation for restoring confiscated property was laid before congress also resolutions of the executive council of penna requesting   0 the delegates of that state to endeavour to obtain at least a reasonable term for making the payment of british debts stipulated in the preliminary articles lately recd these papers were committed to mr osgood mr mercer  mr fitzsimmons mr dyer whose vote on the tenth day of march frustrated the commutation of the half pay made a proposition substantially the same wch was committed this seemed to be extorted from him by the critical state of our affairs himself personally  his state being opposed to it the motion of mr hamilton on the journals  was meant as a testimony on his part of the insufficiency of the report of the come as to the establishmt of revenues and as a final trial of the sense of congs with respect to the practicability  necessity of a general revenue equal to the public wants the debates on it were chiefly a repetition of those used on former questions relative to that subject mr fitzsimmons on this occasion declared that on mature reflection he was convinced that a complete general revenue was unattainable from the states was impracticable in the hands of congress and that the modified provision reported by the come if established by the states wd restore public credit among ourselves he apprehended however that no limited funds wd procure loans abroad which wd require funds commensurate to their duration mr higginson described all attempts of congs to provide for the public debts out of the mode prescribed by the confederation as nugatory sd that the states wd disregard them that the impost of   pe ct had passed in massts by   voices only in the lower  one in the upper house and that the govr had never formally assented to the law that it was probable this law wd be repealed      almost certain that the extensive plans of congress would be reprobated friday march    the report on revenue was taken into consideration and the   and   paragraphs after discussion being judged not sufficiently explicit were recommitted to be made more so a motion was made by mr clarke  ded by mr bland to complete so much of the report as related to an impost on trade  send it to the states immediately apart from the residue in support of this motion it was urged that the impost was distinct in its nature was more likely to be adopted  ought not therefore to be delayed or hazarded by a connection with the other parts of the report on the other side it was contended that it was the duty of congs to provide a system adequate to the public exigencies  that such a system wd be more likely to be adopted by the states than any partial or detached provision as it would comprise objects agreeable as well as disagreeable to each of the states and as all of them wd feel a greater readiness to make mutual concessions  to disregard local considerations in proportion to the magnitude of the object held out to them the motion was disagreed to n j being in favor of it  several other states divided saturday    march a letter was recd from genl washington inclosing his address to the convention of officers with the result of their consultations the dissipation of the cloud which seemed to have been gathering afforded great pleasure on the whole to congress but it was observable that the part which the genl had found it necessary  thought it his duty to take would give birth to events much more serious if they sd not be obviated by the establishment of such funds as the genl as well as the army had declared to be necessary  the report of the come on mr dyers motion in favor of     a commutation for the half pay was agreed to the preamble was objected to but admitted at the entreaty of mr dyer who supposed the considerations recited in it wd tend to reconcile the state of cont to the measure an order passed for granting    licenses for vessels belonging to nantucket to secure the whaling vessels agst the penalty for double papers this order was in consequence of a deputation to congs representing the exposed situation of that island the importance of the whale fishery to the u s the danger of its being usurped by other nations  the concurrence of the enemy in neutralizing such a number of vessels as wd carry on the fisheries to an extent necessary for the support of the inhabitants the come to whom was referred the letter from the secy of f a with the foreign despatches c reported   that our ministers be thanked for their zeal  services in negotiating the preliminary articles   that they be instructed to make a communication of the separate article to the court of france in such way as would best get over the concealment   that the secy of f a inform them that it is the wish of congress that preliminary articles had been communicated to the court of france before they had been executed mr dyer said he was opposed to the whole report that he fully approved of every step taken by our ministers as well towards g b as towards france that the separate article did not concern the interests of france  therefore could not involve the good faith of the u s mr lee agreed fully with mr dyer said that the special report of facts ought to have been made necessary for enabling congs to form a just opinion of the conduct of the ministers and moved that the report might be recommitted mr wolcott  ded the motion which was evidently made for the sole purpose of delay it was opposed by mr clarke mr wilson  mr ghoram the  st  last of whom had however no objection to postponing by mr mercer who repeated his abhorrence of the confidence shewn by our ministers to those of g b said that it was about to realize the case of those who kicked down the ladder by wch they had     been elevated  of the viper which was ready to destroy the family of the man in whose bosom it had been restored to life observed that it was unwise to prefer g b to spain as our neighbours in w florida mr higginson supported the sentiments of mr lee sd that the ct de v had released our ministers  that he agreed with those who thought the instruction of june    cd relate only to questions directly between g b  u s mr holten thought there was no sufficient evidence for praise or blame and that both ought to be suspended untill the true reasons sd be stated by the ministers he supposed that the separate article had been made an ultimatum of the preliminaries by g b  that there might also be secret arts between g b  f if the latter were displeased he conceived that she wd officially notify it mr rutledge was agst recommitting but for postponing the motion for recommg was disagreed to but several states being for postponing the vote was no index as to the main question it had been talked of among sundry members as very singular that the british minister should have confided to mr adams an intended expedition from n y agst w florida as very reprehensible in the latter to become the depository of secrets hostile to the friends of his country and that every motive of honor  prudence made it the duty of congs to impart the matter to the spaniards to this effect a motion was made by mr mercer  ded by mr madison but it being near the usual hour of adjournment the house being agitated by the debates on the separate article and a large proportion of members predetermined agst every measure wch seemed in any manner to blame ye ministers  the eastern delegates in general extremely jealous of the honor of mr adams an adjournment was pressed  carried without any vote on the motion monday march   th on the day preceding this intelligence arrived which was this day laid before congs that the preliminaries for a general peace had been signed on the  0th of jany this intelligence was     brought by a french cutter from cadiz despatched by ct destaing to notify the event to all vessels at sea and engaged by the zeal of the marquis de la fayette to convey it to congress  this confirmation of peace produced the greater joy as the preceding delay the cautions of mr laurens letter of the    of decr and the general suspicions of ld shelburnes sincerity had rendered an immediate  general peace extremely problematical in the minds of many a letter was recd from genl carleton thro genl washington inclosing a copy of the preliminary articles between g b  the u s with the separate article annexed mr carroll after taking notice of the embarrassment under which congs was placed by the injunction of secrecy as to the separate article after it had probably been disclosed in europe  it now appeared was known at n york called the attention of congs again to that subject mr wolcot still contended that it would be premature to take any step relative to it until further communications should be recd from our ministers mr gilman being of the same opinion moved that the business be postponed mr lee  ded it mr wilson conceived it indispensably necessary that something should be done that congs deceived themselves if they supposed that the separate art was any secret at n york after it had been announced to them from sr guy carleton he professed a high respect for the character of the ministers which had received fresh honor from the remarkable steadiness and great abilities displayed in the negotiations but that their conduct with respect to the separate article could not be justified he     did not consider it as any violation of the instructions of june   th      the ct de vergennes having happily released them from the obligation of it but he considered it with the signing of the preliminaries secretly as a violation of the spirit of the treaty of alliance as well as of the unanimous professions to the court of france unanimous instructions to our ministers  unanimous declarations to the world that nothing should be discussed towards peace but in confidence and in concert with our ally he made great allowance for the ministers saw how they were affected and the reasons of it but could not subscribe to the opinion that congs ought to pass over the separate article in the manner that had been urged congs ought he said to disapprove of it in the softest terms that could be devised  at all events not to take part in its concealment mr bland treated the separate article with levity and ridicule as in no respect concerning france but spain with whom we had nothing to do mr carroll thought that unless something expressive of our disapprobation of the article  of its concealment was done that it would be an indelible stain on our character mr clarke contended that it was still improper to take any step either for communicating officially or for taking off the injunction of secrecy that the article concerned spain and not france but that if it sd be communicated to the latter she would hold herself bound to communicate it to the former that hence an embarrassment might ensue that it was probably this consideration which led the ministers to the concealment and he thought they had acted right he described the awkwardness attending a communication of it under present circumstances remarking finally that nothing had been done contrary to the treaty and that we were in possession of sufficient materials  to justify the suspicions wch had been manifested mr rutledge was strenuous for postponing the subject said that congs had no occasion to meddle with it that the ministers had done right that they had maintained the honor of the u s after congress had given it up that the manœuvre practiced by     them was common in all courts  was justifiable agst spain who alone was affected by it that instructions ought to be disregarded whenever the public good required it and that he himself would never be bound by them when he thought them improper mr mercer combatted the dangerous tendency of the doctrine maintained by mr rutledge with regard to instructions and observed that the delegates of virga havg been unanimously instructed not to conclude or discuss any treaty of peace but in confidence  in concert with his m c m he conceived himself as much bound as he was of himself inclined to disapprove every other mode of proceeding and that he should call for the yeas  nays on the question for his justification to his constituents mr bland tartly said that he of course was instructed as well as his colleague  sd himself require the yeas and nays to justify an opposite conduct that the instructions from his constituents went no farther than to prohibit any treaty without the concurrence of our ally  which prohibition had not been violated in the case before congress mr lee was for postponing  burying in oblivion the whole transaction he sd that delicacy to france required this since if any thing should be done implying censure on our ministers it must  ought to be done in such a way as to fall ultimately on france whose unfaithful conduct had produced  justified that of our ministers in all national intercourse he said a reciprocity was to be understood and as france had not communicated her views  proceedings to the american plenipotentiaries the latter were not bound to communicate theirs all instructions he conceived to be conditional in favor of the public good and he cited the case mentioned by sr wm temple in which the dutch ministers concluded of themselves an act which required the previous sanction of all the members of the republic mr hamilton said that whilst he despised the man who wd enslave himself to the policy even of our friends he could not but lament the overweening readiness which appeared in many to suspect everything on that side  to throw themselves into the bosom of our enemies he urged the necessity of vindicating     our public honor by renouncing that concealment to which it was the wish of so many to make us parties mr wilson in answer to mr lee observed that the case mentioned by sr wm t was utterly inapplicable to the case in question adding that the conduct of france had not on the principle of reciprocity justified our ministers in signing the provisional preliminaries without her knowledge no such steps having been taken on her part but whilst he found it to be his duty thus to note the faults of these gentlemen he with much greater pleasure gave them praise for their firmness in refusing to treat with the british negotiator until he had produced a proper commission in contending for the fisheries and in adhering to our western claims congress adjourned without any question tuesday no congress wednesday march    communication was made thro the secry of f a by the minister of france as to the late negotiation from letters recd by him from the ct de vergennes dated in decr last  brought by the washington packet this communication shewed though delicately that france was displeased with our ministers for signing the prely arts separately that she had labored by recommending mutual concessions to compromise disputes between spain  the u s and that she was apprehensive that g b would hereafter as they already had endeavored to sow discords between them it signified that the intimacy between our ministers  those of g b furnished a handle for this purpose besides the public communication to congress other parts of letters from the ct de vergennes were privately communicated to the presidt of congs  to sundry members expressing more particularly the dissatisfaction of the ct of f at the conduct of our ministers and urging the necessity of establishing permanent revenues for paying our debts  supporting a national character the substance of these private communications as taken on the    instant by the president is as follows     finance that the ct de vergennes was alarmed at the extravagant demands of docr franklin in behalf of the u s that he was surprised at the same time that the inhabitants paid so little attention to doing something for themselves if they could not be brought to give adequate funds for their defence during a dangerous war it was not likely that so desirable an end could be accomplished when their fears were allayed by a general peace that this reasoning affected the credit of the u s and no one could be found who would risque their money under such circumstances that the king would be glad to know what funds were provided for the security and payment of the  0 millions borrowed by him in holland that the count de vergennes hardly dared to report in favor of the u s to the king  council as money was so scarce that it would be with the greatest difficulty that even a small part of the requisition could be complied with the causes of this scarcity were a five years war which had increased the expenses of government to an enormous amount—the exportation of large sums of specie to america for the support and pay of both french and english armies—the loans to america—the stoppage of bullion in s america which prevented its flowing in the usual channels  a letter of a later date added that he had received the chevrs letter of ocr and rejoiced to find that congress had provided funds for their debts which gave him great encouragemt and he had prevailed on the comptroller general to join him in a report to his majesty  council for   millions of livres for the u s to support the war but assures the chevalier de la luzerne that he must never again consent to a further application negotiations he complains of being treated with great indelicacy by the american commissrs they having signed the treaty without any confidential communication that had france treated america     with the same indelicacy she might have signed her treaty first as every thing between france  england was settled but the king chose to keep faith with his allies and therefore always refused to do any thing definitively till all his allies were ready that this conduct had delayed the definitive treaty england having considered herself as greatly strengthened by america that docr franklin waited on the ct de vergennes  acknowledged the indelicacy of their behavior  had prevailed on him to bury it in oblivion that the english were endeavouring all in their power to sow seeds of discords between our commissrs  the court of spain representing our claims to the westward as extravagant and inadmissible that it became congress to be attentive to this business  to prevent the ill effects that it might be attended with that the king had informed the court of spain that tho he heartily wished that the u s might enjoy a cordial coalition with his cath majesty yet he should leave the whole affair entirely to the two states and not interfere otherwise than as by his counsel  advice when asked that altho the u s had not been so well treated by spain as might have been expected yet that his majesty wished that america might reap the advantage of a beneficial treaty with spain that as the peace was not yet certain it became all the powers at war to be ready for a vigorous campaign and hoped congs would exert themselves to aid the common cause by some offensive operations against the enemy but if the british should evacuate the u s the king earnestly hoped congs would take the most decided measures to prevent any intercourse with the british and particularly in the way of merchandize or supplying them with provisions wch would prove of the most dangerous tendency to the campaign in the w indies that the british now had hopes of opening an extensive trade with america tho the war should continue which if they should be disappointed in might hasten the definitive treaty as it would raise a clamor among the people of england the chevr added that as he had misinformed his court with regard to congs having funded their debts on which presumption the   milon had been granted he hoped congs would enable him in his next despatches to give some satisfactory account to his court on this head   0 thursday march    this day not noted in the journal as in some other instances revenues taken up as reported mar    the   paragraph in the report on revenue havg been judged not sufficiently explicit and recommitted to be made more so the following paragraph was recd in its place viz that it be further recommended to the several states to establish for a term limited to    years and to appropriate c to the word   million of dollars annually which proportions shall be fixed and equalized from time to time according to such rule as is or may be prescribed by the articles of confederation and in case the revenues so established and appropriated by any state shall at any time yield a sum exceeding its proportion the excess shall be refunded to it and in case the same shall be found to be defective the immediate deficiency shall be made good as soon as possible and a future deficiency guarded against by an enlargement of the revenues established provided that untill the rule of the confederation can be applied the proportions of the  000000 of dollars aforesaid shall be as follows viz this amendment was accepted a motion of mr clarke to restrain this apportionmt in the first instance to the term of   years being first negatived he contended that a valuation of land would probably never take place and that it was uncertain     whether the rule of numbers wd be substituted and therefore that the first apportionment might be continued throughout the    years altho it must be founded on the present relative wealth of the states which would vary every year in favor of those which are the least populous this reasoning was not denied but it was thought that such a limitation might leave an interval in which no apportionment wd exist whence confusion would proceed  that an apprehension of it would destroy public credit a motion was made by mr bland  ded by mr lee to go back to the first part of the report  instead of the word levy an impost of   per c to substitute the word collect an impost c it was urged in favor of this motion that the first word imported a legislative idea  the latter an executive only and consequently the latter might be less obnoxious to the states on the other side it was said that the states would be governed more by things than by terms that if the meaning of both was the same an alteration was unnecessary that if not as seemed to be the case an alteration would be improper it was particularly apprehended that if the term collect were to be used the states might themselves fix the mode of collection whereas it was indispensable that congs sd have that power as well as that it might be varied from time to time as circumstances or experience sd dictate as that a uniformity might be observed throughout the states on the motion of mr clarke the negative was voted by a large majority there being   ays only on the   parag there was no argt or opposition the   paragraph being considered by several as inaccurate in point of phraseology a motion was made by mr madison to postpone it to take into consideration the following to wit that in order to remove all objections against a retrospective application of the constitutional rule to the final apportionment on the several states of the monies  supplies actually contributed in pursuance of requisitions of congress it be recommended to the states to enable the u s in congs assembld to make such equitable abatements  alterations as the particular circumstances of the states from time to time during the war may require and as will divide the burden of such actual contributions among them in     proportion to their respective abilities at the periods at which they were made on a question of striking out the original paragraph was agreed to without opposition on the question to insert the amendment of mr m the votes of the states were   ays   noes viz n h no—cont no—n j no—delre no—maryld no—s c no the rest ay on the  0 paragraph relative to expences incurred by the states without the sanction of congs mr clarke exclaimed agst the unreasonableness of burdening the union with all the extravagant expenditures of particular states and moved that it might be struck out of the report mr helmsly  ded the motion mr madison said that the effects of rejecting this paragraph wd be so extensive that a full consideration of it ought at least to precede such a step that the expences referred to in the paragraph were in part such as would have been previously sanctioned by congs if application cd have been made since similar ones had been so with respect to states within the vicinity of congs and therefore complaints of injustice would follow a refusal that another part of the expences had been incurred in support of claims to the territory of which cessions were asked by congs and therefore these cd not be expected if the expences incident to them should be rejected that it was probable if no previous assurance were given on this point it would be made a condition by the states ceding as the cessions of territory would be made a condition by the states most anxious to obtain them that by these means the whole plan would be either defeated or the part thereof in question be ultimately forced on congs whilst they might with a good grace yield it in the first instance not to mention that these unliquidated  unallowed claims would produce hereafter such contests  heats among the states as wd probably destroy the plan even if it sd be acceded to by the states without this paragraph mr dyer was in favor of the paragraph mr rutledge opposed it as letting in a flood of claims which were founded on extravagant projects of the states mr higginson and mr ghorham were earnest in favor of it remarking that the distance of massachusetts from congs had denied a previous sanction to the militia operations agst general     burgoyne c the penobscot expedition also had great weight with them mr williamson was in favor of it mr wilson said he had always considered this country with respect to the war as forming one community and that the states which by their remoteness from congs had been obliged to incur expences for their defence without previous sanction ought to be placed on the same footing with those which had obtained this security but he could not agree to put them on a better which wd be the case if their expenses should be sanctioned in the lump he proposed therefore that these expences sd be limited to such as had been incurred in a necessary defence and of which the object in each case should be approved by congress mr madison agreed that the expressions in the paragh were very loose  that it wd be proper to make them as definite as the case wd admit he supposed however that all operations agst the enemy within the limits assigned to the u s might be considered as defensive  in that view the expedition agst penobscot might be so called he observed that the term necessary left a discretion in the judge as well as the term reasonable and that it wd be best perhaps for congress to determine  declare that they wd constitute a tribunal of impartial persons to decide on oath as to the propriety of claims of states not authorized heretofore by congs he sd this wd be a better security to the states  wd be more satisfactory than the decisions of congs the members of wch did not act on oath  brought with them the spirit of advocates for their respective states rather than of impartial judges between them he moved that the clause with mr wilsons proposition be recommitted which was agreed to without opposition        paraghs mr bland opposed it sd that the value of land was the best rule and that at any rate no change sd be attempted untill its practicability sd be tried mr madison thought the value of land could never be justly or satisfactorily obtained that it wd ever be a source of contentions among the states and that as a repetition of the valuation would be within the course of the    years it wd unless exchanged for a more simple rule mar the whole plan     mr ghorham was in favr of the paraghs he represented in strong terms the inequality  clamors produced by valuations of land in the state of massts  the probability of the evils being increased among the states themselves which were less tied together  more likely to be jealous of each other mr williamson was in favr of the paraghs mr wilson was strenuous in favor of it sd he was in congs when the articles of confederation directing a valuation of land were agreed to that it was the effect of the impossibility of compromising the different ideas of the eastern  southern states as to the value of slaves compared with the whites the alternative in question mr clarke was in favor of them he said that he was also in congs when this article was decided that the southern states wd have agreed to numbers in preference to the value of land if ½ their slaves only sd be included but that the eastern states would not concur in that proposition it was agreed on all sides that instead of fixing the proportion by ages as the report proposed it would be best to fix the proportion in absolute numbers with this view  that the blank might be filled up the clause was recommitted friday march    the come last mentd reported that two blacks be rated as one freeman mr wolcott was for rating them as   to   mr carrol as   to   mr williamson sd he was principled agst slavery  that he thought slaves an incumbrance to society instead of increasing its ability to pay taxes mr higginson as   to   mr rutledge sd for the sake of the object he wd agree to rate slaves as   to   but he sincerely thought   to   would be a juster proportion mr holten as   to   mr osgood sd he cd not go beyond   to       on a question for rating them as   to   the votes were n h ay mas no r i divd cont ay n j ay pa ay delr ay maryd no virga no n c no s c no the paragraph was then postponed by general consent some wishing for further time to deliberate on it but it appearing to be the general opinion that no compromise wd be agreed to after some further discussions on the report in which the necessity of some simple  practicable rule of apportionment came fully into view mr madison said that in order to give a proof of the sincerity of his professions of liberality he wd propose that slaves should be rated as   to   mr rutledge  ded the motion mr wilson sd he would sacrifice his opinion on this compromise mr lee was agst changing the rule but gave it as his opinion that   slaves were not equal to   freeman on the question for   to   it passed in the affirmative n h ay mass divd r i no cont no n j ay pa ay maryd ay va ay n c ay s c ay a motion was then made by mr bland  ded by mr lee to strike out the clause so amended and on the question shall it stand it passed in the negative n h ay mas no r i no conn no n j ay pa ay del no mar ay virga ay n c ay s c no so the clause was struck out the arguments used by those who were for rating slaves high were that the expence of feeding  clothing them was as far below that incident to freemen as their industry  ingenuity were below those of freemen and that the warm climate within wch the states having slaves lay compared wth the rigorous climate  inferior fertility of the others ought to have great weight in the case  that the exports of the former states were greater than of the latter on the other side it was said that slaves were not put to labor as young as the children of laboring families—that having no interest in their labor they did as little as possible  omitted every exertion of thought requisite to facilitate  expedite it that if the exports of the states having slaves exceeded those of the others their imports were in proportion slaves being employed wholly in agriculture not in manufactures  that in fact the balance of trade formerly was much more agst the so states than the others     on the main question see journals  saturday march   th the objections urged agst the motion of mr lee on the journal calling for a specific report of the supt of finance as to monies passing thro his hands were that the information demanded from the office of finance had during a great part of the period been laid before congress  was then actually on the table—that the term application of money was too indefinite no two friends of the motion agreeing in the meaning of it and that if it meant no more than immediate payments under the warrants of the superintendt to those who were to expend the money it was unnecessary the superintendt being already impressed with his duty on that subject that if it meant the ultimate payment for articles or service for the public it imposed a task that wd be impracticable to the superint and useless to congress who could no otherwise examine them than through the department of accounts  the committees appd half yearly for enquiring into the whole proceedings  that if the motion were free from those objections it ought to be so varied as to oblige the office of finance to report the information periodically since it would otherwise depend on the memory or vigilance of members and wd moreover have the aspect of suspicion towards the officer called upon n b as the motion was made at first the word immediately was used which was changed for the words as soon as may be at the instance of mr holten the object of the motion of mr madison was to define  comprehend every information practicable  necessary for congs to know  to enable them to judge of the fidelity of their minister and to make it a permanent part of his duty to afford it the clause respecting copies of receipts was found on discussion not to accord with the mode of conducting business  to be too voluminous a task but the question was taken without a convenient opportunity of correcting it the motion was negatived see the journal      monday march    a letter was recd from the govr of r island with resolutions of the legislature of that state justifying the conduct of mr howell on the arrival of the french cutter with the acct of the signing of the general preliminaries it was thought fit by congress to hasten the effect of them by calling in the american cruisers it was also thought by all not amiss to notify simply the intelligence to the british commanders at n y in addition to this it was proposed by the secy of f a and urged by the delegates of pa by mr lee mr rutledge  others that congress should signify their desire  expectation that hostilities shd be suspended at sea on the part of the enemy the arguments urged were that the effusion of blood might be immediately stopped  the trade of the country rescued from depredation it was observed on the other side that such a proposition derogated from the dignity of congs shewed an undue precipitancy that the intelligence was not authentic enough to justify the british com̃anders in complying with such an overture and therefore that congs would be exposed to the mortification of a refusal the former consideration prevailed  a verbal sanction was given to mr livingstons expressing to the sd com̃anders the expectation of congs this day their answers were recd addressed to robt r livingston esqr c c c declining to accede to the stopping of hostilities at sea  urging the necessity of authentic orders from g b for that purpose with their letters mr livingston communicated resolutions proposed from his office that in consequence of these letters the orders to the american cruisers sd be revoked and that the executives sd be requested to embargo all vessels congs were generally sensible after the ret of these papers that they had committed themselves in proposing to the british commanders at n y a stop to naval hostilities  were exceedingly at a loss to extricate themselves on one side they were unwilling to publish to the world the affront they had recd especially as no written order had been given for the correspondence and on the other it was necessary yt the continuance of hostilities at sea should be made known to american citizens some     were in favor of the revocation of hostilities others proposed as col bland  genl mifflin that the secy of f a should be directed verbally to publish the letters from carleton  digby this was negatived the superscription was animadverted upon particularly by mr mercer who said that the letters ought to have been sent back unopened finally it was agreed that any member might take copies  send them to the press  that the subject should lie over for further consideration tuesday april   mr ghorham called for the order of the day to wit the report on revenue c and observed as a cogent reason for hastening that business that the eastern states at the invitation of the legislature of massts were with n y about to form a convention for regulating matters of common concern  that if any plan should be sent out by congs during their session they would probably cooperate with congs in giving effect to it mr mercer expressed great disquietude at this information considered it as a dangerous precedent  that it behoved the gentleman to explain fully the objects of the convention as it would be necessary for the s states to be otherwise very circumspect in agreeing to any plans on a supposition that the general confederacy was to continue mr osgood said that the sole object was to guard agst an interference of taxes among states whose local situation required such precautions and that if nothing was definitively concluded without the previous communication to  sanction of congs the confederation could not be said to be in any manner departed from but that in fact nothing was intended that could be drawn within the purview of the federal articles mr bland said he had always considered those conventions as improper  contravening the spirit of the federal governmt he said they had the appearance of young congresses mr ghorham explains as mr osgood mr madison  mr hamilton disapproved of these partial conventions not as absolute violations of the confederacy but as ultimately leading to them  in the mean time exciting pernicious     jealousies the latter observing that he wished instead of them to see a general convention take place  that he sd soon in pursuance of instructions from his constituents propose to congs a plan for that purpose the object wd be to strengthen the federal constitution mr white informed congs that n hampshire had declined to accede to a plan of a convention on foot mr higginson said that no gentleman need be alarmed at any rate for it was pretty certain that the convention would not take place he wished with mr hamilton to see a general convention for the purpose of revising and amending the federal government these observations having put an end to the subject congs resumed the report on revenue c mr hamilton who had been absent when the last question was taken for substituting numbers in place of the value of land moved to reconsider that vote he was  ded by mr osgood see the journal those who voted differently from their

observed on the importance of that country the danger from immediate emigrations of its being lost to the public  the necessity on the part of congress of taking care of the federal interests in the formation of new states which could not take place by the authority of any particular states mr madison observed that the appointment of such a come could not be necessary at this juncture  might be injurious that congs were about to take in the report on revenue c the only step that could now be properly taken viz to call again on the states claiming the w territory to cede the same that until the result sd be known every thing wd be premature  wd excite in the states irritations  jealousies that might frustate the cessions that it was indispensable to obtain these cessions in order to compromise the disputes  to derive advantage from the territory to the u s that if the motion meant merely to prevent irregular settlements the recommendation to that effect ought to be made to the states—that if ascertaining  disposing of garrisons proper to be kept up in that country was the object it was already in the hands of the come on peace arrangements but might be expressly referred to them     mr mercer supported the same ideas mr clarke considered the motion as nowise connected with the peace arrangements his object was to define the western limits of the states which congs alone cd do and which it was necessary they sd do in order to know what territory properly belonged to the u s and what steps ought to be taken relative to it he disapproved of repeatedly courting the states to make cessions wch congs stood in no need of mr wilson seemed to consider as the property of the u s all territory over which particular states had not exercised jurisdiction particularly n w of ohio  said that within the country confirmed to the u s by the provisional articles there must be a large country over which no particular claims extended he was answered that the exercise of jurisdiction was not the criterion of territorial rights of the states that pena had maintained always a contrary doctrine that if it were a criterion va had exercised jurisdiction over the illinois  other places conquered n w of the ohio that it was uncertain whether the limits of the u s as fixed by the provl arts did comprehend any territory out of the claims of the individual states that sd it be the case a decision or examination of the point had best be put off till it sd be seen whether cessions of the states wd not render it unnecessary that it cd not be immediately necessary for the purpose of preventing settlemts on such extra lands since they must lie too remote to be in danger of it congress refused to refer the motion to the come on peace arrang̃ents and by a large majority referred it to a special come viz mrs osgood wilson madison carrol  williamson to whom was also referred the meml of genl hazen on the preceding question cont was strenuous in favr of mr wilsons motion a motion was made by mr dyer to strike out the drawback on salt fish c mr ghorham protested in the most solemn manner that massts wd never accede to the plan without the drawback the motion was very little supported     thursday apl  0 letters recd from genl carleton  admiral digby inclosing british proclamation  of cessation of arms  also letters from docr franklin  mr adams notifying the

secy of f a to report a proclamation for congs at   oclock at which time congs met  recd report nearly as it stands on the journal of friday apl     after some consideration of the report as to the accuracy  propriety of which a diversity of sentiments prevailed they postponed it till next day the secy also reported a resolution directing the secy at war and agent of marine to discharge all prisoners of war friday apl    this day was spent in discussing the proclamation which passed mr wilson proposed an abbreviation of it which was disagreed to the difficultys attending it were that  st the agreement of our ministers with fitzherbert that the epochs with spain as well as france sd be applied to the u s to be computed from the ratifications which happened at different times the former on the  d the latter on the  th of feby  d the circumstance of the epochs having passed at wch the cessation of hostilities was to be enjoined the impatience of congs did not     admit of proper attention to these  some other points of the proclamation particularly the authoritative style of enjoining an observance on the u s the govrs c it was agst these absurdities  improprieties that the solitary no of mr mercer was pointed see the journal saturday apl    a letter of the   th of deceditor illegible figure o s was recd from mr dana in which he intimates that in consequence of the news of peace taking place  independence being acknowledged by g b he expected soon to take his proper station at the ct of st petersburg  to be engaged in forming a commercial treaty with her imperial majesty mr madison observed that as no powers or instructions had been given to mr dana relative to a treaty of com̃erce he apprehended there must be some mistake on the part of mr dana that it wd be proper to inquire into the matter  let him know the intentions of congs on this subject the letter was committed to mr madison mr ghorham  mr fitzsimmons mr rutledge observed that as ye instructions to foreign ministers now stood it was conceived they had no powers for commercial stipulations other than such as might be comprehended in a definitive treaty of peace with g b he said he did not pretend to commercial knowledge but thought it wd be well for the u s to enter into commercial treaties with all nations  particularly with g b he moved therefore that the come sd be instructed to prepare a general report for that purpose mr madison  mr fitzsimmons thought it wd be proper to be very circumspect in fettering our trade with stipulations to foreigners that as our stipulations wd extend to all the possessions of the u s necessarily— those of foreign nations havg colonies to part of their possessions only and as the most favd nations enjoyed greater privileges in the u s than elsewhere the u s gave an advantage in treaties on this subject  finally that negotiations ought to be carried on here or our ministers directed to conclude nothing without previously reporting every thing for the     sanction of congs it was at length agreed that the come sd report the general state of instructions existing on the subject of commercial treaties congress took into consideration the report of the secy for f a for immediately setting at liberty all the prisoners of war  ratifying the provisional articles several members were extremely urgent on this point from motives of oeconomy others doubted whether congs were bound thereto  if not bound whether it would be proper the first question depended on the import of the provisional articles which were very differently interpreted by different members after much discussion from which a general opinion arose of extreme inaccuracy  ambiguity as to the force of these articles the business was committed to mr madison mr peters  mr hamilton who were also to report on the expediency of ratifying the said articles immediately monday april    the committee on the report of the secretary of foreign affrs reported as follows mr hamilton dissenting   that it does not appear that congress are any wise bound to go into the ratification proposed the treaty of which a ratification is to take place as mentioned in the  th of the provisional articles is described in the title of those articles to be a treaty of peace proposed to be concluded between the crown of g b and the said u s but which is not to be concluded until terms of peace shall be agreed upon between g b  france the act to be ratified therefore is not the provl articles themselves but an act distinct—future—and even contingent again altho the declaratory act entered into on the  0th of jany last between the american  british plenipotentiaries relative to a cessation of hostilities seems to consider the contingency on which the provl articles were suspended as having taken place yet that act cannot itself be considered as the treaty of peace meant to be concluded nor does it stipulate that either the provl articles or the act itself should be ratified in america it only engages that the u s shall cause hostilities to cease on their part an     engagement which was duly fulfilled by the proclamation issued on the   th instant lastly it does not appear from the correspondence of the american ministers or from any other information either that such ratification was expected from the u s or intended on the part of g b still less that any exchange of mutual ratifications has been in contemplation   if congress are not bound to ratify the articles in question the come are of opinion that it is inexpedient for them to go immediately into such an act inasmuch as it might be thought to argue that congress meant to give to those articles the quality  effect of a definitive treaty of peace with g b tho neither their allies nor friends have as yet proceeded farther than to sign preliminary articles and inasmuch as it may oblige congs to fulfil immediately all the stipulations contained in the provl articles tho they have no evidence that a correspondent obligation will be assumed by the other party   if the ratification in question be neither obligatory nor expedient the come are of opinion that an immediate discharge of all prisoners of war  on the part of the u s is premature and unadvisable especially as such a step may possibly lessen the   0 force of demands for a reimbursement of the sums expended in the subsistence of the prisoners upon these considerations the come recommend that a decision of congs on the papers referred to them be postponed on this subject a variety of sentiments prevailed mr dyer on a principle of frugality was strenuous for a liberation of the prisoners mr williamson thought congs not obliged to discharge the prisoners previous to a definitive treaty but was willing to go into the measure as soon as that public honor would permit he wished us to move pari passu with the british com̃ander at new york he suspected that the place would be held till the interests of the tories should be provided for mr hamilton contended that congress were bound by the tenor of the provl treaty immediately to ratify it and to execute the several stipulations inserted in it particularly that relating to a discharge of prisoners mr bland thought congs not bound mr elseworth was strenuous for the obligation and policy of going into an immediate execution of the treaty he supposed that a ready  generous execution on our part wd accelerate the like on the other part mr wilson was not surprised that the obscurity of the treaty sd produce a variety of ideas he thought upon the whole that the treaty was to be regarded as contingently definitive the report of the come being not consonant to the prevailing sense of congs it was laid aside tuesday april    the

reported the following clause to be added to the  0th paragraph in the first report viz and to the end that convenient provision may be made for determining in all such cases how far the expences may have been reasonable as well with respect to the object thereof as the means for accomplishing it thirteen com̃isrs namely one out of each state shall be appointed by congress any seven of whom having first taken an oath for the faithful  impartial execution of their trust who shall concur in the same opinion shall be empowered to determine finally on the reasonableness of the claims for expences incurred by particular states as aforesaid and in order that such determinations may be expedited as much as possible the com̃isrs now in appointment for adjusting accts between the u s and individual states shall be instructed to examine all such claims  report to congs such of them as shall be supported by satisfactory proofs distinguishing in their reports the objects and measures in which the expences shall have been incurred provided that no balances which may be found due under this regulation or the resolutions of the — day of — shall be deducted out of the preceding revenues but shall be discharged by separate requisitions to be made on the states for that purpose in support of this proposition it was argued that in a general provision for public debts and public tranquillity satisfactory measures ought to be taken on a point wch many of the states had so much at heart  which they wd not separate from ye other matters proposed by congress that the nature of the business was unfit for the decision of congs who brought with them     ye spirit of advocates rather than of judges and besides required more time than could be spared for it on the opposite side some contended that the accts between the u s  particular states sd not be made in any manner to encumber those between the former and private persons others thought that congs could not delegate to comrs

raised a long debate in favor of the motion it was urged by mr rutledge that the proposed cession of va ought to be previously considered  disallowed that otherwise a renewal of the recommendation wd be offensive that it was possible the cession might be accepted in which case the renewal wd be improper virga he observed alone could be alluded to as having complied in part only mr wilson went largely into the subject he said if the investigation of right was to be considered the u s ought rather to make cessions to individual states than receive cessions from them the extent of ye territory ceded by the treaty being larger than all the states put together that when the claims of the states came to be limited on principles of right the alleghany mountains would appear to be the true boundary this could be established without difficulty before any court or the tribunal of the world he thought however policy reqd that such a boundary sd be established as wd give to the atlantic states access to the western waters if accommodation was the object the     clause ought by no means to be struck out the cession of virga would never be accepted because it guarantied to her the country as far as the ohio which never belonged to virga here he was called to order by mr jones the question he sd must be decided the indecision of congs had been hurtful to the interests of the

them mr carroll urged the expediency of caution the possibility that advantage might be taken by g b of a discharge both of prisoners     and of the army and suggested the middle course of furloughing the troops mr dyer was strenuous for getting rid of expence considered the war at an end that g b might as well renew the war after the definitive treaty as now that not a moment ought to be lost in disburdening the public of needless expence mr rutledge viewed the conduct of g b in so serious a light that he almost regretted having voted for a discharge of prisoners he urged the expediency of caution and of consulting the commander chief he accordingly moved that the report be referred to him for his opinion  advice the motion was seconded by mr izard mr clarke asked whether any military operation was on foot that the commander in chief was to be consulted this was a     national question which the national council ought to decide he was agst furloughing the men because they would carry their arms with them he said we were at peace  complained that some could not separate the idea of a briton from that of cutting throats mr ellsworth enlarged on the impropriety of submitting to the commander in chief a point on which he could not possess competent materials for deciding we ought either to discharge the men engaged for the war or to furlough them he preferred the former mr mercer descanted on the insidiousness of g b and warmly opposed the idea of laying ourselves at her mercy that we might save fifty thousand dollars altho congress knew they were violating the treaty

may    see the secret journal for these two days the passage relating to the armed neutrality was generally concurred in for the reasons which it expresses  the disagreements on the questions relating

articles of iron  hemp they were supported by s carolina who calculated on a russian market for her rice   0 friday may    the report from mr hamilton ghorham and peters in favor of discharging the soldiers enlisted for the war was supported on the ground that it was called for by economy and justified by the degree of certainty that the war would not be renewed those who voted for furloughing the soldiers wished to avoid expence and at the same time to be not wholly unprepared for the contingent failure of a definitive treaty of peace the view of the subject taken by those who were opposed both to discharging and furloughing were explained in a motion by mr mercer seconded by mr izard to assign as reasons first that sr guy carleton had not given satisfactory reasons for continuing at n york second that he had broken the articles of the provisional treaty relative to the negroes by sending them off this motion appeared exceptionable to several particularly to mr hamilton  rather than it should be entered on the journal by yeas and nays it was agreed that the whole subject should lye over the report relative to the department of for affairs being taken up mr carroll seconded by mr williamson moved that no public minister should be employed by the u s except on extraordinary occasions in support of the proposition it was observed that it would not only be economical but would withhold our distinguished citizens from the corrupting scenes at foreign courts and what was of more consequence would prevent the residence of foreign ministers in the u s whose intrigues  examples might be injurious both to the govt  the people the considerations suggested on the other side were that diplomatic relations made part of the established policy of modern civilized nations that they tended to prevent hostile collisions by mutual  friendly explanations  that a young republic ought not to incur the odium of so singular  as it might be thought disrespectful an innovation the

the right of the u states he moved an amendment in favor of private claims mr clarke was strenuous for the right of the u s and agst waiting longer this had reference to the absence of maryland which had always taken a deep interest in the question mr ghorham supported the policy of acceding to the report mr fitzsimmons recommended a postponement of the question observing that he had sent a copy of the report to the maryland delegates the president was for a postponement till the sense of n jersey be known the delaware delegates expecting instructions were for postponing till monday next it was agreed at length that a final vote should not be taken till that day mr     m yielding to the sense of the house but warning that the opportunity might be lost by the rising of the legislature of virga mr hamilton  mr peters with permission moved for a recommitment of the report in order to provide for crown titles within the territory reserved to the state mr madison objected to the motion

only being present the question occurred whether nine states were not necessary to avoid the difficulty a negative form was given to the resolution by which the preamble became somewhat unsuitable it was suffered to pass however rather than risk the experiment of further alteration friday june    the mutinous memorial from the sergeants was recd  read it excited much indignation  was sent to the secretary at war monday june    no congress tuesday june    the day was employed chiefly in considering the report on the journal relative to the department of finance  some thought it ought to lie on

opinion finally the report was entered on the journal without any act of congress thereon by a unanimous concurrence     wednesday june    nothing done      thursday june    a motion  was made by mr williamson seconded by mr bland to recommend to the states to make it a part of the confederation that whenever a fourteenth state should be added to the union ten votes be required in cases now requiring nine it was committed to mr williamson mr hamilton  mr madison the motion had reference to the foreseen creation of the western part of n carolina into a separate state   0 information was recd by congress from the executive council of pennsylvania that  0 soldiers who would probably be followed by the discharged soldiers of armands legion were on the way from lancaster to philadelpha in spite of the expostulations of their officers declaring that they would proceed to the seat of congress and demand justice and intimating designs agst the bank this information was committed to mr hamilton mr peters and mr ellsworth for the purpose of conferring with the executive of pennsylvania and taking such measures as they should find necessary the committee after so conferring informed congress that it was the opinion of the executive that the militia of philadelpa would probably not be willing to take arms before their resentments should be provoked by some actual outrage that it would hazard the authority of govt to make the attempt  that it would be necessary to let the soldiers come into the city if the officers who had gone out to meet them could not stop them at this information mr izard mr mercer  others being much displeased signified that if the city would not support congress it was high time to remove to some other place mr wilson remarked that no part of the u states was better disposed towards congrs than pennsylvania where the prevailing sentiment was that congress had done every thing that depended on them after some conversation and directing genl st clair who had gone out of town to be sent for and it appearing that nothing further could be done at present congress adjourned the secy at war had set out for virginia yesterday it was proposed to send for him but declined as he had probably gone too great a distance and genl st clair it was supposed would answer     friday june  0 the soldiers from lancaster came into the city under the guidance of sergeants they professed to have no other object than to obtain a settlement of accounts which they supposed they had a better chance for at philadelphia than at lancaster see the report of the committee on this subject the report of the committee see the journal on the territorial cession of virga being taken up  the amendment on the journal proposed by mr mchenry  mr clarke being lost  mr bedford proposed that the second condition of the cession be so altered as to read that in order to comply with the said condition so far as the same is comprised within the resolution of oct the  0    0 on that subject commissioners as proposed by the committee be appointed c and that instead of for the purposes mentioned in the said condition be substituted agreeably to that resolution in support of this alteration it was urged by mr mchenry mr bedford  mr clarke that the terms used by virginia were too comprehensive  indefinite in favor of the report of the committee it was contended by mr ellsworth that the alteration was unreasonable inasmuch as civil expenses were on the same footing of equity as military and that a compromise was the object of the committee sundry members were of opinion that civil expences were comprised in the resolution of october the  0    0 mr bland  mr mercer acceded to the alteration proposed mr madison alone dissented and therefore did not insist on a call for the votes of the states mr mchenry moved but without being seconded that the commissioners instead of deciding finally should be authorized to report to congress only in the course of the debate mr clarke laid before congress the remonstrance of new jersey as entered on the journal      as the report had been postponed at the instance of the president  other delegates of n jersey in order to obtain this answer from their constituents and as the remonstrance was dated on the   th of june and was confessed privately by mr — to have been in possession of the delegates on monday last an unfairness was complained of they supposed that if it had been laid before congress sooner the copy which would have been sent by the virga delegates might hasten the opening of the land office of that state mr clarke said there were still good prospects and he did not doubt that the time would yet come when congress would draw a line limiting the states to the westward  say thus far shall ye go  no further mr bedford moved that with respect to the  th   th conditions of the cessions it be declared that clark  his men  the virginia line be allowed the same bounty beyond the ohio as was allowed by the u s to the same ranks this motion was seconded by —— congress adjourned without debating it there being seven states only present and the spirit of compromise decreasing from several circumstances there was reason to believe that r island n jersey pennsylvania  delaware if not maryland also retained latent views of confining virginia to the alleghany mountains notice was taken by mr madison of the error in the remonstrance which recites that congress had declared the cession of virginia to be a partial one saturday june         the mutinous soldiers presented themselves drawn up in the street before the state house where congress had assembled     the executive council of the state sitting under the same roof was called on for the proper interposition president dickinson came in and explained the difficulty under actual circumstances of bringing out the militia of the place for the suppression of the mutiny he thought that without some outrages on persons or property the militia could not be relied on genl st clair then in philada was sent for and desired to use his interposition in order to prevail on the troops to return to the barracks his report gave no encouragement in this posture of things it was proposed by mr izard that congs shd adjourn it was proposed by mr hamilton that genl st clair in concert with the executive council of the state should take order for terminating the mutiny mr reed moved that the genl shd endeavour to withdraw the troops by assuring them of the disposition of congs to do them justice it was finally agreed that congs shd remain till the usual hour of adjournment but without taking any step in relation to the alledged grievances of the soldiers or any other business whatever in the meantime the soldiers remained in their position without offering any violence individuals only occasionally uttering offensive words and wantonly pointed their muskets to the widows of the hall of congress no danger from premeditated violence was apprehended but it was observed that spirituous drink from the tippling houses adjoining began to be liberally served out to the soldiers and might lead to hasty excesses none were committed however and about   oc the usual hour cong adjourned the soldiers tho in some instances offering a mock obstruction permitting the members to pass thro their ranks they soon afterwards retired themselves to the barracks in the evening congress reassembled and passed the resolutions on the journal authorizing a committee to confer anew with the executive of the state and in case no satisfactory grounds shd appear for expecting prompt and adequate exertions for suppressing the mutiny  supporting the public authority authorizing the president with the advice of the committee to summon the members to meet at trenton or princeton in new jersey the conference with the executive produced nothing but a     repetition of doubts concerning the disposition of the militia to act unless some actual outrage were offered to persons or property it was even doubted whether a repetition of the insult to congress would be a sufficient provocation during the deliberations of the executive and the suspense of the committee reports from the barracks were in constant vibration at one moment the mutineers were penitent  preparing submissions the next they were meditating more violent measures  sometimes the bank was their object then the seizure of the members of congress with whom they imagined an indemnity for their offence might be stipulated on tuesday about   oclock the efforts of the state authority being despaired of  the reports from the barracks being unfavorable the committee advised the president to summon congress to meet at princeton which he did verbally as to the members present leaving behind him a general proclamation for the press after the departure of congs the mutineers submitted and most of them accepted furloughs under the resolution of congress on that subject at the time of submission they betrayed their leaders the chief of whom proved to be a mr carberry a deranged officer and a mr sullivan a

emoluments or privileges nor subjected to any penalties or disabilities unless under colour or religion the preservation of equal liberty and the existence of the state be manifestly endangered this variation is in the handwriting of j m and is recollected to have been brought forward by him with a view more particularly to substitute for the idea expressed by the term toleration an absolute and

governor of virginia philadelphia december   th    0 sir— the complexion of the intelligence received of late from spain with the manner of thinking which begins to prevail in congress with regard to the claims to the navigation of the mississippi makes it our duty to apply to our constituents for their precise full and ultimate sense on this point if spain should make a relinquishment of the navigation of that river on the part of the united states an indispensable condition of an alliance with them and the state of virginia should adhere to their former determination to insist on the right of navigation their delegates ought to be so instructed not only for their own satisfaction but that they may the more effectually obviate arguments drawn from a supposition that the change of circumstances which has taken place since the former instructions were given may have changed the opinion of virginia with regard to the object of them if on the other side any such change of opinion should have happened and it is now the sense of the state that an alliance with spain ought to be purchased even at the price of such a cession if it can not be obtained on better terms it is evidently necessary that we should be authorized to concur in it—it will also be expedient for the legislature to instruct us in the most explicit terms whether any and what extent of territory on the east side of the mississippi and within the limits of virginia is in any event to be yielded to spain as the price of an alliance with her—lastly it is our earnest wish to know what steps it is the pleasure of our constituents we should take in case we should be instructed in no event to concede the claims of virginia either to territory or to the navigation of the abovementioned river and congress should without their concurrence agree to such concession we have made use of the return of the honble w jones to n carolina to transmit this to your excellency and request that you will

  0   the scheme of a negro bounty was discussed on several occasions in the virginia legislature as joness letters show but my notion is he says in the letter to which madison alludes and i think the mode would be more just and equally certain in procuring the men to throw the militia into divisions as by the last law and require the divisions to find a negro of a certain value or age or money equivalent to that value    but the negro bounty cannot fail to procure men for the war under either scheme with the draught as the dernier resort in reply to this letter of madisons jones wrote dec   the negro scheme is laid aside upon a doubt of its practicability in any reasonable time and because it was generally considered as unjust sacrificing the property of a part of the community to the exoneration of the rest it was reprobated also as inhuman and cruel how far your idea of raising black regiments giving them freedom would be politic in this and the negro states deserves well to be considered so long as the states mean to continue any part of that people in their present subjection as it must be doubtful whether the measure would not ultimately tend to increase the army of the enemy as much or more than our own for if they once see us disposed to arm the blacks for the field they will follow the example and not disdain to fight us in our own way and this would bring on the southern states inevitable ruin at least it would draw off immediately such a number of the best labourers for the culture of the earth as to ruin individuals distress the state and perhaps the continent when all that can be raised by their assistance is but barely sufficient to keep us jogging along with the great expence of the war the freedom of these people is a great and desirable object to have a clear view of it would be happy for virginia but whenever it is attempted it must be i conceive by some gradual course allowing time as they go off for labourers to take their places

george mason april  d      virginia virginia gunstonhall april  d      gentlemen—          whoever considers the importance of the trade of these states to great britain and her expectations of great part of it returning into british channels upon a peace may readily conceive that she will be alarmed at any measures which may affect it hereafter by imposing such burdens upon it as will give a lasting preference to other nations if therefore congress were to recommend to the legislatures of the different states immediately to enact laws declaring that all private property which hath been or shall be plundered or destroyed by the british troops or others acting under the authority of the king of great britain beyond high water mark from a certain day shall be hereafter reimbursed  made good to the individual sufferers  their heirs by dutys to be imposed upon all imports from great britain into the respective states after a peace and to be continued until full reparation shall be

carry into effect all the articles of the said confederation against any of the states which shall refuse or neglect to abide by such their determinations or shall otherwise violate any of the

necessary for preserving the authority of the confederation and for doing justice to the states which shall duly fulfil their federal engagements and it is moreover most consonant to the spirit of a free constitution that on the one hand all exercise of power should be explicitly and precisely warranted and on the other that the penal consequences of a violation of duty should be clearly promulged and understood and whereas it is further declared by the said   th article of the confederation that no addition shall be made to the articles thereof unless the same shall be agreed to in a

informed you that a proposition had been made in congress for accepting the territorial cession of n york the paper enclosed contains the proceedings which ensued the acceptance of this cession singly met with a negative from virginia for obvious reasons in the first place such a measure instead of terminating all controversy as to the western country the object proposed by the original plan introduces new perplexities and in the  d place an assent from us might be hereafter pleaded as a voluntary acceptance of the u states in the room of n york as litigants against virginia on the subsequent motion you will find virgn divided the proviso expressed in this motion if referred to the territory retained by n york appeared to me to be at least nugatory or rather to imply that a resolution of congress might operate towards depriving another state of the benefits of the confederation and if referred to the territory ceded by n y to imply that the  th art was the constitutional rule of deciding controversies as well where the u s as where a particular state were the party all that congress could as i supposed have properly done would have been to guard against any biass on future decisions by declaring that their acceptance of the cession of n y was not to be considered as expressing any opinion as to the rightful claims or limits of that state but i did not feel myself at liberty to substitute such a proposition because it militated against the guaranty required by virga and would have prejudged that condition of her cession the success of the middle states in obtaining the cession of n y has given great encouragement and they are pursuing steadily the means of availing themselves of the other titles that of connecticut is proposed for the next object virginia will be postponed for the last by enlisting the two preceding into their party they hope to render their measures more effectual with respect to the last besides the effect which may be expected from this coalition with new york on territorial questions in congress it will i surmise prove very unfriendly to the pretentions of vermont duane seems not unapprized of the advantage which new york has gained and is already taking measures for a speedy vote on that question upon the whole new york has by a fortunate coincidence of circumstances or by skilful management or by both succeeded in a very important object by ceding a claim which was tenable neither by force nor by right she has acquired with congress the merit of liberality rendered the title to her reservation more respectable and at least dampt the zeal with which vermont has been abetted if you should be surprized that these considerations did not dissuade connecticut from an unqualified acceptance of the cession of new york you will only be affected as others were at the time the truth is they were surprized at it themselves after it was too late and would gladly have revoked their error you were also informed in my last of the situation in wch the affair of lippencot remained in the midst of our perplexities a letter arrived from genl washington enclosing an intercession from the count de vergennes in favour of the life of young asgill founded on a most pathetic and importunate memorial from his mother the ct writes to genl washington as he says not in the quality of a public minister but of a man who feels the force of mrs asgills supplications he backs his intercession however with the desire of the king  queen who were much affected with the memorial observes that altho asgill is no doubt a prisoner to the u states yet as he became such by an event to which the arms of his majesty contributed the interest he takes in behalf of this officer is the more admissible  signifies that if the british commander should not in this instance fully comply with the demands of justice there is reason to believe that future instances of barbarity will be presented the judgment formed of this intercession by different members is very different all agree that retaliation cannot be executed in the face of it but some are of opinion that it luckily affords and ought to be made the ground of retreat from that measure whilst others suppose that our honour will be more wounded by such a public exposition both of our obsequiousness to france and of her disapprobation of our views than by a retreat of ourselves on the ground of carletons promise of continued pursuit of the murderer some fear also that an omission in our act of the wish expressed by the king  queen of france may give umbrage others again infer from the circumstance of the letter from the count being addressed to genl washington not to congress and in his private not official quality that a public notice of it can not be expected and that a private explanation by the secretary of foreign affairs to the minister of france will be as much as will be proper the minister also received an instruction to interest himself in the affair and had even prepared a memorial to congress relative to it having discovered however the diversity of sentiments prevailing in congress and being apprehensive that his interposition might render the case more perplexing and possibly be not treated with due notice in the final act of congress he has very prudently desisted from his purpose until congress shall have come to some decision with respect to the notice to be taken of the intercession above mentioned i would not wish it to be generally spoken of from this letter          a letter from carmichael dated   july says that the resolutions of congress  the states against separate negociations with the new british ministry were exceedingly applauded at the spanish court and that he had discovered that the imperial  russian ministers had renewed an offer of the mediation of their courts to spain the silence of our other ministers in letters of later date renders the latter article very doubtful a letter of the  th of sept from mr laurens at nantz repeats his purpose to return to america adding that the risk of capture  and the advice of his friends had led him to apply to the court of london for a passport via falmouth  n york to philada that ld cornwallis had interested himself in his case and that the passport was to be transmitted to him it was uncertain whether he was to embark this fall or wait till the spring unless the embarkation from a british port was more necessary than i am aware a direct passport from france would in my view have been more eligible the army we are informed by a

very barren but contain everything which falls under the head of news mad mss   madison set forth the delinquency of virginia in complying with the requisitions of congress in the following letter to edmund randolph dated november   th cypher represented by italics the governor in his letter to the delegates of the  th of the prest month after observing that the great scarcity of cash in virga will put it out of her power to comply with the demands of congress unless the financier will accept tobo in payment desires us to sound the latter on that subject we accordingly called on mr morris and to our astonishment were told that a proposition to this very effect and to the amount of sixty thousand dollars had been a considerable time lying before him that his agent had been instructed to allow the current price and that he wished to have obtained the tobacco because it could be immediately sent under a fortunate convoy to holland where its influence on public credit might be critical and important either therefore mr m must have been basely deceived by his agent which can hardly be supposed or the governor must in the first case have rejected a fair offer and in the next imposed on us a very nugatory and awkward negotiation as we concealed from the superintendt that our enquiries with the govt he escaped the risk to which he had exposed his character with that minister sic i cannot pass over this circumstance without a lamentation on the obloquy which virginia brings on herself by submitting to be eclipsed by even the feeble efforts of other states the monthly lash of the receivers proclamation which has roused so many other states into some degree of emulation has produced no effect on her in our conversation with mr m we were indeed told that mr webb had a prospect of between two and three thousand dollars but if any thing can add to the mortification which we feel at the receipt of nothing it will be the receipt of so beggarly a sum i confide therefore that there is at least enough of pride in the state to prevent it           the obstinacy of rhode island in rejecting the impost is a subject of very general pointed crimination not only among the public creditors and their friends who deem it equivalent to denial of justice but among the most enlightened patrons of the fœdral interests who pronounce it a blow to our credit abroad as well as our future credit at home and in truth who can combine this consideration with the paltry payments on the last requisition of congress and not shudder at the prospect this obstinacy on the part of r i is supposed on good grounds to be much cherished by the limited manner in which other states have acceded to the impost from which she infers a latent repugnance to the measure would it not then be prudent in virga to revise and enlarge her act of compliance if her example should prove less efficacious than might be wished it would at least have a conciliatory effect on other states and gain her general credit i see no possible objection unless indeed she wishes the plan to be frustrated in which case i can only give it as my firm opinion that a thorough knowledge of public affairs would speedily reconcile her to it if your own ideas correspond with those here expressed and the temper of the legislature be not unfavorable you will give such suggestions as may be best adapted to the object and make them the subject of a future paragraph—mad mss   this act recited the depreciation of the bills of credit to at least    0 below their nominal value and the necessity of decreasing the quantity of paper in circulation it was resolved that the states should pay their quotas at the rate of one spanish milled dollar for forty dollars of the bills that the bills as paid in be destroyed that as fast as funds should be provided other bills should be issued not to exceed onetwentieth part of the nominal sum of bills destroyed that the new bills bear interest at five per cent per annum and be redeemed within six years in specie that the new bills be issued to the states in proportion according to their monthly quotas—journals of congress iii       its reasonableness and its fate both will depend much on the scale by which as well the redeemed as the outstanding bills is to be valued in all questions relative to this subject the defect of information under which we lie makes it difficult for us to deduce the general interest from a just  fair comparison of particular interests to supply in some degree this defect with regard to virginia i shall enclose to mr ambler for

combated the statement of rhode island that the proposed duty would bear hardest on the commercial states it was it said an established general principle  that every duty on imports is incorporated with the price of the commodity and ultimately paid by the consumer with a profit on the duty itself as a compensation to the merchant for the advance of his money  as a consumer the merchant paid his share of the duty it thus bore upon all classes in just proportion and promoted frugality by taxing extravagance that the collection of the impost would introduce into the states officers unaccountable to them was an idle objection since it would apply equally to postmasters and if acceded to would militate against the appointment of any federal internal officers no government could exist under these circumstances the proposed measure was one of necessity the revenue was insufficient and could no longer be supplied by loans the measure was within the spirit of the confederation congress was vested with the power to borrow money and by implication with power to concert the nucleus necessary to accomplish that end the measure proposed they had decided upon after the most solemn deliberation—cont cong   howells protest was—that congress had no power to call any member to account for information conveyed to his constituents the secrets only of congress excepted and especially not to call to account a member of the late congress that the appointment of a committee to examine into the matter of a publication in the public press was undignified and a precedent dangerous to the freedom of the press that the report of the committee demanding the delivery up by the executive of rhode island of the writer of the publication was an infraction of the fifth article of the confederation which allowed freedom of speech and debate in congress and as a consequence free communication of such speeches and debates to the constituents that the facts stated concerning the foreign loans were substantially true that they had been successful and there was danger of incurring too large a debt that he was not alone in his opinions that it was unfair to report on a single paragraph of his letter and had a tendency to establish a despotism over the minority by deterring the members of it from writing freely to their constituents that he was well known as an opponent of the five per cent impost and his constituents expected him to oppose it the lower assembly of his state having unanimously rejected it that he was accountable to his constituents and was

since the appointment of the deputation to rho island congress have recd a copy of the refusal of the legislature of that state to concur in the impost with the reasons on which the refusal is grounded the reasons assigned are  st the inequality of the tax which will bear hardest on the commercial states and peculiarly hard on rho island which is the most commercial  dly the inexpediency of admitting to a collection within the state of so large a tax an officer unknown to the constitution and unaccountable to the authority of the state  dly the danger to public liberty from such an accession of weight to the federal government i give this recital from memory and therefore only of the substance of the objections they are in the hands of a committee who will report such observations as they may deem a fit answer to them the deputation has not yet set out but probably will in the course of this week vermont has been again on the tapis its only advocates were the delegates of rho island who are charged with interested views in the case and those of n jersey who are fettered by instructions from their constituents i understand that a mr tichner one of the

errand general greene has referred to congress a case which admonishes them of the necessity of a code for captures  recaptures on land as well as on water a detachment of the continental forces having retaken a number of horses which had been taken by the enemy from the citizens of s carolina the executive authority of the state demanded a restitution on the general principle that the original owners were entitled to all recaptured property this demand was laid before a council of officers which decided against its validity the general has submitted the case to congress for their final judgment it appears from a review of the proceedings of congress that a very defective provision only has been made for captures and no provision at all for recaptures on land the opinion of the council of war is conformable to the practice of the army in like cases and to the rules observed by other nations the demand of restitution in favor of the original proprietors is warranted by the principles of equity and the spirit of the ordinance relating to captures on water all that congress can do in the case will be to remit to the original owners the prize which has been adjudged to the u s but some general provision for future cases will be necessary in which it will be not easy to define the species of property of which restitution may be claimed to extend the rule to every species of property would open a door to innumerable disputes and abuses i observed on this occasion what had escaped me before that if congress should establish a court for captures on land such cases can come before it on appeal letters from franklin and jay dated late in september shew that a commission has been issued to oswald to treat with commissioners of the thirteen u states by which some

several districts on a like or any other equalizing principle note in ms   mr hamilton told mr madison privately that m de marbois speaking of the treaty asked him emphatically whether there were not some articles which required ammadversion mr h did not at the time know what was alluded to he now supposed the allusion to be to some article supposed to be inconsistent with the treaty with france

timidity it appears that the annual revenue which prudence calls for for the objects above mentioned amounts to the enormous sum of three millions of dollars you will ask perhaps from what sources this revenue could be drawn if the states were willing to establish it congress have done nothing as yet from which the answer they wd dictate can be informed by individuals on the floor the imposts a land or poll tax a tax on salt a c have been suggested and some computation of their productiveness has made them competent to the object the valuation of the land accordg to the articles of confederation is also before congress  by some considered as a great step towards obtaining the necessary revenue if you ask by what operation i shall be more incapable of answering it than the

the interest only it called attention to the fact that the five per cent impost was recommended february        but after a delay of two years congress had the mortification to find that one state rhode island entirely refused to agree to it and that another virginia had withdrawn its assent and a third georgia had taken no action that congress had been unable to fulfill its engagements with the public creditors because of the defective compliances by the states at every stage of the war for the year      it said congress had asked  000000 and had been supplied by the states with only   00   the king of france had lent the united states  000000 livres and john adams had opened a loan in holland and obtained only  000000 livres making in all  000000 livres which after deducting

discussions which have taken place we seem only to have gone round in a circle to the point at which we set out the only point on which congress are generally agreed is that something ought to be attempted but what that something ought to be is a theorem not solved alike by scarcely any two members and yet a solution of it seems to be made an indispensable preliminary to other essays for the public relief the deputation from the army is waiting the upshot of all these delays  dilemmas when i mentioned to you the subject of your conversation with dr mcclurg i ought to have added that one reason which influenced the resig—of mr livingston was an expence experienced of three thousand dollars beyond the salary i wish this circumstance not to be withheld as it must be material in the case

uncertain a poll tax seems to be the only one sufficiently simple  equal for the purpose and besides other objections to which even that is liable the constitution of maryland which interdicts such a tax is an insuperable bar the plan talked of by some for supplying the deficiency is to call on the states to provide each its proportion of a permanent revenue within itself and to appropriate it to the continental debt the objections against this plan are that as the execution of it will depend on a unanimous  continued punctuality in the    states it is a precarious basis for public credit that this precariousness will be increased by mutual jealousies among the states that others may be sparing themselves exertions which they are submitting to and that these jealousies will be still more increased by the mutual opinion which prevails that they are comparatively in advance to the u states an opinion which cannot be corrected without closing the accounts between all of them  the u states prerequisites to which are a valuation of the land and a final discrimination of such parts of the separate expenditures of the states as ought to be transferred to the common mass from such parts as ought in justice to fall on the particular states themselves some states also will contend and it would seem neither agst the principles of justice nor the spirit of the confederation for a retrospective abatement of their share of the past debt according to their respective disabilities from year to year throughout the war what will be the end of this complication of embarrassments time

the influence of general washington is rapidly decreasing in the army insomuch that it is even in contemplation to substitute some less scrupulous guardian of their interests there are a variety of rumors concerning peace but none of them of sufficient authority to be particularized the speech of the king of g b to his parliament and the letter to the lord mayor of london from secy townsend as it is stated are the only respectable evidence yet recd there are also rumors on the adverse side which have still less the complexion of authenticity a quantity of clothing on its passage through

the measures which may be pursued by congress  the several states within the ensuing period of   months whether prosperity  tranquility or confusion and disunion are to be the fruits of the revolution the seeds of the latter are so thickly sown that nothing but the most enlightened and liberal policy will be able to stifle them the eastern states particularly massachusetts conceive that compared with the southern they are greatly in advance in the general account a respectable delegate from massachusetts a few days ago being a little chafed by some expressions of messrs lee  mercer unfavorable to loanoffice creditors said that if justice was not to be obtained thro general confederacy the sooner it was known the better that some states might be forming other confederacies adequate to the purpose adding that some had suffered immensely from the want of a proportional compliance with demands for men  money by others however erroneous these ideas may be do they not merit serious attention unless some amicable  adequate arrangements be speedily taken for adjusting all the subsisting accounts and discharging the public engagements a dissolution of the union will be inevitable will not in that event the southern states which at sea will be opulent  weak be an easy prey to the eastern which will be powerful  rapacious and particularly if supposed claims of justice

according to the journal iv     the address to the states was agreed to april      address to the states to accompany the recommendations of the   th the prospect which has for some time existed and which is now happily realized of a successful termination of the war together with the critical exigencies of public affairs have made it the duty of congress to review and provide for the debts which the war has left upon the united states and to look forward to the means of obviating dangers which may interrupt the harmony and tranquillity of the confederacy the result of their mature  solemn deliberations on these great objects is contained in their several recommendations of the   th instant herewith transmitted although these recommendations speak themselves the principles on which they are founded as well as the ends which they propose it will not be improper to enter into a few explanations and remarks in order to place in a stronger view the necessity of complying with them the first measure recommended is effectual provision for the debts of the united states the amount of these debts as far as they can now be ascertained is fortytwo millions three hundred and seventyfive dollars as will appear by the schedule n   to discharge the principle of this aggregate debt at once or in any short period is evidently not within the compass of our resources and even if it could be accomplished the ease of the community would require that the debt itself should be left to a course of gradual extinguishment and certain funds be provided for paying in the meantime the annual interest the amount of the annual interest as will appear by the paper last referred to is computed to be two millions four hundred and fifteen thousand nine hundred and fiftysix dollars funds therefore which will certainly  punctually produce this annual sum at least must be provided in devising these funds congress did not overlook the mode of supplying the common treasury provided by the articles of confederation but after the most respectful consideration of that mode they were constrained to regard it as inadequate  inapplicable to the form into which the public debt must be thrown the delays  uncertainties incident to a revenue to be established  collected from time to time by thirteen independent authorities is at first view irreconcilable with the punctuality essential in the discharge of the interest of a national debt our own experience after making every allowance for transient impediments has been a sufficient illustration of this truth some departure therefore in the recommendation of congress from the federal constitution was unavoidable but it will be found to be as small as could be reconciled with the object in view and to be supported besides by solid considerations of interest and sound policy the fund which first presented itself on this as it did on a former occasion was a tax on imports the reasons which recommended this branch of revenue have heretofore been stated in an act of which a copy n   is now forwarded  need not be here repeated it will suffice to recapitulate that taxes on consumption are always least burdensome because they are least felt and are borne too by those who are both willing and able to pay them that of all taxes on consumption those on foreign commerce are most compatible with the genius and policy of free states that from the relative positions of some of the more commercial states it will be impossible to bring this essential resource into use without a concerted uniformity that this uniformity cannot be concerted through any channel so properly as through congress nor for any purpose so aptly as for paying the debts of a revolution from which an unbounded freedom has accrued to commerce in renewing this proposition to the states we have not been unmindful of the objections which heretofore frustrated the unanimous adoption of it we have limited the duration of the revenue to the term of twenty five years and we have left to the states themselves the appointment of the officers who are to collect it if the strict maxims of national credit alone were to be consulted the revenue ought manifestly to be coexistent with the object of it and the collection placed in every respect under that authority which is to dispense the former and is responsible for the latter these relaxations will we trust be regarded on one hand as the effect of a disposition in congress to attend at all times to the sentiments of those whom they serve and on the other hand as a proof of their anxious desire that provision may be made in some way or other for an honorable and just fulfilment of the engagements which they have formed to render this fund as productive as possible and at the same time to narrow the room for collusions and frauds it has been judged an improvement of the plan to recommend a liberal duty on such articles as are most susceptible of a tax according to their quantity and are of most equal and general consumption leaving all other articles as heretofore proposed to be taxed according to their value the amount of this fund is computed to be        dollars the estimates on which the computation is made are detailed in paper no   accuracy in the first essay on so complex and fluctuating a subject is not to be expected it is presumed to be as near the truth as the defect of proper materials would admit the residue of the computed interest is   00000 dollars  is referred to the states to be provided for by such funds as they may judge most convenient here again the strict maxims of public credit gave way to the desire of congress to conform to the sentiments of their constituents it ought not to be omitted however with respect to this portion of the revenue that the mode in which it is to be supplied varies so little from that pointed out in the articles of confederation and the variations are so conducive to the great object proposed that a ready  unqualified compliance on the part of the states may be the more justly expected in fixing the quotas of this sum congress as may be well imagined were guided by very imperfect lights and some inequalities may consequently have ensued these however can be but temporary and as far as they may exist at all will be redressed by a retrospective adjustment as soon as a constitutional rule can be applied the necessity of making the two foregoing provisions one indivisible  irrevocable act is apparent without the first quality partial provision only might be made where complete provision is essential nay as some states might prefer and adopt one of the funds only and the other states the other fund only it might happen that no provision at all would be made without the second a single state out of the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bankruptcy the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar to the establishment of national credit instead of enlarging on these topics two observations are submitted to the justice and wisdom of the legislatures first the present creditors or rather the domestic part of them having either made their loans for a period which has expired or having become creditors in the first instance involuntarily are entitled on the clear principles of justice and good faith to demand the principal of their credits instead of accepting the annual interest it is necessary therefore as the principal cannot be paid to them on demand that the interest should be so effectually  satisfactorily secured as to enable them if they incline to transfer the stock at its full value secondly if the funds be so firmly constituted as to inspire a thorough  universal confidence may it not be hoped that the capital of the domestic debt which bears the high interest of   per cent may be cancelled by other loans obtained at a more moderate interest the saving by such an operation would be a clear one and might be a considerable one as a proof of the necessity of substantial funds for the support of our credit abroad we refer to paper n   thus much for the interest of the national debt for the discharge of the principal within the term limited we rely on the natural increase of the revenue from commerce on requisitions to be made from time to time for that purpose as circumstances may dictate and on the prospect of vacant territory if these resources should prove inadequate it will be necessary at the expiration of    years to continue the funds now recommended or to establish such others as may then be found more convenient with a view to the resource last mentioned as well as to obviate disagreeable controversies and confusions congress have included in their present recommendations a renewal of those of the   day of septr and of the  0 day of october    0 in both these respects a liberal and final accommodation of all interfering claims of vacant territory is an object which cannot be pressed with too much solicitude the last object recommended is a constitutional change of the rule by which a partition of the common burthens is to be made the expediency and even necessity of such a change has been sufficiently enforced by the local injustice and discontents which have proceeded from valuations of the soil in every state where the experiment has been made but how infinitely must these evils be increased on a comparison of such valuations among the states themselves on whatever side indeed this rule be surveyed the execution of it must be attended with the most serious difficulties if the valuations be referred to the authorities of the several states a general satisfaction is not to be hoped for if they be executed by officers of the united states traversing the country for that purpose besides the inequalities against which this mode would be no security the expense would be both enormous and obnoxious if the mode taken in the act of the   th day of february last which was deemed on the whole least objectionable be adhered to still the insufficiency of the data to the purpose to which they are to be applied must greatly impair if not utterly destroy all confidence in the accuracy of the result not to mention that as far as the result can be at all a just one it will be indebted for the advantage to the principle on which the rule proposed to be substituted is founded this rule although not free from objections is liable to fewer than any other that could be devised the only material difficulty which attended it in the deliberations of congress was to fix the proper difference between the labour and industry of free inhabitants and of all other inhabitants the ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual concessions and if it should be supposed not to correspond precisely with the fact no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal spirit of accommodation among the several legislatures will prevail against little inequalities which may be calculated on one side or on the other but notwithstanding the confidence of congress as to the success of this proposition it is their duty to recollect that the event may possibly disappoint them and to request that measures may still be pursued for obtaining and transmitting the information called for in the act of the    of february last which in such event will be essential the plan thus communicated  explained by congress must now receive its fate from their constituents all the objects comprised in it are conceived to be of great importance to the happiness of this confederated republic are necessary to render the fruits of the revolution a full reward for the blood the toils the cares and the calamities which have purchased it but the object of which the necessity will be peculiarly felt and which it is peculiarly the duty of congress to inculcate is the provision recommended for the national debt although this debt is greater than could have been wished it is still less on the whole than could have been expected and when referred to the cause in which it has been incurred and compared with the burthens which wars of ambition and of vain glory have entailed on other nations ought to be borne not only with cheerfulness but with pride but the magnitude of the debt makes no part of the question it is sufficient that the debt has been fairly contracted and that justice and good faith demand that it should be fully discharged congress had no option but between different modes of discharging it the same option is the only one that can exist with the states the mode which has after long and elaborate discussion been preferred is we are persuaded the least objectionable of any that would have been equal to the purpose under this persuasion we call upon the justice and plighted faith of the several states to give it its proper effect to reflect on the consequences of rejecting it and to remember that congress will not be answerable for them if other motives than that of justice could be requisite on this occasion no nation could ever feel stronger for to whom are the debts to be paid to an ally in the first place who to the exertion of his arms in support of our cause has added the succours of his treasure who to his important loans has added liberal donations and whose loans themselves carry the impression of his magnanimity and friendship for more exact information on this point we refer to paper no   to individuals in a foreign country in the next place who were the first to give so precious a token of their confidence in our justice  of their friendship for our cause and who are members of a republic which was second in espousing our rank among nations for the claims and expectations of this class of creditors we refer to paper no   another class of creditors is that illustrious  patriotic band of fellowcitizens whose blood and whose bravery have defended the liberties of their country who have patiently borne among other distresses the privation of their stipends whilst the distresses of their country disabled it from bestowing them and who even now ask for no more than such a portion of their dues as will enable them to retire from the field of victory and glory into the bosom of peace and private citizenship and for such effectual security for the residue of their claims as their country is now unquestionably able to provide for a full view of their sentiments  wishes on this subject we transmit the paper n   and as a fresh  lively instance of their superiority to every species of seduction from the paths of virtue and of honor we add the paper no   the remaining class of creditors is composed partly of such of our fellow citizens as originally lent to the public the use of their funds or have since manifested most confidence in their country by receiving transfers from the lenders and partly of those whose property has been either advanced or assumed for the public service to discriminate the merits of these several descriptions of creditors would be a task equally unnecessary  invidious if the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favour of some than of others the voice of policy no less than of justice pleads in favour of all a wise nation will never permit those who relieve the wants of their country or who rely most on its faith its firmness and its resources when either of them is distrusted to suffer by the event let it be remembered finally that it has ever been the pride and boast of america that the rights for which she contended were the rights of human nature by the blessing of the author of these rights on the means exerted for their defence they have prevailed against all opposition and form the basis of thirteen independent states no instance has heretofore occurred nor can any instance be expected hereafter to occur in which the unadulterated forms of republican government can pretend to so fair an opportunity of justifying themselves by their fruits in this view the citizens of the united states are responsible for the greatest trust ever confided to a political society if justice good faith honor gratitude and all the other qualities which enoble the character of a nation  fulfil the ends of government be the fruits of our establishments the cause of liberty will acquire a dignity and lustre which it has never yet enjoyed and an example will be set which cannot but have the most favourable influence on the rights of mankind if on the other side our governments should be unfortunately blotted with the reverse of these cardinal and essential virtues the great cause which we have engaged to vindicate will be dishonored and betrayed the last and fairest experiment in favor of the rights of human nature will be turned against them

that it may be obtained without such a cession as to the second that it concerns the eastern states chiefly  as to the third that it concerns them alone whilst the privilege to be conceded will

reception given to the propositions of congress by the assembly i foresaw some of the topics which are employed against them  i dread their effect from the eloquent mouths which will probably enforce them but i do not despair until those who oppose the plan can substitute some other equally consistent with public justice  honor and more conformable to the doctrines of the confederation all those who love justice and aim at the public good will be advocates for the plan the greatest danger is to be apprehended from the difficulty of making the latter class sensible of the impracticability or incompetency of any plan short of the one recommended the arguments necessary for that purpose being drawn from a general survey of the federal system and not from the interior polity of the states singly the letter from the delegation by the last post to the govr appr the legislature thro him that negotiations for a treaty of commerce with g b might be expected soon to take place and that if any instructions should be deemed proper no time ought to be lost in giving the subject a legislative discussion for my own part i wish sincerely that the commercial interests of virginia were thoroughly investigated  the final sense of the state expressed to its representatives in congress the power of forming treaties of commerce with foreign nations is among the most delicate with which congs are entrusted and ought to be exercised with all possible circumspection whilst an influence might be expected from them on the event or duration of the war the public interest required that they should be courted with all the respectable nations of europe and that nice calculations of their tendency should be dismissed the attainment of the object of the war has happily reversed our situation and we ought no longer to enslave ourselves to the policy of the moment the state of this country in relation to the countries of europe it ought to be observed will be continually changing and regulations adapted to its commercial  general interests at present may hereafter be directly opposed to them the general policy of america is at present pointed at the encouragement of agriculture and the importation of the objects of consumption the wider therefore our ports are opened and the more extensive the privileges of all competitors in our commerce the more likely we shall be to buy at cheap  sell at profitable rates but in proportion as our lands become settled and spare hands for manufactures  navigation multiply it may become our policy to favor those objects by peculiar privileges bestowed on our citizens or at least to introduce regulations not inconsistent with foreign engagements suited to the present state of things the relative situation of the different states in this respect is another motive to circumspection the variance of their policy  interests in the article of commerce strikes the first view and it may with great truth be noted that as far as any concessions may be stipulated in favor of foreign nations they will chiefly be at the expense of those states which will share least in the compensations obtained for them if for example restrictions be laid on the legislative rights of the states to prohibit to regulate or to tax as they please their imports  exports  to give such preferences as they please to the persons or vessels employed in them it is evident that such restrictions will be most felt by those states who have the greatest interest in exports  imports if on the other side the citizens of the u s should in return for such a stipulation be allowed to navigate  carry in forbidden channels is it not equally evident that the benefit must fall to the share of those states which export  consume least and abound most in resources of ships  seamen nor should it be overlooked that as uniform regulations of the commerce of the different states will so differently affect their several interests such regulations must be a strong temptation to measures in the aggrieved states which may first involve the whole confederacy in controversies with foreign nations and then in contests with one another i may safely suggest also to your ear that a variety of circumstances make it proper to recollect that permanent engagements entered into by the confederacy with foreign powers may survive the confederacy itself that a question must then arise how far such engagements formed by the states in their federal character are binding on each of them separately and that they may become pretexts for quarrels with particular states very inconvenient to the latter or for a general intrusion into american disputes on the other hand candor suggests that foreign connections if founded on principles equally corresponding with the policy  interests of the several states might be a new bond to the federal compact upon these considerations i think it would be advisable to form all our commercial treaties in future with great deliberation to limit their duration to moderate periods  to restrain our ministers from acceding finally to them till they have previously transmitted them in the terms adjusted for the revision and express sanction of congress in a treaty of commerce with g b it may be the policy of virga in particular to reserve her right as unfettered as possible over her own commerce the monopoly which formerly tyrannized over it has left wounds which are not yet healed  the numerous debts due from the people  which by the provisional articles they are immediately liable for may possibly be made instruments for reestablishing their dependence it cannot therefore be for the interest of the state to preclude it from any regulations which experience may recommend for its thorough emancipation it is possible that experience may never recommend an exercise of this right nor do my own sentiments favor in general any restrictions or preferences in matters of commerce but those who succeed us will have an equal claim to judge for themselves and will have further lights to direct their judgments nor ought the example of old  intelligent nations to be too far or too hastily condemned by an infant and inexperienced one that of g b is in the science of commerce particularly worthy of our attention and did she not originally redeem the management of her commerce from the monopoly of the hanse towns by peculiar exemptions to her own subjects did she not dispossess the dutch by a like policy and does she not still make a preference of her own vessels and her own mariners the basis of her maritime power if holland has followed a different system the reason is plain her object is not to exclude rivals from her own navigation but to insinuate herself into that of other nations the leading objects in the proposed treaty with g b are   a direct commerce with the w indies   the carrying trade between the different parts of her dominions   a like trade between these  other parts of the world in return for these objects we have nothing to offer of which we could well deprive her but to secure to her subjects an entire equality of privileges with our own citizens with regard to the   object it may be observed that both the temper  the interest of the nation leave us little ground to apprehend an exclusion from it the french have so much the advantage of them from the facility of raising food as well as the other produce of their islands that the english will be under the necessity of admitting supplies from the u s into their islands and they surely will prefer paying for them in commodities to paying for them in cash with regard to the  nd   d objects it may be observed that altho they present great advantages they present them only to those states which abound in maritime resources lastly with regard to the concession to be made on the part of the u s it may be observed that it will affect chiefly if not solely those states which will share least in the advantages purchased by it so striking indeed does this contrast appear that it may with certainty be inferred that if g b were negotiating a treaty with the former states only she would reject a mutual communication of the privileges of natives nor is it clear that her apprehensions on this side will not yet lead her to reject such a stipulation with the whole

that though congress approve the principles of the armed neutrality founded on the liberal basis of a maintenance of the rights of neutral nations and of the privileges of commerce yet they are unwilling at this juncture to become a party to a confederacy which may hereafter too far complicate the interests of the united states with the politicks of europe and therefore if such a progress is

of the   of sepr   0 of octr    0 i take it for granted you have the journals the expunging of the article relative to state expenses was a subject of no less regret with me than it is with you  for the same reason but i acknowledge that considering the probable defect of vouchers in virga and the ardor with which the clause was supported from some other quarters mine was much diminished in the course of the discussion on the last trial there were but two or three states besides virga that favored it s carolinas opposition to it had great weight after this clause was expunged it was thought improper to retain the connective clause as virga will now be at liberty to confine her accession to the revenue part of the plan without enlarging her territorial cession or being deprived of the opportunity of annexing any condition she may think fit the connective clause however could not have been carried i believe either before or after the mutilation of the plan notwithstanding this disappointment i adhere to my wishes not only that the revenue may be established but that the federal rule of dividing the burdens may be changed and the territorial disputes accommodated the more i revolve the latter subject the less inducement i can discover to pertinacity on the part of virga and the more interesting it appears to the union i am sorry your departure from richmond became

pulse of the assembly with regard to it the example of virga will have great  perhaps decisive influence on the event of it in rhode island they are attacking it in the newspapers before it has appeared but that state is swayed by a party which has raised  connected its importance with an opposition to every contl measure the bulk of the people are taken in by a belief that if no general impost on trade be levied their state will be able to tax the neighboring states at pleasure should all the other states unite heartily in the plan i do not think any single state will take upon itself the odium  the consequences of persevering in a veto upon it i wish much to know how far your hope was well founded of an introduction of mr jefferson into the legislature the hopes of some i

the general arrangement of the foreign system has been suspended by the thinness of congress in part and partly by the desire of further information from europe i fear much the delay will be

the instruction relative to comercial treaties the principle on which it is founded corresponds precisely with my idea but i know not how far the giving an opportunity to the states of exercising their judgments on proposed treaties will correspond in all cases with the doctrine of the confederation which provides for secrecy in some such cases the deviation however if there be any is trivial and not being an intended one can have no ill consequences no progress has been made towards a treaty with g b owing partly to a desire of hearing further from europe  partly to the paucity of states represented in congs it would seem that the plan of regulating the trade with america by a parliamentary act has been exchanged by the present ministry for an intended treaty for that purpose mr laurens was asked by mr fox whether the american ministers had powers for a commercial treaty his answer was that he believed so that a revocation of mr adamss powers had appeared some time ago in print but he considered the publication as spurious from this it wd seem that this act of cong had never been communicated by the latter to his colleagues he lately complained of the revocation in a very singular letter to congr i consider it as a very fortunate circumstance that this business is still within our controul especially as the policy of authorizing conditional treaties only in europe is so fully espoused by virginia    the offers of n y  maryld of a seat for congs are postponed till ocr next in order to give time for other offers  for knowing the sense of the states on the subject copies of those acts are to be sent to the executives of each state    congress have resumed at length the cession of virga the old obnoxious report was committed and a new report has been made which i think a fit basis for a compromise a copy of it is inclosed for the govr i have also transcribed it in my letter to mr jones as it tacitly excludes the pretensions of the companies i fear obstacles may arise in congs from that quarter clarke from n jersey informed congs that the delegates from that state being fettered by instructions must communicate the plan to their constituents if no other causes of delay should arise the thinness of congs at present will prove a material one i am at some loss for ye policy of the companies in opposing a compromise with virga they can never hope for a specific restitution of their claims they can never even hope for a cession of the country between the alleghany  the ohio by virga as little can they hope for an extension of a jurisdiction of congs over it by force i should suppose therefore that it wd be their truest interest to promote a general cession of the vacant country to congress and in case the titles of which they have been stripped

articles of confederation the military power of congress in time of peace appears to be at least subject to be called in question if congress put a construction on them favorable to their own power or even if they ask the states to sanction the exercise of the power the present paroxysm of jealousy may not only disappoint them but may exert itself with more fatal effect on the revenue propositions on the other side to renounce such a construction and refer the establishment to the separate  internal provision of the states will not only render the plan of defence either defective in a general view or oppressive to particular states but may hereafter when the tide of prejudice may be flowing in a contrary direction expose them to the reproach of unnecessarily throwing away a power necessary for the good of the union and leaving the whole at the mercy of a single state the only expedient for this dilemma seems to be delay but even that is pregnant with difficulties equally great since on
