duplicity a comedy as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by thomas holcroft  london printed for g robinson paternoster row  m dcc lxxxi  to thomas harris esquire this comedy is inscribed as a public acknowledgement of the advantages it received from his great attention and taste as a critic  by his most obedient humble servant thomas holcroft  preface since it is the fate of dramatic works to undergo a much more severe scrutiny than any other of the efforts of the mind authors in this predicament are justifiable in taking every opportunity of speaking in their own behalf and the egotism should be and is by the candid readily forgiven them the applauses bestowed upon duplicity in the theater have equalled my fondest hopes and selflove itself cannot accuse the auditors of ingratitude or want of penetration but though there are scenes happy enough to have given universal satisfaction there are others that have been called vulgarities damned stuff and by other concise and summary epithets which men accustomed to decide without deigning to reason have invented and appropriated to their own proper use i do not mean to affirm there is no truth in these remarks i am perhaps the person least qualified of any to pronounce with safety on the merits or demerits of the work fathers who are the most free from prejudice cannot see those defects in their offspring which are obvious to others in the rapidity of composition blemishes are suffered to escape through a laudable attention to things of greater importance and like an ugly face presently become too familiar to be disgusting it is for this reason dangerous to commit any thing to paper which the judgment at the first perception condemns a work of any consequence is read and reconsidered so repeatedly that the ideas at last lose both novelty and force and the writer is disgusted to find those things which when first conceived gave him so much pleasure become vapid and assume the appearance of common place for these reasons i say it would be arrogant in me to speak decidedly i can only allege what were my original motives for writing as i have done  the english comic drama has long been renowned for humor and when about fourteen years ago the french comedy larmoyante or as we call it sentimental comedy was introduced the complaint was that we had lost all the spirit of our old writers and were dwindled into mere translators the town was in this temper when dr goldsiniths comedy of she stoops to conquer was produced in which humor alone seems to be the chief intention of the author and which gave a fatal blow to mere sentimental dialogue the success of this piece rouzed later writers from the soft slumbers of the heart and wit and humor became commodities in great request the road to fame though difficult was obvious and it would have been unpardonable for a young traveller at his first outset so far to have mistaken as not to have attempted it the difficulties and dangers have increased however in a vast proportion i need only mention the school for scandal and every discerning critic will immediately recollect how and why  in the comedy of duplicity the squire and his sister are characters that in their own nature cannot admit of delicate strokes and if i have erred it is not i believe so much in the coloring as in the choice of my subject an author in his first attempt is seldom impressed with that awe for the public which is requisite but ventures many things that perhaps have their excellencies in reading but that appear rude abrupt or indelicate when pronounced before a large assembly were the humor of smollet which never fails to excite laughter in the closet spoken upon the stage it would frequently excite universal disgust characters of broad humor are become peculiarly hazardous because they are become far less frequent a sense of propriety spreads in proportion as people read and reading is an infallible consequence of riches this produced duces delicate sensations in those who have acquired such a strict sense of propriety and they are offended when they see things represented on the stage which they suppose do not exist in real life though there are a thousand living characters a thousand incidents at which if exhibited an audience would revolt merely on the score of improbability  whatever the execution may have been the intention of this comedy is of a far nobler nature than the mere incitement of risibility the vice it pretends to correct is become truly enormous and i would rather have the merit of driving one man from the gamingtable than of making a whole theater merry  i have likewise been accused by some of imitation and want of originality it is said i have stolen an incident from one piece and a character from another and that it is evidently the play of a player this last remark i believe would never have been made had i not been known to be a player the accusations which have the greatest appearance of truth are that le dissipateur of monsieur destouches and the tragedy of the gamester have furnished the great outlines of the plot to these i answer that were it so i would make no scruple of avowing it because i should not think myself degraded by the avowal but i declare the plot was finished and almost the comedy before i ever read le dissipateur and if i have pillaged the gamester it was from latent ideas of which i am unconscious for i have neither read nor seen the gamester for many years a parallel circumstance to that of sir harry losing his sisters fortune is found i am told in the gamester but this incident was added to duplicity since it was first written by the advice of a friend to give a strength to the denoument but there is a story told in the life of beau nash which had these critics known would have immediately pointed out the place whence they might have sworn without the least suspicion of perjury i had stolen my plot and yet had they sworn they would have been perjured for i never read that story till i had written my play and then i confess i was amazed at the similarity  however i repeat had i taken my plot from any play or story i should have made no scruple to confess it because i think it no disgrace the first of all poets invented none of his plots i shall never be the second and yet i affirm i did invent mine that is as far as i myself am conscious the elegant bishop hurd in his discourse on poetical imitation has the following remark among many others which is applicable to the present occasion the objects of imitation like the materials of human knowledge are a common stock which experience furnishes to all men and it is in the operations of the mind upon them that the glory of poetry as of science consists here the genius of the poet has room to show itself and from hence alone is the praise of originality to be ascertained  the comedy is now committed to the impartial judgment of the true critic and i have only to wish it may receive as favorable a sentence from him as it has already experienced from the voice of an indulgent public  prologue written by mr nicholson and spoken by mr leelewes rash was

wilson melissamrs inchbald mrs tripmrs pit duplicity act i scene i sir harry portlands house enter clara and melissa clara well my dear melissa you will be a happy woman   melissa i have no doubt of it the attention which mr osborne has shown me was not that of a man eager to gain the affection of his mistress by humouring her caprices praising her beauty and flattering her follies he is obliging and wellbred but sincere yet his disapprobation is delivered with a delicacy that makes it more agreeable than some peoples compliments   clara if time instead of mellowing the strokes should wear away this smooth varnish and discover a harsh outline should you not be offended at the severity of his manner think you   melissa believe me dear clara there is no danger for if there be one man on earth more capable of making a woman happy than another it is mr osborne   clara it would be heresy in you my dear to hold any other opinion and i have no doubt but you will continue orthodox after marriage   melissa yes  i shall certainly die in that faith   clara your brother sir harry i believe is of your religion too   melissa entirely  the friendship of mr osborne and my brother is as sincere as the commencement of it was remarkable  have you ever heard their story   clara never you know my acquaintance with your family is but just begun but i hope you will not think them words of course when i assure you that short as it is i feel myself interested in its happiness   melissa oh i am sure you are sincere  i know it by sympathy  well then i will tell you  harry and osborne happened to be both abroad at the same time as my brother was going to italy and passing through the mountainous part of savoy he came to a hollow way among the rocks surrounded by trees and caverns all on a sudden at a turning in the road he beheld osborne and his servants attacked by six banditti and ready to sink under their wounds   clara was sir harry alone   alarmed melissa he had his governor two servants and the postillion  my brother instantly leaped from his carriage snatched up his sword and pistols andflew to the place of action   clara i declare you terrify me   melissa he was not seen by the combatants and took care to advance so near before he fired that he could not fail to do execution  he laid two of the banditti dead and their companions who had discharged their firearms and beheld sir harrys people running to the attack and levelling their pieces fled   clara thank you for that my dear  you have given me breath   melissa the intrepidity with which sir harry saw osborne defend himself and the fortitude he discovered when he was informed as it was at first believed that his wounds were mortal attached my brother so powerfully to him that he resolved not to leave him in the hands of strangers but anxiously waited while he was under cure   clara this was a noble generosity   melissa it was and osborne was so sensible of it that though he was going the other way he would return with sir harry into italy and their friendship has continued ever since   clara but is it not strange my dear that he cannot detach his friend sir harry from the gamingtable   melissa my brother is insatuated  it is his greatest almost his only weakness   clara but the report is that mr osborne takes advantage of this weakness that while he publicly satirizes the practice he privately benefits by his superior address and in fact has half ruined sir harry himself   melissa the report of malice my dear   enter sir harry portland and mr osborne sir harry ladies your obedient  pray when did you arrive in town madam   to clara clara yesterday  but how came you to quit bath so suddenly gentlemen i understood you intended to stay another week and you were gone before me   sir harry mr osborne madam was horriblement ennuye  dull as an alderman at church or a fat lapdog after dinner  thinking on marriage melissa and other momentous matters and so    osborne come come sir harry this is mighty ingenious but you were at least as willing to be gone as myself  the truth madam is my modest friend here heard you were to set off in a day or two and from that moment was continually giving hints and asking me how i as a lover could exist so long without a sight of my mistress and in short began all at once to talk so sympathetically about absence and ages that i who had made the excursion purely to oblige him was i acknowledge exceedingly happy to find i could oblige him by returning   clara what say you to this sir harry  but i know your politeness  you will confess it all to be true and begin to say civil things upon the subject that will only put me to the trouble of blushing and curtsying so well suppose them all if you please  but come tell me  what is the news of the day   melissa news oh that is true  look here my dear  i thought i had something to tell you   reads a paragraph in a newspaper  we hear from very good authority that a hymeneal treaty is concluded between a certain beautiful ward not a mile from st jamess square and her old guardian and that the lady is expected in town from bath every hour to sign and seal   sir harry what say you to this madam   clara say i protest i dont know what to say  except that these newsmakers are a very pleasant ingenious kind of people   melissa but ant you angry   clara angry no indeed i am sure i am very much obliged to them for thinking of me  i shall be so stared at  i will go into public continually and my guardian shall go with me   melissa but is there any foundation for this report my dear   clara nay i am sure i cannot tell there may be for aught i know  i have suspected the matter a great while you must know by my guardians simpering and squeezing my hand so often  then he is continually talking about methuselah and the antediluvians and making systems to convince me how much stronger and longer lived some men are than others  he read the other day in the annual register of a man at inverness who lived to the age of one hundred and seventeen and he has been talking ever since of purchasing a country seat in the highlands   sir harry that would be pleasant   clara very  then we should have a flock of goats i suppose   sir harry dorastus and faunia   clara oh yes  quite in the damon and philida way   osborne you are very happy in a lover madam   clara exceedingly  quite proud of my conquest  there is no such great miracle in bringing a young fellow whose passions are all afloat to die at ones feet  the things so natural that one does it every day  but to thaw the icy blood of a grave old gentleman to see him simper sigh dance minuets and look ridiculous for one  oh there is positively no flattery equal to it   sir harry he will make your winter evenings in the highlands quite entertaining with relating the wild pranks he committed and the deeds of prowess he was guilty of in his youth  then you will be so delighted with listening to his raptures and tasting his panada and    clara oh yes  yes yes  ha ha  i  i think i see him now with his venerable bald head his shrivelled face and his little pug nose that looks as red and as bright as the best dutch sealingwax rising from his chair by the help of his crutchheaded stick to breathe forth vows of love and everlasting fidelity  ha ha ha   melissa it is whimsical enough   clara yes  oh now you talk of whimsical i was accosted by an old gentleman the night before i left bath in the rooms who was the drollest being and had the most agreeable kind of whimsicallity about him i ever met with  i thought he would have made love to me  swore i was an angel and said a thousand civil things  quite galant   osborne oh madam the old men are the only polite men of this age   clara upon my word i begin to think so   osborne the young ones taught in the modern school hold a rude familiarity to be the first principle of good breeding   clara manners like point ruffles are now most fashionable when they are soiled   sir harry no no  they only hang the easier for being deprived of starch  but who was this old gentleman pray madam   clara a relation of yours sir   sir harry of mine madam   clara i should suppose so for he mentioned his nephew sir harry portland   melissa our uncle sir hornet armstrong   sir harry it is  i found a letter from him when i came to town in which he informed me he should arrive in bath the very day we left it   enter servant sir harry who brought this   servant it came by the post sir   exit servant  sir harry reads the letter and seems surprised clara i die to be better acquainted with him  i must have him in my train of sighing swains   osborne you seem astonished sir harry   clara some unkind billet from his mistress i suppose   sir harry no indeed it is the most unaccountable epistle i ever received and from my unaccountable uncle too  there read read   to osborne osbone  reads  dear harry  you know you dog how your old uncle loves you  you will say so when you are thoroughly acquainted with the occasion of this  in brief  i met with a young lady at bath the most extraordinary take her all together i ever beheld  she is a nonpareil a phoenix  but you will judge for yourself  she is coming up to town with her brother who by the bye is a country booby  but that is no matter  i saw her only once and that was in the rooms but once is sufficient  they intended coming up to london by way of seeing the town for the are country people i find though the sister has more accomplishments ease and goodbreeding than i ever yet saw in the drawing room  i proposed a match to the brother and he seemed happy at the offer  they will arrive nearly as soon as this for they set out before it and i shall follow maugre the gout as fast as i can  hornet armstrong p s i forgot to mention their name is turnbull      turnbull why what in the devils name is sir hornet mad   sir harry in one of his right ancient whims i suppose  sir hornet has had many such in his time   melissa but pray who is this miraculous lady mr osborne for you seem to know something of her   osborne do you remember sir harry a gawky girl that stalked round the rooms and stared prodigiously  she that was stuck to the side of a bobwigd country squire   clara oh  what the  the wench with her arms dangling her chin projecting and her mouth open  dressed in the  red ribband tawdry style and that looked as if she were afraid of being lost   sir harry yes  or as if she durst not trust herself alone out of her own parish lest somebody should catch her put her in a sack and send her for a present to the king of the cannibals   osborne the same  that is the accomplished miss turnbull   sir harry how   osborne that is the easy wellbred drawingroom lady   sir harry is it possible   clara ha ha ha ha ha  well   with an affected gravity  and i dont doubt but she would make a sort of a  a  a very good wife  understands the arts of brewing baking pickling of pork curing of hung beef darning of stockings and other branches of housewifery in perfection   sir harry oh no doubt  is perfectly skilled too in the science of feeding the pigs   clara yes  and will make her own and her husbands linen and do all the needle work and quilting at home  believes in ghosts and has got the wandering prince of troy the babes in the wood and the entertaining dialogue of death and the lady by heart   osborne such and so numerous are the wifelike properties of miss barbara turnbull   clara turnbull too  well that is such a delightful name for a country lady  so pastoral   osborne the father was one of the greatest graziers in the west of england and was so intent on getting money that he bred his children in the most stupid ignorance  he is lately dead and the son has commenced gentleman and squire by virtue of the fathers industry and a pack of foxhounds and though he has scarce knowledge enough of articulate sounds to hold a dialogue with his own geese yet does he esteem himself a devilish shrewd fellow and a wit  his conversation is vociferous and patched up of proverbs and outoftheway sayings which he strings together without order or connection and utters upon all occasions and in all companies without respect to time place or person   clara well well sir harry i shall have to wish you joy soon i suppose  but i must be gone  fifty visits to make this morning  time flies  butagreeable company and all that you know  oh sir harry you mean to attend the spring meetings this year at newmarket  i am told you understand the turf  i think of sending a venture of five hundred by somebody  but i shall see you often enough before then  adieu   exeunt clara and melissa manent sir harry and osborne sir harry well what do you think of this lady osborne   osborne i think her a very amiable accomplished lady and one that under an assumed levity observes and understands every thing about her   sir harry i am entirely of your opinion  if i may judge from an acquaintance of such short date she is the first woman in the world   osborne except one sir harry   sir harry you osborne may make exceptions if you please  i am not so captious  she has beauty without vanity virtue without prudery fashion without affectation wit without malice gaiety without coquetry humor    osborne hold hold  stop to breathe  how was it vinegar without acid fire without heat light without shade motion without matter and a likeness without a feature   sir harry spite  by the gods  proud spite and burning envy   osborne but did you observe her newmarket hint sir harry and the concealed significance with which it was delivered   sir harry i did   osborne which being faithfully done into english bears this interpretation  i clara forrester a beautiful elegant sensible girl with a fine fortune should like to take you harry portland with youth spirit and certain et ceteras but    sir harry but that i am afraid of indulging a partiality for any man who is so intolerably addicted to gaming  is not that the conclusion of your speech   osborne oh fie no no gaming  that man has a body without a soul that never felt an inclination to gaming   sir harry perhaps so but that man has the greatest soul who can best resist that inclination   osborne pshaw gaming is the essence of fashion and one of your strongest recommendations  clara is a girl of spirit and what girl that comes under that description would ever place her affections on a sneaking sober prudent fellow  a mechanical scoundrel that knows the day of the month sips tea keeps a pew in the parish church writes memorandums and goes to bed at eleven oclock  poh absurd   sir harry curse me osborne if i know what to make of you  you are a riddle that i cannot expound you have such an awkward way of praising gaming that it always has the appearance of satire   osborne satire how so do you think i would satirize myself who sports more freely than i do   sir harry why there is the mystery  you are as eager to the full as i am  if i set an hundred on a back hand you offer a thousand nay had i the fortune of a nabob and were to stake it all you would be the first man to cry covered and be damned mad if any one wanted to go a guinea  not because you have not generosity but in the true and inveterate spirit of gaming   osborne certainly  gaming  why gaming is the best sal volatile for the spleen  it rouzes the spirits agitates the blood quickens the pulse and puts the whole nervous system in a continual vibration  no man ever yet died of an apoplexy that loved a box and dice   sir harry but they have died as suddenly   osborne oh ay ay but that is a fashionable disease an influenza that is to make your exit with eclat that is to go out of the world with a good report   sir harry true  true  and indeed as to a few years more or less that is in reality a mighty insignificant circumstance   osborne a bagatelle  let us live while we do live and die when we cannot live any longer   sir harry that is my comfort  that is my comfort  yes  yes  a pistol  a pistol is a very certain remedy for the cholic  nobody but a pitiful scoundrel would go sighing and whining and teizing other people with his griefs and complaints  when a man is weary what should he do but go to sleep   osborne to be sure  life itself is but a dream  it is only sleeping a little sounder   sir harry what live to be pitied  ha ha  a decayed gentleman no no no  a withered branch  a firelock without a flint  and yet  heigho  this clara  damn it  its provoking  youth  beauty  affability  she is a bewitching girl   osborne she is indeed   sir harry a lovely girl   osborne ay  enough so to make any man that might hope to be in her favor in love with life   sir harry any man any man  but me  no no  undone  undone  undone    osborne well but seriously since you have such bad success why dont you renounce play   sir harry it is too late  i have sunk eighty thousand  my resources almost all exhausted my estates all mortgaged to jews and scoundrels   osborne all   sir harry all except the estate in kent   osborne well then if you cannot content yourself with your present loss your best way will be to make another vigorous push   sir harry that is exactly what i am determined to do and unless the devil possesses the dice i think i may expect without a miracle that fortune should change hands   osborne one would think so indeed  will you dine then at my house there will be the chevalier the baron and the usual set  they have engaged to dine with me  they are spirited fellows and will play for any sum   sir harry i dont know  suspicion is a cursed meanness and yet i cannot help having my doubts of some among that company  nay had you not so often assured me you were perfectly acquainted with them all    osborne why i tell you again and again so i am  i will be answerable for their conduct and that is more than i would say for any other set of gamblers upon earth   sir harry well well  i will meet you there   osborne we dine early  at five   sir harry agreed   osborne and then  hey for a light heart and a heavy purse   exit osborne sir harry no no  no light heart for me  i am sunk  degraded in my own opinion  gaming alters our very nature  osborne used to hate it  he was then an openhearted generous fellow  he now appears to have contracted an insatiable love for money and a violent desire to win  he cares not of whom  of me as soon as another  were i in his situation and he in mine i think i should find an aversion to increase his distress  he knows mine yet has no such aversion  perhaps he thinks my ruin certain and that he may as well profit by it as another  i know him to have the most refined and strictest sense of honor  i have lost most of my money to him and in his company and therefore have not been duped out of it  that is some comfort however   exit scene ii enter mr osborne and timid osborne well mr timid has sir harry sent to you for a further supply   timid lackaday sir yes  and a very large supply too  he wants  000 l immediately  lackaday i asked him how he thought it possible for me to raise such sums as he called upon me for every day  reminded him what a bad way his affairs were in and what an usurious rate i was obliged to borrow all this money at   osborne what said he   timid lackaday  not much  seemed chagrined  said it must have an end one way or another soon and demanded whether i could or could not raise the money  lackaday  i told him i was no longer master of ways and means and he said then he must positively employ another prime minister for supplies he must have   osborne why did you tell him that go to him inform him you have met with a tenderhearted jew who knows nothing of the situation of his affairs that will lend him  0000 directly if he wants it   timid ten thousand  on what terms   osborne oh the mortgage of the kentish estate   timid the kentish estate  lackaday  but suppose he should go to gaming and lose it to somebody else instead of you   osborne oh i will take care of that   timid lackaday  it must not be benjamin solomons who lends this   osborne true  no  humph  isaac levi agent to a private company at amsterdam   timid writes in a pocketbook isaac levi agent to a private company at amsterdam  lackaday   osborne well  go you to him and inform him that the money shall be ready in about half an hour   timid lackaday  good young gentleman  heaven pardon me i had like to have said damn the dice  you will be a true friend   osborne be under no apprehensions  this old fool is become suspicious i must be sudden   aside timid had not we better inform him of all before he goes any further   osborne by no means  leave that to me   timid lackaday  well  the remembrance of a good deed is grateful on a deathbed   osborne do you be expeditious  i will instruct the jew and he shall meet you here   exit osborne timid heaven pardon me i had like to have said damn the jews    exit end of the first act act ii scene continues sir harry and melissa sir harry heavens what romance i can scarce believe my eyes  did you ever hear of so

for the jokes sake   vandervelt by dad turtle thou have hit it  as sure as can be that is it  it is for the jokes sake   sir harry impossible  the affair is too serious to be intentional caprice   melissa but i thought when i left you you were coming to an eclaircissement   sir harry coming to an eclaircissement  why i told them as plain as i could speak that no alliance whatever could take place between the families   melissa it is certain they have not understood you then   sir harry well there the matter must rest till i can find an interpreter for i cannot make myself more intelligible   clara and you have not had one tender love scene yet   sir harry not one  i am amazed at the girls simplicity  it equals her ignorance  she speaks and looks so totally unconscious of

i doubt he is a sad dog  but no  no no  i am certain he adores you  it is impossible he should do otherwise  but there is another material point about which i am not quite so certain   clara what is

will melt away like lots wife in the first hard shower  none of your fellows that are too valiant to give a woman the wall and too witty to let her have the last word  but one that is  in short his

impossible we should ever be united   sir hornet impossible   clara i do most firmly believe sir harry possesses a thousand virtues but they are all tinged discolored by a failing which if not in its own nature as erroneous as some other vices is more destructive than any   sir hornet i understand you   clara this will for ever deter a woman who values her own peace and welfare from cherishing a passion that must in its consequences be so fatal   sir hornet but you my angel will soon cure him of this  it is not a rooted vice    clara permanently  or my intelligence says false  when he loses there is no possibility of persuading him to desist  the recollection of his loss preys upon his mind and had he the indies he would set it upon the chance of a card the turn of a guinea or the cast of a die   sir hornet well but we have hopes that mr osborne will find means to reclaim him  he is continually with him continually warning him and    clara subtlety and refined artifice  mr osborne sir hornet is an interested physician and would rather encourage than cure the disease   sir hornet heaven forbid  but who informs you of this   clara those who are in the secret i assure you sir  i am afraid mr osborne is a wicked man  he is  what i dare not speak   sir hornet i confess you alarm me though i hope without cause  osborne assumes every appearance of rigid virtue and if this were true he would be the worst of villains  however suspend your opinion awhile  i will soon sift the affair  and in the mean time let me beg of you to think as well of sir harry as your doubts will

hornet and as it was evident his beard was gray his limbs palsied his skin shriveled and his sinews shrunk   vandervelt how sir hornet   sir hornet they naturally concluded he had made his will wrote his epitaph and bespoke his coffin   vandervelt mercy upon me   sir hornet but instead of meditating like a pious christian on the four last things a crotchet takes him in the head he buys a threepenny fiddle scrapes a matrimonial jigg claps a pair of horns upon his head and curvets through the town the sport of the mob derided by the young pitied by the old and laughed at by all the world   vandervelt heaven deliver me what a picture but you forget sir hornet  didnt i explain to you that it was only a joke   sir hornet oh true  ah witty rogue  well  adieu  i will remember the

supposed your passion and suspicion would have required better proof than the malevolent asperson of an anonymous letter ere they ought to have incited you to a quarrel with your friend   sir harry i beg your pardon dear osborne  i am to blame  nothing but the severity of my late losses can plead for me  i know you to be a noblehearted worthy fellow and explanations on such an accusation are as

sir hornet finding you in  zounds what awkward cargo of rusticity has he got there   to clara clara a young lady from somersetshire with a tolerable good fortune that sir harry it is thought by some intends to marry   sir hornet marry  he should as soon marry the mummy of queen semiramis   clara she has been strongly recommended to the family sir   sir hornet recommended  by whom   clara by one you are very intimate with and who has very great influence with sir harry as well as with yourself   sir hornet ay  who is that    clara pardon me there sir hornet   sir hornet certainly the fellow cannot be foolish enough to admire her  but i shall soon discover that by what he thinks of you  harkee harry   sir harry sir   sir hornet i cannot upon the whole tell very well what to make of you  are you thoroughly convinced that you are at this instant legally capable of making your will   sir harry my will sir   sir hornet ay  are you of sound mind   sir harry i believe so sir   sir hornet then pray tell me now we have you face to face what is your opinion of miss turnbull   sir harry sir  that is by no means a question proper to be answered in this company   sir hornet pshaw  damn your delicacy  make your panegyric and i will blush for her and you too   sir harry shrugs up his shoulders sir i have no panegyric to make   sir hornet sir   sir harry even so   sir hornet why you impudent confounded  have you the barefaced effrontery with such a picture before your eyes to    sir harry you have applied the torture and my own ease requires confession   sir hornet humph  and so you  now pray all be attentive for bacons brazen head is going to utter  so you do not think miss turnbull a most engaging    sir harry smiles sir hornet why you intolerable    sir harry i am concerned to see you so serious on the subject  i must acknowledge that in this case sir i have either a most perverse or stupid imagination and cannot for the soul of me discover the latent wonders in the young lady which your better sight has so distinct a view of   sir hornet ha   sir harry i am however exceedingly willing to try the utmost strength of my faith to believe as much as i can and take the rest for granted provided you will not inflict the punishment of a wife upon my superstition   sir hornet obliging youth  bows  inflict the punishment of a wife upon your superstition  and so you think no doubt a wife a burden much too heavy for the back of so fine and pretty a townmade gentleman as yourfelf   sir harry with the addition of miss turnbulls accomplishments i most undoubtedly do sir   sir hornet you do  humph  pray most civil sir  permit me to ask  perhaps there may be some other lady in this good company to whom your profound penetration would give the preference   sir harry if such preference could in the least make me deserving of her i have no scruple to say there is   sir hornet miracle of modesty  there is   sir harry most assuredly  but though to possess the lady you hint at would make me blessed beyond description i have never dared to declare so much before because i am conscious of being unworthy of such a prosusion of charms and accomplishments   clara generous diffidence   aside sir hornet charms and  what the devil is all this  where am i  at sea or on shore  have i a calenture in my brain or is this my nose  they  they call you sir harry portland dont they sir   sir harry and your nephew sir   sir hornet no  that is rather dubious  well then mr harry or sir harry or what you please  you are pretty well convinced i suppose that i have had some slight regard for you   sir harry perfectly sir and remember it with gratitude   sir hornet that remains to be proved friend  ever since your fathers death if i dont mistake i have been tolerably busy a little active or so in forming your mind and manners and moulding you into a sort of being a man might behold without blushing   sir harry it is impossible sir i should ever forget your goodness though i am happy to be reminded of it   sir hornet that is a lie i believe  however sir  among the rest of my cares i was anxious to find a woman worthy of you  nay so solicitous was i about adjusting preliminaries that though the gout had laid an embargo upon a parcel of my fingers and toes i resolved to forego my own ease and set sail immediately that i might convoy you sase into the harbor of happiness   sir harry i am very sensible of the benevolence of your intentions sir and only wish you had done me the honor to    sir hornet well i have only a word or two more to say on the subject  i have been an enthusiastic old blockhead it is true and was fool enough to think all men had eyes however if you have not either the complaisance the wit or the love to hit upon some expedient to make your peace with miss turnbull i will never see never know never speak to you again and now sir you will act as your great wisdom shall direct   sir harry indeed sir i am distressed to see you so intent upon this business i am exceedingly unhappy to do the least thing to incur your displeasure  at this moment especially  i have a thousand reasons to be disatisfied with myself and am grieved to add your anger to the lift  i would do any thing in my power to preserve your friendship and affection but this is too severe a task  i cannot totally forget common sense  i cannot entirely command so delicate a passion as that of love  a little time will discover whether i am ever to think of love or happiness again  of this however i am certain  i never can possess either with miss turnbull    exit sir harry sir hornet indeed youngster so resolute   clara what a noble fortitude   aside sir hornet we shall see who will first read their recantation  an insensible blind puppy

i should as soon take myself for a king or you for a conjuror i only mistook this lady to be miss turnbull not miss turnbull to be this lady   vandervelt mistook miss turnbull and this lady and  i dont understand it   clara be kind enough sir hornet to explain the matter   sir hornet you remember madam i had some conversation with you in the rooms at bath   clara persectly    sir hornet and you could not but perceive how forcibly i was struck with your wit beauty and accomplishments   clara i recollect you were very polite sir and were pleased to say abundance of obliging things   sir hornet not half so many as i thought i assure you madam   vandervelt well said sir hornet   my old friend is quite enamoured with you turtle   sir hornet yes sir so i am  though i do not intend to marry the lady   vandervelt hem   sir hornet my grand object the thing that of all others i have most at heart is to see my nephew sir harry happy  as for myself i feel i am growing old apace and am almost tired of the farce of life   vandervelt why so sir hornet i am sure you play your part excellently   sir hornet no no  i am rolling down hill apace and as the first steep declivity may precipitate me to the bottom there are certain affairs i wish to see finished one of which is the marriage of sir harry   clara so the person you asked concerning me when i went out of the rooms mistook the question and thought you meant miss turnbull   sir hornet so it appears madam  and i was too much enraptured to stay to rectify mistakes  when i negotiated the affair with squire turnbull i studiously avoided an interview with his supposed sister for fear the business should wear a face of precipitate indelicacy  and i thought if i could once bring you and sir harry together i would leave the contingent possibilities to love and the superior good qualities and penetration of the parties which i rationally enough concluded could not fail to produce the desired effect   clara but sir hornet how did it happen that you did not enquire of me myself who i was   sir hornet why faith madam i had been so particular with you and had spoken so freely on the subjects of love and matrimony that i was afraid if i made those kind of enquiries you would mistake the matter perhaps and think i wanted to make love to you in my own proper person hey young van    half aside vandervelt heigho   clara oh no sir

weak man do you think the momentary pang of death a sufficient punishment for the ruin and destruction you have entailed upon all those who have had the misfortune to love or to be related to you do you think that to die and to forget at once your infamy and crimes is a compensation for the havoc you have made with the peace and property of those who were dearest to you who must live to feel the
