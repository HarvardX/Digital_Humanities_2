an account of the jail fever or typhus carcerum as it appeared at carlisle in the year       by john heysham m d  principiis obsta sero medicina paratur cum mala per longas invaluere moras ovid london printed for t cadell j murray r faulder and j milliken bookseller carlisle mdcclxxxii  preface as the hospital or jail fever is already well known and has been correctly and minutely described by several writers upon the subject i should not have thought myself authorized to obtrude this account upon the public attention had not the treatment of the disease which was adopted and successfully pursued at carlisle appeared to differ in some circumstances from what has hitherto obtained in general practice this difference consists principally in the more early application and in the much freer use of bark and port wine a caution seems to have been scrupulously adhered to of not administering these remedies until the last stage of the disease by which delay the strength of the patient has often been so totally reduced that all applications of the most tonic stimulating and corroborating medicines have sailed of effect with respect to the quantity of wine whereas sir john pringle never directed more than a bottle in the day and rarely so much we have here prescribed from one bottle to two bottles and an half daily always with advantage and without any observable inconveniency from excess the doses also of the bark are nearly double to those which the same eminent physician usually exhibited  if the medical reader be taught by this account to suspect the reserve with which he has proceeded in the use of bark and wine to be unnecessary and hurtful  if further enquiry and experience encourage him in a more liberal application of these valuable tonics and stimulants  and if the lives of any of our fellow creatures be thereby preserved the publication of these papers will have fulfilled every intention of their author  carlisle february  th      an account of the jail hospital or putrid fever typhus of nosologists which is thus accurately defined by dr cullen morbus contagiosus calor parum auctus pulsus parvus debilis pleruraque frequens urina parum mutata sensorii functiones plurimum turbatae vires multum imminutae synopsis nosol method tom   p    which raged at carlisle in the year      although this fever neither arose in a jail nor a hospital yet it so exactly resembles the jail fever both in the symptoms causes and method of cure that i have not scrupled to treat of it under that name  section i of the history and symptoms of this fever about the beginning of april an epidemic fever began to make its appearance in carlisle and continued to rage with more or less violence during the remaining part of the year  the rise progress and decline of this epidemic will be best ascertained by examining the register of deaths where i find that two fell victims to it in the month of may four in june four in july eight in august seven in september nine in october eight in november and six in december in all fifty two including a soldier of the first regiment of dragoons and three married women from the villages of rockliffe and warwick of this number three were boys three were bachelors fifteen were husbands three were girls two were maids twenty one were wives and five were widows so that above two thirds of those who died were married people in january    0 there were      inhabitants in carlisle of these  0   were husbands  0   were wives    were widowers  0  were widows and the remainder were either children bachelors or maids since that time there has been some increase which however is not ascertained but which cannot be very considerable a circumstance the cause of which i perhaps may at some future opportunity endeavor to investigate at present i shall content myself with barely mentioning the fact  during the winter we had no frost of any long duration but the cold was considering the climate sometimes very intense the spring upon the whole was mild and temperate in may june and july the weather was remarkably warm dry and serene and continued so till about the middle of august when the temperature of the air suddenly changed and we had ten days or a fortnight of cold wet weather in september the air was warm and moist in october it was remarkably temperate and dry november commenced with a smart frostt which however continued but two days the rest of the month the   d and   d days excepted which were frost was constantly wet blowing weather till the   th of december the air was remarkably dry even to such a degree as to make the roads duly afterward it became moist mild and warm on christmas day i observed the common wild daisy viz bellis perennis in full blow on the   th there was a most violent storm of wind and rain from the west which continued for several hours  this fever chiefly i may almost say entirely raged amongst the common and lower ranks of people and more especially amongst those who lived in narrow close confined lanes and in small crowded apartments  it affected adults more frequently than children i never saw any children under three years of age who were affected with it the infirm than the robust women than men and the married were more subject to it than the single the first person seized with it in a family was seldom the last for in general more than one often three or four and sometimes the whole family were affected with it one after another  it was in a great measure confined to this place very few being seized with it in the neighboring villages se time in august a young man who had recov fm this fever went home to a small village call rcklffe about four miles from carlisle for the bent of fresh air etc his mother was in a little time seized with the fever and died a neighboring wn who attended her likewise caught it and died ut i have not heard that it spread any further in that village about the latter end of november a child whose mother died of the fever but who had not been affected himself was taken to warwick a neighbouri village the woman of the house where he stayed w soon after seized with the fever and died in the space of five or six days and since that time two or three other persons in the village have been affected these three women who died and a soldier in the first regiment of dragoons are included in the total number of deaths though they are not mentioned in the register or other large towns in the county  it raged with more violence in the suburbs than within the walls of the city and prevaled more without the irish and scotch tha tout the english gate  i have endeavored to ascertain the number of persons who have been seized with this fever and from the best information i have been able to procure it appears that near six hundred have at this time viz january the  th      been affected with it that is about one in eleven or twelve of all the inhabitants of carlisle and one in ten nearly of all who have been attacked by the disorder have died  these particulars being premised which i think may afterward be of some use toward ascertaining the exact nature of the epidemic i shall now endeavor to give a faithful history of the disease or a brief and accurate narration of the symptoms as they appeared to me at the patients bedside  this fever constantly begins with a sensation of coldness and shivering somewhat resembling the fit of an ague which however by no means continues so long or proceeds to such a violent degree soon afterward the patient complains of a pain in his head and back and sometimes in other parts of his body of nausea and sickness at stomach but he seldom vomits of great lassitude weakness and weariness of dejection of spirits or heat frequently alternating with the cold shivering fits of thirst and loss of appetite his sleep is also confused and disturbed with frightful dreams  the pulse is weak and frequent varying om ninety to a hundred and ten strokes in a minute the skin in general is dry the tongue white but rather moist the urine is crude and pale i e paler than urine usually made by a healthy person the belly in geral regular  in this situation the patient for the most part continues one two or sometimes even three days not altogether confined to his bed but if left to himself getting up and lying down upon the bed several times in a day  this i shall denominate the first stage of the disorder  according to the moderation or violence of the above symptoms the patient is confined entirely to his bed on the second third or sometimes on the beginning of the fourth day from the first accession of the cold shivering fit almost all the symptoms now increase the pain of the head becomes acute the debility is such that the patient cannot be raised to an erect or even sitting posture for any length of time without great danger of bringing on a fainting fit the appetite is totally gone the thirst increases a tremor of the hands supervenes the tongue becomes gradually dry and brown and when thrust out of the mouth for examination is unsteady and tremulous the skincontinues dry the urine pale and without sediment the pulse becomes more frequent and feeble viz from a hundred and ten to a hundred and fifteen or even a hundred and twenty strokes in a minute  the patient talks some what incoherently yet knows his friends and will answer questions with tolerable distinctness in this situation he continues six seven eight nine ten or eleven days and from which if the symptoms do not increase he gradually recovers the acute pain of the head abates the thirst is more moderate the urine becomes higher colored and deposits some little sediment the color and consistence of which is however various the pulse gets down gradually to a hundred ninety eighty etc and becomes at the same time a little fuller and stronger the patient though he has no great desire for food yet is able to take a little when presented to him and lastly his strength is restored by slow degrees  the above is the more usual and favorable appearance and progress of the disease but often either from neglect or an improper treatment in the beginning or the patients bad habit of body it puts on a more fatal and alarming form  the pain of the head continues a putrid colliquative looseness comes on the tongue as well as base of the teeth are covered with a thick black crust and the patient is unable to thrust it out of his mouth and loses the power of speech and of swallowing  sometimes petechiae appear on different parts of the body and in some cases the whole surface of the body is covered with a scarlet offlorescence which however soon disappears the pulse becomes weaker and quicker from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty strokes in a minute the patient is now altogethe rinsensible the urine and faeces are voided without consciousness he knows not the bystanders the delirium is however of the low not of the furious or outrageous kind  his muscles become flaccid he gathers the bed clothes collectio floccorum he his affected with subfultus tendinum convulsive startings and twitchings of the muscles of the whole body he gradually slides toward the foot of the bed his extremities become cold a small quantity of blood sometimes distills from his nostrils his face has a livid and cadaverous appearance and death which soon follows these symptoms puts a period to his sufferings  after death broad livid blotches appear about the neck and shoulders and putrefaction soon takes place  the appearance of the blood i am unable to describe never having had an opportunity of seeing or examining it  anomalous symptoms a diarrhaea sometimes occured in the first stage of the disorder but whether it was a symptom of the general weakness or was occasioned by the bark and other remedies is uncertain at all events if possible it was to be checked immediately in some cases the fever was attended with a cough sometimes with at other times without expectoration in other cases the pulse was by no means so weak as is above represented a difficulty of making water approaching almost to a suppression of urine with a swelling of the abdomen and evident fluctuation happened in one or two instances a relapse did not occur to my observation and if it ever happened it was very seldom  being persuaded of the general truth of the doctrine of critical days i looked for them in the present case with some attention but as far as i could observe this fever had no stated or certain duration its terminations whether in health or in death by no means happened on certain fixed periods of the disease and were seldom or ever attended with the least appearance of a critical discharge patients i believe died on almost every day of the fever from the fifth or sixth to the sixteenth or seventeenth the salutary terminations occurred as frequently on the noncritical as on the critical days a favorable change sometimes taking place on the sixth and seventh often on the eight ninth tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth days from the accession of the disease and in one case no visible change for the better took place till the eighteenth day but liere the patient had not called in advice till the fever had made considerable progress  in short an early or a late a salutary or a fatal termination of this fever entirely depended upon the constitution of the patient and the speedy application of proper remedies if the patient had a tolerable constitution and the bark and wine were given in large quantities immediately after the accession of the disease he soon recovered if on the contrary the use of these medicines was neglected for any length of time he either died or was brought to the greatest extremities of weakness and danger from which he recovered exceeding flowly but concerning these matters i shall have occasion to speak more fully in the last section  having thus related the most distinguishing symptoms of this fever i shall now proceed to mention a few particulars respecting the prognostics  section ii of the prognostics on this head i shall content myself with pointing out first those symptoms which indicate a favorable issue and secondly those which on the contrary portend danger and death  first when the pulse in the second stage of the disease does not exceed one hundred and twenty strokes in a minute and grows slower and stronger by the use of wine and bark when the urine by the same remedies becomes higher colored and deposits upon standing a little time a sediment when the delirium is not constant but only occurs when the patient awakens out of sleep when the pain of the head is not violent or if it has been violent upon the use of the remedies hereafter described abates when the patient is able to lie on his back or sides indifferently when he is able to put out his tongue to swallow and to answer questions distinctly we may in general promise a favorable termination  but in the second place if the pulse notwithstanding a liberal and copious use of wine and bark is feeble and exceeds one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty strokes in a minute if the urine continues crude and pale if the delirium is constant if the looseness cannot be restrained by proper remedies if the urine and faeces are voided involuntarily if the teeth are covered with a black gummy matter if the tongue is parched black and chopped if the patient cannot articulate distinctly or swallow or put out his tongue when desired when he can only lie upon his back when subsultus tendinum tremours of the hands and convulsive startings in other parts of the body come on when he is affected with stupor when he attempts to gather up the bed clothes when his extremities become cold his face livid and covered with a cold clammy sweat and he slides down the bed death is at no great distance  petechiae which have by physicians been justly deemed marks of malignity and putrefaction in fevers of this kind did not according to my observation portend imminent danger nor did a bleeding of the nose unless occuring together with other dangerous circumstances appear to me to be an alarming symptom for several patients affected with one or the other of these symptoms if a sufficient quantity of proper tonic and stimulant remedies were thrown in recovered and got through the distemper as well as others who were not affected with them but i must here remark that i never observed either petechioe a scarlet efflorescence or a bleeding of the nose in patients who began to take the bark and wine early in the disease  section iii of the remote causes of this fever and particularly of the occasional cause a peculiar constitution or temperament of the air has been often accused and perhaps in some cases with propriety as laying the foundation of many epidemical disorders accordingly i thought it not improper to mention the state of the weather not only previous to the appearance but during the rise progress and decline of this fever although i am inclined to think in the present instance it was by no means a powerful agent  because in the first place this epidemic was in a great measure confined to the city and suburbs of carlisle whereas the general state of the air must be supposed to be nearly the same through the whole neighborhood and more especially in the adjacent villages where however no disease of the kind ever appeared unless the seeds of it had been evidently carried either by some persons who had labored under the disease or whose clothes etc had been previously imbued with the contagion  in the second place because the temperature of the air in the months of october and november when the fever raged with the greatest violence was different from what it had been in april and may the months in which the disorder began to make its appearance but similar to what it was in december and january when it was manifestly upon the decline  if we therefore wish to discover the causes which will be of no little importance in ascertaining the true and precise nature of the disease we must attend to more local circumstances than the general qualities of the air  it is evident from the preceding history that this fever is extremely contagious i e it is evident that a subtle active and virulent substance is generated in and escapes from the body of a person laboring under the disease which when applied to a sound body in particular circumstances will produce a similar affection and thus it is propagated from one part of a family to another and from neigbour to neigbour this active poison is by physicians denominated contagion or more properly human effluvia  how this poison operates on our systems is not thoroughly understood but under what circumstances it is first generated and produced we are often but too well acquainted it is the offspring of filth nastiness and confined air in rooms crowded with many inhabitants hence such effluvia often originates in ships hospitals and jails of which many striking examples are upon record  at the assizes held at oxford in the year      a putrid effluvia arising from the prisoners at the bar infected a great part of the court with a pestilential sever of which upwards of three hundred persons died camden annal reg elizab bacon mead   another very melancholy instance of the fatal effects of human effluvia occurred in the year    0 during the sessions at the old baily at these sessions near one hundred prisoners were tried who were all during the sitting of the court either placed at the bar or confined in two small rooms which opened into the court the court house was crowded with people great numbers of whom were almost instantly seized with the jail fever and above forty died of it but the must remarkable circumstance is that those only were affected who were on the left hand side of the lord mayor a stream of air from the prisoners being directed to that side of the room in consequence of a window being opened on the other all on the right hand side escaped the putrid effluvia being wafted from them to the opposite side  in both these instances it does not appear that the prisoners either before or after their trials were affected with any particular distemper resembling that which seized so many and of which they were supposed to have communicated the contagion just before this sheet was going to be printed off osters reports accidentally fell into my hands in which i find the following observations it ought to be remembered that at the time this disaster happened there was no sickness in the gaol more than is common in such places this circumstance which distinguishes this from most of the cases of the like kind which we have heard of suggesteth a very proper caution not to presume too far upon the health of the gaol barely because the gaolfever is not among the prisoners  for without doubt if the points of cleanliness and free air have been greatly neglected the putrid effluvia which the prisoners bring with them in their clothes etc especially where too many are brought into a crowded court together may have fatal effects on people who are accustomed to breathe better air though the poor wretches who are in some measuve habituated to the fumes of a prison may not always be sensible of any great inconvenience from them  the persons of chief note who were in court at this time and died of this fever were sir samuel pennant lord mayor for that year sir thomas abney one of the justices of the common pleas charles clarkeesquire one of the barons of the exchequer and sir daniel lambert one of the aldermen of london of less note a gentleman of the bar two students one of the under sheriffs an officer of lord chief justice lee who attended his lordship in the court at that time several of the jury on the middlesex side and about forty other persons whom business or curiosity had brought thither  fosters reports p     in order to prevent such melancholy accidents happening in courts of justice it perhaps might not be improper to bathe the prisoners and accommodate them with clean clothes or at least with clean linen immediately before they are brought to the bar such regulations i apprehend would not be attended either with much trouble or expense and might be the means of preserving the lives of many individuals who may be serving on these solemn occasions their king and their country   how then it may be asked could the disease be caught in consequence of any effluvia arising from their bodies if any putrid effluvia had been generated amongst them during their confinement would not they have suffered from it sooner than others to whom it was afterward applied in consequence of diffusion in the air and more especially as it is to be imagined that the bodies of the prisoners were disposed to receive infection from their being fed on a poor watery diet and from that anxiety which they must suffer from their situations  in answer to these questions let it be in the first place observed that many of these prisoners had been long confined many had been long accustomed to filth and uncleanliness in consequence of which the putrid effluvia would be generated gradually and for along time be constantly applied to their bodies in small quantities till it at length became as it were their natural atmosphere when they would no more feel its influence than the tanner perceives the smell of his tanyard or the chandler the smell of his putrid tallow  further the human body is possessed of the power either of accommodating itself to or resisting the effects of many active and noxious bodies when they are constantly and gradually applied in small quantities which would injure many of the functions of life nay even in some cases bring on death were they given in large doses at first this may be illustrated by the effects of opium of hemlock and of tobacco on the human body every one knows that a person by constantly accustoming himself to make use of these drugs in small quantities will in time acquire the habit of taking without danger a quantity at one dose which would either injure the health or even destroy the life of another person  it is presumed to be upon this principle that physicians and surgeons visit the sick with so much impunity they are frequently exposed to the infection but rarely in contagious diseases stay any considerable time with the patient by which means they never imbibe a large quantity of the contagious matter at any one time at least till their constitutions have acquired the power of resisting its effects  for examples of the production and effects of human effluvia in hospitals ships and camps the reader may consult huxham priagle and lind  but jails hospitals ships etc are not the only places in which this poison may be produced it may be generated in any close room or apartment where a great number of inhabitants are crowded together and where little attention is paid to cleanliness in the instance of this disease which prevailed at carlisle although we perhaps may not be able to point out the particular house in which the cause of the fever orginated yet i think we may without much hesitation pronounce that the occasional cause of it is human effluvia which has been generated in some little dirty confined place of which there are great numbers in carlisle and every other large manufacturing town when i surveyed this town and suburbs i had an opportunity of seeing many scenes of poverty of filth and nastiness and in the bills of mortality for the year      the following observation is made  nervous and putrid severs are not very frequent no more than five have suffered by both these diseases which must appear somewhat astonishing to one who knows how many inhabitants there are of the lowest rank who are crowded in close and small apartments where they sleep eat and prepare their victuals whose food cannot be the most nutritive who seldom change their clothes and who pay but little attention to cleanliness  thus it appears probable that human effluvia was the occasional cause of this fever we have only to observe that it never seemed to produce fever except in cases either where it was applied as it immediately issued from its sources and especially where it was accumulated from want of ventilation or where it was communicated by means of clothes etc that had been used by the person laboring under the fever in which it may be long retained nor was it in general so virulent and active as to produce any noxious effects unless in concurrence with some other remote causes concerning which we shall now speak  since i had arranged the above particulars from my notes i have upon enquiry discovered the precise place where this fever began about the latter end of march or the beginning of april it was in a house in richardgate which contains about half a dozen very poor families the rooms are exceeding small and in order to diminish the window tax every window that even poverty could dispense with was shut up hence stagnation of air which was rendered still more noxious by the filth and uncleanliness of the people the surgeon who attended some of these poor wretches told me the smell was so offensive and disagreeable that it was with difficulty he could stay in the house while he enquired into the situation of his patient  one of the persons affected with the fever in this house was a weaver who on his recovery went to his usual employment at a large workshop where he communicated the disorder to his fellow weavers and from thence the fever spread all over the town  section iv of the causes which predisposed or rendered the body more liable to be affected by the occasional cause when applied concerning these causes which as is were prepared the body for the action of human effluvia it is not my intention at present to enlarge much without attempting to explain their mode of operation i shall deem it sufficient briefly to enumerate them they are evidently such as have a tendency to weaken and debilitate the whole body and more especially the nervous and muscular fibers and may i think be comprised under the following heads    a poor watery diet   uncleanliness   cold   intemperance in drinking   excess in venery   fatigue   grief and anxiety   fear   previous diseases were it necessary i could mention many instances where all or at least most of the above causes apparently cooperated with human effluvia in producing the fever therefore by avoiding these predisposing causes even persons liable to be exposed to the contagion will in general escape the disease during an epidemic of this kind to those who can afford it a genous diet and a liberal use of wine or spirituous liquors as the one or the other is most agreeable to the constitution will prove the most effectual preservatives by a liberal use of wine etc i mean such a quantity as will exhilerate the spirits without occasioning either head ach thirst or sickness at stomach for intoxication ought to be studiously avoided those who have weak delicate constitutions or who either from local circumstances or their profession are much exposed to the putrid human effluvia may with great advantage have recourse to the bark and moderate exercise in the open air  section v of the cure in section first i have faithfully related the the phenomenon attendant on this disease in the third and fourth i have endeavored to ascertain the causes which produced these phenomenon and in this i shall attempt to point out the means which from experience i have found to be the most effectual in bringing about an early and salutary termination  after having attentively considered the facts delivered in the preceding sections i think we cannot hesitate a moment in deducing the following conclusions    that the disease in a great measure consists in extreme debility   in a tendency of the fluids toward putrefaction the obvious indications of cure then are    to remove the causes or obviate the effects of that debility   to obviate or correct the tendency of the fluids toward putrefaction at whatever period of the disease i am called to a patient my first care is to remove if possible every cause of the disease which continues to subsist the causes which continue to operate and aggravate the disorder after it is fully formed are in general human effluvia generated in and issuing from the patients own body uncleanliness which favors an accumulation of these effluvia grief anxiety and fear  i immediately order the patient clean linen which ought to be changed every day or at farthest every other day and if possible endeavor to direct a stream of fresh air over the bed which not only carries off the noxious particles as they are formed prevents an accumulation of them and keeps the chamber pure and sweet but universally acts as a refreshing stimulus to the patient more especially in the summer when the weather was hot some caution perhaps ought to be used during intense frost  but if the situation of the bed would not admit of this either a window or the door or sometimes both were advised to be kept open and if the bed had curtains they were always ordered to be open the excretions of the sick whether faeces or urine etc were immediately removed  a strict observance of these circumstances especially in the early stages of the fever tended much to mitigate its virulence and prevented the disorder from spreading on the contrary the neglect of them was i am satisfied frequently attended with dangerous and fatal consequences which nobody i think will doubt when i inform them that i have been often called to patients on the eighth ninth tenth and eleventh days of the fever and found them in a small dirty room the bed near a large fire where the victuals were preparing for the rest of the family the bed curtains close drawn the sheets and shirt upon the patients back almost black with dirt so that he was immersed in a putrid effluvia rendered highly poisonous by stagnation heat and consequent fermentation  if the patient lamented the death of some friend or relation his sorrow was attempted to be scothed and if he was fearful and anxious as was often the case about his own fate he was always encouraged with hopes of a speedy recovery fear operates as an excessive debilitating power on the human body and when it acts in conjunction with human effluvia seldom fails to produce fever every thing therefore which tends in the least to excite this passion of the mind especially in those who are already sick ought to be cautiously avoided this observation leads me to take notice of some customs very prevalent in carlisle and which in opposition to this salutary caution tend much to alarm and terrify the sick    upon the death of any inhabitant what is called the death bell is immediately olled for the space of ten minutes or a quarer of an hour which announces to the world is dissolution    in due time the public crier comes and after ringing his bell proclaims in every street in a loud distinct and melancholy tone of voice the hour of the deceaseds funeral inviting the friends and neighbors to attend    and lastly funeral psalms are sung by the attendants as they are conducting the corpse through the public streets to the church yard for interment it is only amongst the common people that the  d and  d ceremonies are observed but the   st is universal   what is the consequence a patient is confined to his bed his body is debilitated to the last degree his spirits are depressed he hears these repeated and successive notices of death it may be perhaps of the death of some friend or near relation he is anxious and alarmed and if sensible concludes as disponding people usually do that his fate will be the next upon which he is seized with sudden terror which increases his weakness aggravates all his complaints and sometimes it is to be feared renders a disease fatal which might otherwise have yielded to the power of medicine  in ages of popish ignorance and superstition such cremonies might perhaps be thought conducive to the suture happiness and repose of the dead we are now however certain their only tendency is to injure the living and as such with all due deference we recommend to the superior judgments of our respectable magistrates and clergy their abolition especially during the continuance of a fatal epidemic disease i am happy to inform the public that upon my representing the evil tendency of these ceremonies to our present dean the rev dr percy who has since he came amongst us invariably shown a readiness to interest himself for the good of his fellowcitizens he not only made an immediate reform with respect to the usual mode of tolling the bell and singing funeral psalms but likewise recommended to the worshipful the mayor and corporation some alterations with respect to the public crier who obligingly promised to do every thing in their power toward promoting the welfare of the community about the same time he and other charitable and humane persons opened a subscription for the purpose f providing wine and other necessary cordials for the sick poor which afforded relief to several distressed objects had it fortunately been established sooner it is probable many who are now orphans would have had no occasion to lament with unavailing tears the loss of their parents  did the effluent and wealthy know but half the distresses of the poor and relieve them who that are rich would be unhappy nihil est enim tam populate quam bnitas  homines enim ad deos nulla re proprius accednt quam salutem hominibus dando  cic orat pro q lig     these circumstances being premised i now come to take notice of those remedies which appeared from my own experience to be the most efficacious in answering the above indications of cure  at the commencement of the epidemic when i was called early in the first stage of the disease which however was not often the case i ordered the patient the saline mixture and if there were evident symptoms of costiveness a small portion of tartar emetic was added to it a medicine which i had often used and with apparent success in slow nervous fevers typhus mitior of nosologists cullen synop nosol p    i took care however that the quantity of the tartar emetic should not be sufficient to excite any great degree either of nausea or vomiting for in some cases where the nausea proceeded to actual vomiting i found all the symptoms were considerably aggravated and as the epidemic advanced and i had greater opportunities of ascertaining the nature of the disease i altogether laid it aside as an useless or even as a noxious medicine  along with the saline mixture the patient was ordered to take the bark in substance and to drink plentifully of port wine sometimes pure sometimes when he complained of thirst diluted with a small portion of cold water if there was any tendency to sickness the saline draught was taken in the act of effervescence until the sickness abated  it happened however more usually that i did not see the patient till the first stage of the disease was finished in such cases rather than overload the patients stomach with too much medicine i altogether ommitted the saline mixture and entirely confided in the use of bark and wine and was seldom disappointed  the tonic cordial stimulant and antiseptic qualities of these remedies in a remarkable manner increased the vigor of the system and in a great measure preventd any tendency to putrefaction for by a copious and liberal use of them the pulse became slower and stronger the thirst and pain of the head abated the delirium was removed the urine became higher colored and was either cloudy or deposted some little sediment and lastly the patient got some refreshing sleep it is not however by administering these remedies in small quantities or at distant intervals that we are to expect these salutary effects  the debility was in general so great as to render it necessary to throw them in in large quantities otherwise little or no good effects were produced  the following was my general mode of giving the bark  r pulv cort pruv opt unciam unam rad serpent virg drachmas dues  m and divide in parts xii aquales sumat i secunda vel tertia quaque hora ex vin rub haust  when the patients stomach could not bear the bark in substance as was sometimes the case a strong decoction somewhat like the following was substituted  r pulv cort peruv opt sescunciam coque ex aquae fontanae libris tribus ad libras duas cola and colaturae add tinct cort peruv sescuntiam syrup balsam unciam unam  m and sumat aeger coch mag iii secunda vel tertia queque hoar  according to the age sex constitution of the patient and urgency of the symptoms different quantities of wine were administered i had no opportunity of seeing any very young children in the disease and when it affected children from eight to twelve or fourteen years of age it was in general very mild  to adults i usually ordered from one bottle to two bottles and one half in the space of twentyfour hours and i believe more might have been taken with advantage for i never saw any bad effects from an excess though i have perceived evident ones from a too sparing use of this grateful cordial indeed i often found it a difficult matter to persuade the nurses to administer it in sufficient quantities some were deterred by prejudices but more i believe were prevented by poverty almost in every case it was my constant custom on leaving the patient to urge the plentiful use of wine in this method i constantly persevered till a change took place which was in general favorable when the quantity of wine was gradually diminished and the patient was supported by strong fresh broth panada etc and in a little time by solid animal food  soon after this fever made its appearance i had recourse to pediluvium but i quickly found it was rather prejudicial than useful for the debility was in many cases so extreme that the patient sometimes fainted during the operation and was always very much fatigued which more than counterbalanced the stimulating and antispasmodic effects of the warm water  fomentations however of the feet and legs by means of several folds of flannel wrung out of hot water were afterward used with apparent advantage for in this case the fatigue occasioned by the operation was very inconsiderable  blisters seemed to have little or no effect upon the general system or in raising the pulse but when applied behind the shoulders or to the nape of the neck their operation was obvious in abating the violent pain of the head a young girl about nine years old was affected with the fever and particularly complained of a very severe and acute pain in her head the surgeon who attended her prescribed the saline mixture with tartar emetic in small quantities and took about five or six ounces of blood from her arm in hopes of relieving the head ach but without effect for it rather increased after the bleeding i was sent for the next day and notwithstanding her pulse was stronger than in most instances of this fever i advised a blister to be immediately applied betwixt her shoulders which soon removed the pain in her head she was at the same time ordered to take a strong decoction of the bark with plenty of wine which soon freed her from all complaints i afterward in similar circumstances always prescribbed blisters and generally with similar success  a diarrhea often occurred in the second stage of the discase sometimes even in the first whether it was occasioned by the bark or was a consequence of the previous debility is a matter of no great moment it was always a disagreeable often a dangerous symptom and never to be trisled with for when it was even moderate it never failed to weaken the patient greatly disregarding therefore all ill grounded apprehendsions of blocking up the passages and retaining a putrid somes in the intestinal canal i constantly attempted to put a stop to the evacution as quickly as possible and where i was fortunate enough to succeed my patients always recovered  for this purpose i ordered in some cases six or eight drops of tinct thebaic in every dose of the bark but when the diarrhaea was likely to be violent and not to be easily restrained the bark was discontinued the quantity of wine was increased and a cordial astringent composition some what like the following was made use of  r confect japon cardiac utriusque sesquidrachmam aq cinnam ten uncias septem spirit tinct cinnam syrup

thirty or forty drops of tinct thebaic was given at bedtime by this method i generally succeeded in restraining the diarrhaea and as the stools became less frequent they became better colored and less putrid and offensive  if on the other hand several days elapsed without any evacuation by stool a simple injection of warm milk and water had the desired effect i was however by no means anxious about the retention of the saeces and in the second and last stages of the disease seldom ordered a glyster unless there were evident symptoms of irritation in the bowels in consequence of such retention  likewise in other cases of extreme debility and danger although not attended with a diarrhaea i have often administered opuim as a more instantaneous and diffuse siulant than either wine or bark in the following form with considerable advantage  r confect cardiac gr quindecim aq cinnam ten seunciam spirit drachmas duas spirit lavend comp drachman unam tinct thebaic gut quadraginta vel

so small and weak as i have before represented in the history of the fever and in one particular instance i found the pulse so strong that i should have been induced to have drawn a little blood had i not been previously acquainted with the nature of the prevailing epidemic and the dangerous consequences of bleeding when the situation of the patient was such the only difference of my practice consisted in administering his wine and medicines a little warm and if the cough was very troublesome i omitted though perhaps without any great reason the use of the radserpent virgin  with respect to the anomalous symptoms such as a difficulty of making water and in consequence of it a swelling of the abdomen i left them entirely to nature and when the patient recovered from the fever and was able to get out of bed the discharge of urine not only became free but copious which in a very little time diminished the tumor of the belly  through the whole course of the disease when fruit could be procured the patient was desired to eat as much of it as he pleased except when contraindicated by a diarrhaea by steadily pursuing this method from the beginning the patient was not only saved but the symptoms were rendered more moderate and the duration of the disease much shortened  every person who is the least acquainted with medicine after attentively reading the history symptoms and causes of this fever will readily perceive that bleeding must be highly improper in confirmation of which i have now only to observe that toward the first appearance of the disorder before its nature had been clearly ascertained and perhaps where the pulse was some what stronger than in the cases which i had an opportunity of observing a few patients were let blood some in consequence of advice some of their own accord of these however scarcely one escaped the weather in the month of january      except about two days of frost was constantly wet warm and blowing wind west or south west in
