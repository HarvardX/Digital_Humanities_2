here selected under the title of comic ballads fall under the several denominations of pastoral amatory ludicrous and convivial this dissertation therefore naturally divides itself into these several heads  no subject of critical discussion has been examined with more assiduity and less success than pastoral composition the french critics whom a writer of any discernment seldom quotes but to confute their absurdities have here blundered with more than ordinary address rapin has found that pastoral writing must faithfully represent the manners of the golden age dubos a more judicious writer has discovered that the real dialogues of modern shepherds are too gross for poetic relation he therefore advises a poet who would now venture into this walk of verse to choose for his speakers princes who had lost themselves in a wood he is surely himself lost in a wood of false criticism when he informs us that the first dialogue of fontenelles plurality of worlds is an excellent pastoral eclogue it is no doubt a very fine piece of writing but considered in the light of a bucolic poem it makes fully as awkward a figure as an ancient river god in a french opera with a tie wig and silk stockings  did these writers ever read theocritus did they not know that he was the father and his works the only models of this kind of poetry  of all the poets of antiquity none has been imitated with less success than that excellent writer he would himself appear to be perfectly original for though we read that homer was indebted for some of his beauties to his poetical predecessors we never find theocritus lay under this accusation his eclogues breathe the very spirit of nature and surpass those of all his imitators in beauty as much as a romantic river wandering through the richest rural scenes does a dutch jetdeau squirting among hedges of clipped yews virgil who was born an elegiac poet but never happened upon his proper province has in pastoral only displayed excellent skill in versification which is indeed his first and almost only praise in all his works his very persons are ridiculous for what have thyrsis and corydon to do with the po an absurdity followed by the whole imitators of this imitator and among others by pope who gravely makes alexis sing upon the banks of the thames his admired french author boileau might have told him that truth alone is fair and lovely to confound the names of different climates and ages must to every reader of taste appear fully as ludicrous as to confound places and dates in defiance of geography and chronology who but must smile if he read that theocritus was born at the devil tavern in the strand at paris in the year of christ  0  and had the honor to recite one of his eclogues before that merry prince charles i of england who was so pleased with it that he cut three capers of a most surprising height to the amazement of the bard and afterward made him a present of a lottery ticket yet this is not more absurd than to mingle names places and subjects that are perfectly heterogeneous as is done in popes pastorals which are very much inferior to them of philips though phillips has no claim to praise the fact is that pastoral eclogue is quite foreign to modern manners those of theocritus appear natural from their antiquity and from his inimitable language and manner but he stands alone and ever will  any eclogues that occur in this collection such as robene and makyne etc are of a lyric nature and may with much more propriety be called songs than eclogues though they partake of the manner of both i therefore leave the pastoral eclogue to come to the pastoral song or ballad a species of composition which though not very remote in its essence from the pastoral dialogue is infinitely more consonant to modern manners as it implies no personal representation it is not supposed to be written or spoken by a shepherd but merely to convey rural sentiments and images  dubos tells us that the peasants of italy at this day go to keep their flocks or labor the ground with their guitar on their backs and that they sing their loves in extempore verses which they accompany with their instrument this they call improvisadare this practice of making extempore verses is frequent in italy as we may observe in many of the latest travelers but i suppose the principal merit of such poetry arises from the surprise of the hearer the works of barnardino perfetti a patrician of sienna firenze      now lie before me he was the best of modern extemporary poets and crowned in the capitol yet there is nothing in them  were any of these songs to be committed to writing and of high merit it might be considered as a pastoral song complete in every circumstance  yet i question if in truth of character it could exceed some of the pieces of that kind now under our eye though written perhaps in the smoke and noise of a capital but to pass from this theory many of the scottish songs now selected must be allowed by every good judge to have uncommon excellence in the pastoral mode of poetry they possess the utmost truth of manner and of coloring they have all that sweetness which an ancient critic   hermogenes l ii c    observes is the result of perfect simplicity as most of the pastoral pieces in this selection are likewise of the amatory style i shall proceed to consider these kinds of poetry in conjunction  if the antiquity of the different kinds of poetry were properly ascertained it is to be believed that love poetry would be found among those of the first invention love that sweetest and best of passions is ever the inspirer of poetry love is a master that can call forth musical sounds from the heart of the savage of iceland amid his half years wintry night as well as from that of the exulting inhabitant of arabia the happy under the influence of the summer sun his effects are controlled by no manner of life and confined by no zone in the most barbarous countries love will be found the inspirer of sentiment and refiner of thought and of language spirero nobil sensi a rozzi petti raddolciro delle lor lingue il suono   as love is perhaps the father of poetry  plato loq de amore  so it is observed that the fair objects and best judges of that passion have always esteemed it the most complete triumph of their charms when their lovers are so enflamed as to commence poets in their praise amorous poetry has often been the supposed magic charm that has caught the heart of the fair novice in that passion this has not escaped shakspere that anatomist of the heart  my gracious duke this man has witched the bosom of my child thou thou lysander thou have given her rhymes and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unhardend youth midsummer nights dream if we except sappho the only female who ever wrote any thing worth preservation there is no writer who has painted love in more genuine and tender colors than are used in the scotch amatory ballads yet there are none of them that i remember are written by ladies there is indeed of very late years one insignificant exception to this rule auld robin gray having got his silly psalm set to soporific music is to the credit of our taste popular for the day but after lulling some goodnatured audiences asleep he will soon fall asleep himself  that profligacy of manners which always reigns before women can so utterly forget all sense of decency and propriety as to commence authors is yet almost unknown in scotland may it ever be so may domestic duties and affections be ever the sole employments and amusements of my fair countrywomen while those of other kingdoms are showing themselves naked in love songs and romances or stalking the streets in the breeches of criticism and morality  the love verses in this volume are of almost every different hue incident to that changeable passion but a plaintive tenderness is the more general characteristic of them fielding i think has observed that love is generally accompanied by a pleasing melancholy the songs in this collection called lochaber ewbuchts marion low down in the broom and many others have when accompanied witn their proper airs a most exquisite pathos they yield a very echo to the seat where love is throned   others again possess an equal power of sprightliness such as an thou were my ain thing soger lady over the bogie etc which do not yield to the best french songs in spirit though these are likewise excellent in their kind indeed if the french excel in any species of poetry it is in their songs though their best efforts in this way do not seem much known in england as this is the case and it is perfectly coherent with my subject i shall beg leave to present my reader with a few french songs of the first merit  in the serious style here is one never yet published  il faut attendre avec patience le jour

remarks on the principal scene of the scottish pastoral songs namely the southern part of scotland in the neighborhood of the tweed i cannot do this better than in the words of an excellent writer he forms a fine contrast by beginning with a description of the northern parts of scotland the highlands of scotland says he are a picturesque but in general a melancholy country long tracts of mountainous desert covered with dark heath and often obscured by misty weather narrow valleys thinly inhabited and bounded by precipices resounding with the fall of torrents a soil so rugged and a climate so dreary as in many parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage nor the labors of agriculture the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that intersect the country the portentous noises which every change of the wind and every increase and diminution of the waters is apt to raise in a lonely region full of echoes and rocks and caverns the grotesque and ghastly appearance of such a landscape by the light of the moon  objects like these diffuse a gloom over the fancy which may be compatible enough with occasional and social merriment but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of silence and solitude and a little further he observes that the ancient highlanders of scotland had hardly any other way of supporting themselves than by hunting fishing or war professions that are continually exposed to fatal accidents and hence no doubt additional horrors would often haunt their solitude and a deeper gloom overshadow the imagination even of the hardiest native he proceeds  what then would it be reasonable to expect from the fanciful tribe from the musicians and poets of such a region strains expressive of joy tranquillity or the softer passions no their style must have been better suited to their circumstances and so we find in fact that their music is the wildest irregularity appears in its composition the expression is warlike and melancholy and approaches even to the terrible  and that their poetry is almost uniformly mournful and their views of nature dark and dreary will be allowed by all who admit of the authenticity of ossian and not doubted by any who believe these fragments of highland poetry to be genuine which many old people now alive of that country remember to have heard in their youth and were then taught to refer to a pretty high antiquity  some of the southern provinces of scotland present a very different prospect smooth and lofty hills covered with verdure clear streams winding through long and beautiful valleys trees produced without culture here straggling or single and there crowding into little groves and bowers with other circumstances peculiar to the districts i allude to render them fit for pasturage and favorable to romantic leisure and tender passions several of the old scotch songs take their names from the rivulets villages and hills adjoining to the tweed near melrose a region distinguished by many charming varieties of rural scenery and which whether we consider the face of the country or the genius of the people may properly enough be termed the arcadia of scotland and all these songs are sweetfully and powerfully expressive of love and tenderness and other emotions suited to the tranquillity of pastoral life essays by dr beattie  d edit essay i   thus far this eminent philosopher and poet whose ideas are so fully expressed and so consonant with my own that they leave me little or nothing further to add i must however observe that the genuine old songs which were originally set to the most admired of the scottish airs are most of them unfortunately lost for the present words to the greater part of them we are indebted to allan ramsay and his friends as he himself informs us in the following words of the preface to his teatable miscelcellany or collection of songs my being well assured how acceptable new words to known good tunes would prove engaged me to the making verses for above sixty of them in this and the second volume which are scottish songs the third and last volume containing mostly english about thirty more were done by some ingenious young gentlemen i heartily wish honest allan and his ingenious young gentlemen had rather used their endeavors to recover and preserve the real ancient ballads than to compose new ones for uncouth as those might be i much suspect they exceeded their substitutes in variety at least indeed as i meant this as a poetical not as a musical work i found myself obliged to admit only the best of these modern pieces always prefering the ancient when it could be found those who wish for words to all the scottish airs may find them in many collections this only means to present the reader of taste with the very best of scottish ballad poetry the reader whom i could wish to please would turn with contempt from a constant succession of the same ideas expressed in the same words and stanza for though the airs vary their verbal accompaniments have in general a similarity as disgusting as the poems of blackmore or the pictures of angelica kauffman though the ancient songs were perhaps less smooth than their successors they were doubtless more varied being composed at distant periods by different minstrels than they could possibly be by allan ramsay a writer not rich in ideas and his young friends who perhaps begun and finished their labors in this way in the space of a few weeks and if they were harsh or uncouth the ancient composer might plead with tasso  se ben miri molle e dura e costei cosi son duri e molli i versi miei molle e in lei quel di fuori dentro ha marmi e diaspri sol nella scorza i versi miei son aspri ma senti come spiri da loro interni amori spirto gentil ch intenerisce i core   a very celebrated and intelligent physician who was born and passed his early years in the south of scotland informs me that it is his opinion that the best of the ancient scottish airs were really composed by shepherds in his remembrance there was in almost every village of that district a chief shepherd who had acquired celebrity by composing better songs than others of the same profession and he thinks that though the best airs are in general known yet the words to at least one half have never been published the musical instruments used by these rude minstrels are the common flute and the stockandhorn which is a flute with a small horn fastened to the further end of it and which forms a base in the nature of a bassoon  the beginning of one of their unpublished ballads of the mournful kind he happens to remember it was written on the fatal expedition to darien in the end of last century a project that seems to have been formed for the destruction of the scottish youth and opens with the following most striking couplet  well a awa to the woods and murne until our scottish joes come hame i believe not above half a dozen of these genuine scottish pastoral ballads are in print and suspect all such may be found in this volume they have certain strokes in them which in my opinion could only occur to real shepherds such are the yellowhaird laddie ewbuchts marion in simmer i mawd my meadow etc what a sad exchange to give such songs for the poor tinsel of allan ramsay and his bottle companions  there is a book printed at st andrews in      called the complaint of scotland it is written by a sir james inglis and is of such exceeding rarity as to be almost unique but dr george mackenzie in his lives of scottish writers has given us an abstract of it the author mentions a masque and enumerates the following songs as forming part of the entertainment    the briers binds me sair   still under the leyvis grene   coutbume

the samen sueit face    in an myrthfou morrou my heart levit on the lad this list which is of exceeding curiosity may teach us that not one of our scottish popular airs is so ancient as      indeed i suspect these of which the scene lies in the south of scotland as tweedside etc are all of them posterior to the accession of james vi to the throne of england any of the above songs that have local marks belong to the northern parts of scotland and it is to be supposed that the provinces which first felt the blessings of repose would first break out into finging not above two of the pieces in this list are now known if i do not mistake numbers   and    or something like them may be found in smiths songs in score before the year   00 they are english songs and prove the author has intermingled english airs with those of his own country i am told no    used lately to be sung on the stage at edinburgh and contains a mock courtship between a frog and a mouse of some satirical merit  some few of the modern songs have the merit of being written on real occasions and such always speak the language of the heart a language of difficult simulation some of such yield not to the elegies of tibullus in nature and pathos though that ancient poet is a wonderful master in amatory verse hammond has never caught his spirit except in imitations which are so close as to be almost translations but i have lately had the pleasure of seeing some elegies of this kind in manuscript which rival those of tibullus himself  the most ancient pieces in this selection are of the ludicrous style of poetry which is something surprising as that species of writing has been thought by able crities to be an effort of modern refinement it is true the images given us in the scottish ludicrous pieces are often not the most agreeable or delicate but have the most modern writers swift for example been more laudable in this respect in peblis to the play christs kirk on the green and others the reader will find curious descriptions of low life and manners as they were in scotland in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the more curious as they were drawn by the hands of monarchs themselves it is certainly much to the credit of the united kingdoms that while the poets of the other countries of europe were writing extravagant romances chaucer and the princely bards of scotland were employed in delineating real life and manners  in the wife of auchtermuchty and similar productions here given there is abundance of humor though a critic of fashion may perhaps pronounce it low but t is nature and will ever be so had chaucer only written or rather translated the romaunt of the rose his works might now have been fast asleep in some old chest but his ales replete with humor of the lower kind will perpetuate his fame that father of english poetry appears to have been as much esteemed in scotland as in his native country dunbar the chief of the scottish poets has in his goldin terge the following spirited apostrophe in his praise which is highly generous if we consider the inveterate enmity at that time subsisting between the two kingdoms it proves that the pursuit of poetry is productive of large and liberal sentiments even in a barbarous period  o reverend chawser rose of rethouris all as in our tongue ane flour imperial that raise in brittane evir quha reidis richt thou beiris of makars the triumphs royal thy fresche ennamalit terms celestial this matter couth haif illuminit full bricht was thou nocht of our inglis all the licht surmounting every tongue terestrial as far as mayis morrow dois midnicht chaucer may indeed be regarded as the father not only of english poetry but of that remarkable quality of writing called humor a word which i believe has no corresponding term in any language as we have none for the french naivete for they are distinct ideas naivete if i mistake not only implies a native gaiety an unconscious simplicity and is never used in a synonymous sense with humor which implies something characteristic even though severe or morose as we say a humourous gravity fontaine has naivete chaucer has humor wit is an assimulation of distant ideas humor is confined to manner either of speaking or writing  it has been affirmed by some eminent critics that the moderns much excel the ancients in witty and humourous composition and alleged that the ancients have no writers in these kinds to oppose to don quixote hudibras the splendid shilling the adventures of gil blas the tale of a tub and the rehearsal adventurer no     the reader will smile at the works here enumerated when he thinks on the omission of those of shakspere fielding and smollet the last of whom was a writer of the most genuine humor that ever existed  but in this they did not reflect that they only saw one side of the question the fact is that with is the most fleeting and transitory quality writing can have like an exquisite essence it wastes itself and leaves only the vase that contained it the margites of homer i suspect began like hudibras in our time to cease being understood before it was allowed to perish but the argument i would use is in short that we cannot judge of the efforts of the ancients in this way because their best works are lost surely then to pronounce against them when they cannot be heard in their defense is not candid it must however be allowed that the modern novel descriptive of real life and the most useful kind of writing known when properly conducted appears to have been foreign to ancient conception but it appears to me very evident that the human mind in the progress of ages alters its shape and powers if i may so express myself in the days of greece and rome its criterion would seem to have been strength in modern times versatility and acuteness hence the dignity and grandeur of their writings and the wit and precision of ours reasons might be given for the difference but this is not the proper place  as we have seen chaucer was so much regarded by the ancient scottish poets i suppose it was from him they took their ideas of burlesque descriptions of vulgar life  the convivial songs in this selection are not many i shall not therefore insist on this head it may however be observed that considering how much the french have written in this way it is something strange their ancient allies the scots should have been so barren in this very easy mode of composition one would imagine the juice of the grape that inspired anacreon was equally potent in his numerous french imitators while the scots having little of that liquid inspiration were by ale confined in the bands of sleep at the social hour that gave the french bons vivants free access to the regions of fancy  it may perhaps be expected that before closing this essay i should offer some remarks on scottish music a subject of much interest and curiosity to every lover of that best sort of melody which speaks to the heart and passions but the ingenious author of an essay on scottish music annexed to mr arnots history of edinburgh has left me nothing to add on that head dr beattie has likewise treated this subject more briefly but with his usual elegance and ability in his essay on poetry and music as they affect the mind another good writer dr gregory in his comparative view of the state and faculties of man with those of the animal world has likewise dropped a few remarks on this matter both these eminent authors have used many arguments to confute the opinion of those who ascribe to david rizzio the invention of our scottish melodies an idea that like many heresies is only made important by its opponents for it carries absurdity and confutation in itself i am informed that some scotishman has made some stanzas to the favorite irish air of langolce under the name of the banks of the dee such a thest cannot be too severely condemned as if persisted in there is an end of all national music as the irish air is rather impure had the scene of the new verses been laid in ireland they might have been innocent enough   i shall therefore conclude with an observation or two respecting the volume now under the readers eye  he has already been admonished not to look upon this work as a collection but as a selection not as pretending to offer the whole of the scottish ballads to his view but only the very best of them the first volume the second edition is here meant indeed presents the reader with a complete digest of such tragic pieces yet discovered in the scottish dialect as any ways deserve preservation those omitted being of no merit of any kind such are johnie armstrong young waters lord of ochiltree the battle of harlaw the battle of raidquair and others not to mention lord thomas and fair annet which is an english ballad as well as chevy chase though some who have not seen dr percys ancient ballad of this name will still contend for its being scottish such has been the generous impartiality of the minstrel who composed this fine ballad and who perhaps had been entertained with equal attention at alnwick and at douglass castles that hardly one intrinsic mark could be given to authorize the ascribing of it to a native of either country till the ancient copy appeared which at once terminated the dispute  an edition printed at aberdeen      has a preface and notes which present the arguments that were then valid for chevy chase being a scottish composition  the loss of chevy chase might be compensated to scotland by the recovery of many tragic pieces of no inferior merit were means used by those who have opportunities for that purpose bertram the archer the robin hood of scotland is now hardly known to have existed though he was celebrated in many a heroic ditty the only stanza known to the editor is given as it closes with a pretty thought bertram being surrounded by his enemies addresses his weapons in this manner my trusty bow of the tough yew that i in london bought and silken strings if ye prove true that my true love has wrought     of the scottish ballads which fall under the title of this second volume i must confess perhaps twenty or thirty more would have been admitted had the limits of the work allowed it yet here i have to use a vulgar metaphor presented the reader with the cream of about a dozen volumes most of them uncommon in this part of the kingdom the comic pieces here given are chosen either from their being rare their being unpublished or their intrinsic merit  for the very curious piece which is placed at the head of this volume and now first published i am indebted to the friendship of the most learned and ingenious editor of the relics of ancient english poetry peblis to the play will certainly be looked upon as a very considerable acquisition to ancient scottish poetry and will i doubt not gain dr percy to whom alone the reader is beholden for it much grateful applause in the northern part of the kingdom in particular indeed considerable fame is already due to him who first set the example of a legitimate collection of this kind than which if conducted with taste nothing can well be more entertaining to the lover of poetry the relics of ancient english poetry were only the amusement of his youthful hours of relaxation from severer studies but might well be called a work of infinite labor and disquisition if executed by a writer of less genius to form a noble plan and less ability to put it in execution for the politeness peculiar to himself with which the communication of this poem was made i now beg leave to offer him my public acknowledgments  some readers may perhaps think that a few of the pieces in this volume might with equal propriety have

percy who to the copy in his handwriting from which this is printed annexed the following account of the original ms  this old song is preserved in the pepysian library at magdalen college in cambridge in p     of an ancient ms collection of old scottish songs and poems in folio which ms had i believe been a present to the founder of that library old mr pepys from the duke of lauderdale minister to king charles ii it had originally belonged to that dukes ancestor sir richard maitland knt who lived in the reign of queen mary and her son king james vi and contains a great number of songs and poems by the said sir richard maitland which are of high poetical merit and throw moreover great light on the incidents and manners of that age it is remarkable that this old bard sir richard maitland was blind like homer and milton at least at the time when some of his poems were written as he expressly mentions it and consoles himself very poetically under the loss of his sight and very advanced age in one of his pieces entitled the blind barons comfort besides his own pieces the ms contains a selection of the pieces of other bards collected by him some of them as this of james i no where else preserved  the foregoing poem is expressly quoted for king james is composition and postiively ascribed to that monarch in john majors scottish history  to see his account of king james i toward the end where major seems to hint that a parody had been made of this song of the kings to ridicule him for some low intrigue in which the king had been detected etc i have not the book by me but with this clue the meaning of that very obscure passage i think may be decyphered  this song written by king james i is a proof that christs kirk on the green was written by his descendant james v being evidently a more modern composition  the passage of major mentioned above is as follows artificlosum libellum de regina dum captivus erat composuit antequam eam in conjugem duceret et aliam artificiosam cantilenam ejusdem yas sen etc et jucundum artificiosumque illum cantum at beltayn etc quam alij de dalkeith et gargeil mutare studuerunt quia in arce aut camera clausus servabatur in qua mulier cum matre habitabat  dr p after writing his own remarks having communicated this poem to several of his learned friends they interspersed theirs and i shall here give their observations and a few of my own upon this singular production after a few preliminary notices that may be necessary to the english reader  james i king of scotland and the undoubted author of the production now under view was born in the year      being the son of robert iii his father to screen him from the ambitious designs of his uncle the duke of albany sent him to france but he was unfortunately taken at sea and ungenerously detained in captivity by the kings of england though during a truce between the two realms for nineteen years nor was he released without payment of an immense ransom upon his assuming the government on the death of his father in      he enacted many wise laws and acquired the esteem and affection of his people but attempting to reform the feudal system of his kingdom and in consequence to curb the power of his nobles he was by some of the chief of them murdered in his bed in      being the   th year of his age and   th of his reign  ballenden in his translation of hector boeces history gives this character of him he was weil learnit to fecht with the sword to just to turnay to wersyl to sing and dance was an expert mediciner richt crafty in playing both of lute and harp and sindry other instrumentis of musik he was expert in gramar oratry and poetry and maid so flowand and sententious versis apperit well he was ane natural and borne poet  mr walpole in his catalogue of royal and noble authors gives us this list of the works of james i  a panegyric on his queen  scotch sonnets one book one of them a lamentation while in england is in ms in the bodleian library and praises gower and chaucer exceedingly  rythmos latinos lib i  on music  he is said to have written some poetical pieces when in england which is very likely but it appears to me that peblis to the play could not be one of these he being not more than twelve years of age when he left scotland it is not to be supposed that he was so familiar with the manners of his countrymen as to paint them so minutely as is done in this poem  peblis to the play peblis or peebles is the countytown of twedale ettrick forest is not far distant from it that forest was a royal chase hence the kings of scotland frequently resided there darnley was there in the winter before his death h  play appears to me here to mean an annual festival some of which are still celebrated in

my own gray mare that threw me as or seems an error of the old transcriber indeed in old writ the words will be quite similar if i was faint and lay down to rest me if this is not the sense i leave the passage to future commentators for when christs kirk on the green boasts of such learned and respectable interpreters as bishop gibson and mr calendar it is not to be supposed that a poem of such superior antiquity and curiosity as this is will want illustration ed  st    nokks the nich in the ends of the bows in which the bowstring is inserted p  st  0 schamons dance that is the showmans

written and if we may judge from this line of no mean merit it being as smooth as could be expected at this day ed  st    settand schaftis i suspect the word schaftis has been brought from the end of the third line to this the sun settand schaftis if it means throwing darts and no other interpretation can be thought of may indeed be that kind of bastard sense that is not uncommon in old versifiers of the middling class but i believe james i would not have written it the sun was set and  or the sun was setting a word wanting would appear the proper way of reading this line ed  settand is the old termination of the participle of the present tense now altered to setting p  ib had their bein mair etc this dry joke of the kings calls to remembrance a similar stroke in the morgante maggiore of pulci where a hermit in the middle of an interesting story breaks off by telling the knight his guest and auditor that his candle is done that he has no more and must of consequence go to bed ed  ii christs kirk on the green this edition is given from the last entitled two ancient scottish poems the gaberlunzie man and christs kirk on the green with notes and observations by john calendar esquire of craigforth edinburgh       vo bishop gibsons edition of this ballad printed at oxford      from bannatynes ms is the earliest edition i am sorry however to see mr calendar quoting ramsays edition for some parts of his text as there certainly never was a more ignorant or rash transcriber of ancient scottish poetry than allan ramsay he seems to have considered it as very much his property and to have exercised his own profession upon it by shaving curling and powdering it at his will and pleasure mr calendar might have given us a transcript of this piece from bannatynes ms in the advocates library at edinburgh in which dr percy has observed in a ms note christs kirk on the green is very different from what it was when filled with the innovations of allan ramsay this most ingenious and faithful of all editors of ancient english poetry has likewise the following notice prefixed to his ms copy of peblis to the play in maitlands ms the old song of christs kirk differs from all the copies i have seen in the conclusion of all the stanzas each of which ends with this line by way of burden or chorus at christis kirk on the green always preceded by some short line as in this first stanza was never in scotland hard nor seen sic dansing nor deray another in falkland on the grene nor peblis to the play as was of wowairis as i wene at chrystis kirk on ane day their come our kittie wesching clean in her new kirtil of gray full gay at chrystis kirk on the grene which i cannot help thinking is more genuine than that in the evergreen and the other editions as it so exactly resembles the conclusions of the stanzas in peblis to the play in consequence of these well founded remarks i have preserved the burden in this edition throughout  as the foregoing piece was undoubtedly written by james i of scotland so we have good authority thongh not so infallible to ascribe this to james v a prince who delighted in low manners and adventures so much as often to disguise himself in order to enjoy them he reigned from      to      a most curious account of his death may be found in knoxs history of the reformation of religion in scotland he was the zerbino of ariosto and is celebrated by ronsard in as good verses as ever came from his pen  the notes of mr calendar are fraught with that knowledge of northern literature for which he is so justly celebrated and though my opinion can add nothing to the general suffrage i cannot help saying that for universal science of northern antiquities and languages mr calendar may justly be regarded as the most learned man in europe i am sorry to see he takes no notice of a work he published a specimen of some time ago in his present publication which leads me to fear he has dropped that grand design this was his bibliotheca septentrionalis in the manner of dherbelots bibliotheque orientale containing a complete system of northern science of every kind to be comprised in two folio volumes an amazing work and which ought to be made a national concern in his present volume he promises a glossary of the ancient scottish language but would he return to the large design above praised the fame would be infinitely greater without much greater labor words are for pedants but facts are for all there is perhaps no branch of learning more painful and less glorious than etymology to mr calendar the glossary to this volume is much obliged they who would see what vast intelligence may be bestowed in elucidating christs kirk on the green and the following piece called the gaberlunyie man are referred to his work  i must remind the reader of a curious circumstance which is that sappho the celebrated poetess wrote a ballad if i may so call it on a country wedding which is mentioned by demetrius phalereus and which i doubt not resembled this he observes she made the rustic bridegroom and the porter speak in mean and vulgar language though she was herself happy in the most exquisite expression where it was to be used with propriety see them phal     and seq  christs kirk on the green the kirktown of leslie near falkland in fife  st   falkland on the green dr percy observes there possibly once existed a scottish song of this title could this be recovered he adds the subject would be complete  st   as any rose etc the alliteration in the first of these two lines is happy in the second unfortunate and harsh lire signifying flesh nor skin  st   morreis dance is so called from the moors its inventors as they were of the fiddle or violin pulci mentions it as used in the days of charles the great but i suppose on no authority avea cerbante fatti torneamenti e giostre e feste e balli alla moresea morgante mag canto iv st    curious notices with regard to it may be seen in the last edition of shakspere  st    fie he had slain a priest that is committed the most atrocious of murders to kill a priest was thought to unite sacrilege and murder cardinal beaton was sensible of this when he cried upon receiving his mortal wound i am a priest i am a priest fie fie all is gone see knox  iii the gaberlunyie man is likewise ascribed to james v but i am afraid upon no authority if it is his the stanza flows amazingly smooth indeed from stanza ii it would appear the writer wished to have it ascribed to james i the first lines of that stanza bearing an analogy to his imprisonment in england the nature and naivete of this piece are exquisite  st i for your courtesy that is by your courtesy an adjuration  ib ayont the ingle that is beyond the fire the warmest place in the room in farm houses of scotland to this day the fireplace often stands in the midst of the kitchen so that the family can all sit around ingle is a word appropriated to familiar fire in scotland to call such fire is thought ominous among the country people  iv the jollie beggar is likewise ascribed to james v i believe upon no authority but a blunder of mr walpoles who confounds this with the former the adventure may be the kings but i suspect the description is anothers this piece is no less spirited than the former the transitions to opposite passions in both are described in such a rapid and easy manner as would have done credit to the first comic writer  v the vision in a letter which the editor received some time ago from the author of the minstrel the following remarks are made upon this poem which being of so good a judge will he doubts not have great weight with the reader  the best scottish poem of modern times that i have seen for though the title pretends that it was written four hundred years ago i have reason to think that it was produced in this century is called the vision i am inclined to think that the author of it whoever he was must have read arbuthnots history of john bull but there are noble images in it and a harmony of versification superior to every thing i have seen in the kind i suspect that is the work of some friend of the family of stuart and that it must have been composed about the year       st   saya fere fere for mate is a common word in ancient scottish the scottish writers even carried it into england with them as we may observe in the tragedies of william alexander of menstrie london   0   st    it is with regret i observe that the latter part of this stanza is still applicable many scottish peers have not sufficient spirit to slight english gold but ignobly to this hour barter the liberties of their country and their own independence for it may execration pursue their memories scotland is perhaps at this day the only country in europe to which the philosophical light of liberty has not penetrated to oppose a foolish or corrupt minister is with my countrymen to oppose legal power one of their most celebrated writers is just now engaged at a rated salary to defend the cause of corruption  not all his talents will save him from the contempt of more enlightened posterity  st    this ludicrous description of the drunken gods is perfectly risible nothing in midas or the golden pippin can exceed it the several attributes are finely preserved  st    bruce is here used for him the jacobites esteem legal heir of the crown the principles of this poem are utterly detested by the editor as they are by every friend of mankind he only gives it as a piece of fine writing in its way the unhappy attachment to the family of stuart has wasted the finest estates and shed some of the best blood in scotland it now exists only in the breasts of old women  the real bruce robert i was a hero if ever any such existed the finest epic poem in the world might be founded on his story the famous history of the valiant bruce in heroic verse by patrick gordon gentleman dort      reprinted at edinburgh

scotland during the   th century sir david lindsay wrote several interludes  by the way sir david lindsay was once a most popular author in scotland witness the proverb its no in davie lindsay meaning any thing out of the common road he was in great celebrity in his own life time about the period of the reformation a story is told of an honest farmer who being on his deathbed a pious neighbor brought an english bible to read to him the dying man had to that day never known of such a book and upon hearing some of its miraculous contents cried out hoot awa bring me davie lindsay that is all a made story  st   fyn mackowl better known in england says lord hales under the modernised name of fingal  concerning this personage whether real or imaginary there are innumerable legends in the highlands of scotland he is more celebrated as a giant then as the hero of ossian  on the next line that dang the devil etc his lordship observes this may allude to the contest with the spirit of loda here let me observe that to doubt fingal and temora being ancient compositions is indeed a refinement in skepticism they contain various allusions to the manners of other times which have escaped the observation of mr macpherson himself  the editor has been called a zealous defender of the antiquity of ossian by those who had not understanding enough to perceive the scope of his dissertation on the oral tradition of poetry which only attempts to prove that poetry may be a long time preserved by tradition without the slightest reference to ossians antiquity but from probability only of preservation which the candid reader will confess to be no argument these people will stare when he assures them that so far from being an advocate of ossians antiquity he does not regard twenty pages in the whole work as ancient and has always expressed that notion nay be must add that if not two lines in the poems of ossian are ancient that circumstance would if infallibly proved give an infinite addition in his opinion to their superlative merit so little has he of the spirit of an antiquary  st   three stanzas are here omitted as full of filth without humor to palliate it  xii ane ballat of

answered him and said she was right glad there to see a gentleman of our isle and told him that she was a scottish woman and came first from scotland to venice and from venice thither where her fortune was to be the wife of an officer under the turk who being at that instant absent and very soon to return she entreated the gentleman to stay there until his return the which he did and she for countrysake to show herself the more kind and bountiful unto him told her husband at his homecoming that the gentleman was her kinsman whereupon her husband entertained him very kindly and at his
