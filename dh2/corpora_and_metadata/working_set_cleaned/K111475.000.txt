  the grecian history from the end of the peloponnesian war to the death of philip of macedon containing the space of sixtyeight years  by temple stanyan esquire  volume the second now originally published  london printed for j and r tonson in the strand mdccxxxix  preface having promised a second volume of this history when i published the first it is now become a debt of so many years standing that i dont know whether the bare discharging it will be thought sufficient without saying something in excuse for my having deferred it so long and yet upon second thoughts i believe i might easily have been forgiven if i had never discharged it for the world is not so rigid in demanding debts of this kind as we authors imagine but to deal plainly i have been many years employed in business of another kind though i must confess it has been with very little advantage to the public or myself and much less do i propose any great benefit to arise to either from this undertaking however it has served to shift the scene a little and to gratify my own inclinations in renewing my acquaintance with those studies which i have formerly pursued  i have pleased myself with the thoughts of doing some sort of justice to the memory of a race of worthies who may be called the first assertors of public liberty and if i have not succeeded so well in it as i could wish i hope it will be imputed rather to the nature of the subject than to any want of my endeavors in the former part of this history i did not find it an easy task to take off that veil of fable and fiction which has been thrown over the first ages of greece and to introduce in the room of it something like the coloring of history and even in the later times which are called historical i have met with too much intricacy and confusion in the treating of so many separate states in unravelling their different interests in describing their different manners and customs and forms of government and in connecting the whole with the body of the story  in the progress of this work i have found more difficulties of this kind than i apprehended at my first entrance upon it and it is that which i believe has chiefly discouraged others from undertaking it for i cannot otherwise conceive how it should happen that the history of a country which has been the scene of so much action within itself and which has given birth to so many great events in other parts of the world should be so much neglected i do not mean that it has been wholly buried in the rust and ruins of antiquity but it certainly has not received a due proportion of those improvements which have been made of late years both in ancient and modern history as well as in other arts and sciences for though there have been many parts of the affairs of the grecians extracted from their historians and biographers poets orators and philosophers with great variety of glosses and comments upon em yet they are in such detached pieces and so unmethodizd that they can only serve as the groundwork for a more regular composition and as such i have made use of them there are some collections of this kind which are more in the form of history but the facts contained in them are related in so dry and lifeless a manner that there is nothing of the true spirit of greece in them and a further objection to them is that they are intermixed with the affairs of other nations which have no relation to them this is the method observed by the writers of universal history whose chief merit is the preserving the order of time but for the sake of that they invert the order of place and hurry you on from one country to another without any natural agreement or connection such a confused variety of matter may do well enough when it is comprised in those short compendiums of chronology which are designed to imprint on the memory the dates of the most remarkable events as they have happened in the world but the relating things at length in an historical way and blending together sacred story and profane ancient and modern foreign and domestic as it distracts the mind of the reader too much so it is a work of too great labor and extent for the writer to be thoroughly executed  he who has succeeded best in this way is monsieur rollin who has culled out the flowers of the grecian story and interspersed them in the accounts which he has given of the other ancient kingdoms and commonwealths but besides the relating things by piecemeal in the confused manner beforementioned he has omitted several particulars which are material and in others which are not so he is too circumstantial and his reflections though they are generally just are too frequent and too tedious too trite and obvious and too juvenile however they may be suited to the design of his province in the institution of youth and may serve as lectures to instill into their minds principles of virtue and morality they are not so agreeable as they should be to the laws of history which will allow of very few reflections but such as naturally arise to the reader from a simple relation of facts or such at least as are interwoven in the body of the story so as not to break the thread of it i would not be thought to detract from the merit of a work which has met with a pretty general approbation and is now in every bodys hands the author has certainly taken great care and pains in it he is copious in his matter faithful in his authorities and clear and easy in his narration and there is a spirit of liberty throughout the whole which is well suited to the subject and which few of his countrymen except monsieur tourreil have attained to wherefore though i had composed the following sheets before his history appeared in the world i will freely own that it has been of service to me in the revisal of them  i must likewise acknowledge the lights i have received in several passages of this history from the grecian antiquities of the most reverend the lord archbishop of canterbury who is no less eminent for his extensive knowledge in all parts of learning than for his other great qualities and however this work may have served as an amusement to his grace in the early course of his studies it cannot now be thought unworthy of his more advanced age nor unbecoming either his holy profession or his high station  just before i sent these sheets to the press i met with the history of epaminondas lately published at paris by the abbe de la tour being intended to supply the loss of that life of him which was wrote by plutarch i likewise received a discourse in manuscript upon the same subject which had been pronounced in the academy of the belles lettres and inscriptions by the abbea gedoyn and which was communicated to me in a very obliging manner from monsieur de fontenelle i was desirous to see if any thing material had escaped me in my account of the greatest man of greece and the perusal of these two pieces has served to clear up to me some doubtful passages concerning him and to confirm me in others  as to this second part of the grecian story it contains the transactions of sixty eight years which is not a twentieth part of the time comprised in the first volume but what it wants in the number of years is made up in the variety of events and the fullness of the materials this compass of time together with the twentyseven preceding years of the peloponnesian war was the most active and bustling age of the grecians who when they were freed from the danger of a foreign enemy fell into such dissensions as turned the edge of the sword against themselves and ended in the destruction of that liberty which they had so gloriously defended there were still among them some true patriots who aimed at nothing further than the general safety of greece and an equal balance among the several commonwealths but it was the fixing and preserving this balance which created so much difficulty and disturbance among so many different governments and popular assemblies it was hardly possible to avoid confusion and discord and the demagogues and other artful and designing men from hence took occasion to perplex and inflame matters still more in order to carry on their own selfish views at the expense of the public there was one part of the constitution of greece well designed to remedy these inconveniences and that was the council of the amphictyons who were in the nature of states general and were intended not only to provide for the common good and safety of the whole but to decide the differences and adjust the pretensions of each particular state and great regard was paid to their determinations but though they were convened twice a year it was mostly for formsake so that except upon some very extraordinary occasions they seldom did any thing that answered the end of their institution the grecians had other specious shows of liberty and their public harangues were full of it but it was chiefly in show and in words for the spirit of it was in a great measure lost the band of amity which had united them against the persians was dissolved the open generous and disinterested valor which they showed upon that occasion began daily to degenerate into sloth and luxury faction and corruption fraud and violence the greater states devoured the lesser and then preyed upon one another in short the great bone of contention now among them was the sovereignty of greece which most of them aspired to in their turns and still as one competitor failed in it there started up another such was the convulsive state of greece at the time of the peloponnesian war and so it continued as long as it was a nation there were indeed some quiet intervals but they were short and such as served rather to recover breath than to settle any course of tranquillity  in relating these wars of the grecians among themselves the reader is not to expect such great and surprising incidents as those which happened in their defense against the persians he will not meet with such numerous armies as those which came with all the power of the east like n inundation upon them nor with such signal victories as those which have perpetuated the names of marathon salamis plataea and mycale the efforts which were then made for the public liberty had something more than human in them and are not to be accounted for according to the ordinary course of nature but however the eclat of these illustrious actions may raise our attention and admiration yet an account of the intestine quarrels which succeeded them will furnish us with more of that useful knowledge and instruction which is to be drawn from history there were fewer numbers then brought into the field and less blood shed but the merit of these later victories consisted more in the skill and conduct of the generals and the discipline of the troops than in the number of the slain there were more feints and stratagems marches and countermarches incampments and decampments more surprising of garrisons intercepting of convoys debauching of allies and cluding of treaties in short the grecians were now become much more expert and refined in the art of war and less prodigal of their lives than when they had nothing but an hardy desperate valor to oppose to the multitudes of the barbarians and when by that glorious stand made at thermopylae one part of them devoted themselves to certain death for the preservation of the rest hence it was that these civil discords were protracted to a greater length than could otherwise have been imagined for considering the heat and rancour with which they were carried on and that the scene of action lay in so narrow a compass as greece strictly so called it might naturally have been expected that things would sooner have been brought to some general issue and that by some decisive stroke one of the principal republics would have made an entire conquest of the whole besides the reasons already given for the long continuance and the fatal issue of these wars another material one may be assigned which is that the grecians were not content to decide their own quarrel without interesting foreign powers in it most of them to their eternal reproach as they found themselves distressed made mean applications to their old enemies the persians who had found out the secret of fomenting their divisions and supporting one state against another in order to weaken the whole philip afterward improved upon the example the persians had set him and thus in the end the grecian liberties were lost the means by which this change was effected and the struggles which were now and then made by particular persons and states for recovering the ancient honor of greece is chiefly the subject of this volume  here it may not be improper to observe that notwithstanding these commotions with which the whole country was more or less agitated arts and sciences received daily improvement and were carried on to a great degree of perfection and there was more politeness and civility more policy and intrigue more good writing and speaking and a greater variety of men eminent in all professions than in any other period of time in greece or in any other country in that age of the world and as a thorough knowledge of the lives and characters of these famous men does very much conduce to the knowledge of the history of the times they lived in i have therefore been the more exact in describing them so as to distinguish their good and bad qualities and to show in what manner and in what degree they have been beneficial or hurtful to their country in the doing this i have found it difficult to reconcile the different accounts which have been given of them by some of the historians of those times who often clash with one another and sometimes even with themselves all that i could do in this case was to compare them together to supply the defects of one out of another and to extract out of the whole those particulars which appeared to me the most rational and probable and most consistent with the common known character of the person i was describing i have observed the same method with regard to facts as well as persons throughout the course of this history and where i have met with any essential difference or manifest contradiction i have taken notice of it as such in the body of the story  if we consider how many volumes relating to the affairs of the grecians have been lost we might expect more confusion and greater chasms in their story than there really are but it happens very fortunately that some of their best writers and of the best authority are still remaining particularly thucydides xenophon and demosthenes who had a great share in the transactions they relate and were otherwise most remarkable for their probity and veracity so that the groecia mendax of juvenal cannot be thought applicable to these writers or to the times in which they flourished but must be understood only of the fabulous age which undoubtedly is a fitter subject for the extravagancies of poetry than for the gravity of an historian i have accordingly considered it in that light and have gone no further into it than i found necessary in order to make a beginning and to introduce the more solid and authentic parts of the story and herein i am sufficiently warranted by the example of our own historians who have not contented themselves with the wild accounts of the ancient britons but have had recourse to the trojan brute as our founder and the scottish writers begin their relations from a son of cecrops the athenian or of argus who lived an hundred years before him and though there is no great stress laid upon these early accounts they are sufficient to show that we have grafted upon the same stock of fable as the grecians or rather carried it further and grafted one fable upon another and the same vaniy has prevailed in several other parts of europe  here i cannot help observing how much it is to the honor of greece that so many nations have laid claim to her as their common mother and that they have invented so many fictions and forgeries to be considered as grecian colonies when they might more naturally and with more credibility have drawn their descent from some imaginary heroes of their own but it was the established fame and the real merit of greece that made them so fond of being allied to her it was the learning wit and delicacy of athens the laws and discipline of sparta and the valor and love of liberty throughout the whole country which put them upon forming these pretensions in hopes that by calling themselves grecians they should be thought to inherit their virtues and to act upon their principles and in some respects they have copied after them particularly in their forms of government which have served as models to several considerable states in this part of the world but with such variations and improvements as the wisdom of the later ages has found necessary for though the general plan of government in greece was founded upon principles of liberty there were great errors and defects in it which i have cursorily taken notice of in relating the tumults and disorders that have been occasioned by them some of these imperfections are still retained in the republics which are now subsisting in europe and others have been added by refining too much and aiming at more perfection than that sort of government is capable of i know there have been several attempts to show that there may be such a thing as a perfect commonwealth but how plausible soever the arguments for it may appear in writing they are not easily to be reduced to practice so as to prevent the tyranny of the few in an oligarchy or the licentiousness of the many in a democracy this was the case of the two principal states of greece upon which most of the others were founded  in sparta indeed according to the settlement of lycurgus there was the appearance of a limited monarchy but it was too limited first by the authority of the senate and afterward of the ephori who though they were originally instituted only as a barrier between the senate and the people soon became the supreme magistrates and were superior to the kings in every thing but the name however the government subsisted long under this form and the roman commonwealth was founded upon it the consuls answering to the two spartan kings and the tribunes of the people to the ephori but these roman magistrates had greater power and made a worse use of it especially the tribunes who under color of protecting the people in their just rights became the authors of most of the seditions tumults murders and civil discord which happened in the most busy times of the commonwealth as in sparta the power of the kings was too much restrained so in athens the power of the people was too excessive and nothing but some middle scheme between these extremes can be supposed to answer the true ends of government i might from hence take occasion to extol the happiness of our own constitution which is so equally poised by a due distribution of power on the one hand and of liberty on the other but perhaps some may think the boundary lines between them are drawn so fine as not to be easily perceptible at least this is the most plausible pretense for the many partydisputes among us and the best way of accounting for our frequent alarms and jealousies lest one part of the constitution should break in and make encroachments upon the other these are bad effects but they proceed from a good cause and however some particulars may be affected by them they have seldom gone so far as to endanger the safety of the whole so that notwithstanding these inconveniences we are in the main much happier than any of our neighbors who reproach us with them and our liberty is better secured to us than it could be in any of the republics of greece or in any of those regal governments in europe which though they were formed upon the same model with ours have now very little remains of their original institution i have made a further digression from my subject than i intended but in speaking of the grecian governments and of those which have been grafted upon them i could not as an englishman resist the temptation of saying something in preference of our own which is certainly the nearest to perfection and is attended with very few evils but such as are of our own making  but to return to greece i have rather chose to finish my account of it with the death of philip of macedon than to carry it on to his successor for the affairs of alexander besides that they are already related by others in a fuller and more unbroken manner than those of the preceding times are not strictly speaking to be looked upon as a continuation of the grecian story since they relate almost entirely to macedonia and persia some indeed of the grecians took occasion from the absence of alexander in his eastern expedition to attempt the recovery of their liberty but he soon returned upon them and by the destruction of thebes and the victory afterward obtained over the peloponnesians by antipater his viceroy in macedonia he struck such a terror into the whole country that he kept them in a quiet subjection so that if he had lived to return again into grecce he would have found it very easy to annex it to his own dominions and to destroy the very name of it however the grecians still subsisted but in so low and lifeless a condition that from the time of alexanders captains till they were subdued by the romans there were very few among them who were distinguished for arms and counsels and not many for arts and learning so that except the famous league of the achaian under aratus and philopoemen and the endeavors of agis and cleomenes to recover the state of sparta from the encroachments of the ephori

athens that though she gathered strength enough to survive it she could never perfectly recover it from a prospect of bringing the war o an happy issue she found herself in one hour reduced to the lowest ebb of fortune and lay at the mercy of those whom she had so lately insulted for the terms obtained by the las treaty amounted to little more than surrendering at discretion so that from hence we man date the fall of the athenian empire which began soon after the defeat of the persians at my cale and continued about seventy three years however the conquerors were so generous a not wholly to extinguish the name of athen they said they would not be guilty of putting ou one of the eyes of greece and this agrees wit what plutarch relates of lysander that when h sent word to sparta that the athenians were taken the magistrates wrote back to him it is su ficient to have taken them but it is certain they imposed some further marks of their conque on them of which the most particular was that they obliged the people to break up th democracy and submit to the government o thirty men who are commonly known by the name of the thirty tyrants the thirty tyrants a m   0  olymp      this change wa owing chiefly to lysander who about the same time introduced the oligarchy into samos an other places which he took in as tributary t athens in most of them he established a d cemvirate which was modeled according to hi directions and made up of his own creature and thus he treated not only the enemies bu the allies of sparta by which means he had in manner engrossed to himself the whole empire  greece  having settled his conquests lysander returns in triumph to sparta he returned in triumph to sparta with the athenian and other galleys and fifteen hundred talents in money together with a great deal of rich booty besides the crowns of gold and other presents which had been made him by the several cities he sent the money to sparta in sealed bags by gylippus who ripping up the bottom of the bags took out as much as he thought fit and then sewed them up again but there happened to be a note in each bag specifying the sum contained in it which gylippus not being apprisd of the fraud by this means was detected and thereupon either to avoid punishment or out of shame for having been guilty of so mean an action he banished himself and never afterward appeared in sparta  there was a further consideration in regard to this treasure whether according to the spartan laws it ought to be received into the city many of the soberest and most discreet among them opposed the introducing it and they were the more confirmed in their opinion from this instance of gylippus who they found had been so far influenced by money as to give up every thing else for it and to sully all the glory of his past actions for he was otherwise a man of great reputation and had acquitted himself extremely well in the war of sicily where he had the command of the spartan troops and it was owing chiefly to him that the athenians did not make themselves masters of that island hereupon the ephori were obliged to pass a decree that none but the old iron money of the country should be made current but lysanders friends would not yet give it up they resumed the debate and got the decree reversed or at least so far qualified that this money though it was to be admitted into the city was to be employed only on public occasions and it was made capital to convert it to any private use but this did not answer the intent of lycurgus which was by prohibiting the use of gold and silver to restrain covetousness and luxury plutarch observes upon this occasion that the ill consequence of riches was not so effectually prevented by forbidding the use of money in private as it was encouraged by allowing it in public that therefore this sort of prohibition only heightened their desires and that if their actions did not presently break out at least their affections were tainted whatever was pretended of laying in a fund to supply the exigencie of the state the use of money had now got footing among them they began to know the valu of it as well as their neighbors and raised  by more arbitrary and oppressive methods didorus siculus says they exacted tribute fro all the cities under their jurisdiction and tre surd up a thousand talents every year upon the whole it is certain that the introducing the treasure was in effect a change in the constintion it softened their minds so as to prepare them for corruption and in short was the first great step toward their throwing off that rugged virtue which distinguished them so much from the rest of greece this change was owing entirely to lysander who sacrificed every thing to his ostentation and vanity and stuck at no expense to gratify them he erected his own and several of the chief commanders statues in brass he was very liberal to those of his retinue and gave such encouragement to the poets that they complimented him with songs of triumph and employed all their art in his praises the grecians in general were so awed with his merit that they erected altars to his honor and sacrificed to him as a god  in the mean time while the thirty in athens the proceedings of the thirty instead of compiling and publishing a more perfect body of laws which was the pretense or their being chosen began to exert their power of life and death and though they constituted a senate and other magistrates they made no further use of them than to confirm their authority and to see their commands executed however they at first acted cautiously and condemned only the most detested and scandalous part of the citizens such as lived by evidening and informing but this was only to give a color to their proceedings their design was to make themselves absolute and knowing that was not to be done without a foreign power their next step was to desire a guard might be sent them from sparta till such time as they could clear the city of all disaffected persons and thoroughly settle the government lysander accordingly procured them a guard under the command of callibius whom by bribes and artifices they worked over to their designs and then acted without control filling the city with the blood of those who on account of their riches interest or good qualities were most likely to make head against them the most violent among them was critias who resolved to reek his revenge on the people by whom he had formerly been banished theramenes protests against them the first who protested against these proceedings was theramenes one of their own memhers and lest he should joi with the multitude against them they investe three thousand of the citizens with some part o the power and by their assistance disarmed the rest being thoroughly emboldened by such a accession to their party they agreed to singl out every one his man to put them to death and seize their estates for the maintenance o their garrison amongst whom was nicerat the son of nicias a man of the greatest esta and interest in athens and of so sweet and obliging a temper that he was universally l mented but being still jealous of theramene who was struck with horror at their proposal they found it necessary to remove him out of t way is accused by critias and thereupon critias accused him to  senate of endeavoring to subvert the government from thence he took occasion to justify their proceedings in general as that it was necessary to abridge the people in some measure of that liberty with which they had so long been pampered that all changes of government were attended with blood and therefore it was no wonder that they had so many enemies but that it was unpardonable in one of their own order to desert them and to betray that power which by accepting a share of it he had promised to maintain theramenes made so full and handsome a defense that the senate were inclined to favor him which critias perceiving and knowing that as one of the three thousand he had a privilege of being tried in form he struck his name out of the list in order to subject him more immediately to their censure it was justly urged by theramenes that it was as easy to blot out any other mans name as his and that therefore they ought to make his case their own but as they were under no present apprehension of that kind or rather that they were awed by a guard which critias had placed before the bar of the court they durst not oppose the tyrants who taking advantage of their silence is condemned and executed immediately passed sentence of death upon him which he suffered by the juice of hemlock when he had drank his dose he threw away what was left in the cup and said this to honest critias socrates whose disciple he had been was the only one of the senate who ventured to appear in his defense he made an attempt to rescue him out of the hands of the officer of justice and after his execution went about as it were in defiance of the thirty exhorting and animating the senators and citizens against them critias who had likewise been his scholar was so alarmed and incensed at his behavior that he forba him instructing the youth but he went o with the same intrepidity and without any regard to his authority the tyrants whethe they were awed with his merit or his resolution did not think fit to proceed against him but as he continued to use the same freedom with the government it soon after cost him his life as in its proper place will be more particularly related as to theramenes the people expressed a greater concern for him than could have been expected for one of that society but he was indeed the only one among them from whom they had any thing to hope for as a barrier between them and the tyranny when he first engaged with them he was upon the strictest terms of friendship with critias and they had always acted together in concert but when he sound what measures the other was pursuing he opposed him and broke with him  he had appeared in most of the late contests betwixt the nobility and the commons his character and was active but not violent endeavoring rather to accommodate himself to both parties than to depress either from whence his enemies gave him the name of the buskin as it serves either foot but his shifting sides proceeded not so much from the unevenness of his temper as from his caution and moderation which made him distinguish betwixt the rule and the tyranny he had some time before shown his inclination to an oligarchy having been principally concerned with pisander and antiphon in introducing the government of the four hundred and in this latter instance he seems to have had some plan of that kind in his view for he thought the thirty too few to carry on the administration and proposed the adding some competent number to them on the other hand he was as much against the letting in the three thousand which he saw was only arming one part of the citizens against the rest he was according to the mildness of his nature for some middle scheme whereby the power of the multitude might be restrained but not totally abolished but whatever his designs were he had not weight enough to put them in execution and therefore sell a sacrifice to the honesty of his intentions the greatest blot upon his memory is his being instrumental in the condemnation of the admirals after the fight at arginusae  the tyrants having removed this obstacle out of their way renewed their outrages with more security taking off all whom they thought any way obnoxious or in any capacity of obstructing their designs whilst they were thu destroying with sword and rapine the wretched remainder of the citizens cast their thought on alcibiades and were struck with remorse for their last ill usage of him but as he had before overlooked their peevishness and relieved them in their extremities so neither were they now without hopes that he might appear again to rescue them and the tyrants themselves were so apprehensive of it that they were very solicitous to get intelligence of all his designs and actions critias at last represented to lysander that either the government or alcibiades must fall and after many solicitations so far prevailed that orders were given to dispatch him he resided at that time in a small village in phrygia where he was making an interest with pharnabazus to recommend him to his master artaxerxes lysander made it a request to pharnabazus to deliver him up either alive or dead and laid such stress upon it that he seemed to make it a condition of the league between the spartans and the persians he consented to it and committed the execution to his brother and his uncle who surrounding the house where he dwelt with his mistress timandra set fire to it alcibiades threw in great quantities of clothes and furniture to choke the flame then with his robe on his left arm and his sword in the other hand he made his way through it which the assassins perceiving alcibiades murdered retreated and slew him at a distance with their darts and arrows some ascribe this murder to pharnabazus his own private jealousy of him others to the resentment of some young noblemen whose sister he had debauched and others say he had got into the secret of the levy that cyrus was making for the expedition against his brother and was endeavoring by the discovery of it to artaxerxes to ingratiate himself with that prince and to procure his assistance for reestabling the affairs of his country that therefore it became necessary to take him off but whatever cause they assign for his death they are generally agreed as to the manner of it which indeed was suitable to that extravagance his character with which fortune had all along treated him and therein she did but second the variety of nature who seems in his composition to have worked up the most jarring contradictions and to have tried how far she could go in reconciling the extremes of vice and virtue but it is to be doubted whether his virtues ought upon a strict examination to bear that name and whether they ought not rather to be called extraordinary talents and endowments and ways of recommending himself they had more of artifice and design of popularity and ostentation than of any real principle of honor and justice or love of his country and therefore valcrius maximus makes it a question whether his good or bad qualities were most hurtful to the public by the former says he he deceived his fellowcitizens and by the latter he ruined them h first insinuated himself into their confidence and then put them upon fruitless and desperat projects particularly that fatal expedition against sicily where their fleets and armies moulderd away when they had need enough of them a home and this paved the way for their tota overthrow by lysander his view in these enterprises was not only to procure honor to himself but also to make himself necessary and to keep the people employed so that they should not be at leisure to inquire into his conduct he likewise found his account in the presents that were made him abroad and in that respect he was both greedy and corrupt and yet his taking them was not so much for the sake of the money as to support his popularity and luxury his natural bent was certainly pleasure and yet as much as he loved it he made it give way to his ambition but he was so violent and withal so irregular and capricious in the pursuit of it that there was no living with him upon any equal sooting he was any thing and every thing by fits and starts and just as it suited his present purpose one while for the oligarchy and then as great a stickler for the democracy one while in the spartan interest in order to revenge himself of his country and then in the persian in order to be reconciled to it the people it must be confesd were no less unequal and inconstant in their behavior to him from whence it happened that according to the temper they were in or according to the occasion they had for his service he was looked upon as the best or worst member of the commonwealth and was either caressed and adored or detested and persecuted and yet upon the whole they had such an opinion of his merit that though they were never easy with him they never thought themselves safe without him plutarch makes a remark that his enemies could never get the better of him but in his absence which must be attributed to his subtilty and address and more especially to the amiableness of his person and the force of his eloquence which nepos says no body could resist but though by these means he captivated the generality of the citizens yet the gravest and most considerable among them saw further into the disguise and were more upon their guard against him upon this occasion the warning that was given them by timon the manhater of what they were to expect from him may be worth remembering it happened one day that alcibiades having succeeded well in an oration the whole assembly attended to compliment him upon it and timon instead of avoiding him as he did others in the like cases put himself in his way and taking him by the hand said go on boldly my son may thou increase in credit with the people for thou will one day bring them calamities enough he was scarce above forty years old when he died by which time he had done enough to make himself by turns the support and terror not only of his own country but of several other parts both in greece and asia and he had been still greater if he had been as careful to preserve the peoples love as he was to obtain it but the management of prosperity was not his talent and therefore the fairest view of him is to be taken from his sufferings which as they were often unjust set off his good qualities to a greater advantage and consequently made his fall the more lamented especially at a time when he was so much wanted having given a general character of this great man when i first mentioned him i have here only added such further observations as were necessary to illustrate it and which have naturally occurred upon a more distinct survey of his actions  the inhabitants not being able to bear the severe treatment they met with from the thirty fled daily in great numbers out of the city by which means all greece was overspread with athenian exiles till at last the spartans published an edict forbidding any of their cities to receive them so that they were forced to betake themselves to thebes and argos and such other places where they could live in any tolerable security  the first who appeared to stem this torrent thrasybulus opposes the thirty was thrasybulus who had done good service in the peloponnesian war insomuch that alcibiades is said to owe most of his success to his acting in concert with him but his merit being not of so glaring a kind was in a great measure eclipsed by that general till it broke out upon this occasion of exerting himself alone and in such a cause as the subversion of tyranny at thebes he fell into a consultation with his fellowcitizens and the result was that some vigorous effort though it carried never so much danger with it ought to be made for the recovery of the public liberty accodingly with a party of thirty men only as nepos says but as xenophon more probably says of near seventy he seized upon phyle a strong castle on the frontiers of attica this enterprise gave the alarm to the tyrants who immediately marched out of the city with the three thousand and their spartan guard and attempted the recovery of the place but were repulsed with loss finding they could not carry it by a sudden assault they resolved upon a siege but being not sufficiently provided for that service and a great snow falling that night they were forced to retire the next day into the city leaving only part of their guard to prevent any further excursions into the country  by this first success thrasybulus had increased his followers to the number of seven hundred his success with which he made a sally upon the guards and dispersed and routed them with the slaughter of about an hundred and twenty the thirty in the mean while were under great consternation and for sear of treachery from those few who were left in the city they forced them to quit it then they fortified eleusis to serve them upon any sudden exigency as a place of retreat and to free themselves from any jealousy the inhabitants might give them they caused all who were able to bear arms to pass one by one as it were upon a review in order to compute the strength of the garrison and murdered them at the same time they attempted to corrupt thrasybulus and sent under color of treating about prisoners to make him a private offer of sharing with them in the government together with the liberty of restoring any ten of the exiles whom he should name upon condition he would dismiss the rest and come into their measures to which proposal he generously answered that he looked upon his banishment to be far more honorable than the whole power and dominion of the thirty and that be would never put up his sword till all the citizens from every part were received and restored to the liberties derived to them from their ancestors  by this time he had got together a body of a thousand men with which he marched out of phyle by night and seized on the piraeus the thirty coming with their whole strength to the relief of it he took advantage of the ground made the best disposition of his men then reminded them of the cause they were engaged in and the success they had hitherto met with and offered the enemy battle wherein he easily obtained the victory which indeed was more remarkable for the consequence of it than the number of the slain which were about seventy but among them were critias and hippomacbus two of the chief of the tyrants  a truce being granted for delivering up the dead bodies both sides came to a parley and thrasybulus took that occasion to expostalate with them asking them why they fled from a conqueror whom they ought rather to join as the assertor of the public liberty adding that his army was composed of citizens and not of enemies that he came not to rob or plunder than but to restore them to their own in short that his quarrel was to the tyrants not to the city then he reminded them how they were tied to one another by all the obligations of religion laws and consanguinity how they had served in the same camp and sought under the same colors he conjured them that if they themselves could paiently submit to the yoke they would at least have ome pity for their fellowcitizens who were baished for no other reason but because they would ot be slaves concluding that if they would restore him to his country he would restore them to their liberty it is probable this speech may be consounded with another to the same effect by some ascribed to cleocritus but it is certain i made such an impression upon the three thou sand especially those who had been least instrumental in these outrages that upon their return into the city they became thoroughly sensible that they ought not to let their country b ruined to support the avarice and ambition o their tyrants the thirty reinovd the issue whereof was that th thirty should be removed from the government accordingly they retired to eleusis and te others were chosen ten subsittuted in their room olym      one out of each tribe fo the administration  but this change was far from producing an good effect they follow the example of the thirty the ten copied exactly after the thirty so that the tyranny being restrained only as t the number there were the same jealousies tumults and divisions in the city the same act of injustice rapine and cruelty and many o the three thousand were too deeply involved i the guilt of the former administration not t pursue the same measures they found ther was no means of sasety or impunity lest so them but by the utter destruction of those i the piraeus accordingly they held correspondence with the thirty at eleusis and made the joint application to sparta for fresh succors so that purpose their request was seconded b lsander who represented it as a new affront o ferd to the spartans in revolting from them and dissolving the form of government which they had prescribed to them and thereupon he procured them from the state an hundred talents lysander sent to support them with a commission for himself to go general and his brother libys admiral in order to block up the piraeus by sea and land accordingly he marched with a strong body of peloponnesians and the admiral suffered no provisions to go in by sea by which means those in the piraeus were distressed on all sides  while things were in this posture pausanias sent after him pausanias one of the spartan kings got leave to follow lysander with another body to support him but his design was not so much to assist as to watch him he could not allow him the glory of conquering athens a second time and therefore went rather to trifle and perplex the war than to prosecute it to any real advantage so that what some call his commiseration of the poor athenians was in reality the envy he bore to lysander it is also observable that in making his levies for this expedition out of the forces in alliance with spara the boeotians and corinthians who had all along been the most active and professed enemies of the athenians resused now to serve against them alleging that they could not salve their oath in making war upon those who had not broke any one article of the league but the truth is they apprehended the power of the spartans concluding they would make an entire conquest of athens and annex it to their own dominions this is the first instance of that jealousy which soon after several other states of greece conceived of sparta  pausanias before any act of hostility on his side sent to those in the piraeus to depart every one to his respective home and upon their refusal having drawn up his men and made a slight attack he went to view the ground for opening the trenches but the enemy made a sally and galled him so in his retreat that from skirmishing he was forced to bring it to a regular action which was fought obstinately enough on both sides till at length the athenians were routed routs the athenians with the loss of an hundred and fifty men and pausanias erected a trophy  but instead of pushing his victory he sent privately to the athenians that they should dispatch ambassadors to him and the two ephori who attended him in the field to offer terms of accommodation accordingly they sent their deputies both from the piraeus and the city and a peace was concluded upon these conditions that every man should return home except the thirty and the ten and eleven mort who had commanded in the piraeus and if any in the city apprehended themselves to be obnoxious they should also be free to retire with them to eleusis after which pausanias drew off the spartan army and those in the piraeus marched with their arms into the city where thrasybulus having among other things reproached the citizens with their calling the spartans in to their assistance told them they had nothing further to fear provided they would be governed by their ancient laws the democracy restored and so far prevailed upon them that they chose their magistrates as formerly and restored the democracy  but the city had no sooner began to recover breath when the remainder of the faction at eleusis were hiring foreign troops in order to make another attempt whereupon the whole city went out against them and having taken their commanders upon a pretense of coming to a parley cut them to pieces after which the rest were easily brought to an accommodation and lest the remembrance of former transactions should create any new disturbances a general amnesty was passed a general amnesly and every man obliged himself by oath to bury what was passed in oblivion which being religiously observed the city was restored to its former tranquillity and its members were again united into one body  thus ended this sedition in the third after its breaking out upon the change of the government olymp      during which time the state suffered such convulsions as proved more fatal to it than the war there were fourteen hundred citizens put to death without hearing and those chiefly men of note and condition there were above five thousand more forced to fly into the piraeus and xenophon observes that this stine fury had consumed as many in eight months as the peloponnesian war did in ten years as the flame was kindled by the tyranny of the thirty so it was all along fomented and kept alive by the ambition of lysander and that it was at last extinguished is almost entirely owing to the conduct and resolution of thrasybulus who after the share he had in rescuing his country from a foreign enemy had the peculiar glory of suppressing its intestine foes and by that means of restoring the city to itself and in effecting this he showed the greatest temper and moderation which indeed were necessary in such a conjuncture to appease the minds of the people and to reconcile them to one another hence it was that this act of oblivion became a pattern to succeeding ages and cicero recommends it as such to the people of rome when the city was divided into factions upon the murder of julius caesar  upon this reestablishment of affairs in athens the other states enjoyed the same tranquillity or rather kept in a quiet subjection to sparta which now held the undoubted sovereignty of greece but it being a maxim with the spartans that this sovereignty was not to be maintained but by a constant course of action they were still seeking fresh occasions of war and part of their forces together with another body of grecians being at this time engaged in a quarrel between the persian king and his brother it will be necessary to pass over into asia and relate so much of the persian affairs as concerns the expedition of cyrus wherein those forces were employed especially since it is attended with circumstances which if duly considered will easily make it pass for one of the greatest actions of antiquity  darius the persian upon his deathbed olymp      for his two sons artaxerxes and cyrus the former whereof he declared his successor grounds of the expedition of cyrus and the other general of a part of his troops and he had before appointed him commander in chief of the maritime provinces the old king being dead tissaphernes who went up with cyrus from his government accused him to his brother of treason but upon the intercession of his mother parisatis not only his life was spared but he was confirmed in his government and yet he was no sooner returned to it but he studied how to revenge this affront and to dethrone his brother to this end he practiced with the grecians and barbarians and made levies of the best soldiers of peloponnesus in order to recruit his garrisons the pretense for which was his distrust of tissaphernes from whom he had taken all the cities of ionia except miletus and that he had blocked up by sea and land under color of restoring some whom tissaphernes had banished upon a suspicion of their betraying him the king was not much concerned at his quarrel with tissaphernes so long as he thought these levies were designed against him only and he was the more confirmed in this opinion because cyrus continued to send him up the tribute due from those places as before  cyrus in the mean while held intelligence with clearchus aristippus and other grecians who were either banished from their respective countries his making levies or disgusted in them and by their means got together upon several different pretenses one little army in the chersonese of thrace a second upon the hellespont and a third in thessaly when his designs were ripe he drained his garrisons and assembled all these scattered forces together at sardis giving out that his intent was to chastise the pisidians who infested his province his pretense for it but tissaphernes judging right that these preparations were too great for so inconsiderable an enterprise as the pisidian war haend to inform the king of it who accordingly took the alarm and prepared for his defense  at the rendezvous of the forces at sardis the rende of his for at saci there were four thousand grecians who had been drawn out of the garrisons under the command of xenias proxenus the boeotian had brought two thousand more sophaenetus the stymphalian one thousand socrates of achaia five hundred and phasion the megarean seven hundred in all to the number of eight thousand two hundred men with which cyrus marched through lydia to colossus a city of phrygia where he was joined by menon the thessalian who commanded in the room of aristippus with fifteen hundred more his next march was to celaene another city of prygia where clearchus the spartan came in to him with two thousand more sosias the syracusian with one thousand and socrates the arcadian with three hundred which made the whole number of grecians thirteen thousand whereof eleven thousand were heavyarmd  but when they were got as far as tarsus the capital of cilicia the grecians refuse to follow him they began to perceive cyruss intent of leading them into persia against his brother and refused to follow him till by the artifice of clearchus who was the only grecian in the secret of cyruss design they being convinced it was less hazardous to proceed than to retreat but are prevailed upon by clearchus began to be pacified and upon a promise of having their pay augmented to a third more they agreed to march at issus he last city of cilicia there came to them thiry five peloponnesian galleys and twenty five of cyruss which had been employed in the blockade of miletus and cherisophus the sparan joined the army with seven hundred greians which he had on board the galleys four hundred more who were in the pay of abrocomas deserted from him and came in to cyrus this abrocomas commanded upon the euphrates and marched with three hundred thousand men to join the kings army but did not arrive till after the battle  when they were arrived upon the coasts of phaenicia xenias and sion de xenias and phasion deserted from them and made their escape on board a merchant ship which cyrus did not resent in such a manner as was expected he only told the other captains that no body should reproach him with keeping them in his service against their will or with taking from them what they had got in it that it was in his power to pursue and punish them but that he was so far from doing either that he would send to them their wives and children which be had as hostages by this generous proceeding he fixed the resolution of those who before had no great inclination to proceed  when they came to thapsacus a city upon the euphrates cyrus told them plainly his design of marching against the king at which the soldiers murmured the greciansagain refuse to march and reproached their officers with having kept it so long secret refusing at the same time to march any further till cyrus promised them a further reward upon their arrival at babylon but are again prevailed upon together with their full pay to their return into ionia menon was also very instrumental in persuading them for which cyrus made him presents to a considerable value  from thence they marched through mesopotamia and at last advanced into the province of bablyon where cyrus upon the return of those who had been sent to reconnoitre the enemy advised with the grecian captains and then spoke to them to this effect it is not my friends cyruss speech to the grecian captains for want of troops that i have made choice of you but because i have thought you were better to me than a great number of barbarians dont let me be deceived in my opinion of you but show your selves worthy of that liberty which you enjoy and which i think preferable to all other possessions consider only who you have to do with and nothing can happen in the engagement to dishearten you the enemy indeed is very numerous and will rush upon you with great shouts and acclamations but if you can stand this first eclat you your selves will be ashamed for them afterward if you behave upon this occasion like your selves and any one shall afterward desire to return home his countrymen shall have cause to look upon him with admiration and envy but many of you i believe will rather choose to stay with me and accept the offers that shall be made you there was a certain samian who took the liberty of telling the prince that his promises were very large in proportion to the danger of his enterprise but that after the battle he would forget them or that if he did not he would not have it in his power to perform them to which cyrus replied this kingdom of my fathers is so extensive that one part of it is not habitable by reason of the heat nor the other by reason of the cold all that lies between these two extremes it will be in my power if i am victorious to bestow on my friends neither am i so much afraid of not having enough to give as of not having men enough to give it to and as for you grecians i promise to give every man of you a crown of gold upon which assurances they went away very well satisfied clearchus afterward asked him if he thought the king would give him battle yes undoubtedly said he if he be the son of darius and parisatis and my brother he will not let me take possession of all this without striking a stroke for it  upon a general review of his army he reviews his army he found it composed of ten thousand and four hundred heavyarmd grecians two thousand five hundred others and an hundred thousand of other nations and the enemy by the accounts they had from deserters amounted to twelve hundred thousand men besides a select body of six thousand horse he then formed his army and forms it giving to clearchus the command of the right wing of grecians and menon the lest and marched in order of battle expecting every hour to engage but the enemy having left a pass open to him which he thought they would have disputed he pursued his march with more security and less order till at last being arrived at the place where he intended to encamp he discovered the kings army by a thick cloud of dust and prepared to receive them he ordered clearchus to charge directly into the center where the king was for that thereupon depended the whole success of the battle but the enemy being so numerous that one of their wings would cover the whole front of cyruss army he thought it not advisable to abandon the river for sear of being surrounded by them which plutarch blames him for as having left that service to cyrus and thereby occasioned his death when he had let the enemy advance within four or five hundred paces of him the grecians began the hymn to battle the battle and marched up to them with great acclamations but before they were got within reach of their javelins the barbarians fled and the grecians after them calling out to one another not to break their ranks in the pursuit cyrus perceived the grecians were victorious yet was not transported with it though he was already saluted king by those about him at length he discovered the king his brother in the midst of the battle and for fear he should fall upon the grecians in their pursuit and cut them off he made up directly to him with six hundred horse and with his own hand killed artagerses who commanded the kings six thousand horse but when he had broke their squadrons all his own people abandoned him except a few of his domestics with whom he charged on to the king and crying out i see him threw a javelin at him and wounded him in the stomach but at the same time received a wound himself under his eye cyrus killed and was killed upon the spot with eight of his principal attendants the king orders his head and right hand to be cut off and then pushed on to cyruss camp in pursuit of ariaeus who commanded his horse and had fled as soon as he had heard of his masters death the grecians at the same time were in pursuit of one part of the kings army whils the other part of it were plundering their camp so that both sides thought themselves victorious the king returned upon them in the same order of battle as at first but the barbarians fled again on all sides upon the approach of the grecians who being very much fatigued and night drawing on returned to their camp not knowing what was become of cyrus but expecting his orders the next day to complete their victory when the news arrived to them the next morning of cyruss death it occasioned a general consternation and they were now to deliberate not so much to annoy the enemy a to provide for their own safety  this was the success of the battle which wa fought at cunaxa in assyria on the banks o the river euphrates about an hundred league from babylon and thus sell cyrus in the pursuit of his ambition which yet was attende with so many good qualities that he deserved better fate and it is very probable from the circumstances of the action that if he had been more cautious in exposing himself he had carried his point the character of this prince is finely drawn by xenophon but not to enter further into the persian affairs than is necessary to my present purpose i will only observe of him in general from that historian that no body of his time whether grecian or barbarian was so universally beloved he describes him further as a prince born for empire and the most worthy successor of cyrus the great  amidst the confusion the grecians were in after the battle they sent to arius as conqueror and commander in chief upon cyruss death to offer him the persian crown in the mean time the king as conqueror also on his side sent to them to surrender their arms the grecians summoned to surrender their arms and implore his mercy representing to them at the same time that as they were in the heart of his dominions surrounded with vast rivers and numberless nations it would be impossible for them to escape his vengeance and therefore they had nothing to do but to submit to the present necessity upon debating among themselves what answer they should return proxenus desired to know of the heralds but they refuse upon what terms the king demanded their arms if as conqueror it was in his power to take them if upon any other foot what would be give them in return he was seconded by xenophon who said they had nothing left but their arms and their liberty and that they could not preserve the one without the other clearchus said to the same effect that if the king was disposed to be their friend they should be in a better capacity of serving him with arms than without if their enemy they should have need of them for their defense some indeed spoke in terms more complying that as they had served cyrus faithfully they would also serve artaxerxes if he would employ them and provided he would at the same time put them in possession of egypt at last it was agreed that they should remain in the place where they were and that if they advanced further or retreated back it should be looked upon as a declaration of war so that by the issue of the debate it appeared to have been managed so as to avoid giving a direct answer but only to amuse the king and gain time  whilst this treaty was on foot they received ariaeuss answer that there were too many powerful men in prsia to let him possess the throne wheresore he intended to set out early the next morning in his return toward greece and that if they had a mind to accompany him they should join him that night in his camp which accordingly they all did milthocytus goes in to the persian king with   0 horse the rest decamp the next day except milithocytus a thracian who went with a party of thre hundred men and forty horse to the king the rest in conjunction with ariaeuss forces decamped by break of day and continued then march till sunset when they discovered from the neighboring villages the king was in pursuit of them but this alarm was over the next day when he sent to treat with them clearchus returned answer that his men were straightened for want of provisions and that his affairs required him rather to fight than to enter upon a treaty wherefore the king to prevent their being desperate sent to conduct them to several villages where they found plenty of every thing and after three days stay there tissaphernes came and insinuated to them the good offices he had employed with the king to give him leave to conduct them safe into their country that in return they ought to acknowledge this favor and not show themselves averse to such terms as he could obtain for them clearchus urged in their defense that they had been engaged in this expedition by cyrus without their knowledge or intention that upon his death they were now freed from that engagement and had no design upon artaxerxes or his country provided he did not oppose them in their return which tissaphernes agreed to on the kings part that he should not and promised further that they should be furnished with all necessary provisions in their march and that he himself would return with them to his government  accordingly in a few days after they set out ander his conduct but in their march the barbarians encamping at about a leagues distance from the grecians created some little distrusts and jealousies on both sides in about fifty days being got to the banks of the river zabatus clearchus to prevent things coming to an open rupture had a conference with tissaphernes wherein among other things he assured him of their fidelity in regard to the truce between them as likewise of their future service whenever he should have occasion to employ them and that they would always look upon him as the author of their safety and deliverance the treachery of tissaphernes to which tissaphernes answered that he was glad of this occasion of coming to a right understanding with him that indeed it was in their power to have destroyed the grecia whenever they had pleased but that he himself had prevented it out of a desire to oblige them by his good offices as cyrus had done by hi money the result of their discourse was that they had been misrepresented to each other by some of clearchus his officers and that h should bring them all to tissaphernes in order to detect those who were guilty he particularly suspected menon of a design to supplant him  his command and accordingly brought hi the next day with three other general office proxenus agias and socrates attended with  guard of twenty captains and about two hundred soldiers upon a pretense of buying provisions in the persian camp the five gneral officers upon a signal given were imm diately admited into tissapherness tent and put in arrest the others who were without were at the same time cut in pieces and some persian horse scouring the plain killed all the grecians they met amidst this scene of slaughter and confusion the persians sent to them a second time in the kings name to lay down their arms pretending that clearchus was executed as having been accused by proxenus and menon of perfidiously designing to break the truce and that his accusers were sent for to be rewarded by the king for their discovery but xenophon suspecting the treachery demanded that proxenus and menon as being innocent and common friends to both might be restored to them as the properest persons to advise them in this exigency to which the persians not knowing what to reply went away immediately after nicarchus one of the captains who had attended the generals came wounded in the belly and holding up his entrails with his hand to the grecian camp and told them all the particulars of what had happened the five grecian generals executed the five generals were sent back to the king who caused them all to be beheaded except menon who suffered some other way after a years torture it does not appear why he was distinguished in this manner from the rest though indeed there was some justice in it in regard to his character which was as extraordinary as his treatment  he was by birth a thessalian the character of menon covetous and ambitious but who made his ambition all along subservient to his avarice and had no other view in his pursuit of honor but to get by it he sought the friendship of men in power only to screen him from punishment he concluded the readiest way to obtain his ends was by perjury lying and fraud and took candor and openness for stupidity he loved no body and wherever he professed a freindship it was in order to ensnare he did not laugh at his enemies but always made a jest of his friends so neither did he attempt to defraud his enemies of their property as knowing they were too much upon their guard against him but his friends who were not so he fleeced and plundered and he valued himself as much upon his injustice and falsehood as others did upon their religion and virtue for he thought none but cheats were to be looked upon as men of address he made his way to great men by traducing their favorites his manner of supporting his authority among the troops was by committing the same crimes with them he endeavored to make himself feared by the mischief he could do you and you were to take it as an obligation that he did not do it when it was in his power he gained the favor of ariaeus in his youth by abandoning himself to his unnatural passion and he prevailed the same way with aristippus for his command in the army some have imagined that he was pardoned by artaxerxes and conclude from thence that he was engaged in a design of betraying the grecians to him which according to his principles might easily be supposed but however this account of him does not appear to be well founded  clearchus was a spartan of clearchu and esteemed one of the greatest captains of his time he had done good servie to his country in the peloponnesian war and was entirely devoted to the love of arms insomuch that he laid out all his money in war and with the same gust and appetite with which others laid it out upon their pleasures hence it was that upon the peace he desired leave to go and chastise the thracians who had committed some insults upon the chersonese soon after he was gone the ephori changed their minds and recalled him and though they pasd sentence of death upon him for disobeying their orders he proceeded on his march beat the thracians in a pitched battle ravaged their country and continued the war till he entered into cyruss service where he was pitched upon as the properest man to command the grecians in this expedition and he had talents suitable to so hardy an undertaking he was severe in his looks and harsh in his speech he always punished sharply and sometimes in anger but generally with discretion he was very strict in his discipline and it was a saying of his that a soldier ought to be more afraid of his officer than of his enemy upon action his men desired no other general for he then appeared mild to them and reserved all his fierceness for the enemy but when the danger was over he resumed his natural roughness and many of them as they found opportunity left him none of them followed him out of inclination but lived with him as boys do with their schoolmasters however he did every thing with them by dint of punishment and the sum of his character is that he was more fit to command than to obey  proxenus was a boeotian of proxenus and of an aspiring temper which had engaged him in this service though he did nothing in the pursuit of his ambition but what was consistent with honor and virtue he was capable enough of command but was too much the reverse of clearchus he had not the way of making himself feared where it was necessary for he was more afraid of being ill with the soldiery than the soldiery with him he thought it sufficient to commend good actions without punishing the bad for which reason he was beloved by those who acted upon principles of honor but bad men took advantage of his easiness  agias was an arcadian of agias and socrates and socrates and achaean they had both lived without reproach either as to their military or their civil conduct  the grecians had ever since the battle of cyrus been so upon their guard and were withal so bold and resolute that the persians despaired of subduing them by open force and therefore had recourse to this treacherous stratagem which had so far succeeded that the loss of the generals was very near breaking and dispersing the whole body the news of it struck them with the utmost consternation they expected every moment when they should be attacked in their camp they considered that they were at the very gates of the king surrounded with great rivers in the midst of many nations their enemies six or seven hundred leagues from greece without officers to lead them in want of all manner of provisions and of means to get any besides that they had no cavalry and therefore if they were victorious could not pursue their enemies and if they should happen to be defeated must every man of them be cut off in these perplexing thoughts they passed the night without sleep despairing ever to see their native country more  it was upon this occasion xenophon and others succeed in the command that xenophon signalized himself he was an intimate friend of proxenus who had invited him into asia and presented him to cyrus who had also expressed a particular esteem for him but hitherto he had served only as a voluntier in the army the next morning he assembled the officers and represented to them the misery of their condition that they could expect no mercy from the king if they fell into his hands to prevent which they had nothing to depend upon but their own personal bravery and that no time ought to be lost in providing for their defense he therefore advised to choose new officers in the place of those who were murdered and to resolve to make their way home in the best manner they could accordingly they chose timasion in the room of clearchus xanthicles in that of socrates cleanor in that of agias philesius in that of menon and xenophon in that of his friend proxenus he having encouraged the army with a long harangue in praise of their ancestors proposed to them for the safety and expedition of their return to burn their tents carriages and all unnecessary baggage and to march in the form of a hollow square that in case they should be attacked they might be prepared to receive the enemy with a front either way all which being approved of cherisophus the spartn led the van and timasion and xenophon brought up the rear  they bent their march toward the heads of the great rivers the grechians pursue their march in order to pass them where they were fordable but they had made very little way before they were followed by a party of the enemies archers and slingers commanded by mithridates which galled their rear and wounded several of them who being heavyarmd and without cavalry could make no resistance to prevent the like inconvenience xenophon furnished two hundred rhodians with slings and mounted fifty more of his men upon baggagehorses so that when mithridates came up with them a second time and with a much greater body the barbarians repulsed by them he repulsed them with this handful of men till he arrived near to the city larissa on the banks of the tigris from thence they marched to another desolate city called mepsila and about four leagues from that place tissaphernes came up to them with his whole army in order of battle but after several skirmishes was forced to retire in a few days after he secured an eminence over which the grecians were obliged to make their way which xenophon perceiving took a deachment of the army and with great diligence gained the top of a mountain which commanded that eminence from whence he easily dislodged the enemy and made good a passage for the rest of hsi troops into the plain where they found plenty of provisions though tisaphernes had done what he could before to urn and destroy the country  but still they were under as great difficulties as ever being bounded on the one hand by the tigris and on the other by inaccessible mountains inhabited by the carduchi a sierce and warlike people and who xenophon says had cut off an army of six score thousand persians to a man by reason of the difficulty of the ways however having no boats to cross the river and the passage through the mountains opening into the rich plains of armenia they resolved to pursue their march that way these barbarians soon took the alarm but not being prepared to meet them in a body they possessed themselves of the tops of the rocks and mountains and from thence annoyed them with darts and great stones they are attacked by the carduchi which they threw down into the defiles through which they passed in which they were also attacked by several other parties and thoug their loss was not considerable yet what with storms and famine besides seven tedious days march and being continually forced to fight their way they underwent more fatigue and hardship than they had suffered from the persians during the whole expedition  they were now got to the banks of the centrites which divides the mountains from armenia and whilst the carduchi were still in view of them and pouring down upon their backs they had this deep river before them with  body of troops on the other side to dispute their passage notwithstanding which they forded it with all their baggage and fought their way into armenia they fight their way  armenia where tyribazus the governor offered them free passage and provisions upon condition they did not ravage the country but his design was to cut them off in the mountains which they being apprizd of fell upon him first defeated him and took his tent arrive at the euphrates soon after they arrived at the euphrates which they passed near the source and continued their march through the desert part of armenia where several of them were lost in the deep snows and the rest suffered extremely by cold and hunger after a stay of seven days to refresh themselves in the villages they proceeded through the countries of the phasiani tachoi and chalybes which latter were reckoned the stoutest people of the barbarians but the grecians again forced the passes they held in the mountains and made good their descent into the plain after which they arrived at the river harpasus and from thence at a rich populous city called gymnias they were very well received by the governor of the province who dismissed them with a guide that brought them in five days within sight of the sea they are within sight of the sea at which they burst out into tears and exclamations of joy and embraced their officers for having brought them within reach of several grecian colonies by which they might hope to be protected the rest of their march and of this they had an instance in the next province belonging to the macrones who at first appeared in arms against them but finding them to be their countrymen brought them provisions and gave them free passage from thence they advanced to the mountains of colchis where they met with some opposition but got the better and in two days more arrive at trapezus a grecian colony arrived at trapezus a grecian colony of the sinopeans situate in the country of colchis upon the euxine sea  here being almost beat out with the fatigues of their long march they resolved to make the rest of their way by sea and deputed cherisophus to the spartan admiral for ships for that purpose whilst the army waited his return they subsisted themselves by their incursions upon the barbarians till at last after thirty days stay hearing nothing of him and the country being quite exhausted they put their women old and sick men and part of their baggage on board some vessels which they had stopped at trapezus whilst the rest renewed their march by land and in three days reached cerasus another greacian colony they review their forces at cerasus where upon a review of their forces they were found to amount to eight thousand six hundred the rest of the ten thousand being dead either of the fatigue sickness or their wounds  upon their arrival on the frontiers of the mosynaeci opposed by the mosynaeci and repulsed they were vigorously opposed and repulsed with loss but being encouraged by xenophon but rally and are victorious they rallied took the metropolis and by that means became masters of the whole country from thence they continued their march along the coast arrive at cotyora till they arrived at cotyora the distance from the field of battle to this place is computed at about six hundred and twenty leagues which from the day of the battle took them up eight months time of which they marched an hundred and twentytwo days they had hitherto preserved themselves in an entire body but being aterwards broken and diminished by their divisions and other accidents xenophon for that reason seems to finish their retreat at this place but as he still prosecutes his account of them it may be proper to see what further difficulties they meet with till they arrived nearer home and passed again into the service of their country  the inhabitants of this place at first refusing them admittance they ravaged the country and lived at discretion till by the interposition of the sinopeans to whom cotyora was tributary they were supplied from the town during their stay here of fortyfive days there was a general enquiry made in the nature of a court martial into all the abuses and offenses that had been committed in the army whether by officers or others since the death of cyrus and punishments allotted accordingly among others xenophon was accused of having treated several of the soldiers ill xenophon accused but he made it appear he had done nothing but what was necessary to preserve the discipline and was acquitted with a general applause but acquitted he had also formed a project of settling them in these parts and sounding a grecian colony which was approved by some but his enemies representing it to the army only as a more honorable way of abandoning them and to the inhabitants as a design to subdue and enslave the country he was forced to give over that enterprise however the noise of it had this good effect that the natives did what they could in a friendly manner to procure their departure advising them to go by sea as the safest way and furnished them with a sufficient number of transports for that purpose  accordingly they embarked with a fair wind and the next day got into the harbor of sinope where cherisophus met them with some galleys but instead of the money they had also expected from him he only told them they should be paid their arrears as soon as they got out of the euxine sea but this answer occasioned a great deal of murmuring and discontent among them the army mutiny so that they resolved to put themselves under one single general desiring xenophon in the most pressing and affectionate terms to accept of that command which he modestly declined and procured the choice to fall upon cherisophus but he enjoyed it not above six or seven days for no sooner were they arrived at heraclea than the army deposed him for refusing to extort a sum of money from the inhabitants of that city which being a grecian colony xenophon likewise refused to concern himself in that affair so that the army being disappointed in their hopes of plunder and divide fell into a mutiny and divided into three bodies of which the achoeans and arcadians were the principal consisting of four thousand five hundred foot and commanded by ten of their own officers cherisophus retained another of two thousand one hundred and xenophon the third of about the same number forty whereof were horse which indeed was all the cavalry they had  the first body having obtained ships of the heracleotae sailed to calpe a port of bithynia cherisophus led his troops by land leaving what ships he had to xenophon who set sail and landing on the confines of bithynia marched into the country the arcadians landing in the night had plundered the villages upon which the inhabitants appeared in arms and almost entirely cut off two regiments and surrounded a hill where the rest were encamped xenophon in the mean time receiving advice of their condition marched to their relief setting on fire every thing in his way that was combustible which struck such a terror into the enemy that they decamped by night are reunited upon which the grecians were happily reunited and encamped at the port of calpe where they settled the command as before substituting neon in the room of cherisophus who died here and making it death for any man henceforward to propose the dividing of the army but being straightened for provisions they were forced to spread themselves in the villages where pharnabazuss horse being joined by the inhabitants cut in pieces five hundred of them the rest escaping to an hill were rescued and brought off by xenophon who after this led them through a large forest where pharnabazus had posted his troops to oppose their passage defeat pharnabazus but they entirely defeated him and pursued their march to chrysopolis of chalcedon having got a great deal of booty in their way arrive at byzantium and from thence to byzantium  pharnabazus who feared they would be strong enough to dispossess him of his government had been practicing with cleander the governor of byzantium and anaxibius the spartan admiral to use all possible means to hasten their departure accordingly anaxibius got them out of the city gate under a pretense of reviewing them and told them they would meet with plenty of provisions in the thracian villages and that they should proceed to the chersonese where he would take care they should be paid their arrears but they were so ill satisfied with these promises that they reenterd the gates in a tumultuous manner and put the city into the utmost confusion they addressed themselves to xenopho telling him propose to plunder the city that now was the time to make himself great and them rich and that they ought not to slip this opportunity of furnishing themselves with every thing they wanted to appease them he seemed at first to comply with their demands then having drawn them up in a large square of the city but are restrained by xenophon he represented to them the ill consequence of plundering the city and thereby incensing the spartans who held the sovereignty of greece and had athens in their alliance that this would involve their country in a dangerous war and themselves in inevitable ruin since it was equally impracticable for them to make their retreat to the persian or any of the countries through which they had forced their passage or to return home to which he added how much it would sully the glory of their retreat that after having spared so many of the barbarian cities they had plundered the first they came to in their own country and murdered so many of their friends and relations this harangue had so good an effect that they immediately changed their resolution and marched out of the city without committing the least disorder which was entirely owing to xenophon who to the courage and conduct he had shown in every circumstance of the retreat had added this extraordinary instance of his mildness and humanity and the force of his eloquence and this was testified of him at large in a letter from chio a philosopher then in the town to a friend of his wherein he tells him he had been an eyewitness of the skill and temper with which xenophon had allayed the fury of the soldiers that he could not forbear going to thank him as the author of his deliverance and was struck with the sight of a man who had nothing terrible or severe in his looks but entertained him in the most meek and agreeable manner on several subjects and who knew so well how to reduce philosophy to practice  the troops being thus appeased xenophon leaves the army xenophon took his leave of them and retired into the city with a design to embark for athens but as they proceeded to the neighboring villages they were divided in their opinion as to what course they should take but is prevailed upon to return to it in these uncertainties he was prevailed upon to return to the army and was received with all imaginable demonstrations of joy at the same time there was an overture made to him from seuthes he assists seuthes in thrace king of the odrysians in thrace with a promise of great rewards both to the officers and soldiers in case they would enter into his service he accepted the offer and led them into the service of that prince who by their assistance gained great advantages over his enemies insomuch that the whole country submitted to him  they had no sooner reestablished him in his dominions but thimbron the spartan general sent them word he was ordered by the state to declare war against tissaphernes and that they should receive all fitting encouragement if they would assist him seuthes not being able to pay them their arrears and having no further occasion for them did what he could to encourage the proposal though they were of themselves desirous enough to serve again in the cause of their country besides that they were glad of such an occasion of revenging the treachery of tissaphernes to them in their retreat so that they easily gave into it and were so warm upon it that an arcadian accused xenophon of having detained them so long out of that service he is again accused by the army only to enrich himself at the expense of their lives and labors and added that as to his part what little he had he would freely give to see him stoned to death another stood up and seconded this motion and a third spoke to the same purpose he made it appear in his answer to this charge that he had acted in every thing for the good and safety of the army that as to his own particular he had not received the rewards which were promised him nor even so much as several of the other captains and appealed to seuthes himself for the truth of it he modestly hinted to them his past services which they had promised never to forget when in their dangers and fatigues they gave him no other name than that of father savior and deliverer and in the end reproached them with the rankest malice and ingratitude they were so well satisfied with his defense that several spoke in his favor and nothing more of a complaint was urged against him but is acquitted so that they prepared for their new expedition and he embarked with them and sailed to lampsacus in mysia from thence they marched to troas and crossing mount ida arrived at antandros whence coasting along they gained the plain of thebe his success at pergamus and arrived at pergamus in lydia where xenophon with a detachment of three hundred men took a persian lord with all his equipage and a great sum of money thimbron takes the army under his command the next day thimbron arriving there took them under his command and joined them to his own troops in order to carry on the war in asia  thus in the first year of the ninetyfifth olympiad a m      olym     ended this memorable expedition of this body of grecians who notwithstanding the many adventures and impediments they met with and which took up so much of their time performed the whole journey of between four and five thousand english miles forwards and backwards in the space of about nineteen months from their first setting out till their arrival at pergamus it is true indeed that upon a review of the forces at cerasus there appeared to be but eight thousand six hundred men and after their service under seuthes there is mention made but of six thousand which last diminution of them was owing to their divisions and going in separate bodies in search of plunder as they came nearer home but yet that any such number of them should escape as did actually reach the confines of greece seems almost incredible that after the death of cyrus which struck such a damp into the rest of his forces they alone should have courage enough to continue the war to oblige the persian to sue to them for peace and furnish them with provisions that after the treacherous murder of their officers they should be still hardy enough to make their way in defiance of a numberless army that could neither take them by force nor circumvent them by stratagem that they should traverse the body of that vast empire with so many barbarous nations on all sides to dispute their passage over rocks and mountains almost inaccessible and such rivers as the tigris and euphrates and all this with the countenance rather of conquerors than of despairing successless adventurers exposed to the fury of a powerful incensed monarch with a victorious army these are circumstances which would not easily gain credit if they had not been described and attested by xenophon who has done it with such exactness and fidelity and at the same time with such modesty in regard to himself that the only doubt remaining is whether he gained more honor by the share he had in the expedition or by the account he has given of it  but it is time now to return to greece which we left chiefly under the direction of the spartans who contenting themselves with the submission of the several states to them at home were meditating other great designs and resolved to push their conquests abroad the first occasion that offered was from the ionians they were afraid of the power of tissaphernes who as a reward for the service he had done artaxerxes in the late war with his brother cyrus had the government of all the cities he had possessed in those parts conferred on him and therefore they begged assistance from sparta to support them in their liberties their request was easily granted and a body of five thousand men with three hundred athenian horse were sent to them under the command of thimbron who appeared among them but would not venture to take the field till he was joined by the remainder of the ten thousand at pergamus with which forces he took that and several other illfortified towns and then laid siege to larissa but before he could take it he was recalled by the ephori thimbron recalled and banished and banished for having suffered the soldiers to pillage the countries of their allies and was succeeded in the command by dercyllidas  athens during the time of the expedition of the ten thousand and the breaking out of this fresh war in asia was very quiet with its neighbors and endeavoring to recover itself from its late confusions in the government at home but there were still some seeds of rancour and malice left among the citizens which two years after the expulsion of the thirty broke out upon socrates and occasioned his death the chief instrument in it was anytus who engaged melitus and lycon to join with him in accusing him to the state accordingly melitus drew up his accusation socrates accused containining in substance that he did not acknowledge the gods of the republic but introduced new deities in their room and further that he corrupted the youth he urged in his defense that he had assisted his defense as others did at the sacrifices and solemn festivals and appealed to melitus himself for the truth of it he denied his endeavoring to establish any new worship he owned indeed he had received frequent admonitions from a divine voice which he called his demon that constantly attended him and discovered to him things to come that he had often made use of this divine assistance for the service of himself and his friends but that if he had been thus particularly favored from heaven it was owing chiefly to the regularity of his life and conduct and that the approbation of the gods which was given him as the reward of his virtue ought not to be objected to him as his crime then as to the other article wherein he was branded with a criminal passion for young men he said he had no other view in his conversation with them than to regulate their morals that as he could not do this with any public authority he was therefore forced to insinuate himself into their company and to use in a manner the same methods to reclaim that others did to corrupt them  how far the whole charge affected him is not easy to determine it is certain that amidst so much zeal and superstition as then reigned in athens he never durst openly oppose the received religion and was therefore forced to preserve an outward show of it but it is very probable from the discourses he frequently held with his friends that in his heart he despised and laughed at their monstrous opinions and ridiculous mysteries as having no other foundation than the fables of the poets and that he had attained to a notion of the one only true god insomuch that upon the account both of his belief of the deity and the exemplariness of his life some have thought fit to rank him with the christian philosophers and indeed his behavior upon his trial was more like that of a christian martyr than of an impious pagan where he appeared with such a composed confidence as naturally results from innocence and rather as cicero observes as if he were to determine upon his judges than to supplicate them as a criminal  but how slight soever the proofs were against him the faction was powerful enough to find him guilty there was the form of a process against him and his irreligion was the pretense upon which it was grounded but his death was certainly a concerted thing his steady uninterrupted course of obstinate virtue which had made him in many cases appear singular and oppose whatever he thought illegal or unjust without any regard to times or persons had procured him a great deal of envy and ill will insomuch that he had several years before been publicly attacked upon the stage in the play called the clouds where he is introduced as the author of many gross impieties which some say aristophanes wrote out of a personal pique to him others that he did it only according to the liberty then indulged to the stage and intended in the person of socrates to expose and ridicule the philosophers in general but most are of opinion that it was at the instigation of anytus who looked upon him as a dangerous man and took that method of preparing the people for his condemnation whenever an opportunity should offer this agrees with the terms proposed to him even after the accusation was given in when perhaps he was not sure of carrying his point against him he hinted to him that if he would talk less freely and not take upon him to censure and arraign the administration he would yet endeavor to stifle the affair and save him it was upon the same account that he was forbid conversing with the young men those at the helm were jealous of his tampering with them in relation to the government and this seems to be the grounds of that part of his accusation but he was not to be bought by bribes or detered by menaces in short he had more plainness and integrity than the times would bear and therefore fell a sacrifice to the corruption of those whom his honesty had made his enemies  it was a privilege in athens after conviction to demand a mitigation of the punishment but that he said would be owning himself guilty and he chose rather to defy and incense his judges so that they unanimously passed sentence of death upon him he is condemned by drinking the juice of hemlock which was not put in execution till thirty days after and executed during which time he conversed with his friends with the same evenness and serenity of mind he had ever done and though they had bribed the jailor for his escape he refused it as an ungenerous violation of the laws he was about seventy years old when he suffered which made him say he thought himself happy to quit life at a time when it begin to be troublesome and that his death was rather a deliverance than a punishment this agrees with his last words to his friend crit just before he expired we owe a cock said he to aesculapius dont fail to pay it him thereby intimating that he should sacrifice for him  that god as if he had recovered from a diseas his innocence soon after appeared in such live colors that the athenians imputed all the mifortunes of the republic to his unjust condemnation and to avert the vengeance of heaven thought themselves obliged to make suitable expressions of repentance which they did by revoking his sentence with a public solemn lamentation and by condemning his accusers from thence their love and respect to his memory rose even to veneration insomuch tha they erected his statue and dedicated a chap to him  he was born in the fourth year of the seventy seventh olympiad his chaacter of indifferent parentage an as bred to his fathers business of a statuary ut soon quitted it for the study of natural phiosophy wherein he made a good proficiency but finding it so defective and unsatisfactory that e could ground no certain principles upon such  diversity of opinions he turned his thoughts wholly to the nature of man and by diving eep into the passions and affections endeavored ather to cultivate the heart than the reason and rather to regulate the manners than refine e wit it is said of him that he had naturally a disposition to vice but he so far got the etter of himself as to make virtue habitual to im and was therefore the better prepared to plant it in others so that he was the first who settled the standing rules of good and ill and is to be looked upon as the founder of moral philosophy his life and doctrine were one connud lesson of virtue which he inculcated ith candor and modesty easiness and affaility and tempered the dryness of his maxims with an air of humor and pleasantry as knowg that to please was the surest method to ersuade and by this means he took off that gged and unsociable dress that philosophy then ore if he sometimes went out of his chaacter it was in opposition to the sophists he ould not bear their deluding all the youth of that time with a superficial tincture of the scinces and therefore took all occasions of conting their false reasonings and of mortifying their arrogance as to his own way of reasoning it was very just and yet uncommon he began with doubting enquiring and asking of questions as if he sought rather to receive instruction than to give it and from the answers which must be naturally made his inferences were undeniable he had a way of leading people insensibly from one absurdity to another till they came to the point he aimed at and by the most familiar comparisons mad the truth so plain as to become in a manner the object of their senses by which means he voided the odium of dictating and left to ever one the pleasure of convincing himself h studies did not so wholly employ his time as  make him in other respects an idle member  the commonwealth he made several capaigns in the peloponnesian war where being  the actions at potidaea delium and amphipol he had the good fortune to save alcibiades  xenophon from falling into the enemies hands and he gave such further proofs of his courag that when his party was at last forced to retre it is said of him he did not fly as others  measured back the field by inches some part  his time he devoted to his love of music an rhetoric he had also the reputation of  good poet insomuch that he is said to have  a hand in several of euripidess plays but  had used these kinds of study rather as amuments than his business and in subsrviency  is other great designs it was upon these ocasions that the oracle styled him the wisest man it was by these methods that he kept up he reputation of the city and by his numeous followers established in it the glory of phiosophy and that at a time when it had lost he power of empire  chap ii from the death of socrates to the peace of antalcidas containing the space of    years dercyllidas had now taken thimbrons army under his command a m   0  olymp      and finding e had both tissaphernes and pharnabazus to deal with at the same time took occasion from a ique between them to practice secretly with the rst who was the most active and had the reatest interest in the soldiery and struck up a eace with him in order to attack the other with more vigor and security dercyllidas his successes accordingly e invaded his province and several of the aeolian cities as soon as he appeared before em pend their gates to him some after a little show of resistance submitted and others he gained by stratagem so that in eight days he took possession of nine cities after which he made a truce with pharnabazus and retired to bithynia where he spent the winter in destroying and ravaging the country for provisions  being continued another year in his command olymp      he renewed the truce with pharnabazus and going into thrace shut up the isthmus of the chersonese with a wall to protect the neighboring cities from the incursions of the barbarians from thence repassing into asia he took atarna a strong place in ionia in possession of the exiles from chios but this was a work of above seven months afterward understanding that tissaphernes and pharnabazus had joined their forces against him he marched with a design to give them battle but first in an interview with them demanded the liberty of the grecian cities tissaphernes demanded on his side that the spartan army should withdraw out of the country on which condition a truce was concluded till such time as they could receive further instructions from their respective masters  whilst these things were doing in asia the spartans quarwith the eleans the spartans began a quarrel with the eleans for having in their former alliances constantly sided with athens argos and other states at war with them and for not having admitted them as well as the rest of greece to the olympic games upon these and such like other frivolous pretenses they sent ambassadors to demand of them that they should restore the cities under their jurisdiction to their ancient rights and priileges and in case of a refusal to make a ormal declaration of war the eleans urged  their defense that as they had gained those cities by the sword they had the sole right of sing and disposing of them as they thought roper whereupon agis one of the spartan kings was sent to harass the country with fire  who by appearing in that manner among them encouraged leptis and several over towns to revolt from them so that meetg with little opposition he marched to elis d as he was upon the point of taking and undering it the inhabitants capitulated and greed to the terms insisted on of dismantling their own city and of making cyllene and all he other towns free and independent of them and thus the eleans were taken into the alliance  sparta the grounds of this rupture were  slight and trifling that it plainly appeared how dustriously the spartans had promoted it and ow greedily they laid hold of every thing that okd like a handle for exerting their power st they should lose that spirit and discipline y which they had arrived to it and not be able  maintain the title they then enjoyed of the rotectors and arbitrators of greece but this otion carried them so far as to make them uilty of the same injuries and abuses they preended to redress and in the end proved deructive both to themselves and their neighbors  agis had made two campaigns of this expedition agis the spartan king dies after which he returned home and died and had a monument erected for him more sumptuous and magnificent than any of his predecessors he left  son called leotychides but his legitimacy being suspected his uncle agesilaus disputed the succession with him is succeeded by agesilaus and being supported by lysander carried it his reign was ushered in with a conspiracy against him an account whereof being given in to the ephn they apprehended one cinadon as the principal and being asked how he came to be concerned in this treason he could give no other reason for it than that he could not bear any man  the city greater than himself upon which  was executed with several of his accomplices  the phaenicians were at this time fitting out  great fleet for the service of the persian which so alarmed the spartans that they resolved to send a fresh army into asia upon the old pretense of freeing the grecian cities the matter was proposed by lysander who also desired the command of these forces having  design to reestablish in those cities the decenvirate which was the form of government  was always most fond of but agesilaus inclining to go himself the other desisted though it cam to be a long debate whether they should tru him with that post on account of an advic the oracle of delphi had given them that  republic should go near to be destroyed when  regal government halted for agesilaus was lame of one leg this had also been made use of as an objection to him in his pretensions to the succession but at last they salved the matter with this resolution that it was better for the king to halt than the kingdom and accordingly he was sent with eight thousand men and provisions for six months who is sent into asia   being arrived at ephesus a m   0  olymp      tissaphernes amused him for some time under a pretense of waiting for dispatches from the king his master and having in the mean time got together a great army his successes there let agesilaus know he would declare war against him if he did not retire out of asia but he was so incensed at his tricking him in this manner that he immediately entered phrygia where he took several towns and met pharnabazuss forces but for want of cavalry did not venture a battle  but having soon after procured a great number of horse which he had demanded of the cities there by way of contribution he engaged tissapherness army and gained a signal victory near the river pactolus where he forced the enemys camp and found in it a great deal of money and other rich booty tissaphernes himself not being in the action the king suspected his fidelity and looking upon him as the author of this and several other miscarriages caused him to be beheaded  the next year he sent tithraustes in his room olym      who endeavored to gain upon agesilaus by treaty he sent to let him know that his predecessor had deservedly been punished with death as being the author of this war that as to his own part he would pursue other measures and would allow the asiatick cities their liberty provided they would pay the customary tribute and that the army withdrew to which the other answered he could do nothing in it till he received orders from sparta however tithraustes prevailed with him in the mean time to draw his forces toward phrygia and gave him thirty talents for their subsistence upon his march he received dispatches from sparta to let him know the state approved of his proceedings and gave him a power of appointing an admiral to act in concert with him by sea accordingly he procured from the isles and maritime towns an hundred and twenty galleys and gave the command of them to pisander he appoints pisander admiral his wifes brother a man of fire and ambition enough but in other respects not equal to that charge especially considering he had so experienced and vigilant  commander as conon to deal with  however these great preparations from sparta gave a fresh alarm to the persians who finding they could not prevail upon agesilaus either by menaces or persuasions to quit as resolved upon a more effectual expedient by making a diversion and removing the seat of the war they knew how ill affected most of the grecian states were to that of sparta on account of her late absolute and tyrannical treatment of them and thought this the most proper time to stir them up against her and to rouse in them a sense of recovering their liberty the persians incense the thebans and other states against sparta to which purpose tithraustes sent over timocrates to practice with the orators and other leading men of the principal cities and to make his commission more effectual gave him fifty talents to dispose of among them as he saw proper it was upon this occasion that agesilaus afterward upon his return home said he had been drove out of asia by thirty thousand archers by which he meant so many pieces of the persian coin which was stamped with the figure of an archer conon is by some thought to have been the author of this advice he had during his retreat in asia after the defeat of the athenians at aegospotamos made it his business to ingratiate himself with the persians in hopes by them to gain an opportunity of retrieving the misfortunes of his country with that view he took all occasions to incense them against the spartans and to traverse their designs insomuch that nepos ascribes it to him that agesilaus did not penetrate further into asia and carry his conquests as far as mount taurus and justin makes him signalize himself by many great exploits against that king personally but the accounts of both these historians in that respect are too confused and inconsistent to be reconciled with others or even with themselves neither can we with any certainty affirm that he appeared in action till after agesilaus had quitted asia we may however conclude that he was before that making use of his credit at the persian court to procure an armament at sea and that he was at least very instrumental if not principally concerned in forming a confederacy of the other states of greece against sparta  the first whom timocrates treated with upon this subject were the thebans who easily hearkened to the proposal and received the presents he met with the like success at argos and corinth and these states worked up several others to accuse and murmur against the spartans in order to their uniting against them it is observable this is the first notorious instance o the grecians being corrupted with the persian gold so much did they now begin to sin from that zealous spirit of honor and integrity concord and unanimity by which they were animated in the first persian wars i does not indeed appear that the persians ha before made them any such gross overtures  betray and sell their country but it might probably be because they thought it in vain the knew they were not enemies to be tamper with in such a manner they sound them ever where in earnest when they moved against them as one soul and body when they laid aside all domestic dissensions to pursue the common enemy and in short acted upon no other principle than the love of liberty and the defense of their country this was the plain hardy and untainted age of greece which might have been of a much longer duration if its inhabitants had contented themselves with the glory they had acquired at home but these successes soon fired them with an ambition of making themselves more formidable by enlarging their bounds and extending their conquests so that by throwing themselves out in colonies and carrying their arms abroad they had a freer converse with other nations and as by this means they arrived to quicker degrees of knowledge and politeness so on the other hand they became more luxurious and effeminate and more open to the charms and temptations of riches they received the first impressions of this kind from the footing they got in asia where they were struck and dazzled with the pomp wealth and magnificence of the persian governors and though in all the actions they had there they still behaved like grecians and with a sense of glory yet they expressed too great an eagerness to enrich themselves with plunder in short the love of money was now rooted in their affections and it soon after visibly appeared in the effects it produced for as the grecians had been bribed to quit their pretensions in asia so others afterward made use of the same methods to invade greece and this will appear in the sequel of the story to be one of the principal causes of its total subversion as the spartans kept up longest to the rigor of their discipline and the force of their laws they were a great while proof against corruption and bribery but the contagion still spreading they at last yielded to the example of their neighbors it was then greece became so divided and irresolute as to admit of no means for its preservation when not only each state but also the leading men in that state had separate views of their own without any regard to the good of the whole  the thebans the thebans engage the athenians in the quarrel as they were the first gained over to the persian interest so they were the most active in promoting it to strengthen their alliance they sent ambassadors to the athenians with a long representation of the present posture of affairs wherein they artfully insinuated their zeal and affection to their state from thence they took occasion to inveigh against the tyranny of sparta and concluded with telling them that now was the time to throw off the yoke and to recover their former splendour and authority the athenians though they had no share of the persian money needed not many arguments to engage them in a rupture of this kind for which they had been so long waiting a fit opportunity  the first act of hostility broke out between the locri opuntii hostilities begun and the phocians upon a dispute about a piece of ground and both sides appealed to their respective confederates for justice and protection the locri were the aggressors at the instigation of the thebans and the spartans espoused the latter upon a particular pique they had to thebes which they thought it necessary to resent at this time when they found several other states arming against them accordingly they ordered pausanias to march with the peloponnesian forces and sent lysander before to engage other cities in boeotia where having got together a considerable army he invested haliartus the thebans immediately marched with their whole strength and taking the advantage of attacking him before pausanias could come up to his assistance defeated his army lysander killed and he himself was killed on the spot  thus fell this great man his character after so many signal services to his country in giving athens the most fatal blow she had ever received and in raising sparta upon her ruins to a higher pitch of power and grandeur than she ever attained either before or after him as it was by his means that sparta did at this time in a manner give law both to greece and asia so he himself became no less absolute in sparta than she was among her enemies and allies the authority of her kings was sufficiently abridged by the constitution but by his working genius and the interest he had in the state upon the reputation of his services he made them appear still less and that in the field too where they were least subject to be controuled an instance of which we have in his going with agesilaus into asia where all the court and application was made to him and in every thing that passed of moment he had either the first hand or the finishing stroke insomuch that the king found himself obliged to take notice of it and that he might no longer appear a cipher sent him upon other service to the hellespont neither was it enough for him to eclipse the power of the kings and to impose his own government of ten men upon all the spartan conquests but he was further endeavoring to alter the succession of the heraclidae in order to obtain the sovereignty for himself as a confirmation of this there was found among his papers after his death a discourse concerning the government which lacratidas generously suppressed saying it would be inhumane to dig lysander out of his grave he was undoubtedly a brave experienced commander but his dissimulation craft and treachery his ambition arrogance and ostentation make up the greatest part of his character and therefore it may seem pretty extraordinary that he should support himself so long under so jealous and austere a government as that of sparta but he had a great deal of artifice and address and notwithstanding the imperiousness of his temper he knew how to curb it upon occasion and to suit it to his circumstances so that where he found it necessary to make his court he was contrary to the manners of his country very mild and tractable patient and submissive and had all the little arts of flattery and insinuation it was with regard to these supple qualities as well as to the badness of his morals in general that the character of his countryman callicratidas has been set up in opposition to his and indeed it was quite the reverse of it except in the military part and in that he was no way inferior to him but he was otherwise open candid and generous modest temperate sincere and just and was above making use of any trick or subterfuge lysander was so jealous of his merit that when he was ordered to give up the command of the fleet to him he did what he could to lessen and distress him he went so far as to withold from him the pay of the seamen that was remaining in his hands which besides the meanness of the action was betraying the interest of his country and hazarding the safety of it in a very critical conjuncture upon the whole notwithstanding his great achievements he is not to be looked upon as a true patriot for it seems chiefly owing to him that the spartans transgressed the just bounds of power he had put into their hands it was his pride and insolence his cruel and tyrannical deportment and that under the pretense of restoring liberty which gave their neighbors the first impressions of rancour and resentment against them it was this that made them conceive an ill opinion of their government in general and laid the seeds of those alliances which were formed against them and which at last proved fatal to them but they were not yet so sensible of the consequences and therefore paid all due respect to his memory they went so far as to fine some who were under a contract of marriage to his daughters but finding that their father died so poor as to leave them no fortune had deserted them it is certain he had reserved nothing to himself out of the spoils of the atti war which to the spartans was a sufficient argument of his merit a stronger instance of the sense they had of his loss was that they could pitch upon nobody but agesilaus to succeed him who notwithstanding that he was carrying on the war in asia with good success was immediately recalled to the defense of his country  after the action pausanias came up but durst not make another attempt he only demanded the bodies of the slain and yet could not obtain them upon any other terms than quitting the country pausanias condemned the spartans judged his proceedings very dishonorable and condemned him to death upon which he made his escape to tegea and died there  toward the end of the year agesilaus ravaged the government of pharnabazus and at dascyllum his winter quarters took and plundered his tent but that governor some time after managed an interview with him wherein he remonstrated that however he might be obliged to act for his masters honor and safety he had not showed himself an enemy to the spartans but on the contrary had done them many good offices in their war against the athenians and that he was now inclined to act no otherwise against them than as he should be necessitated to it in order to support himself in his command by which means he prevailed with agesilaus to withdraw his forces out of the province thereupon he descended into the plain of thebes and as he was preparing to march further into the country received news of the war broke out in greece with orders at the same time for him to return home with which he readily complied agesilaus recalled from asia olymp      and the regard he therein paid to the laws of his country is particularly taken notice of that when he was prosecuting the war with great increase of honor and advantage and had set his heart upon the entire conquest of the persian empire he had so much command of himself as to stop in his full career and abandon all out of a deference to the ephori who had recalled him however he left four thousand men in asia to maintain the footing he had got there till such time as the affairs of greece would permit him to return and pursue his conquests  but the spartans could not wait his arrival they found the war thicken on their hands and were ready to be attacked on all sides timolous a corinthian proposed the advancing immediately into their territories in order to crush them singly before they could be joined by their auxiliaries they set out said he by themselves only but in their march they gather forces as they go till they grow too numerous to be withstood like rivers which are small at their source and easily to be forded but as they continue their course the accession of other waters makes the stream too rapid this advice was judged reasonable and a resolution was taken to pursue it but there being too much time spent in debating the command and order of the battle gave the spartans an opportunity of being joined by the eleans sicyonians epidaurians trezaenians and others to the number of about fourteen thousand men and thirteen hundred horse under the command of aristodemus who was also appointed tutor to agesipolis the other sparta king during his minority on the other side were the athenians argives boeotians corinthians and euboeans who made up about two and twenty thousand men and two thousand horse both sides encamped near sicyon and t so small a distance from each other that it oon came to a regular battle the spartans gain a victory near sicyon wherein the spartan allies were almost entirely routed but they themselves maintained their ground and bore so hard upon the athenians who were in the left wing opposite to their right that they recovered the day and gained the victory by their own single valor and with the loss of not above eight of their own men which bore no proportion to that of their enemies or allies  the news of this victory reaching agesilaus at amphipolis he sent back dercyllidas with it into asia to confirm the associated cities there and pursued his march with all possible diligence but not without some opposition particularly from the thralli in thrace who having formerly sold the passage through their country to xerxes demanded of him an hundred talents and as many women he asked them by way of derision why they did not come to receive their demands and proceeding on his journey made great slaughter of them then demanding a passage through macedonia the king sent him word he would consider of it so let him said agesilaus and i will go on in the mean time the macedonians did not much relish this laconick answer but they were not as yet in a condition to resent it and therefore gave him no disturbance having afterward defeated a body of thessalian horse which attacked his rear he arrived in boeotia where he received intelligence of a great engagement at sea  conon had prevailed with artaxerxes to fit out a fleet conons victory at cnidus and to give the command of it to him jointly with pharnabazus they lay in the chersonese with about ninety sail where they had notice that the spartan fleet consisting of an hundred and twenty ships of their own and their allies lay about cnidus from whence pisander who commanded it weighed anchor and bore down directly upon the persians in the first attack he had the better of it but one part of the persian galleys came up so seasonably to the relief of the other that they turned the fortune of the day insomuch that the spartan confederates began to secure their retreat the admiral though he was so ill supported charged with his ship in the front of the enemy where he did a good deal of execution but at length was overpowered and killed after which the spartans retiring toward the continent conon pursued them and took fifty of their ships the res having recovered their port at cnidus  agesilaus having privately received this account thought fit to stifle or disguise it for the present and used his utmost endeavors to bring the enemy to a speedy battle before his army could be more particularly informed and while they were flushed with their last victory accordingly he joined the spartan allies and me the athenians with their allies on the plain  coronea agesilaus his victory at corone the thebans began the attack with great vigor but were repulsed by the extraordinary courage of agesilaus who notwithsanding that he was dangerously wounded pushed the enemy till he gained a complete and signal victory but not decisive enough to put an end to the hostilities which were still continued by incursions into each others territories  the corinthians complained olymp      that the chief seat of the war being among them they were infested on all sides being equally distressed by their enemies and burdened by their allies for which reason they were inclinable to a peace this was opposed by the magistrates and other citizens who had been corrupted with the persian money and these debates occasioned a great dissension and massacre in their city a massacre at corinth which the spartans easily improved to their advantage making use of one of the discontented parties to attack the other by which means a body of their troops under the command of praxitas got within the walls he defeated a great number of the argives who came up to the relief of their friends in the city and put to the sword the boeotians who had got possession of the port called lechoeus he broke down a great part of the walls which were afterward repaired by the atbenians and the whilst he was pursuing his victory agesilaus ravaged the country of the argives and his brother teleutias the admiral scoured the gulf of corinth taking their ships and demolishing their arsenals  the athenians iphicrates sent with recruits from athens to put a stop to these successes sent a fresh supply to their army under the command of iphicrates whose conduct was in finitely above his age having at twenty year old arrived to such a degree of perfection in military affairs that no athenian captain ever se out with greater expectation  about the time of his arrival with a reinforcement deputations were sent from boeotia and other parts to sound agesilaus in relation t peace but he rejected their proposals with didain till hearing soon after that the forces h left at lechaeus had been defeated by iphicrates he was more inclinable to treat his saccesss but the the deputies stood off and insulted him in their turn demanding leave of him by way of derision to go to corinth whereupon he dimissd them and after he had reinforced the garrison of lechaeus returned to sparta having by this last action lost all the honor of thi expedition iphicrates upon his departure wen on successfully and recovered all the places the had been taken by him and praxitas  the war was continued by little skirmishe and incursions which chiefly affected the achans as confederates of sparta they were ver much infested by the acarnanians who were supported by the athenian allies but agesilaus enerd their country with fire and sword and put n end to this quarrel  in this manner the spartans maintained themselves and their allies for some time without any considerable increase or diminution of power but their affairs at sea were in a more declining condition and the effects of their defeat at cnidus began more visibly to appear the cities in asia over which they claimed a jurisdiction finding them so disabled in their shipping and that they had work enough upon their hands at home readily hearkened to pharnabazus who encouraged them to revolt from the spartans the asiatick cities revolt from sparta and expel their governors which they consented to upon condition they might enjoy their own laws he was assisted in this work by conon who suggested to him that the leaving them in the free enjoyment of their liberty would be the surest means to keep them in his interest the like attempts were made at sestos and abydus but dercyllidas lying there secured those parts  the next year pharnabazus and conon puring their late victory olymp      procured another fleet from the towns upon the hellespont with which hey made a descent upon the maritime parts of laconia and ravaged the country after which conon desired leave to sail with the fleet to ahens with an intent to repair the haven of piaeus conon rebuilds the walls of athens and rebuild the walls which he reprented as a very important pice of service against parta pharnabazus not only complied with his request but gave him fifty talents to be employed in that work which was accordingly effected  the spartans finding the war brought home to their own doors overtures of peace olymp      and that the athenians reaping the advantage of it might soon wrest the sovereignty of greece out of their hands sent antalcidas to treat with the persians about a peace he applied himself to teribazus the governor of sardis and offered to give up the grecian cities in asia provided the islands and the other parts of greece might remain free an overture of this kind was easily hearkened to but the athenians and their allies taking the alarm sent ambassadors on their part likewise to join in the negotiations and to support the interests of their respective principals but there were so many different pretensions started th they could not come to any agreement among themselves and teribazus did not think himself sufficiently authorized by his present instructions to conclude with the spartans separately however he was so well affected to them that tho the treaty was at a stand he supplied them it the mean time privately with money to maintai a fleet at sea wherein he had a further view that they might by that means awe the other states into a compliance with the terms offered by them the spartans likewise gained another point with teribazus in relation to conon latcidas had it in his instructions to render hi suspected and to inveigh against him as the chief incendiary of the war and as having promoted it with no other view than to aggrandize the athenians at the expense of the persians the charge in fact was true and it was urged so strongly against him that as he was then at sardis waiting the event of the negotiations teribazus thought it proper to seize him and keep him in custody till he should receive orders from his master how to dispose of him some say he sent him to artaxerxes who put him to death others that he escaped out of prison with the consent or connivance of teribazus the latter whereof does not seem very probable because we find no further mention made of him either in greece or persia so that we may conclude he died about this time and that he fell a sacrifice to his own illtimed zeal for the service of his country conons death and character which certainly carried him further than was suitable to the circumstances he was under he had lived as a voluntary exile among the persians who had given him their protection and assistance he had been favored and trusted by them he had by interesting em in his quarrel broke the power of sparta at sea and repaired the ruins of his own city and both at their charge and hazard but not content with this he was at the same time practicing against them and endeavoring underhand to withdraw from them several cities and the whole provinces of ionia and aeolia in order to annex them to the dominions of athens and all this under a pretense of rescuing them from the tyranny of sparta and securing them to the persians they could not when they were let into a discovery of these artifices think he had made a suitable return for what he owed them nor indeed can this part of his character be otherwise justified than by that false principle which had generally obtained among the grecians to give up every thing that interfered with what they called the honor or advantage of their country this was carried so far as in some cases to destroy the common distinctions of right and wrong and the spartans themselves notwithstanding their severe justice in other respects were so loose in this particular that nothing was esteemed base that was beneficial another motive for his exerting himself in so extraordinary a manner might be in order to redeem his own honor which does not seem to stand quite clear in the affair of aegospotamos nepos indeed says he was absent from his command at the time of that engagement and assigns that as the cause of the defeat but the most natural and authentic account is that he was present in the action but that being overpowered by sander and seeing no probability of success on his side made his escape with eight or nine ships and retired to cyprus this agrees with what is further said of him that he was afraid and ashamed to return to athens which it is plain he did not attempt till several years after when he had done enough to wipe off that stain the latter part of his life was certainly without reproach either as to his courage or capacity of both which he had given sufficient proofs and had made himself so formidable to the spartans that they were glad upon any terms to get rid of him and it was by the most abject submission to the persians that they compassed it the dread they had conceived of him seems to have been the grounds of that scandalous peace which they soon afterward concluded and as they began from that day forward to decline in their reputation and power we may look upon conon as having more remotely occasioned their downfai  upon the offers of peace made to teribazus he went up to artaxerxes to give an account of his proceedings and to receive fresh instructions in the mean time struthas was sent to command in the lower asia and to take care of the seacoasts he was not so well inclined to the spartans as his predecessor being more exasperated at what had been done by agesilaus whereupon they sent thimbron with a good body of troops to keep him in action which he did at first with good success but ranging about with a separate party in quest of booty was surpised by struthas and killed he was succeeded by diphridas thimbron killed succeeded by diphridas who was a man of better conduct at least of more caution and he having gathered up the remains of the army maintained his ground in the paces which had submitted to thimbron  there were at this time two contending parties at rhodes commotions at rhodes olymp      concerning the form of government there and they were supported by their respective patrons those for the democracy by the athenians and the others for the oligarchy by the spartans the latter being overpowered and forced off the island made their complaints at sparta and ecdicus was dispatched with eight ships to their relief but finding himself too weak to do any thing to the purpose teleutias the admiral was sent with twentyseven sail with which he restored the exiles and the oligarchy this was a matter of too much consequence to the athenians to be given up they were sensible how much their sovereignty in the island which was truly the point in question depended on the form of government which should prevail in it and therefore sent out thrasybulus to put things upon the former footing before he durst attempt any thing at rhodes he went into thrace where he gained over two persian princes to the athenian interest he then took in byzantium chalcis and several other cities upon the hellespont and from thence he went to chastise the lesbians who were all of them except those of mitylene in the spartan interest having succeeded thus far he sailed toward rhodes he had in his way levied a sum of money for contribution upon the inhabitants of aspendus but they being afterward ill treated by his soldiers rose in a great fury and murdered him in his tent thrasybulus murdered his character   such was the end of this great patriot to whom athens owed as signal a deliverance as any she had received in the persian wars we need only consider her condition under the tyranny of the thirty when of those who had escaped the fate of a long war some had been murdered others banished and their estates confiscated when the city was one continued scene of outrage and violence and when those few good men who still remained and expressed a sense of recovering the public liberty yet chose rather to content themselves with talking of it than really to attempt it yet even then did thrasybulus rise in a manner singly against the united power of the oppressors it having been already related with what prudence zeal and intrepidity he conducted that affair i will here only add an observation which has been made that the success of this enterprise was chiefly owing to its desperateness for the contempt with which the thirty treated it in the beginning made them neglect the proper means of providing for their safety thrasybulus in the mean time went on with his design and increased his followers and when they sound him in a condition to make head against them they thought fit to make him an offer of sharing in the tyranny with them upon condition he would desist but it was not to be supposed that one who had the courage to project such an enterprise and who had advanced it so far would hearken to any other terms than the entirely restoring the freedom of his country his publickspiritedness together with his fidelity constancy and magnanimity made him at least equal to the greatest men of his time there were several indeed whose achievements happened to make a greater noise in the world but none of them had a more real foundation of merit and therefore nepos says of him that if virtue were to be considered abstractedly from fortune he should be inclined to give thrasybulus the first place in his catalogue of warthies  the spartans at this time sent anaxibius with a small supply of money and shipping to retrieve their affairs in the hellespont and thereupon the athenians to secure the places recovered by thrasybulus ordered out iphicrates with eight galleys and twelve hundred men being chiefly those who served under him in his corinthian expedition before any considerable action happened on either side iphicrates intercepted anaxibius in his way to abydus by an ambuscade and rushing out upon him here said the spartan general to his men must i die take care of yourselves and accordingly he was killed with a good number of those about him  about the time of these transactions abroad the aeginetans infest the coast of attica olymp      the coast of attica was infested by the people of eegina the athenians made a descent upon them and had in some measure blocked them up by sea and land but they were soon after repulsed by them and the spartans who assisted them and who had fomented the quarrel thereupon the islanders renewed their insults till at length they were humbled by a victory obtained against them by chabrias but are repulsed by chabias an athenian of good reputation and those seas were cleared for the present  but chabrias being soon after sent to the assistance of evagoras king of cyprus and a friend to athens the spartans took advantage of his absence and formed a design of surprising the athenians ships in their harbor accordingly teleutias entered the piraeus by night where most of the men being on shore he took several merchant ships with three or four galleys and sunk or disabled as many more as the time would allow and having put the city under a general consternation he returned and preyed upon the coast seizing the fishingvessels with such other booty as sell in his way  in this manner did these states for some time carry on a kind of a pyratical war without any regular engagement and without bringing things to any general issue but the atheians being so hafassd on all sides the spartans having more garrisons than they could maintain and their confederates revolting from them and the other states being drained and tired out began by mutual consent to think of a peace with the persians which teribazus being now returned from his master had full power to conclude the peace of antalcidas the conditions were that all the cities in asia with the islands of clazomenae should be under the jurisdiction of persia that the islands of lemnus imbrus and scirus as having from time immmorial been subject to athens should still continue so and that all the other cities of greece should be left entirely free which terms were submitted to by all but the thebans who refused to give up their jurisdiction over the towns in boeotia but they were afterward overawed and forced into it  this peace was concluded a m      olymp      according to the most general account in the second year of the ninetyeighth olympiad and was called the peac of antalcidas if as plutarch says that may be called a peace which was the reproach and rui of greece it was not only giving up at once all the footing agesilaus had got in asia bu undoing all that had been done there by th grecians in general ever since they were a nation it was what the persians themselves could not have asked or even hoped for if the spartans had not to their eternal infamy made e the first overture the grounds of which overture was their dread and jealousy of the a ans lest they should recover the power they ad wrested from them the colonies planted  asia had for many ages been considered as a part of greece and the supporting and protectng them as such was the chief pretense upon which the last war against persia was founded wherefore this proceeding of the spartans in elation to the peace was betraying and sacrificing ne part of their country in order to maintain their tyranny over the other this was plainly their drift and antalcidas was a very proper instrument for the purpose his character when he went up to the persian court to solicit this affair he took are to conform himself to their softness and efeminacy he could join in a ball upon occasion and went so far as to play the buffoon and in a wanton dance to mimick leonidas and callicratias whose names were revered at sparta as havng been the terror and scourge of the barbaians however by thus prostituting his chaacter and sacrificing even the customs and manners as well as the liberty of his country e gained so far upon artaxerxes that he showed him very uncommon marks of favor and distinction which was the more remarkable because he naturally hated the persons of the spartans and looked upon them as the most impudent of mankind but notwithstanding that he was so highly honored and caressed upon this negotiation he afterward met with the common ate of that sort of agents for the spartans being reduced to an extremity and sending him again to artaxerxes to press for supplies he was treated by the king with great coldness and contempt and returning without success he found the same reception at home insomuch that fearing the power and severity of the ephori he starved himself to death  chap iii from the peace of antalcidas to the battle of leuctra containing the space of    years the treaty though it was principally between greece and persia was made to extend likewise to the grecians among themselves and i was provided by it that whatever states should refuse to accede to it the other contracting powers together with the persian king should compel th to it by force of arms the spartans affecting still the sovereignty of greece the insolent behavior of the spartans after the peace dismembered as i was took upon them the execution of this part of the treaty and under the notion of guarantees explained it as they thought fit and according as they were swayed by their passion o their interest  they began with the mantineans and the year after the peace sent their king agesipoli to throw down their walls which he effected by turning against them the course of the river that ran through the city by which means the foundation being sappd and weakened the inhabitants despaired of making any defense and apitulated this was the same stratagem that cimon formerly made use of when he took eion situate upon the river strymon they were obliged by the terms of their surrender to anton themselves into villages this proceeding of the spartans was in revenge for their having taken part against them in the late wars and with a view to reduce them so as that they should not be in a condition to unite against em some other little states they treated less rigorously but yet with such an air of superiority and control as plainly showed they expected to be obeyed in order to keep them under their dependence and at the same time to make them a little sanguine in their interest they would in some cases redress their grievances restore their exiles compose their differences and do such other popular acts of justice as to make them think they were executing the treaty to their advantage and that they were the authors of their liberty and among the greater states they had obliged the corinthians to withdraw their garrison from argos which with their freeing the boeotian cities and some other instances of that kind had raised their reputation for the present and taken off a good deal of the odium which they had contracted by the treaty in other respects  the people who gave them most disturbance at this time they quarrel with the olynthians were the olynthians who were started up on a sudden and grown so powerful that they not only held the neighboring places in subjection but had overrun a great part of macedonia and taken many towns with pell the metropolis wherein they copied after the example of sparta and under a pretense of delivering those places from the tyranny of amyntas their king had in a manner drove him out of his dominions the inhabitants of acanthus and apollonia finding themselves under a necessity of submitting to them if they were not supported against them represented their case to the spartans who looking upon the olynthians with a jealous eye made no difficulty of granting their protection to those cities and immediately dispatched two thousand men under the command of eudamidas who recovered potidaea and fortified several parts of thrace in the mean time his brother phaebidas was sent to join him with a greater body of troops  but an incident happened in his march phaebidas seizes the cadmea at thebes olymp      which proved to be of more consequence to the affairs of greece than was at first apprehended when he arrived at thebes he found the city divided into factions one party being headed by isnias and the other by leontiades they were two of the polemarchs or governors of the city and the latter being in the spartan interest and finding that he could not otherwise get the better of his colleague betrayed the citadel called cadmea to phaebidas then seized ismenias and forced his party to the number of four hundred to fly to athens for refuge this made a great noise there and in the other parts of greece and even at sparta they were so ashamed of it that they pretended to resent it for they were sensible the thebans had done nothing in violation of the treaty since they had submitted to it that their domestic dissensions did not concern the public and that phaebidas had no authority to intermeddle in them but this action was excused by agesilaus who was supposed to be at the bottom of the design he considered it in no other light than as it was of advantage to the commonwealth and declared his opinion that if it answered in that respect it mattered not by what authority it was done he added further in behalf of phaebidas that in an enterprise of that nature orders were not to be expected this way of reasoning so far prevailed with the spartan government that they avowed and justified the action though at the same time they punished the actor for they imposed a fine of ten thousand drachmas on phbidas and deprived him of his command which plutarch takes notice of as a ridiculous inconsistency and polybius in condeming the aetolians for a procedure of the like kind compares them to the spartans who when phaebidas had contrary to all faith and treaties seized the cadmea punished the author of the treachery but did not withdraw their garrison as if says he that punishment could wipe out the injustice of the action and give full satisfaction to the thebans he makes a further remark applicable to the present occasion that upon the peace they proclaimed publicly they would restore all the cities to their liberties and yet did not recall any of the governors whom they had placed in them he then adds that it is the height of madness joined to the most consummate wickedness to pretend that a man needs only shut his ow eyes to hinder others from seeing him  however the spartans kept possession of the citadel and confirmed leontiades in the government to whom archias was joined in commission as having been an accomplice with him in the treachery in the next place they procured articles to be exhibited against ismenias for having taken money of the persians and held intelligence with them and for having been a principal promoter of these intestine broils isines condemned upon which he underwent a formal trial before three commissioners deputed from sparta and one from each of the other great cities of greece and was condemned to death  the spartans having in this manner secured thebes the war carried on against the olynthians prosecuted the war against the olynthians the command was given to teleutias who with the assistance of anupetas defeated them under the walls of the city after which he ravaged the country and went into winter quarters the next campaign proved more successful to the olynthians who having defeated a party of the spartan army teleutias marched with the main body to their relief and charging furiously within bowshot of the city his men were very much galled and himself killed teleutias killed he is charged with more passion and rashness in this enterprise than was suitable to his post but however he might expose himself upon this occasion his character he had in the main behaved well in the service of his country and acquitted himself with honor in both his capacities of general and admiral he was also rich and liberal and had endeared himself so much to those who served under him that upon his return home in a former expedition they flocked about him to crown him with wreaths and garlands and xenophon says his manner of engaging the affections of the soldiers deserved more to be taken notice of than the wealth he possessed or the dangers he underwent but whatever his personal merit was he owed a great deal to agesilaus who was his half brother and was chiefly instrumental in the raising and supporting him  the spartans succeeded by agesiolis  as soon as they heard of his death sent their king agesipolis in his room he having collected the forces which were much shattered and dispersed by the last action took torone a town in alliance with the olynthians and harassed the country but the fatigue and extreme heats of the season threw him into a fever his death of which he died agesilaus who had lived in good friendship with him lamented his loss there had indeed at his first setting out been a secret emulation between them which agesilaus perceiving easily got the better of and molded him to his purpose for being naturally modest and tractable but indolent withal and averse to business his colleague took care to cultivate in him this mild disposition and in order to take off the edge of his ambition entertained him with dogs and horses and loveaffairs and went so far as to recommend boys to him and assist him in his amors  he was succeeded in the command by polybiades polybiades takes olynthus olym  00   who besieged olynthus and reduced it by famine the conditions imposed on the inhabitants were that they should have the same friends and foes with the spartans and that they should join with them as confederates in all their wars  this war continued near three years the spartans quarrel with the psiasians and it was no sooner ended but the spartans were called upon to chastise the phliasians for having ill treated the exiles who had lately been restored by their interposition they made their complaints at sparta and were fined for so doing but upon their repeated instances for protection the ephori declared war and agesilaus was sent to do them justice he required of them to deliver up their castle which they refusing to do he laid siege to the city they made a very obstinate deence even to the imprisoning such as did but mention any thing of a surrender till at length their provisions failing them who are reduced by agesilaus they were reduced to the last extremity and sent to sparta to obtain the best terms they could in the mean time agesilaus left a garrison in the town and reurned home after he had spent above a year and an half in this expedition  the spartans had by this time under color of putting things upon that equal footing which was required by the treaty gained such an inrease of power and authority to themselves that there was no state in a condition to make ead against them but in the midst of this ecurity they were alarmed from a quarter where they least expected it the thebans had or four years since the seizing of the citadel ubmitted to the spartan yoke the thebans recover the cadma olymp  00   but they now ook occasion by a very desperate attempt to hrow it off for which purpose there was a seret correspondence carried on between the most onsiderable of the exiles at athens and those ho were well affected to them in thebes and measures were concerted between them by phyllidas secretary to the theban governors by whose contrivane a competent number of the exiles were to get into the city and charon a man of the first rank there offered his house for their reception the day being fixed they set out from athens and twelve of the most active and resolute among them were detached to enter the city the rest remaining at a proper distance to wait the event the first who offered himself was pelopidas who was young and daring and had been very zealous in encouraging the design and by the share he had in it gave a sufficient earnest of what might be further expected from him in the service of his country the next man of consequence was mlon who by some is said to have first projected the affair with phyllidas these two with their ten associates dressed themselves like peasan and beat about the fields with dogs and huntingpoles as in search of game by which means having passed unsuspected and conveyed themselves into the city they met at charons house as the general rendezvous where they were so after joined by thirty six more of their confederates it was concerted that phyllidas sho on that day give a great entertainment to  chias and philip the two governors who we appointed by the spartans and to make it  more complete he had engaged to provide so of the finest women in the town to give th a meeting matters being thus prepared  associates divided themselves into two bands one of which led by charon and mellon were to attack archias and his company and having put on womens clothes over their armor with pine and poplar over their heads to shade their faces they took their opportunity when the guests were well heated with wine to enter the room and immediately stabbed archias and philip with such others of the company as were pointed out to them by phyllidas a little before this execution archias received an express from athens with all the particulars of the conspiracy and the courier conjured him in the name of the person who wrote the letters that he should read them forthwith for that they contained matter of great importance but he laid them by unopend and with a smile said business to morrow which words upon that occasion grew into a proverb  the other band headed by pelopidas and damoclides went to attack leontiades who was at home and in bed they rushed into his house by surprise but he soon taking the alarm leaped up and with his sword in his hand received them at his chamber door and stabbed cephisodorus who was the first man that attempted to enter pelopidas was the next who encountered him and after a long and difficult dispute killed him from thence they went in pursuit of hypates his friend and neighbor and dispatched him likewise after which they joined the other band and sent to hasten the exiles they had left in attica  the whole city was by this time filled with terror and confusion the houses full of lights and the inhabitants running to and fro in the streets in a wild distracted manner and waiting impatiently for daylight that they might distinguish their friends from their foes and determine what course to take early in the morning the exiles came in armed and pelopidas appeared with his party in a general assembly of the people encompassed by the priests carrying garlands in their hands proclaiming liberty to the thebans in general and exhorting them to fight for their gods and their country for though they had made such a prosperous beginning the most difficult part still remained whilst the citadel was in the possession of the spartans with a garrison of fifteen hundred men besides a great number of citizens and others who had fled to them for protection and declared themselves on their side  plutarch who is very particular in the first part of this transaction which has been related chiefly from him passes over the taking the citadel too slightly he only says that pelopidas with charon and mellon blocked it up attacked it and got possession of it before any succors could arrive from sparta but it is not probable that should be the work of a day or that it should have been effected with so small a force and therefore this part is to be supplied from diodorus siculus who says that the athenians early the next morning after sent five thousand foot and two thousand horse to pelopidass assistance and that several other bodies of troops came in from all the cities of boeotia to the number of seven thousand that the castle being besieged by this army held out for several days but surrendered at last for want of provisions others say they capitulated more out of fear than necessity and that the commander at his return to sparta was put to death for it however the citadel upon which the whole depended was recovered and as the gaining that restored the thebans to their former liberty so it was the foundation of their future greatness  this action bore so near a resemblance to that of thrasybulus whether we consider the courage of the actors the hazards and difficulties of the undertaking the manner in which it was conducted or the success and consequences with which it was attended that it was called its sister and pelopidas proposed that enterprise as a pattern to the exiles when he exhorted them not to content themselves with living in a lazy dependence on the athenians and to fawn for fear upon every smoothtongud orator but to exert themselves like thrasybulus and that as he had advanced from thebes to break the power of the tyrants at athens they should in like manner march from athens to set thebes at liberty  the spartans were so enraged and so far from giving up their usurped dominion that they sent their king cleombrotus in the depth of winter to make war upon the thebans whereupon the spartans declare war against them but after he had deseated some small straggling parties he left the prosecution of his designs to sphodrias who commanded in thespiae the athenians were afraid by entering into this quarrel to draw the spartans upon them and therefore withdrew their protection and assistance from the thebans the thebans on the other hand the thebans create a quarrel beten athens and spara not thinking themselves able singly to cope with the spartans contrived to create a misunderstanding between these two states in order to bring over the athenians to them accordingly they practiced underhand with sphodrias and put him upon a project of attacking the piraeus as a thing that would redound to his honor and be very advantageous and agreeable to his principals he was brave and ambitious but rash withal and indiscreet and he was worked up to it partly by flattering his vanity and partly by presents it was concerted olmp  00   that he should march in the dead of night so as to be able to make his attack upon the place by break of day but he failed in his time and when he was got as far as elesis the design took air and miscarried however he had done enough to alarm and incense the athenians who thereupon imprisoned the spartan ambassadors but the state disavowd this proceeding of their officer and called him to an account for it agesilaus urged in his behalf that he was an honest man and that the commonwealth stood in need of such soldiers and got him acquitted which he is said to have done at the intercession of his son archidamus who had a loveaffair with cleonymus the son of sphodrias this attempt made in a profound peace and without the least provocation given was of the same kind with that of the cadma though it had not the same success and it was matter of great surprise that the author of it should go unpunished it is therefore to be looked upon as one of those glaring instances of the partiality of the spartan government in cases wherein their interest was concerned and the athenians resented it accordingly for they immediately declared themselves on the side of the thebans and joining heartily with them drew to their confederacy several of the cities which were grown weary of the spartan tyranny  the spartans olymp  0    in order to retain those places which had not yet revolted abated of their usual severity to them the spartans invade boeotia and sent agesilaus and cleombrotus by turns with a good body of troops into boeotia where they made several campaigns but did little more than show themselves and harass the country with the loss of many of their men among whom was phaebidas who since the affair of the cadmea commanded in the garrison at thespioe and afterward in the army upon the absence of the spartan kings  the man who signalized himself most against the spartans are opposed by chabrias olymp  0    was chabrias the athenian who had served well at sea and land and was now pitched upon as the best officer of his time to oppose to agesilaus who had entered boeotia with eighteen thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse and whose name struck such a terror into the thebans that they proposed nothing more than standing upon their defense and to that end possessed themselves of an hill near the city agesilaus detached a party of lightarmed men to provoke them to come down and give him battle which they declining he drew out his whole forces in order to attack them chabrias his successes who commanded the mercenaries on the part of the thebans ordered his men to present themselves and keep their ranks in close order with their shields laid down at their feet and their spears advanced and with one leg put forward and the knee upon the halfbent agesilaus finding them prepared in this manner to receive him and that they stood as it were in deiance of him thought fit to withdraw his army and contented himself with ravaging the country this was looked upon as an extraordinary stratagem and chabrias valued himself so much upon it that he procured his statue to be erected in that posture  the spartans having done nothing considerable enough to answer the losses and expense of these expeditions resolved to try their fortune at sea and fitted out a fleet of seventy sail under the command of pollis who endeavored to intercept a great quantity of corn designed for athens and had in a manner blocked up the city but chabrias having notice of this design came up with the spartan fleet and having defeated it convoyed the transport ships safe into the piraeus  chabrias acting offensively in his turn the victory at naxus sailed with the fleet to naxus and laid siege to it and pollis coming up to the relief of the island a very sharp engagement ensued wherein the athenians dispersed the whole spartan fleet having destroyed twentyfour of their galleys and taken eight with the loss of eighteen of their own chabrias returned with his spoils to athens and was highly honored this being the first victory at sea that had been obtained by the athenians singly without the assistance of the persian since the peloponnesian war and this had put them upon asserting their former dominion at sea  for this purpose they ordered their fleet to sail round peloponnesus olymp  0    under the conduct of timotheus who was the son of conon and inherited his fathers virtues the successes of timotheus he drew several towns and places on the coast some by force and others by management and mild treatment into the alliance with athens whereupon the spartans sent out nicolochus with the command of their fleet to put a stop to these encroachments he was hot and daring and immediately fell in with the athenians before his whole number of ships could join him but he was defeated and timotheus erected a trophy this action happened near leucas  the thebans taking advantage of these diversions at sea recovered all the cities of boeotia and invaded phocis the spartans grew every day less terrible to them so that they began now to act offensively against them and had frequent encounters with them and though they were not regular and decisive battles they were such as served to raise their courage and gain them experience and were introductory to those greater actions which happened afterward the success of these little engagements was generally on their side and was chiefly owing to pelopidas and of pelopidas who signalized himself in most of em in one of them at a place called taagra he slew the spartan commander with his own hand but that which happened about the same time at tegyra was more remarkable  he had formed a design of surprising ordmenus the battle t tegyra which was garrisoned by the spartans and marched against it with three hundred foot and ome horse but receiving intelligence that a great body of spartans were upon their march o reinforce the garrison he thought it advisable o retire in his retreat he met this reinforcement near tegyra and being opposed by them he ordered his horse who were in the rear to advance and engage them relying on his foot for the main stress of the battle the attack was very furious on both sides but gorgoleon and theopompus who commanded the spartans soon sell and all who were near them were either killed or put to flight which struck such a terror into the rest of their troops that they opened a passage for the thebans to pursue their march but pelopidas would not quit the field till he had made a further slaughter among em and thoroughly routed and dispersed them he acquired more reputation by this retreat than he could have got by succeeding in his original design against orchomenus and it was a more signal disgrace to the spartans than they had hitherto met with for they had at least three times as many men in the field and it was never known before that in all their wars whether against grecians or barbarians they had been beat by fewer troops than their own or even by an equal number it must indeed be allowed that these three hundred foot were the flower of the theban army and they were distinguished by the name of the sacred battalion the sacred battali they were as remarkable for their fidelity and affection to one another as they were for their courage and in that respect were likewise called the band of lovers there are several fabulous accounts concerning them but all that can be reasonably collected from them is that they were a brave determined set of young men who had vowed perpetual friendship and sworn to stand by one another to the last drop of their blood they were said to have been first raised by gorgidas who was one of the governors of boeotia in conjunction with pelopidas and had a considerable share in the transactions of that time he used them chiefly as a guard to the citadel but employed them occasionally in other services of the war and upon an engagement he chose to divide and mix them in the ranks with the other troops in order to animate them by their example but pelopidas found a better effect in keeping them in one entire body and after the proofs they had given him of their behavior in this action he constantly charged at the head of them in the same manner without breaking and dispersing them they are said to have remained invincible till the battle of cheronea which happened some years after when they were every man of them cut down by the macedonian phalanx and the next day philip taking a view of the field of battle looked on them with surprise as they lay all together among the slain and extolling their virtue p over them  it was this battle of tegyra says plutarch which first convinced the grecians that the breed of martial spirits is not confined to the banks of the eurotas but that true courage and bravery are the growth of every country where the inhabitants are brought up with a sense of honor and justice and are more afraid of the least disgrace than of the greatest danger  these successes of the thebans made the athenians begin to think they gained ground a little too fast and whatever cause of resentment they had against sparta they did not care to carry it so far as to raise the power of one state upon the destruction of the other which consideration inclined them toward an accommodation it happened at the same time that artaxerxes wanting a supply of grecian troops to assist him in his egyptian war and which could not easily be spared without putting an end to these intestine broils sent his ambassadors into greece to renew the peace of antalcidas the peace of antalcidas renewed olymp  0    which in the present conjuncture met with very little difficulty except from the thebans who would not give up their jurisdiction over the cities of boeotia the general tenor of the treaty was as before that all the cities for the future should be governed by their own laws with an additional provision that all the garrisons should be withdrawn which was accordingly executed by commissioners appointed for that purpose  during the short respite that was by this means given to the grecians a body of grecians employed by the persians against egypt artaxerxes engaged twenty thousand of them in his service against egypt pharnabazus who had the charge of the war and had been two years in making preparations for it had got together an army of two hundred thousand men besides this body of grecians with a proportionable number of shipping to act in concert with the land forces he sent to athens to demand that chabrias who then served as a voluntier with the egyptians might be recalled home iphicrates commands them and that iphicrates might be sent to command the grecians both which point were readily complied with the general rendezvous was at ace afterward called ptolemai where it was resolved to attack pelusium one o the seven mouths of the nile as the most convenient passage into the country but the egyptians had so long notice given them to provide for their defense that they had made that place inaccessible both by sea and land where upon pharnabazus ordered the fleet to mendesium another mouth of the nile and made a descent with three thousand men who after a vigorous resistance took the place iphicrates took the fort likewise with those who had retired into it and being flushed with this success proposed to go without loss of time to aack memphis the capital city of egypt but parnabazus chose rather to stay till his whole forces could come up in order to make sure work of it the other urged the necessity of marching immediately against it and in order to cut off all further pretenses offered to do it with only his own troops which being likewise refused it was plainly seen pharnabazus is jealous of him that pharnabazus was jealous of his having too great a share in the honor of the expedition whilst this matter was in debate between them the egyptians put a strong garrison into memphis and drawing down the rest of their forces against the persians maintained their ground and harassed them till at length the inundation of the nile obliged them to quit the country by these means they lost the prospect of taking memphis the consequence whereof must have been the reduction of the whole kingdom such was the fate of most of the persian expeditions which were generally ill concerted and worse conducted and were always attended with delays which were chiefly occasioned by their generals hands being tied up so that upon any sudden emergency they often waited for instructions from their court till the occasion was over and this was alleged by pharnabazus in his excuse to iphicrates who expostulating with him upon the operations of the war asked him how it came to pass that he who was so quick in proposing his measures was so slow in the execution because said he i am master of my words but the king is master of my actions but this was not so much the case of the present miscarriage which was chiefly owing to the misunderstanding between the two generals however pharnabazus upon his return into asia threw the whole blame of it upon iphicrates who did not think it proper there to justify himself he took warning from wha had lately happened to conon under the like circumstances and therefore withdrew himself privately to athens pharnabazus sent his complaint after him and the athenians promised to punish him according as they should find he had deserved it but they found reason to be very well satisfied with his behavior and were so far from censuring it that soon after as a mark of their approbation they appointed him admiral  in the mean time the several cities of greece especially those in peloponnesus were no sooner put into a condition of enjoying that liberty which was now more fully restored to them but they fell into tumults and seditions among themselves with such resentment of former injuries upon those who had acted under the spartan administration that they banished their persons and confiscated their estates and created such further disorders that the two states of athens and sparta sound themselves obliged to interpose in behalf of those who were best affected towardsem and whose quarrels they had formerly espoused the peace broke again in grerce and this occasioned another rupture the year after the peace was concluded though it was not so general a one as before nor of so long continuance  the first contests were concerning zacynthus and corcyra commotions at zacynthus and corcyra which were occasioned chiefly by the spartan faction in the former of these places the people had expelled their magistrates who flying to timotheus for protection he received them on board his fleet and transported them back to the island where by his further assistance they got possession of a strong castle and maintained themselves against the inhabitants the like divisions subsisting in corcyra the spartans sent out mnasippus with a fleet under color of assisting their friends there but they knew of what importance that island was to the recovery of their dominion at sea and their true design was to secure it to themselves the fraud being detected the inhabitants in general united against them as their common enemy and put themselves under the protection of athens but before they could receive any relief from thence the spartans had landed upon them and besieged them and when they found themselves straightened for want of provisions they made a desperate sally wherein they killed mnasippus with a good number of his men at length iphicrates and timotheus coming up with the athenian fleet took nine of the spartan galleys and put an end to these commotions  about the same time the inhabitants of plataea applying to their old friends the athenians for their protection and alliance the thebans took offense at it and demolished the town and soon after did the same by thespiae the thebans demolish plataea and thespiae the ahenians were so highly incensed at the treatment of those two cities which had deserved so well of the common cause in the persian war that they would act no longer in conjunction with them and upon their breaking with them the affairs of greece took a new and unexpected turn  athens and sparta began now to think in earnest of enjoying some repose themselves athens and sparta incline to peace and of giving it to the lesser states whose quarrels had been promoted chiefly by them and made subservient to their views of obtaining the sovereignty of greece this was undoubtedly the true grounds of their enmity though several other pretended causes were asignd of which the most plausible was the settling the other cities and republics in a state of freedom and independency this was now in some measure effected and the spartans having been forced to give up a great part of the power they had unjustly obtained the athenians contented themselves with this mark of their submission especially since they had recovered a great part of what they had lost at sea which had brought things to a pretty equal balance the truth is they had been at almost all the charge and hazard of the war exclusive of their allies so that notwithstanding they had been successful in the main they had been sufficiently drained and harassed and were therefore glad of so avourable a conjuncture to renew the former treaty there being at the same time nothing to apprehend on the side of asia where artaxerxes was deeply engaged in his egyptian war there was a general disposition for peace and the negotiations were carried on successfully by the athenians but it was rejected by the thebans the thebans aver se to it and in such a manner as plainly showed they were now setting up for themselves and would no longer be considered as a subordinate state  they were naturally an hardy and robust people but had the character of being heavy and stupid even to a proverb and yet such generals as epaminondas and pelopides and such writers as pindar and plutarch one would think should have vindicated them from that reproach however it is certain they had not hitherto exerted themselves in any degree suitable to the fame of their heroes and founders who by their exploits partly fabulous and partly historical had given a promise of what might be expected from their descendants especially in a city of so great antiquity and renown as to have maintained a siege even before that of troy but they were far from answering these expectations the thebans were divided in interest from the boeotians during the persian wars which is assigned as one reason why they were so long kept under they basely deserted the common cause of greece at that time to join with the barbarians and when contrary to all human probability that numerous army was defeated they apprehended the power and resentment of the athenians who as being their neighbors might under a pretense of punishing their treachery possess themselves of their country this necessity threw them under the protection of the spartans who chose rather to forgive the friends of persia than sacrifice the enemies of athens and accordingly entered into a league with them the thebans were not ungrateful they did them very great service in the peloponnesian war and continued during the whole course of it their good and faithful allies upon what occasion they afterward broke with them and were thereupon obliged to have recourse to the athenians has already been related it was a constant maxim with them as they were deserted by one of those two states to fall in with the other and which side soever they inclined to they were generally of weight enough to turn the balance however they had hitherto made no further use of that weight than to secure themselves but they had been so constantly engaged of late years on one side or the other according to the exigencies of their affairs that it had brought them into discipline and fired their ambition and the spartans had principally contributed to it by their late srequent expeditions against them it was an established point of policy in the spartan government to avoid engaging too often with the same enemy for fear of instructing them in the art of war and lycurgus had for the same reason expressly forbid it by his laws but the resentment of agesilaus against the thebans carried him on beyond any consideration of that kind insomuch that finding his colleague cleombrotus averse to the theban war he lead the army himself notwithstanding that he had before claimed the privilege of his age to excuse his attendance and an action happening wherein he was wounded antalcidas reproached him that he was well requited by the thebans for having taught them to fight in short they began now to look about them and enlarge their views and finding themselves too much cramped up within their ancient limits they laid hold of the present conjuncture to extend their dominion beginning as the other states had done by little encroachments on their neighbors  the spirit which now appeared among them they are encouraged by pelopidas and epaminondas had been raised by pelopidas their late deliverer from the spartan yoke and was seconded and supported by epaminondas who though he had all the qualities necessary for the service of the public yet chose to lead a private life in a constant course of virtue and the study of philosophy he had seldom appeared in public but in order to get himself excused from those employments which were so eagerly courted by others but his extraordinary merit no longer suffering him to enjoy his retirement he was forced out of it and placed at the head of the theban army he had before this contracted an intimacy with pelopidas which was daily improved by the correspondence of their tempers and principles and the ardent zeal which they both expressed for the good of their country and they had upon some occasions before this time appeared together in action but pelopidas having made a more early figure in the army the success which the thebans had hitherto met with was generally ascribed to him however epaminondas had done enough to distinguish himself and they both now came to be considered in the same light as generals abroad and as governors at home  when the treaty proposed by the athenians was upon the point of being executed the thebans demanded to be comprehended in it under the name of the boeotians and to be expressly styled so but the other contracting powers would not agree to it agesilaus particularly insisted upon their leaving boeotia free and independent he was answered by epaminondas who was there as ambassador on the part of the thebans that they the spartans would do well to show them the example by setting free the country of laconia for that the pretensions of the city of thebes to the one were as well founded as those of the city of sparta to the other he urged farther not only in behalf of the thebans but of greece in general that sparta had aggrandizd herself by war at the expense of her neighbors that peace might be obtained and such a ne as might be solid and lasting but that it could not be otherwise so than by reducing all to an equality these remonstrances however just they were yet so incensed agesilaus that he struck the name of the thebans out of the treaty agesilaus declares war against the thebans and declared war against them  the entering into a war in this manner was thought both by the spartans and their allies too hasty a step and when it was at last and with some difficulty decreed by the ephori it was censured as an act more of passion than judgment and as owing to the particular pique agesilaus had to the thebans on whose account he had been called out of asia and thereupon he laid hold of all opportunities of being reyengd on them however he took care at the same time to conclude a peace with the rest of the grecians though it was couched in so loose and general terms as if it were intended only to serve the present occasion lest any of them should oin against him and that he might afterward either observe or break it according as he should find it most for his purpose this agrees with what he said to the other ambassadors upon his dismissing them that what could be amicably adusted should and that what was not otherwise to be remedied must be determined by the sword it being too dissicult a task to provide for every thing by reaty  the thebans were by this means left to them elves and cleombrotus lying then in phocis wit ten thousand foot and a thousand horse the ephori sent him orders to march immediate into boeotia and at the same time they order fresh levies to be made in laconia and amon their allies the thebans though they were under the utmost consternation and that all greece general looked upon them as lost prepared  stand upon their defense epaminondas was at pointed commander in chief but there we joined with him at his own request six other as his council or assistants  cleombrotus in the mean time pursued h march with great diligence and went on  to a certain victory however when he a rivd upon the frontiers of boeotia he sent under color of justifying his proceedings to dmand of the thebans that they should restore if boeotian cities to their liberty that they shou rebuild plataea and thespiae which they had donlishd in the last war and that they should make g all the losses the inhabitants had sustained eminendas returned an answer suitable to the dmand that the spartans had nothing to do wi boeotia and that the thebans were not accom table to them for their conduct  there now remained nothing further to  done on either side but to prepare for actio but just as the thebans marched out of the c they were terrified by omens and prodiga which they interpreted to portend ill success to them epaminodas by way of encouragement repeated to them a verse of homer which implied  that there was one sure good men to those who fought for their country one of these unlucky auguries was a sudden reat clap of thunder which they looked upon as a warning from heaven and addressed themselves to their general to know his sentiments upon it but he being more attentive  the incampment of the spartan army than  the thunder gave them no other answer han that be wondered to see the enemy bad tchd upon so bad a piece of ground when they ight have posted themselves so much more advanageously however to prevent any further effets of this superstition or fear which was among the troops he found it necessary to huour them a little and to take them in their own ay accordingly he invented other countermens and auguries and made use of old rophecies and predictions which he applied  the present occasion and took care to have them explained in so favorable a manner that he soldiers went on in full confidence of sucess and were eager to engage the next oint in debate was among the generals hether they should act defensively or march p to the spartans camp and offer them attle the council of war upon this occasion consisted of epaminondas and five of  colleagues and they were equally divided opinion but pelopidas as some say came afterward and by his vote it was determine to give the enemy battle accordingly  two armies met in the plain of leuctra town in boeotia  archidamus the son of agesilaus having join the spartans with the new levies had increas their number to four and twenty thousan whereas the thebans had at the most but  thousand there was also a great disproporti in their horse but the thebans had vastly  advantage both in the quality of their horse and in their management of them  epaminondas endeavored to supply his w of troops by his disposition a m      olymp  0    the batt of leuctra and by the vgour of his attack and taking to himself  command of the left wing opposite to  right of the enemy commanded by cleomiotus he put the main stress of the battle the concluding that is he could break that body  spartans the rest would easily be put to the ro with this view he strengthened his wing w his heavyarmd infantry and the best of  other troops by which additions it was  mn deep whereas that of the spartans was b twelve he closed it with the sacred band  der the command of pelopidas and his ho he placed in the front of it after the example of cleombrotus having drawn off so ma from his other wing he ordered those who remained in it to fall back in a slanting line as if they declined fighting and were making their retreat which he did that they might not be left too much exposed and that they might cover his flank on the right and be a body of reserve to him in case of need  he then advanced with his wing extending t obliquely in order to draw off the right wing of the spartans from their main body the enemy perceiving his design changed their order of battle and began to extend their wing likewise with an intent to surround epanondas but before they could open and close their divisions he took advantage of their forming themselves and began the attack with the horse and pelopidas charging with him at the same time with incredible speed and bravery at the head of his battalion they followed she horse and pressed so hard upon the sparans that though they were of all the grecians the most expert in recovering any surprise or disorder of that kind their skill was now quite passed their horse being not able to stand the shock were forced back upon their infantry which by this means was broke and thrown into a good deal of confusion the thebans having made this impression with their horse pushed on to cleombrotus and opened their way to him with great slaughter notwithstanding that the spartans fought with their wonted bravery and held the victory some time in suspense at length cleombrotus  with dinon sphodrias his son cleonyme and other officers of note who came up  defend the person of their king and  he was killed the fight was renewed with greater rage and obstinacy both to revenge  death and to recover his body this la was a point of honor with the spartan which they could not for shame give up and epaminondas chose rather to gratify them in it than to hazard the further success of the battle wherefore he left them in possession of their dead king and went on to their other wing which was commanded by archidamus and consisted chiefly of the allies who had not willingly been engaged in this quarrel but were the more easily persuaded to it from the weakness of the thebans so that they thought they had little more to do than to take the field and that they were to conquer without fighting or as diodorus expresses it  without dust but they were so disheartened at the death of cleombrotus and the defeat of his wing that they soon betook themselves to flight and were followed by the rest of the army epminondas pursued them with great slaughter till having completed his victory he remained master of the field and erected a trophy there fell in the battle four thousand on the side of sparta whereof one thousand were lacedamonians and the flower of their army and four hundred of them were citizens of sparta the thebans lost in the whole but three hundred men  epaminondas had succeeded in every part of this action according to his wish and according to the manner in which he had projected it his skill and conduct in this battle and in that which succeeded it at manitinea are looked upon as masterpieces in their kind and they who are curious that way may see the exact plans of them as they are described by a le chevalier de folard late author in his comments upon polybius  this battle was fought within twenty days after the conclusion of the peace and as it was the sharpest of any that had happened during the wars of the grecians among themselves so it was more remarkable for the number of the slain there having seldom been above four or five hundred killed on the side of the vanquished even in the height of the rivalship between athens and sparta when they fought with the most rancour and inveteracy the thebans acquired more glory by it than any of the republics had ever gained by any single victory in those wars and epaminondas felt such a sudden excess of joy upon it that he went out of his usual character and was hardly able to contain himself but the next day upon cooler thoughts he resumed the philosopher and appeared so pensive and melancholy that his friends were very inquisitive to know the cause of it he told them he had suffered himself to be too much transported upon his victory and that he was now undergoing a proper chastisement for it but his command of himself upon this occasion did not come up to that of the spartans whose behavior after the battle was so remarkably great that i question whether it can be paralleled in the history of any age or country  if happened that when the news of the defeat came to sparta they were celebrating a public festival in the city where there was a great concourse of strangers from several parts of greece the behavior of the spartans after their defeat the ephori who from the accounts they had already received of the battle could not but be sensible of the terrible consequences of it yet gave orders that the solemnity of the day should not be interrupted but privately sending the names of the slain to each family out of which they were lost they went on with the sports and ceremonies as if nothing had happened the next morning when they were more fully informed of the particulars the fathers and relations of the slain came out rejoicing in the marketplace and saluting each other with a kind of exultation on the contrary the fathers of those who survived the battle concealed themselves in their houses and if any of them were upon any necessary occasion obliged to go abroad it was easily discovered by their looks that they were ashamed to own their children the women carried it still further the mothers of the slain openly rejoicing cheerfully making visits to each other and assembling in a triumphant manner in the temples whilst they who expected their children home sat silent and dejected  but the generality of the people were awakened by this misfortune and considered it as a blow that they should never be able to recover they began to despair when they found themselves without troops deserted by their allies and in a manner at the mercy of the conqueror especially when they were further informed that he designed to invade peloponnesus this occasioned a general murmuring and repining it brought to their remembrance the former predictions of the oracle that they should suffer under a lame king they considered further that they had given the crown to this lame king in prejudice to the right of leotychidas his nephew but notwithstanding these reflections and that he had undoubtedly been the sole author of their present calamity he had still so much credit with them that they renewed the confidence they they had formerly placed in him and submitted their affairs entirely to his determination either as to peace or war  one great point under their immediate consideration was concerning those who had fled out of the battle they were by the law in that cafe to be degraded from all honors and rendered infamous insomuch that it was a disgrace to intermarry with them they were to appear publicly in mean and dirty habits with patched and partycolored garments and to go halfshavd and whoever met them in the streets might insult and beat them and they were not to make any resistance this was so severe a law and such numbers had incurred the penalties of it many of whom were of great families and interest that they apprehended the execution of it might occasion some public commotions besides that these citizens such as they were could very ill be spared at this time when they wanted to recruit the army under this difficulty they gave agesilaus a power even over the laws to dispense with them or to abrogate them or to enact such new ones as the present exigency required he would not abolish or make any variation in the law itself but made a public declarntion that it should lie dormant for that single day but revive and be in full force again on the morrow and by that expedient he saved the citizens from infamy  chap iv from the battle of leuctra to the battle of mantinea containing the space of   years the fugitives being thus reinstated in the army agesilaus made an inroad into arcadia where he took a small town belonging to the mantineans and wasted the territory but avoided engaging in any hazardous enterprise doing no more at present than what was barely necessary to keep his men in action and to revive their spirits and at the same time to show that the fortune of sparta was not quite desperate  the thebans in the mean time were endeavoring to improve their victory and sent an herald crowned with a garland to communicate it in form to the athenians and to demand their assistance but they did not think this a time to break with sparta they found it a fit opportunity to make themselves more absolutely masters at sea and if they could not carry it further so as to obtain the sovereignty of greece at least they thought it better to share in it with sparta than to endanger the letting the  thebans into the whole upon which considerations they dismissed the herald without giving him audience  with these views olymp  0    the athenians take advanta a of this overthrow of the spartans they gave the spartans to understand that as they had lost their power it was expected they should lay aside their haughtiness and severity at the same time they took upon themselves to maintain the peace which by the deputies of the several cities assembled at athens they caused to be renewed and retified in the name of them and their confederates the thebans stood out as before and the eleans now followed their example objecting against the freedom of several towns which they pretended to be immediately under their jurisdiction and several other states afterward fell in with the thebans several states side with the thebans some by compulsion and more out of inclination and policy as they found they were most likely to be protected by them thebes was now become the common asylum for those who apprehended the power of their neighbors and more particularly of the spartans  the mantineans about this time took occasion to rebuild their city the mantineans rebuild their city which with the assistance of the eleans and some part of the arcadians they perfected and walled in as before and according to pausanias the arcadians in general by the persuasion of epaminondas out of several small towns built one common city by the name of megalopolis though diodorus places it two years lower upon their great overthrow by the spartans thus far the arcadians had made a right and reasonable use of spartas being humbled but they and some other states when they found themselves restored according to the treaty to the free enjoyment of their own laws and forms of government grew wanton and capricious and fell into such dissensions among themselves as proved of worse consequence to them than the dominion of sparta  this was the case of the tegeans who had formed a scheme of uniting themselves with all the rest of the arcadians commotions in arcadia into one body of a commonwealth with a general council consisting of ten thousand in whom there was to be lodged an absolute power to determine all matters relating to peace and war but this project occasioned such factions and tumults among them that great numbers were killed and above fourteen hundred banished and it ended in bringing the spartans again upon them under the old pretense of restoring exiles and in making their country a seat of war  agesilaus immediately took occasion from these intestine divisions to send a body of fifteen hundred men among them under the command of polytropus he possessed himself of there was another city of this name in boeotia orchomenus a battle at orchomenus which was well affected to sparta and garrisoned it lycomedes the arcadian general being about three to one stronger marched up to him and offered him battle under the walls polytropus accepted it and was killed with two hundred of his men and the rest were forced back into the city however lycomedes not doubting but the spartans would come with a greater force to revenge themselves did not think it advisable to pursue his victory without some further assistance accordingly he applied to the athenians but they refused to join with him concluding as they had done before with regard to the thebans that sparta was low enough already and that it would be wrong policy in them at this time to support any other state against her hereupon the arcadians had recourse to the thebans who received them with open arms and this was a great addition to the confederacy that was forming against sparta  about the time of the civil discord among the arcadians concerning their new form of government there happened a more grievous instance of the same kind at argos sedition at argos where the government being in the people the orators or demagogues as they were more properly called ftirtd them up against the nobility who to secure themselves against the insults and outrages to which they were exposed entered into conspiracy to destroy the democracy which being suspected by the commons they put several to the rack and extorted from them a confession of the whole design whereupon they murdered thirty of those who were principally concerned without any form of trial and many false accusations against others were dressed up and aggravated by these orators insomuch that there were above sixteen hundred of the greatest and richest men of the city executed and their estates confiscated at length the orators whether they were struck with remorse for the cruelties they had oceasiond or that they were afraid of being at last involved in the general ruin began to slacken in their prosecutions and the people from thence concluding that they had deserted their cause murdered such of them as they could find remaining in the city this was the greatest massacre that had happened in any city of greece and it was distinguished by the name of the seytalism from the manner in which it was executed by the knocking on the head with clubs and this sedition was a very unlucky conjuncture for that city which was so rich and powerful that she was in a condition to dispute the sovereignty of greece this opinion was confirmed by jason who putting in his claim to it in behalf of the thessalians made use of it as an argument to them that the argives were too much weakened with their intestine broils to appear as competitors  this jason had a little principality at pherae account of jason of thessaly and having ambitious views and extraordinary skill in military affairs got himself to be declared general of thessaly with which authority he had gained many of the neighboring countries into his alliance and the thebans courted him for his assistance when they found themselves disappointed of it at athens he appeared ready to join them with a good body of troops but when it came to the point he diverted them from pursuing their victory advising them to use it with moderation and not to make the spartans desperate the spartans on the other hand he persuaded to lie by a little till they had recovered breath and could fight upon more advantageous temrs so that he acted rather as a mediator than an ally and there is mention made of a truce concluded between them by his means but the account of it is so differently related that it does not appear whether it were before or after the battle of leuctra jasons business was to manage so between those states that neither of them might grow too powerful and that he might make his advantage of it in bringing about his own designs which by his money art and eloquence he had in some measure effected but notwithstanding that he was eager in the pursuit of his ambition he endeavored to save appearances and to preserve a good character so that when he had injured or molested any of his neighbors he would say by way of excuse there is a necessity for those to be unjust in small matters who will act justly in great ones he was at the head of an army of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand heavyarmd foot without reckoning the lightarmed soldiers and with this force he might soon have been capable of giving law to the rest of greece but before he could make any attempt toward it he was suddenly assassinated at the instigation of his brothers polydore and polyphron who jointly succeeded him but the latter killed the other and was soon after killed himself by his some make him his brother nephew alexander under the pretense of revenging the death of his father polydore by this means alexander possessed himself of pherae and became very oppressive and tyrannical but as i shall have occasion to mention him more particularly i would here only observe that from the time of jasons death the thessalians lost the influence they had in the affairs of greece and the prospect of obtaining the sovereignty of it in their turn  the thebans in the mean time having besides the late accession of the arcadians got the phocians locrians acarnanians euboeans and other neighboring states under their dependence were preparing to act offensively against the spartans olymp  0    the thebans act offnsiverly against sparta and under a notion of assisting the arcadians against them entered peloponnesus where having joined the arcadians and the rest of the confederates they made up an army  forty some say fifty thousand men besides grea numbers who followed the camp for plunde amounting in the whole to seventy thousand epaminondas and pelopidas having the command of the army divided it into four bodies who broke into laconia at four several parts of it a the same time then made a general rendezvou at sellasia and pursued their march with fire an sword toward sparta agesilous was at this time in pursuit of the arcadians after the defeat of polytropus but upon this approach of the thebans he immediately returned to sparta where he found the inhabitants under the utmost terror and consternation and the more so because no enemy had appeared there in the course of near six hundred years since the dorians as descendants of hercules first got possession of the country hence it was that plato said the city of sparta was like the temple of the furies which nobody bad courage enough to approach and it was a frequent saying of agesilaus himself that the women of sparta had never seen the smoke of the enemies fire which was now retorted upon him there was another saying of antalicidas to the same purpose who being in dispute with an athenian about the valor of the two nations the athenian bragged that his countrymen bad often drove the spartans from the river cephisus yes said antalcidas but we never had occasion to drive you from the euros but this was not the case at present for epaminondas at the head of his infantry passed that river though it was then swelled to an unusual height and though the spartans taking that opportunity to fall upon him cut off a good number of his men however he made good his passage and marched up to the suburbs of the city where the inhabitants were with great difficulty restrained from rushing out in a confused and desperate manner upon the enemy but agesilaus upon this occasion showed more temper than ordinary he found it necessary to lay aside his pride and obstinacy and to play a saving game he endeavored to quiet the minds of the people so as to keep them within their bounds and made the best disposition he could of them for the defense of the city it was thought proper in this extrernity to proclaim that as many of the helots as would enlift and form themselves into companies should receive their freedom and a thousand of them accepted the offer xenophon says six thousand which is not very improbable from the circumstance he adds that when they were armed in a body they made so formidable an appearance that the spartans themselves durst not trust them without placing a good number of mercenaries and other troops as a guard upon them  the thebans being thus far advanced made a sort of encampment near the city and endeavored to draw the spartans out of it in order to a pitched battle but agesilaus had retired to an e minence in the heart of the town and intended nothing more than the defense of it hereupon they resolved to attack it and endeavored to tak it by storm and attempt to take the city by storm but they found the avenues so well secured that they met with more difficulty that they expected when at length they made at irruption with their horse the spartan horse opposed them and a party of three hundred foot who lay in ambuscade sallying out upon them at the same time but are repulsed they were repulsed with considerable loss and discouraged from making a second attempt they contented themselves with encamping again without the city where they bid defiance to the spartans and challenged them to come out and give them battle to which they returned a very cool answer that they would not decline it when they saw a prop occasion then they reproached agesilaus by name as the incendiary of the war and the author of all the mischief done to his country but he resolved not to be provoked he overlooked all these personal insults and reflections as the effects of rage and disappointment and would not suffer himself to be diverted from the only point he had then in view which was the security of the city and the preservation of it at this time was no less owing to this command of himself than to his good conduct in other respects  the behavior of ischolas the spartan upon this occasion behavior of ischolas deserves particular notice he commanded one of the detachments which were ordered out to secure the most important passes but finding it too weak to stand the attack of the enemy he picked out the youngest of the men and sent them back as a reserve for the future service of their country and with the rest devoting himself after the example of leonidas to the public good he made a long and obstinate defense and fought till they were all killed to a man the thebans proposing nothing further to themselves there decamped and after having plundered and laid waste all the country returned into arcadia  this expedition had not answered the great preparations that were made for it epaminondas resoures the messenians but epaminondas to make it the more memorable proposed the restoring the posterity of the old messeniens who had near three hundred years before been driven out by the spartans and were settled in sicily italy and other parts where they retained their ancient customs and manners and the dorick dialect by a general consent of his allies he invited them home to their native country and their city was immediately rebuilt and peopled so that in a few months it recovered its former state and grandeur and a strong garrison was lest for its defense the territory was likewise divided by lot among the new inhabitants the resettling a people who had made so considerable a figure in to early times of greece did highly redound to the honor of epaminondas and was a fresh digrace to the spartans for having tamely suffer the loss of a country of as large extent as the own and the most fertile of any in greece besides that they had been so long in possession of it and held it as a barrier against any invsion on that side and agesilaus was so piqud it that he made it the grounds of continuing the war with the thebans when they offered him peace and the consequence of his refusal was that it very near occasioned the loss of spark itself  the thebans in their return home met with some opposition from iphicrates who had been sent with twelve thousand athenians to assist the spartans in their extremity but having loiterd at corinth he did not come up till the business was over and afterward he omitted to secure an important pass called cenchreae which would have given them a great deal of disturbance in their retreat his conduct throughout in this affair was blamed which was the more remarkable in him because he never misbehavd upon any other occasion  epaminondas and pelopidas epaminondas and pelopidas imprisoned at their return at their return to thebes instead of receiving the acknowledgements due to their services were clapped up as state prisoners for having continued in their command four months longer than the time dimited by law which took in almost the whole of this expedition from their first entrance into peloponnesus and as the crime was capital they were tried for it they had nothing to allege in their excuse for so manifest a violation of the law but the advantages they had obtained for their country so that they confessed the charge and submitted themselves to their judges their enemies had used great art and industry to incense the people against them which epaminondas perceiving and that they were ready to pass sentence of death against him reminded them of the battle of leuctra and his other exploits by which he had saved his country and restored the liberty of greece and he made it his request to have it inscribed upon his tombstone that for those services he was punished with death this manner of reproaching them had so good an effect that they were ashamed to proceed any further against him they are tried and acquitted and he was honorably acquitted as was likewise pelopidas who being of a warmer temper and spirited up by his friends expressed his resentment of this usage and revenged himself upon meneclides who was at the bottom of this prosecution and was a very able speaker but loose in his manners illnatured perverse and envious he was one of those who met at charons house upon the affair of the cadmea and not thinking himself considered enough for his share in that enterprise made it his business upon all occasions to accuse and calumniate his superiors even after the trial he prevailed so far as to get epaminondas excluded for a year from the government of boeotia but pelopidas being more a favorite with the people he went another way to work and endeavored to supplant him by setting up charon against him which he contrived in the following manner there was a famous painter of cyzicus employed at thebes in drawing a battle but was forced away by the revolt there before he had put the last hand to it however the picture remaining in the city meneclides proposed the hanging it up in some public place with an inscription to perpetuate the memory of a victory obtained by charon at plataea though it was in reality no more than a skirmish wherein forty spartan were killed this action happened a little before the battle of leuctra and the magnifying it in this manner was plainly with a design to eclipse the glory of that day and to throw a slurupon the two generals who commanded pelepidas therefore opposed the motion which yet he did with great art and decency with regard to charon to whom he gave all due praise but at the same time he exposed the absurdity of the proposal and the malice and impertinence of the author of it which the people being sensible of laid so heavy a fine upon him that he was not able to pay it and from thenceforward he grew a common disturber of the government  but to return to the spartans they had unexpectedly got rid of a very formidable enemy but the terror and confusion they had been in the sense of the losses they had sustained and their apprehensions of what further might happen cabals and conspiracies in sparta had created a great deal of ill blood among them and raised such a spirit of murmuring and caballing against the government that agesilaus found it almost as difficult a task to manage the people in the city as to keep the enemy out of it the means by which agesilaus suppressed them there was an instance of this kind wherein he showed extraordinary address and presence of mind two hundred malcontents had got into a strong part of the town called issorion where they had seized the temple of diana agesilaus would not employ force against them not knowing how deep the plot might be laid and how far it might spread but went muffled up in his cloak with only one servant and being come near the rebels called out and told them you have mistaken my orders my directions were not that you should all go in a body to that station but some of you should plant yourselves there and others there at the same time pointing out to them different parts of the city they went off accordingly without the least suspicion to the places which he marked out to them and immediately upon their being thus dispersed he ordered some of the troops to possess themselves of that post and caused about fifteen of the conspirators to be apprehended and they were put to death the night following this conspiracy was followed by another of more dangerous consequence wherein a great number of the citizens were engaged and had private consultations every night how to introduce a change in the government they were so strong a party that it was neither safe to prosecute them publicly according to law nor to let them go on and connive at them wherefore agesilaus took another course and with the consent of the ephori put them to death privately without process which had never before been practiced in sparta but the present exigency of affairs seemed to make it necessary for these seditions happened about the time of the theban expedition and to add to the consternation the city was then under many of the helots and mercenaries at the same time deserted to the enemy  but the spartans having got over these domestic difficulties and repulsed the thebans began now to look abroad and provide for their future security they had got together a good body of auxiliaries from corinth and other parts of peloponnesus but their chief dependence was on the athenians to whom they had formally given up the command at sea in order to fix them in their interest but they were not so sanguine in it as was expected so that what they did was rather to keep the thebans under the command divided equally between athens and sparta than to assist the spartans they now insisted on being upon the same footing with them both at sea and land which they called treating upon equal terms and since nothing less would content them it was accordingly agreed that each state should command five days alternately  this agreement was no sooner made the arcadians renew the war but the arcadians renewed the war they took pallene in laconia by storm where they put above three hundred spartans in garrison to the sword olymp  0    and ravaged the country after which they were joined by the argives and eleans and the thebans sent epaminodas again to them with seven thousand foot and five hundred horse the athenians being now in earnest sent chabrias to oppose his passage he joined the spartans with their allies at corinth where they made up an army of twenty thousand men to which there was afterward an addition of two thousand from sicily who did good service epaminondas came up to force his passage as he had done before into peloponnesus but finding it shut up with a wall and a deep interechment across the isthmus as at the time of the invasion by xerxes he endeavored to draw the enemy out into the field which they declined although they were near three times his number whereupon he surveyed the works and finding one part where the spartans were posted weaker than the rest he chose to make his main attack there epaminondas again invades peloponnesus which he did with such resolution and bravery that after a very hot dispute on both sides he opened the passage and harassed the country sicyon and some other places having submitted to him and assaults corinth he pursued his march to corinth where after some skirmishing he came up with his whole strength and made so vigorous an assault that the inhabitants were in the utmost despair but is repulsed by chabrias but chabrias came out and stood the shock and by the advantage of the ground and the constant fresh supplies which he received from the city repulsed the enemy with great loss whereupon they not only retreated from corinth but quitted peloponnesus and the honor of this defense was almost entirely owing to chabrias  epaminodas by one part of his conduct in this expedition incurred the displeasure of the state for notwithstanding his bravery in forcing the pass that was defended by the spartans he was suspected of partiality toward them for not having pursued and slaughtered them when they were judged to be in his power his enemies aggravating the matter and making it a charge of treachery got him turned out of the government of boeotia and reduced to the condition of a private man this accusation was not thought to be well founded enough for so severe a censure however an occasion offered soon after wherein his service was so seasonable and so important that he easily wiped off the aspersion  it does not appear what effect the dividing the command between athens and sparta had upon this invasion however it produced one good consequence as it served to weaken the confederacy against them for it was now made use of as a precedent by the arcadians who were grown so elated with their successes and put such a value upon their services against sparta that they disdained to act any longer in subordination to the thebans this spirit was raised in them by lycomedes of mantinea the arcadians spirited up by lycomedes who had been their general in most of their late expeditions he was of great birth and fortune and being ambitious withal represented to them that the whole country of peloponnesus belonged properly to them as the first ancient inhabitants that they were the most numerous of any people in greece and so stout and powerful that they had always been considered in the first rank of auxiliaries insomuch that the spartans had never done any thing against athens without them nor had the thebans now appeared against sparta if they had not supported them that as they had formerly advanced the affairs of the spartans they were now doing the same for the thebans and that in short if they did not insist upon commanding in their turn with them they might in the end find them spartans too he had so inflamed them with these remonstrances and gained such an entire credit with them that they easily agreed to every thing he proposed and there was nothing so difficult that they were not ready to undertake this created a great coldness and jealousy on the part of the thebans and the eleans at the same time were inclined to break with the arcadians for refusing to deliver up to them some of their towns which had been taken by the spartans  whilst these disputes were on foot fresh overtures of peace the king of persia sent to manage the renewal of the peace among the grecians that they might be able to spare him such succors as he had occasion for the chief point in debate was the restoring messene to the spartans which the thebans not agreeing to the negotiations broke off and philiscus of abydus who was employed on the part of the persians returned into asia having left behind him two thousand mercenaries with money to pay them for the service of the spartans at the same time they received a second supply of two thousand men from sicily  agesilaus on account of his age got the command of the army transferred to his son archidamus who marched against the arcadians and in return for what they had done the last year in laconia stromd a town called caryae and put the garrison to the sword from whence he proceeded to parrhasia and destroyed the country about it the sicilian troops being now upon their return home were intercepted by the messenians and archidamus coming up to their relief was opposed by the arcadians and argives a signal victory of the spartans but he charged them so furiously that he broke them at once and gained a victory not easily to be accounted for it is said there fell above ten thousand of the enemy without the loss of one single man on the side of the spartans and hence it was distinguished by the name of the tearless battle the joy upon the arrival of the news at sparta was so great that the people were not able to contain themselves this was the first remarkable success they had met with since their defeat at leuctra which had made such an impression on them that it is said the men were ever since ashamed to look their wives in the face but this had given em new life they went in crowds to the banks of the eurotas full of praise and thanksgiving to the gods as having washed off the stain of that action and restored their city to its ancient splendour plutarch remarks that this excess of joy too plainly discovered the present weakness of sparta for that victory was formerly so common to them that it was looked upon as a thing of course the soldiers did not boast of it nor were the citizens exalted upon it so that in the most extraordinary case they seldom sacrificed any thing more than a cock and the messenger who brought them the news of a signal victory at mantinea in the time of the pelponnesian war had no other reward than a piece of salt meat but this was re an the manner insomuch that the old king himself went out in procession to meet and embrce his son and was attended by the epheri and the whole senate and all with tears of joy in their eyes  the thebans and eleans were far from being displead at this disaster which the arcadians had brought upon themselves by their istimd vanity and arrogance and this defeat of them was followed by a further train of misfortunes  the thebens in the mean time were daily increasing in power the thebans increase in power which gave them great credit and influence among their neighbors and pelopidas was chiesly instrumental in it they were become modeators of the quarrels about the succession in macedonia where they had composed the differences in the royal family and taken as hostages at one time thirty and afterward fifty young men of the chief families and with the former the kings brother who was afterward known by the name of philip of macedon and father of alexander the great  they were likewise applied to by the thessalians for protection against the tyranny of alexander the pherean whereupon pelopidas was sent as ambassador to expostulate with him and bring him to reason upon his return from macedonia he went to pharsalus in thessaly in order to revenge the treachery of some mercenary troops who had deserted him in that expedition he was no sooner arrived there but alexander appeared before the place with a great army pelopidas had but a few thessalian troops with him and imagining that alexander came thither to justify himself and answer the complaints that were made against him he and ismenias who was joined in commission with him went alone and unarmed to him not doubting but the power and authority of thebes with their own personal reputation and the public character with which they were invested would protect them against any violence but the tyrant finding them in his power plopidas and i smeni imprisnd by alexander of pherae seized em and sent them prisoners to pherae polybius calls it an unpardonable act of imprudence and rashness in pelopidas to trust himself so far to one whom he knew to be so wicked and perfidious alexander at first permitted every body to see him with an intent by making him a public spectacle to break his spirit and humble him but it had a different effect he sent to tell him in defiance that it was absurd in him daily to terment and put to death so many innocent worthy citizens and to spare him who he knew if ever he escaped out of his hands would certainly make him suffer the punishment due to his crimes the tyrant surprised at his intrepidity answered why is pelopidas in so much baste to die which being reported to him he sent him this reply it is that thou may perish so much the sooner by becoming still more hateful to gods and men from that time alexander allowed nobody to see or discourse with him but thebe his wife whose curiosity was raised by the account his keepers had given her of his behavior as soon as she was admitted to him she fell a weeping and said i pity your wife and i you said he who can bear with alexander when you are not his prisoner this reply affected her nearly and roused in her such a sense of her husbands ill usge of her that she repeated her visits to pelopidas and complained freely to him of the many outrages she had received he was not wanting on his part to incense her still more against him till by degrees he had worked her up to the highest pitch of hatred and resentment these frequent interviews had very much the appearance of a love affair which she had chiefly promoted but there is no real foundation to say that she went any further than to compassionate his sufferings and to communicate her own in order to revenge them which accordingly she some time after accomplished  the thebans resenting this insult upon the person of their ambassador the theans resent it immediately sent an army into thessaly but the generals through ill fortune or ill conduct being not able to effect any thing were forced to retire alexander pursuing them great numbers of their men were killed and it was owing to epaminondas that the rest of them were not totally defeated he was at this time in disgrace with the government the reason whereof has before been related and therefore he had no command in this expedition but served as a common soldier however when the troops found themselves under these difficulties which they attributed to the incapacity of their officers they obliged him to take upon him the command he took the horse and lightarmed foot and posting himself in the rear repelled and charged the enemy by turns till he made good the retreat the thebans upon the return of the generals fined each of them ten thousand drachmas and soon after sent epaminondas in their room to repair this dishonor and prosecute their revenge alexander was very much terrified at his second arrival but he preserring the safety of pelopidas to all other considerations avoided pushing things to an extremity for fear of making him desperate so as turn all his fury against his prisoner and therefore lay hovering about with his army so as to keep him in awe and yet give him an opportunity of offering satisfaction which had the effect he proposed he thought it too dishonorable a part to enter into a treaty of alliance with one who was looked upon as a monster of mankind but granted a truce of thirty days in which tin having recovered pelopidas and ismenias out his hands pelopidas and ismenias released by epaminondas he withdrew his forces he coducted the whole of this affair with so much courage and capacity on the one hand and  much prudence and temper on the other th it entirely restored him to the favor and goo opinion of his fellowcitizens and his generon behavior in overlooking their unjust resentment against him was not the least part of hi praise in it  pelopidas notwithstanding this accident ha in the main been very successful in these foreign transactions and he had raised such an opinion of the justice and integrity of the thebans as well as of their valor that they were easily tempted to pursue their design of obtaining the sovereignty of greece the thebans pursue their design of obtaining the sovereiguty of greece but finding they could not compass it by their confederates at home they had recourse to persia and they had now a good pretense for it for the spartans had before sent one thither to treat on their purt whereupon the thebans proposed it to their confederates as expedient that each of them should depute some proper person to assist there likewise in order to support their respective interests accordingly the arcadians eleans and argives consented to it and pelopidas was named on behalf of the thebans which the athenians being informed of appointed two on their part also but this was a proof how much they were degenerated from the virtue of their ancestors for whatever mean applications had before been made to the persians by particular persons or states there had been no instance of a of a congress of this kind where by a general consent all the leading states of greece were by their representatives assembled in form to discuss and settle their demands on each other at the court of persia but this was the case at present and the spartans had chiefly contributed to it by the peace of antalcidas which had prepared the grecians in general to receive the yoke and to govern themselves according to the edicts of that king whose predecessors had been so shamefully bafled in their attempts against them and who himself was so lately distressed by those very spartans when agesilaus was ravaging in the heart of his empire  pelopidas being arrived with the other ambassadors in persia negotiati ous in persia so far ingratiated himself by his address and the fame of his exploits that he was particularly distinguished from the rest of them and the king received him with most extraordinary marks of honor and esteem he represented to him at his audience that the thebans had constantly from the batte of plataea to this present time adhered to the crown of persia and that the spartans had broke with them purely because they refused to join with them against him from thence he took occasion to mention their success at leuctra with their invading laconia and intimated that the late overthrow of the arcadians and argives was owing to their not having been assisted by them the king was so well pleased with his person and discourse and was so well affected to the thebans as the people on whom he could best depend that he readily granted his demands the substance whereof was that the liberty formerly granted to all the towns should be confirmed that messene in particular should remain free from the jurisdiction of the spartans that the athenians should lay up their fleet and that the thebans should be looked upon as the ancient heredilary friends and allies of persia  pelopidas gained great credit by this negotiation and the thebans upon his return expecting to receive the benefit of it caused the deputies of all the towns to be assembled at thebes in order to their ratifying the treaty but when the oath for confirming it was tendered to them they said they came to hear the articles read not to swear to them which they could not do without consulting their principals and lycomedes objected in behalf of the arcadians to the place of their meeting which he said ought to be where the seat of the war was this method not taking effect the cities were applied to separtely in hopes by that means to awe them into a compliance but the corinthians said plainly they did not see any occasion there was for the treaty and others following their example nothing further was done in it so that the thebans were all at once disappointed in their views and artaxerxes left them as he found them without engaging himself any further in their behalf which indeed he could not do at this time without arming the rest of greece against him for his partiality to the thebans was now no less visible than the designs of the thebans themselves who had raised so much jealousy by what they had already done that there was a general disposition to unite against them and to make it a common cause the athenians were particularly disgusted by that article of the treaty which was to restrain their power at sea and they showed their resentment by putting to death timagoras one of their ambassadors upon his return from persia he was charged with having taken part with pelopidas and not having acted in concert with his colleague and as he was next to pelopidas in favor with the king and had received rich presents from him it was taken for granted that he had betrayed the interests of his country  the thebans would not yet give over their designs but finding they could not manage the arcadians olymp  0    the theban create fresh disturbances in peloponnesus and the other pelopannesian a lies to their purpose endeavored to reduce ther by means of their neighbors the achaean who had not yet taken any part in the quarel epaminondas appearing as an enemy among these latter they easily submitted to him and entered into an engagement to act in alliance with him by which means the arcadians being distressed on one side by the achaans and on the other by the spartans made their complaints of this usage at thebes and from hence arose fresh commotions and animosities in several parts of peloponnesus but not considerable enough to be particularly related the most remarkable effects of them were at sicyon account of ephn of scyon where euphron a man of great power took this occasion to erect a tyranny under color of placing the government in the people he had a natural interest among the spartans and cultivated the same with their enemies and managed so on all sides by betraying and sacrificing one party to the other and by murdering and banishing the chief of the magistrates and nobility that he obtained his ends and supported himself for some time till the people were afterward divided against him and he was murdered at thebes by a party of those whom he had banished  they who suffered most by these disturbances were the phliasians who were very much exposed by their situation among the theban allies euphron not only attacked them himself but drew the whole body of arcadians and argives upon them by whom they must have been swallowed up if they had not been timely relieved by the athenians under the conduct of chares but they had first undergone a siege and made a vigorous defense far beyond what could have been expected from a small city surrounded with so powerful enemies the chief quarrel against them was their steady adherence to the spartans for whose sakes they had often been reduced to the greatest streights and necessities and yet never could be prevailed upon from their first engaging with them to abandon their interests insomuch that their honor and fidelity in this respect is said to be without precedent  the athenians had drawn a good deal of work upon their hands in supporting this little state and being dissatisfied that none of their allies had assisted them in it the arcadians took this opportunity to propose an alliance with them a league between the athenians and arcadians it was debated among them whether the accepting it were consistent with their engagements to sparta but it being considered as of equal advantage to both states that the arcadians should be drawn off from the thebans the treaty was concluded however it was so qualified that the athenians were to assist the arcadians with a body of horse in case they were invaded without being obliged to join in the invasion of laconia this treaty was set on foot and negotiated by lycomedes lycomedes vrtherd who soon after upon his return from athens was murdered by a party of exiles he was a man of great designs and good execution but had engaged his countrymen in perpetual quarrels to support his own ambition and was undoubtedly the author of all their late misfortunes  the athenians upon this new accession acted a treacherous part against corinth which they were endeavoring to possess themselves of even whilst they had garrisoned it with their own troops as protectors and allies but the corinthians having notice of their design immediately drew all the athenians out of their garrisons and discharged them chares at the same time came up with his fleet under color of assisting them to compose matters in the city they thanked him for the offer of his service but would not trust him so far as to admit him into their harbor these proceedings dissolved the alliance between the two states the alliance dissolved between athens and corinth and were a kind of declaration of war on both sides whereupon the corinthians thought it necessary to secure themselves by a peace with the thebans and requested of the spartans to give their consent to it which they readily granted not only to them but to all such others of their consederates as desired it but declared at the same time that for their own part they would never lay down their arms till messenia should be restored to them in the condition they received it from their ancestors however the corinthians with the phliasians and some others concluded a peace with the thebans upon condition that every one should enjoy their own artaxerxes at the same time sent as a mediator to settle once more the tranquillity of greece and prevailed so far that all parties and even the spartans themselves were quiet for the present and this was called putting an end to the laconick or boeotian war olymp  0    a general peace after it had continued above five years from the battle of leuctra there is a disagreement among the historians of this time concerning the date of some of the principal events between the battle of leuctra and this peace but all the occurrences which have been here related are generally allowed to have happened within the compass of these five years  this last treaty had no more than the name and appearance of a peace which according to the present situation of affairs was not likely to be sincere or of any long continuance the growing power of thebes could not but necessarily keep up the other great states in arms against her and the lesser ones were so involved olymp  0    but is brole the next year either as accessaries in their quarrels or as principals in their own that the very next year fresh disturbances broke out the flame was first kindled between the arcadians and eleans who had long contested their right to triphylia which belonged properly to the latter and both sides according to the fortune of their arms held possession of it by turns the eleans being worsted upon this occasion called upon the spartans for assistance and the arcadians being supported by the athenians harassed the country of elis and took several towns  in the year following olymp  0    they encouraged the pisaeans upon some old fabulous pretense to claim a right of presiding at the olympic games and they accordingly took upon them to manage the solemnity the eleans to whom this honor did undoubtedly belong resolved not to give it up the eleans defeat the arcadians and argives in the midst of the exercises they fell upon the arcadians with their whole strength and with such fury and intrepidity that they soon routed them and then deseated a body of two thousand argives but being at length overpowered retreated back to their city though with great honor and applause from the people who were convened from all parts of greece to the festival and during this action stood as spectators with their crowns on their heads the behavior of the eleans upon this occasion was the more remarkable because they had a very low reputation for arms and had done nothing like it before however the pisaeans remaining conquerors went on with the sports but the eleans would not allow this olympiad to have been duly celebrated or to be registered in their annals  epaminodas during these transactions was wholly intent upon advancing the honor of his countrymen attempt of epaminondas to gain the dominion at sea for the thebans and proposed to them to try for the dominion at sea which he told them they might easily obtain as they were sovereigns at land and as a proof of it he instanced in the case of the spartans who in the war with xerxes had but ten ships at sea and yet had the command over the athenians who had two hundred the people came into his proposal and having immediately ordered preparations to be made for fitting out an hundred galleys sent him to rhodes chios and byzantium to solicit the assistance of those places and to fix them further in their interest which he easily effected notwithstanding that the athenians had sent out a strong squadron under the command of laches to oppose him but whatever schemes of this kind they had formed they were diverted from pursuing them by the part they took in the quarrels among their neighbors and the death of epaminondas happening soon after they lost the only opportunity they ever had of becoming powerful at sea  whilst he was negotiating these matters abroad some of the theban fugitives joined with the orchomenians a design to change the government of thebes in a design to change the government of thebes into an aristocracy which being discovered three hundred orchomenian horsemen who were to have put it in execution were seized by order of the theban magistrates and condemned to death they then sent a sufficient force against orchomenus where the men were all put to the sword the women and children sold for slaves and the city razed to the ground this was looked upon as an act of cruelty not common among the grecians and such as would not have happened if either epaminondas or pelopidas had been present they had always shown great humanity to those who were in their power having never spilt the blood of any man they had conquered or deprived any city of its liberty after they had taken it  the thessalians still groaning under the tyranny and oppression of alexander the pherean took up arms against him but being worsted in several battles they begged assistance of the thebans who ordered seven thousand men uner the command of pelopidas pelopidas sent against alexander of pherae to their relief but just as he was ready to march there happened a great eclipse of the sun from which the people according to the ignorance and superstition of the times apprehended such strange effects that pelopidas thought it not advisable to proceed with so great a number of his countrymen against the general opinion that the expedition would prove fatal as to himself he was not at all moved at this phenomenon although he was supposed to be principally affected by it for the augurs had made it portend his death considering him as the sun of thebes that was to be eclipsed however he resolved to go on and marched out with only three hundred horsemen who attended him as volunteers and having joined the thessalians he encamped in the face of the enemy who was far superior to him in numbers having an army of above twenty thousand men the battle at cynoscephalae near a place called cynoscephalae there were two hills opposite to each other in the midst of the plain and both sides endeavored to get possession of them with their foot pelopidas at the same time ordered his cavalry to charge that of the enemy which he soon routed and pursued over the plain but alexander having gained the hills and doing great execution upon the thessalians who attempted to force those ascents pelopidas was obliged to give over his pursuit and march up to their relief which so animated them that after two or three charges the enemy began to fall into disorder and give way which pelopidas perceiving cast his eyes about in search of alexander and having at length discovered him in the right wing rallying and encouraging his men he was so inflamed at the sight that he advanced before his soldiers crying out and challenging the tyrant who retreated and sheltered himself in the ranks pelopidas there upon grew desperate and charged the enemy arh great numbers whereof as they advanced forwards he cut down with his own hand but others at a distance shot through his armor and wounded him and then they stabbed him in the breast with their spears pelopidas killed the thessalians seeing him in this danger hastened down from the hlls to his assistance but came too late to save him however to revenge his death they attacked the enemy so vigorously both with their horse and foot that they entirely routed them and killed above three thousand in the pursuit and yet did they not look upon it as a victory or think that any success could compensate the loss of their general the thebans who were then present lamented over him in the tenderest and most affectionate manner calling him their father savior and instructor in every thing that was great and excellent the thessalians and other allies not only sympathizd but vyd with them in expressing their concern and doing honor to his memory and the whole army was so affected that they neither put off their armor nor unbridled their horses nor even dressed their wounds but ran to him and heaped up the spols of the enemy about his dead body they cut off their horses manes and their own hair and such as retired to their tents neither kindled a fire nor took any kind of refreshment in all the cities through which the body passed it was attended by the magistrates with the priests and inhabitants carying trophies crowns and golden armor after which the thessalians begged it as a singular favor of the thebans that they might bury him and in the most pathetick terms urged it as a sort of right due to them as the greatest sufferers you indeed said they have lost a great general and in that we share in common with you but we have likewise lost in him all the hopes of recovering our liberty and under this heavy misfortune our paying the last honors to him may be some small alleviation of our sorrow the thebans granted their request and they buried him with great pomp and splendour his death as to the manner of it was rather to be pitied than commended for he certainly exposed himself more than he ought to have done but besides the natural heat of his temper which was not easily to be restrained he was animated with a more than ordinary zeal in the cause of liberty especially at this juncture when i was in a manner deserted by the other great states for the spartans instead of exerting themselves as formerly in behalf of those who were injured were making a servile court to dionysius the tyrant of sicily and supplying him with officers the aenian were at the same time kept in pay by this very alexander and in honor to him had erected his statue this therefore pelopidas thought the fairest occasion of advancing his own and his countrys honor and of making it appear to the rest of greece that the thebans were the only people who waged war t succor the distressed and to destroy all arbitrary and unjust government and this wa the principal motive of his entering upon this expedition but besides these considerations he was fired with resentment against the person of alexander by whom he had been s injuriously treated and could not forego such an opportunity of endeavoring as well to revenge himself of the tyrant as to extirpa the tyranny  he was of one of the best families in thebes and came early to the possession of a large fortune his character which he employed chiefly in the relief o such as wanted and deserved his assistance among the rest he pitched upon epaminondas as proper object of his bounty but could never prevail with him to accept a present from him which had such an effect upon him that h chose to conform himself after his example t a plain frugal and laborious way of living an there was in his apparel and at his table a open unaffected simplicity which he ever after wards maintained in the highest posts of the government but notwithstanding this regularity and appearance of economy his constant attention to the business of the public made him neglect his private affairs and very much impaired his estate insomuch that having a great number of children to provide for his friends took occasion one day to tell him that money was a very necessary thing it is so indeed said he but it is for that man yonder pointing to one nicodemus who was lame and blind there was a great conformity of manners between him and epaminondas except that he delighted most in the exercises of the body and the other in those of the mind but they had the same general disposition to virtue and the love of their country and this begat the strictest friendship between them plutarch dates the beginning of it from the siege of mantinea soon after the peace of antalcidas the thebans acting then in alliance with sparta epaminondas and pelopidas were engaged together and their wing giving way they kept their ground and stood singly in each others defense till pelopidas being very much wounded fell among the slain epaminondas concluded him dead yet would not leave his body in the power of the enemy but though he was wounded himself likewise maintained the conflict till at length agesipolis the spartan king came up from the other wing of the army and rescued them both when to all appearance they were lost this was an action that must in all probability have happened before the town was besieged and there is room to collect from pausanias that it did so but it is not generally taken notice of nor any where particularly described neither does it elsewhere appear that either of these two generals had distinguished themselves so early in any engagement however this circumstance of their lives in the manner it is attested may have its weight and it is too remarkable a one to be omitted but however their friendship began it was very sincere and lasting and the success of their achievements was almost entirely owing to that perfect union and good correspondence that was always between them without any jealousy of command abroad or rivalship in the administration at home this good agreement between them has been taken notice of in opposition to that spirit of dissension envy and rancour which formerly reigned in athens between aristides and themistocles cimon and pericles nicias and alcibiades who great as they were in other respects were always endeavoring to supplant and ruin one another and their personal enmity was said to exceed that which they bore to the enemies of their country but yet it has been shown that some of them knew how to stile their jealousies upon occasion and to curb and moderate their resentment when the affairs of the public required it but there was no need of any management of this kind between the two great men we are now speaking of they had no private views of their own they were above all considerations of money and they had no ambitions but for the public so that provided that were well served their intention was answered and each of them looked upon the others success in it as his own as to what relates further to pelopidas singly he was very strong and active and of indesatigable industry he was bold and enterprising and so successful withal that he never lost one battle he had so thoroughly established himself in the favor and affections of the people that he was chose thirteen times governor of boeotia or as diodorus says without interuption from the time of the recovering the cadmea upon the whole he was at least the second man of thebes and in some respects may be considered as the first particularly with regard to the affair of the cadmea which was certainly the foundation of the theban greatness he would indeed have persuaded epaminondas to bear a part with him in that undertaking but he declined it as an action of too much blood and outrage he told him that if the rest who were concerned in it were as moderate as their chief he should make no scruple of joining with them but that some of them he foresaw would carry their passion and revenge too far and must necessarily involve the innocent with the guilty however in the main he approved the design as the cause of liberty and in some measure contributed toward the success though he did not care to be engaged in the desperate part of it  the thebans as well to revenge the death of pelopidas as to improve the victory of the thessalians which they were not able to do of themselves forthwith sent to their assistance seven thousand foot and seven hundred horse who soon defeated and broke to pieces the remainder of alexanders army alexander defeated and reduced to terms whereupon he was compelled to restore the towns he ha taken from the thessalians and to withdraw his garrisons out of all the other places h had unjustly seized and he was further obliged by oath to take part with the theban in their wars whenever they should requir it upon these conditions they permitted him to return in peace to his own dominions where he continued about seven year longer till he was grown so insupportable t every body about him that he was murdered it his bed by his wife and his brothers is murdered h dead body was dragged about the streets an trodden under foot and left as a prey so the dogs nor were any indignities of thi kind though too much for him account of his cruelt who had been wont to bury some alive and to dress up other in bears and boars skins to be baited an shot at for his diversion and who had surprise and massacred the inhabitants of whole cities which were in friendship and alliance with him but amidst these cruelties there is one instance recorded of him wherein he discovered some little sparks of humanity and remorse which yet he was far from valuing himself upon for seeing a famous tragoedian act in the troades of euripides he went abruptly out of the theater but sent to bid the actor go on with his part for that he did not go out of any dislike of his performance but because he was ashamed that he who had never shown any concern for those he had murdered should be seen to weep for the sufferings of hecuba and andromache  but to return to the thebans they were still restlcss in their pursuit of power and sought all opportunities of advancing themselves upon the weakness or divisions of the other states they who furnished them with the most plausible pretense for stirring at this time olymp  0    divisions among the arcadians were the arcadians who were quarrelling among themselves about some consecrated money which they had taken out of the temple of olympia during their disputes with the eleans and applied to the payment of a select body of their troops called the epariti the mantineans protested against it as sacrilege and brought over several of the council of ten thousand who had at first consented to it to retract their opinion and to agree with them that it was a wicked thing which would sor ever brand them with infamy and entail a curs upon their posterity the debating this matter was principally between the tegeans and mantineans and it wrought such confusion between them and the rest of the arcaians that they thought it necessary for the peace of the community to make it up as well a they could both with the eleans and among themselves but the leading men who had touched the money apprehending they might be called to an account for it thought the best way of preventing such an enquity would be to embroil matters still more and theresore sent to the thebans to let them know the arcadians were upon the point of revolting to the spartans if they did not speedily come in and put a stop to it at the same time they sent directions to a theban officer in tegea to seize some of their own people as disturbers of the peace and accordingly great numbers were apprehended and consigned as prisoners of the state but this occasioned such a general clamor that they were soon after dischargd and complaint was made of it at thebes as a matter of impeachment against the officer for intermeddling in their affairs and attempting to interrupt the good correspondence between the two states the more moderate among them who saw the consequence of calling in a foreign power to decide their differences protested against the thebans marching their troops into their territories and did what they could to prevent it which the thebans take advantage of but the theans could not be prevailed upon to let slip such an opportunity of getting once more a footing in peloponnesus which was their real design and epaminondas made no great secret of it but he told them at the same time by way of justification that the thebans had been drawn into the war on their account that therefore they had acted treacherously with them in making peace with athens without their consent however that when he should march his army into peloponnesus to assist his friends there he should see what proofs they the arcadians would then give of their fidelity this was delivered in so magisterial and menacing a style that they who were best afsected to the thebans did not like it and the mantineans with such others as were concerned for the good of the community and the general safcty of peloponnesus concluded there was no time to be lost in providing against the worst that could happen  accordingly they sent to the athenians and spartans to apprise them of the danger athens and sparta  to assist the mantine and to ask their assistance they immediately took the alarm and entered into a strict consederacy sor their common defense and to prevent all disputes about the command in the army it was agreed to divide it in such mannet that each state was to have it within their own territories this was a point the arcadians had very much at heart but the spartans being now so easily persuaded to give that up to them which they had so long contcsted with the athenians even till they were reduced to the greatest extremity was a plain proof how much they were terrified with the apprechensions of another descent into peloponnesus  epaminondas in the mean time began his march with all the boeotians some euboean and a body of thessalian horse expecting to be joined by the argives messenions and many others upon his appearing among them upon his first arrival in peloponnesus he lay for some time at nemea a town in the teitory of argos where he might reasonably hope to intercept the athenians in their march to join their consederates but receiving intelligence that they were to pass by sea he removed to  which city with the greatest part of areadia immediately declared for him the spartans with their consederates had their general rendezvous at mant which they naturally imagined would be first attacked as being the chief seat of those who had revolted from the thebans  but whilst they were securing themselves on this side epaininondas considering that the city of spara was in a manner drained for this expedition broke up privately epaminondas endeavors to surprise sparta and marched all night in order to surprise it but the design being discovered to agesilaus as he was upon his march to mantinea he sent immediate notice of it to sparta with orders to put the town in a posture of defense till he could come in to its relief which he did with such expedition that epaminondas found him in the city ready to receive him that which is here related of agesilaus is by diodous siculus ascribed to agis the other spartan king however that be it is certain that agesilaus had a principal part in the defense of the city the few forces in it were posted to the best advantage that the time and other circumstances would admit of and the old men and boys were placed on the tops of the houses to annoy the enemy with darts and stones epaminondas though he found by this disposition that his design was discovered yet made an assault at several parts of the city but met with the most vigorous opposition agesans saw there was now no room for that caution or cunning but is  agehlau which had served him upon other occasions wherefore putting all upon a desperate push he exerted himself far beyond what could be expected from his years and by dint of valor repulsed the enemy but great part of the glory of this action was due to his son archidamus the  who having les  hundred men with him was at all the dangerous passes where the enemy pressed hardest he passed the river in open defiance of the thebans then marched up an eminence charged and routed those soldiers who a xenophon expresses it  breathed fire and who so lately beat the spartans when they had the advantage both of the ground and the numbers he who signalized himself most as a private man and of isadas was isadas the son of phabidas he was a very beautiful large and wellproportiond youth scarce arrived at the age of manhood he had just anointed himself at home when the alarm being given he rushed out without any arms and almost naked then snatching a spear in one hand and a sword in the other he broke into the thickest of his enemies and bore down all before him the ephori after the action was over gave him a garland as the reward of his gallantry but then to keep up the rigor of their discipline fined him a thousand drachmas for going into the battle unarmed  the spartan forces were now come up from mantinca and were followed by most of the confederates  so that epaminondas finding nothing more to be done on that side drew of his army and turned toward mantinea which he judged to be now quite desenceless for besides that the troops were drawn out of it the inhabitants were scattered about in the fi having taken that opportunity whilst the war was removed into another quarter to get in their harvest wheresore he resolved to attack the town and first ordered the horse thither who found the people dispersed in the manner they had been informed and all things to appearance as they expected but it happened that six thousand athenian auxiliaries who coming by sea knew nothing of what had passed at sparta and having passed the isthmus in order to join the confederates as they supposed in mantinea were just got into the town and without staying to refresh themselves or their horses marched out and gave the thebans battle after an obstinate dispute with some loss on both sides the athenians got the better mantinea relieved by the atheniens and took those who were without the walls under their protection this action was a very sharp one but not decisive and is to be considered rather as a skirmish and a prelude to what happened afterward than as a victory however it was of more immediate consequence to the mantineans who without such a seasonable and miraculous relies must have been lost and hegelochus who commanded this body of athenians obtained great honor by making such a stand against the thebans who were much superior in numbers and were also supported by the thessalian horse  epaminondas was very much piqud at the ill success of these two last enterprises which he was asraid would lessen him in the opinion of his allies and sully the glory of his former achievements and therefore thought himself obliged to attempt something further to support his own and his countrys honor and to keep up the spirits of those whom he had taken under his protection and as the time allotted him for this expedition was very near expiring he had no time to lose besides he was got so far into the enemies country and they were so well prepared sor him and watched his motions so narrowly that he thought he could not easily secure his retreat without fighting or that if he did it would be abandoning and sacrificing his allies these considerations determined him to proceed immediately to action and by one decisive battle either to make himself master of peloponnesus or to fall honorably in the attempt  accordingly a m  upon the spartans coming to the relies of the mantincans he prepared to attack them and this drew on a general engagement of both the armies with their respective consederates that of the thebans consisted of thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse which was more by a third part both of horse and foot than the spartans had with the athenians and all the rest of their associates the mantineans as the war was in their territori were in the right wing with the spartans next to them the athenians in the lest and the achaans eleans and others of less note made up the main body the thebans with the arcadians chose the left of their army to oppose the right of the enemy the argives were in the right and their main body consisted of the euboeans locrians sicyonians messenians thessalians and others and both the armies were flanked with their horse  but after this disposition epaminondas took a compass as if he declined fighting and then made his troops halt and lay down their arms with a show of encamping at a small distance from the enemy hoping by this feint to allay their heat and take off the first impression of their fury and then to fall upon them by surprise which happened in a great measure as he expected for when he afterward advanced toward them they had quitted their arms and their horses and were so dispersed about that they had much ado to form themselves in time however they recovered the surprise and stood the charge with great resolution epaminondas put the issue of the battle upon his left wing as he did at leuctra and his scheme of breaking in upon the enemy was much after the same manner by placing the best of his men in front then drawing them up close and narrowing them to a point so as to penetrate like the beak of a gally as xenophon expresses it the engagement began with the horse and it was very hot and obstinate till at length the athenians who bore the brunt of it were so galled with the darts and slings of the thessalians and so overpowered with the numbers of the thebans that they were forced to give way and to leave their foot exposed but yet they kept themselves in a body so as not to break in upon them and in their retreat meeting with a detachment of the euboeans and other mercenaries whom epaminondes had sent round to attack their rear they fell in among them and cut them entirely to pieces the rest of the athenians in that wing were hard pressed by the argives and the theben horse but some elean horse who had been posted in the rear as a body of reserve coming up to their relief they maintained their ground their horse in the other wing made the same vigorous resistance but were forced at last to throw themselves in among their foot for protection  upon this the foot joined battle and sought with incredible fury especially the spartans and the thebans who were more immediately concerned in the event of the action and were never more in earnest their lances being broke with the violence of the charge they closed in with their swords and stood foot to foot neither side abating of their rage or giving back one inch of ground which epaminondas perceiving formed a troop of the most determined men about him and putting himself at the head of them made a very vigorous charge upon the lacedaemonian phalanx and wounded their general with the first javelin he threw and his troop pushing on with the same ardour he soon broke the enemy to pieces and then made such havoc among them that the ground about him was covered with the bodies of the slain but advancing still forwards in order to make a thorough rout of it the spartans rallied and collected themselves into a body pointing their whole fury at him and throwing an infinite number of darts at him epaminondas killed many of which he drew out of his body and retorted at them till at last he was mortally wounded by a javelin which was said to be thrown by gryllus the son of xenophon who was afterward killed himself in the same battle but the death of epaminondas is by some ascribed to anticrates a spartan who as a reward for so minent a piece of service was exempted from all public offices and taxes and plutarch says there was one of his descendants remaining in his time who enjoyed the same immunities the thebans upon their generals falling renewed the attack in order to rescue his body and after a very sharp resistance on the part of the spartans carried it off this missortune put an end to the action and both sides parted as it were by consent xenophon makes it entirely a drawn battle and says that each party rected trophies and asked leave to bury their dead that neither of them took any town nor gained any accession of territory or any increase of power and that things remained just in the same situation after the battle as they were before but however exact and faithful he may be in the other parts of his history he is thought upon this occasion to have been a little prejudiced and to have industriously avoided saying too much to the advantage of the thebans who had manifestly the victory though they were in too much concern and confusion to pursue it and the only grounds upon which the enemy disputed it with them was on account of the euboeans and others whom the athenians in their retreat had cut to pieces  epaminondas was carried alive into his tent where as soon as he recovered his speech he asked his friends about him whether the enemy had taken his shield from him they told him it was safe and it being brought to him he kissed it he then asked which side had the victory they told him the thebans all then said he is well and soon after upon the drawing the head of the javelin out of his body he sell as it were in the arms of victory and congramlating the good fortune of his country expired  there was something very great and solemn in these circumstances of his death his character and suitable to that just and deliberate firmness and composure of mind which he had shown in all the actions of his life to consider him in all respects as a soldier statesman and philosopher he was not only as cicero esteems him the first man of greece but the greatest perhaps that any age or country has produced for all the several virtues which others possessed singly were united in him and in so perfect a degree as to be without an allay of any one vice or failing besides his natural good disposition he had all the advantages of education and was furnished with the best masters not only for eloquence and philosophy but also for his exercises and all the other lighter accomplishments hence it was that polymnis his fathers house was at that time one of the best schools in greece and open to all the learned world he was indeed more liberal upon this head of expense than his circumstancees would allow for though he was of one of the best families in thebes he died so poor as to leave his son no other fortune than what he had bestowed on him in this manner it happened however that he neither wanted nor desired one for he had such a thorough contempt of riches that he did not leave enough to bury him he was in this as in many other respects a philosoper in practice and reality and was poor upon choice and yet without any affectation he view of being applauded for it jusian says he was no more desirous of fame than he was of riches he did not indeed affc popularity or applause he was so modest that all his great offices were in a manner forced upon him and his first motive in all his undertakings was the honor of his country but yet he had not an insensibility of glory with regard to himself as may appear from the answer he made to his friends about him when he was dying among other expressions of their grief for the loss of him they lamented his leaving no children behind him yes said he i leave two fair daughters the victories of leuctra and mantinea to perpetuate my memory upon another occasion being asked whether he thought himseif or chabrias or iphicrates the better general it is hard said he to judge while we live there are other instances to prove that he knew what was due to his merit and that he did not decline praise though he did not covet it he was covetous of nothing but his time which he employed wholly in the improvement of his mind or in what he thought might be useful to the public and he made even his diversions subservient to that end his running wrestling and other exercises of that kind were not used by him as they generally were by others barely for amusement or the glory of excelling in them but as lessons of instruction in the art of war for which reason he had an aversion to sat men in the army and disbanded one who he said would require three or four shields to cover his belly he had an extraordinary genius for war and had thoroughly studied the theory of it before he entered upon action it has appeared from his disposition and his manner of attacking both at leuctra and mantinea that he was particularly well skilled in the tacticks that which has set him in a light above most of the grecian generals is the difficulties and discouragements which he met with upon his first appearance in the world he had to do with a people who were sunk into a state of sloth and idleness and disposed to slavery they were very low at that time in their reputation for arms and though they had taken some part in the late wars it was occasionally only and rather in order to support themselves by their attachment to those who were best able to protect them than with a sense of gaining honor or asserting their freedom they had but few troops and those were without spirit or discipline and without officers to conduct them this was not the case of the great captains who went before him especially those of athens and sparta who had troops ready formed and disciplined inured to dangers and fatigue sird with ambition and the love of their country supported by their fellowcitizens and flushed with victory so that their commanders had nothing more to do than to pursue the track of glory they were in and to carry on the service in the way they found it epaminondas had none of these advantages but by his courage and zeal and the force of his genius he supplied the want of them and in effect created an army which being trained up by his instructions and animated by his example soon showed the thebans that they were capable of acting for themselves and fighting their own battles from hence it was that from auxillaries and dependents they became principals and put in for their turn of superiority in grecce it must be allowed that pelopidas had paved the way for him in effecting this change and that he had been assisting to him in most of his great enterprises but without epimanondas the work had been left very imperfect it was his bold defiance of the spartans that brought on the battle of leuctra and he afterward went further toward the reducing them than any one man or than all the states of greece together and though he did not thoroughly succeed in it he had so disabled and dispirited them that they never recovered their former reputation and authority among other marks of their being humbled he had brought them to lengthen their monosyllables as he himself expressed it in rallying them upon that assected and i dont  i may be allowed  but it seem to be justified by the  which taci  despotick brevity with which they were wont to expres mselves in their answers to those who oerd to treat or expostulate with them his military virtues were still inferior to those which regarded either the society or himself his disedness was visible in every circumstance of his life and nothing could ever shake his integrity or slacken his zeal sor the public the persians knowing of what consequence it was to fix him in their interest sent diomedon of cyzicus to tempt him with a large sum of money he first gained micythus a particular favorite of his and gave him five talents to sound him upon it but epaminondas rejected the offer with disdain and indignation declaring that he would not put the riches of the universe in competition with the good of his country you diomedon said he dont know me and i am not surprised that you should form a judgment of me from yourself for which reason i forgive you but withal advise you to make the best of your way home that you may not have an opportunity of corrupting others as for you said he addressing himself to micythus if you dont immediately restore him his money i will deliver you up to the magistracy his generosity and friendship have sufficiently appeared in his behavior to pelopidas he was judicious and grave but yet afsable he was continent patient of injuries and very compassionate and to crown all he was strictly just and so sincere a lover of truth that he would not tell a lie even in jest he was also a very able speaker and had gone further in his search after knowledge of all kinds than most of the pailosophers of his time who were so by profession and yet he did not value himself upon it or make any show of it and it was said of him in this respect that nobody knew more than he and spoke less study was indeed his darling passion and he was so devoted to it that he may be considered almost as a single instance of one who acquitted himself so well to the public against the natural bent of his inclination it was looked upon as matter of astonishment that a man who was so much hid from the world and buried as it were in books should break out at once into so great and so tumultuous a scene of action that he should negotiate the interests of his country abroad manage the government at home and lead an army with such success against the united powers of greece but he had a capacity for every thing and applied himself to every thing and when he was once roused by a sense of what the public expected from him he gave up his beloved retirement and was from thenceforwards in such continual motion that nobody every did so much in so short a time when the thebans were once brought into action he resolved to keep them up to it if i am your general said he you must be soldiers boeotia as being an open flat country he told them was the stage of war and that they could keep it no longer than they had their hands upon their shields it was by these maxims and this conduct that he became the support of his country and a pattern to the greatest captains of the present and succeeding times philopaemen who is called the last of the grecians made it his study to imitate him and is said to have come very little short of him in his valor and conduct and his integrity but he was more rough and choleric and had too much of the soldier in his common deportment whereas epaminondas was cool and gentle and had nothing of fierceness but in the field upon the whole he raised the glory of thebes to an height beyond any of her neighbors at that time and that so suddenly that it was said to be born with him and it will appear by the sequel of the story how far it may be likewise said to have expired with him  the grecian history book ii the affairs of greece from the battle of mantinea to the death of philip of macedon containing the space of    years chap i from the battle of mantinea to the end of the social war containing the space of   years the battle of mantinea was the greatest that ever was fought by grecians against grcians the whole strength of the country being drawn out and ranged according to their different interests and it was fought with an obstinacy equal to the importance of it which was the fixing the empire of greece and this must of course have have been transferred to the thebans upon their victory if they had not lost the fruits of it by the death of their general who was the soul of all their counsels and designs this blasted all their hopes and put out their sudden blaze of power almost as soon as it was kindled however they did not presently give up their pretensions they were still ranked among the leading states and made several further struggles but they were faint and ineffectual and such as were rather for life and being than for superiority and dominion they proposed nothing further to themselves at present than an honorable peace and this was according to the opinion of epaminondas himself who when he lay wounded in his tent inquired after those whom he judged most proper to succeed him in the command and finding they were killed in the battle advised them to make peace which they easily concluded for their enemies were as weary of the war as themselves the conditions were the peace renewed by all but the spartans that every one should retain what they were now in possession of and hold it independent of any other power hereupon all the states of greece entered into a league offensive and defensive excepting only the spartans who refused to ratify the treaty because the messenians were included in it this opposition was raised chiefly by agesilaus agesilaus censured for it who was therefore looked upon as stubborn and refractory and an unreasonable protracter of the war especially as he had no money to carry it on but what he was to raise by loans and heavy taxes and his stickling with so much obstinacy at this time for the country of messenia revived in the minds of the people the great extent of territory and the great dominion both by sea and land that he had lost since his accession to the throne  but whatever censure he had incurred by this proceeding olymp  0    his transactions in egypt his next enterprise which was the last scene of his life was still more blameable at least with regard to himself though it did not so much affect the interest of his country tachos who had usurped the kingdom of egypt being at war with the persians engaged agesilaus to assist him with a body of spartans accordingly he entered into that service expecting to have the sole command of the army upon his arrival in egypt all the great officers of the crown went to pay their compliments to him and the whole country flocked down to the shore to see the man whose reputation in arms had made so much noise in the world but they were much disappointed when instead of the great and awful prince they looked for they found a little old man of a contemptible presence lying on the grass his clothes threadbare and his hair uncombd and rejecting their rich presents of sweetmeats and perfumes which he told them they might give to his slaves the helots he joined the egyptian army which consisted of eighty thousand men besides ten thousand hired troops whereof one thousand were spartans but tachos deceived him in his expectations of being general and would allow him no other command than that of the mercenaries at land committing to chabrias who came in as a voluntier from athens the charge of his fleet and reserving to himself the chief command over all agesilaus was otherwise treated by him with so much insolence and in a manner so much below his spirit and dignity that he took an opportunity to fall in with nectanebus his son or rather his nephew who had revolted from him and got himself to be proclaimed king in his stead and the people being generally on his side agesilaus joined with them and drove tathos out of his kingdom he had no sooner withdrawn himself but another competitor started up and marched against nectanebus with an army of an hundred thousand men who shut him up in one of his towns and laid siege to it when the works were pretty well advanced and the lines of circumvallation drawn almost round the place nectanebus threw himself among the grecians and sallying out by night at the gap where the lines were unfinished drew up his forces and easily routed those of the enemy who were entangled and encompassed by their own works this was owing entirely to the advice and conduct of agesilaus who improved this victory by several others till he had settled nectanebus in full and quiet possession of the throne diodorus relates this part differently as if agesilaus had reconciled himself to tachos and reinstated him in the kingdom but this rests singly upon his authority and the other account is more natural as well as more general agesilaus acquitted himself extremely well as to the military part of this expedition but it does not in other respects redound much to his honor one chief motive of his undertaking it was gain which he covered under a pretense of supplying the necessities of the state but the letting himself out to hire to a barbarian and serving under an egyptian rebel as a captain only of a band of mercenaries was thought very unbecoming a spartan king especially of his age and character he first made a mean figure by entering into that service and then a scandalous one by deserting it and joining with the enemy of him whom he came to as an auxiliary he endeavored to justify himself by several false pretenses and according to the common plea of the spartans in the like cases called it acting for the benefit of his country but whatever name he gave it it was certainly a foul action and plutarch calls it downright treachery and it was more so in him because it was purely his own act without being tied down by any express orders from the government of sparta the winter following nectanebus dismissed him with great marks of civility and gratitude for the services he had done him and gave him two hundred and thirty talents of silver with which he sailed homeward but was drove by stress of weather upon a desert shore of africa called the haven of menelaus where he sickend and died his death being full eighty four years old of which he had reigned forty one  he was so extraordinary a man and character and had so many mixed qualities that besides what has been already observed of him in the course of the history it may be proper to take a more distinct view of him he set out in the world with strong prejudices against him both as to his person and his pretensions the first of them he overcame by the sprightliness of his air and his good humor with a way he had of jesting upon himself which prevented others using the same freedom with him however he was so sensible of his defects that he would not suffer any picture or statue to be made of him in his lifetime and utterly forid the doing it after his death his way to the throne was attended with greater difficulties which yet he got over by his spirit and address and by the assistance of his friends particularly of lysander who in effect put the crown upon his head and in that respect it was made a charge of ingratitude upon agesilaus that he had afterward upon a slight pretense thrown him off but he himself was the cause of it he valued himself too much upon his services to him and his behavior to him in asia has been shown to be so arrogant and assuming that it might very well justify his sending him away from him when he found he could no longer act with him lysander full of resentment upon his return formed a powerful party against him to break which he singled out the ringleaders some of whom he sent away upon foreign services others he got to be accused of avarice and injustice in their employments and then made it his business to bring them off thereby obliging them to become his friends and so by degrees he wore out the faction as he was a younger son he was bred up with more severity and subjection than the immediate heirs of the crown and by the obedience he paid to the laws as a private man he was better fitted for the government when he came to it he made great court to the ephori and the senate even to a show of reverence and by the deference he paid to their power he secretly advanced his own and by that means carried the prerogative higher than any of his predecessors but his popularity grew at last suspected insomuch that he is said to have been fined by the ephori for monopolizing the citizens who were looked upon as the common goods of the republic he was remarkable for his continency and moderation and kept up the old spartan plainness and frugality even to affectation not allowing his wife and daghter to distinguish themselves by their dress and living in the same house that belonged to aristodemus his predecessor above seven hundred years before nor suffering so much as the door of it to be repaired yet notwithstanding this rigid appearance there was nothing of stiffness or moroseness in his behavior he treated every body with candor and affability and had such a complacency and agreeableness in his conversation as made him amiable to the last he was very sond of his children and would often enter into their little sports with them being one day surpised by a friend as he was riding with them on an hobbyhorse say nothing of it said he till you are a father yourself he was generous to his enemies not detracting any thing from their due merit easily forgiving and never taking any unjust advantage against them on the other hand he was too partial to his friends whom in all cases right or wrong he thought himself obliged to support of which there is an instance in a letter of his to idrieus prince of caria wherein he says if nicias be innocent acquit him if he be guilty acquit him upon my account however be sure to acquit him of the same kind was his interposing in behalf of phaebidas and sphodrias and yet the consequence of it was in a great measure the engaging sparta in the leuctrian war it was a saying of his that to be straitlaced in point of justice when ones friend is concerned is only a pretense for deserting him yet nobody talked more of justice upon other occasions than he did insomuch that some about him expatiating one day upon the grandeur of the king of persia wherein said agesilaus does his grandeur consist or how is he greater than i am if he be not more just by which he would have it understood that justice was the rule of all his actions but he has not given many instances of it especially in his public character wherein he was so different from what he was in his private life that he may be considered as two different persons his failings in the latter were few and generally speaking goodnatured ones but in his regal and military capacity his passions were much stronger and his faults more unpardonable the same aspiring temper which he discovered from his childhood and by which he afterward usurped the crown carried him on to the last stage of his life and bore down all other considerations that stood in the way of his ambition and yet he managed so well that he passed the first thirty years of his reign in great honor and esteem but as he advanced further in years he grew more perverse and arbitrary and withal more restless and impatient continually forming new schemes of action and never easy but in war and indeed he had admirable talents for t he was brave active and vigilant he had nurd himself to the extremes of heat and cold and fared as hard in other respects as a private sentinel he was very careful to keep up the courage of his soldiers for which purpose he would conceal or lessen the news of a defeat in other parts or sometimes substitute the report of a victory in the room of it he had a more efind way of deceiving his enemies by publishing his real design of a march or an attack so that they might take it for a feint and consequently be unprepared for him nobody knew better how to use the advantages of time and place or to effect by stratagem what he could not obtain by force and notwithstanding his natural impetuosity he could command himself upon occasion and was either cool and temperate or daring and desperate according as the case required of which he gave sufficient proofs in his defense of the city of sparta his behavior upon that occasion when the whole was at stake was great and glorious though it must be allowed at the same time that he did nothing more than what he owed to his country whose interests he had sacrificed to his implacable hatred of the thebans and messenians and his insatiable thirst of revenge the spartans were so sensible of his abilities that when he was in asia they constituted him admiral as well as general which was an honor they had never before conferred on one single person his power after that expedition increasing in proportion to the opinion they had of him he did what he would with them and brought them into such a condition that they were forced to rely upon him and to stand or fall with him and though he saved them from immediate destruction he had sufficiently drained and harassed them and left them in a miserable declining state lysander gave the first shock to their power by his pride and agesilaus quite broke it by his obstinacy the first made them odious to their neighbors and the latter made them contemptible and upon the whole it may be said that sparta owed her downfall to the two greatest men she ever bred  the death of epaminondas and the peace which ensued upon it had slackened the zeal of the principal powers of greece the indolent state of greece and rendered em too secure the athenians more particularly when they found themselves delivered from him who kept up their emulation grew indolent and remiss and abandoned themselves to their ease and pleasure being wholly taken up with shows sports and festivals they were naturally too much addicted to these sorts of amusement and they had formerly been encouraged in them by pericles who knew how to lead them by their inclinations and took this method to ingratiate himself with them and to divert them from inspecting too narrowly into his administration but they now carried these diversions to a much higher pitch of extravagance they had such a passion for the stage that it stifled in them all other thoughts either of business or of glory poets and players were become their only favorites and received the esteem and applause that was due to the captains who had fought their battles the very victualling of their fleets and armies was consumed upon the stage their singers and dancers were pampered up with marrow and other luscious food whilst the admiral and the captains of the ships had no other provisions on board but meal cheese and onions in short the decorations and other charges attending the theater were so excessive that plutarch says it cost more to represent some of the famous pieces of sophocles and euripides than it had done to carry on the war against the barbarians and in order to support this charge they seized upon the fund which had been set apart for the war with a prohibition upon pain of death even to advise the applying it to any other purpose they not only reversed this decree but went as far the other way making it death to propose the restoring the fund to the uses to which had before been appropriated under the sam penalties by diverting the course of the supplies in so extraordinary a manner and enter taining the idle citizen at the expense of the soldier and mariner they seemed to have n remains of that spirit and vigor which they had exerted in the persian wars when they demolished their houses to furnish out a navy an when the women stoned a man to death who proposed to appease the great king as he was called by paying tribute and doing homag to him  but whilst they were wrapped up in this slothful security and had nothing immediately to apprehend from their old enemies either in greece or persia they found themselves on a sudden engaged with a people which the macedonians take advantage of who were hitherto obscure and in a manner barbarous these were the macedonians who though they were hardy and warlike enough had never yet presumed to intermeddle in the affairs of greece the truth is they had enough to do at home to adjust the quarrels about the succession of their kings and to defend themselves against the illyrians ponians and other powerful neighbors but several circumstances concurred at this time to raise them out of their obscurity and to bring them into a new scene of action which by degrees wrought such a thorough change in the state of greece that it will be necessary to take a cursory view of their affairs and to consider them connectedly with those of the grecians at least so far as may serve to show by what steps this change was effected  they may also upon another account seem to require a place in the grecian story how far they may be considered as grecians for their first kings were of grecian extraction but they are not so much entitled to it from their descent as from their exploits by which the very name of greece was in a great measure lost and swallowed up in that of macedonia before their later achievements which brought about this great revolution they were no otherwise considered as a part of greece than many other borderers who were originally planted from thence but having afterward little or no intercourse with their mother country contracted the habits and manners of the natives where they settled and from thence were looked upon as one and the same people with them and in the same degree of barbarism this was the case of most of the grecian colonies and therefore though i have had frequent occasion to mention them i have not entered further into their story than as it has born relation to greece either on account of their wars or alliances with it or of their being protected by it or becoming tributary to it or of such other engagements and dependences as have blended their affairs with those of the gre cians and made the relation of them a necessary part of their history thus much may suffice to account for my not having treated the most remarkable of these colonies so fully and distinctly as might be expected from the figure they have made in the world such as sicily crete and some others of the islands with the lesser asia and several other parts of the continent but it ought to be considered that where their fame and grandeur has been owing more to their transactions with other people than with the grecians most of the particulars concerning them do not fall within the compass of my design but belong more properly to a separate history of their own or to that of the nation which they have had most to do with  the macedonians were so called before the grecians intermixed with them their original and they were some time known by other names which they received from the first planters or principal men either of the whole country or of some particular parts of it but the accounts we have of these original founders like those of the grecian states are very fabulous and imperfect the first who is mentioned with any degree of certainty to have reigned in macedonia was caranus by birth an argive and said to be the sixteenth in descent from hercules it was upon this foundation that philip grounded his pretensions to be of the race of hercules and assumed to himself divine honors wherein he carried his vanity a great way though not so far as his son did after him caranus therefore is commonly reputed to have led forth a body of his countrymen their first kings by the advice of the oracle into these parts where he settled and made himself king and yet herodotus contrary to the opinion of all the later writers makes perdiccas the first king sir isaac newton reconciles this difference by a very probable conjecture that they were jointfounders of this kingdom that they were both contemporary and of the royal family of argos from whence they fled about the same time and at first erected small principalities in macedonia which after the death of caranus became one under perdiccas and that this kingdom was founded about the   th or   th olympiad from this time the macedonians were properly a grecian colony and among other proofs of their being so it is observable that amyntas which was the name of some of their succeeding kings was also a common name among the argives another of their kings was by virtue of their grecian extraction admitted to the olympic games but whatever rights and privileges this nation claimed as grecians they were generally treated as barbarians till such time as they carried their arms into asia and had trampled upon the liberties of greece caranus having according to the general account reigned twentyeight years the succession was continued after him to the times we are now treating of but there is very little worth notice recorded of these kings they being chiefly employed in defending themselves against the incursions of their neighbors and as to their domestic affairs they were remarkable only for the frequent murders and usurpations which happened in the royal family  amynlas the second amyntas father of philip who was the sixteenth in descent from caranus and the father of that philip whom we are now to treat of had much ado to support himself in the throne he left it in a very tottering condition and entailed a war with the illyrians and olynthians upon his children by his wife eurydice he left three sons who all in their turn succeeded to their father alexander perdiccas and philip he had also a natural son called ptolemy alorites some say he had a second wife called gygaea and by her had three more sons archelaus argaeus or archideus and menelaus who were murdered by philip but this does not seem probable because eurydice appears to have survived amyntas and to have been very active in the succeeding reigns the succession of alexander and perdiccas was strongly opposed first by pausanias whose father and himself had before usurped the crown and then by their brother plolemy who is said to have murdered alexander and to have reigned three years upon his death till he was afterward slain himself by perdiccas pausanias was drove out by iphicrates who at this time happened to be sent by the athenians with a small fleet into those parts to make the necessary dispositions for the siege of amphipolis eurydice upon this occasion accosted him in a very moving manner she brought her two sons perdiccas and philip to him and putting one of em between his arms and the other upon his knee conjured him by the mutual friendship that had passed between the two nations and by the personal kindness and affection that her husband had born to him that he would take these two orphans into his protection and defend them against the invader but this account of her maternal affection is by no means consistent with that which justin gives of her that being in love with her soninlaw who is understood to be ptolemy she caused her own two sons alexander and perdiccas to be murdered in order to advance him to the throne and that she had before attempted to destroy her husband with the same view but the history of these two kings alexander and perdiccas is so confused that not only the transactions of one reign seem to be ascribed to another but the transactions themselves are also differently related as to ptolemy the most plausible account given of him is that upon his competition with perdiccas they referred themselves to pelopidas who adjudging the crown to the latter the other quitted his pretensions and pelopidas for the better observance of this agreement carried philip with him among others as hostage to thebes  there are other occasions mentioned of his being given as an hostage to the illyrians both by his father and his brother alexander however that be it is certain he was at thebes at the time of the death of his brother perdiccas who according to the most general accounts was killed in a battle with the illyrians  this accident brought him home the rise of philip and gave him an opportunity of exerting those talents by which he not only surpassed all his predecessors but eclipsed the fame of all the grecians of his time though it must be confessed that he received his first impressions of glory from em and that he owed a great deal to the improvements he made under epaminondas but besides these advantages he had great natural endowments and a genius equal to the greatest designs as may sussiciently appear from the difficulties he had to encounter at his first setting out when he was scarce three and twenty years old and the means he used to overcome them perdiccas had left a young son to succeed him so that philip had no immediate prospect of coming to the crown however upon the news of his brothers death he stole home privately from thebes and taking advantage of the consternation the people were under and the dangers they apprehended from an insantreign a m      olymp  0    he is decd king got himself at first declared protector to his nephew and soon after king in his stead and indeed the present condition of the macedonians required a man of his prudence and activity for they were surrounded with as many enemies as they had neighbors the illyrians flushed with their late victory were preparing to march against them with a strong army the paeonians were making daily incursions upon them and at the same time the title to the crown was contested by pausanias and argaeus the former whereof was supported by the thracians and the latter by the athenians who for that purpose had sent out a good fleet and three thousand land men  under these circumstaces with so many enemies on his hands at once and that before he was settled in the throne his first part was to make sure of his own people to gain their affections and to raise their spirits for they were very much disheartened having lost above four thousand men in the late action with the illyrians he succeeded in these points by the artfulness of his address and the force of his eloquence of which he was a great master his next step was to train and exercise them and reform their discipline and it was at this time that he instituted the famous macedonian phalanx he irstitutes the macedonian phalanx which did so much execution it was an improvement upon the ancient manner of fighting among the grecians who generally drew up their foot so close as to stand the shock of the enemy without being broken the complete phalanx was thought to contain above sixteen thousand men though it was also taken in general for any company or party of soldiers and frequently for the whole body of the foot but this of philips invention is described by polybius to be a long square consisting of eight thousand pikemen sixteen deep and five hundred in front the men standing so close together that the pikes of the fifth rank were extended three foot beyond the line of the front the rest whose distance from the front made their pikes useless rested them upon the shoulders of those who stood before them and so locking them together in file pressed forwards to support and push on the former ranks whereby the asfault was rendered more violent and irresistible  in this year died xenophon xenophon his death and character and in the ninetieth year of his age notwithstanding the glory he had acquired by his persian expedition he was banished athens for having been engaged in it for cyrus having been too great a favourer of the spartans the athenians did not think he ought to receive any countenance or assistance from them in the quarrel with his brother artaxerxes thereupon xenophon chose to return again into persia where he joined agesilaus and there they contracted a strict friendship which continued as long as they lived upon which of these two expeditions it was that the sentence of banishment was passed against him is not determined but he had by both of them incurred the displeasure of his fellowcitizens who looked upon him as not being well affected to the interest of his country he has not by his actions given any marks of his enmity against it but it is certain that he was a great admirer of the spartan manners and constitution and had a very indifferent opinion of the athenian democracy upon his second return into greece he resided at scillonte a town in the elean territory but at that time under the dominion of sparta but upon the invasion of laconia by epaminondas he quitted that neighborhood and retired to corinth where he spent the remainder of his days it is to the leisure he enjoyed in these places of retreat that we owe most of his historical and other writings by which he appears to have possessed more different talents and to have been more thoroughly accomplished than any man of his time not only as a captain philosopher orator and historian but being likewise well skilled in politics in horsemanship and hunting in tillage and planting he had also the advantage of a very beautiful person with a pleasing aspect which bespoke that candor and simplicity for which he was so remarkable both in his manners and his writings  his character as an historian having already been described in the account i have given of the authors from whom this history is collected i will here only add an observation that he was the first philosopher in greece who wrote an history and to this it may be ascribed that he has expressed nature better than most other historians of his time his conceptions were clear and that made his diction so this regular way of thinking and digesting his matter he learnt of socrates under whom he studied nothing is more to be admired in him than the affection he bore to his master and in this part plato agreed with him but there was otherwise no good understanding between them which is the more extraordinary because they were both equally of a mild and amiable disposition and had no enemies but such as their virtue had created them the cause assigned by diogenes laertius for their disagreement was a rivalship in their writings and in supprot of this opinion it is said that xenophon wrote his cyripaedia as the picture of a just monarchy in opposition to that which plato had drawn of a perfect commonwealth it is a question among the learned how far this piece of xenophon will bear being examined according to the strict rules of history and whether it ought not rather to be looked upon only as a more modest and instructive species of romance there is likewise great allowance to be made for his character of ageslaus which is too much in the style of panegyric but his close intimacy with that prince had made him partial to his failings he extols his personal bravery and his other private virtues and very justly but he does not consider him enough in his public capacity as one who upon the merit of his services had got more power into his hands than was usually allowed to the spartan kings and by his rashness and obstinacy had made an ill use of it almost to the destruction of his country  when philip had made some proper regulation of his affairs at home he began to look abroad in order to divert the storms which threatened him from all quarters by money and promises he made up matters for the present with such of his enemies as lay nearest to him and then turned his forces against the athenians philip defeats the athenians who were marched up to methone to assist argaeus he gave them battle and defeated them and the death of argaeus who was killed in the action put an end to that dispute for he permitted the athenians when they were in his power to return home this instance of his moderation gained so far upon them that they soon after concluded a peace with him which yet he observed no longer than it served his design of securing the other part of his dominions  accordingly he marched northward olymp  0    subdues the paeonians and the illyrians where he broke with the paeonians and subdued them then fell upon the illyrains and having killed above seven thousand of them in a pitched battle obliged them to restore all their conquests in macedonia he had also shut up the passage of the thracians but yet did not think it sufficiently secured without making himself master of amphipolis which was very commodiously situated on the river strymon and was the key of that side of his dominions seizes amphipolis he knew the importance of it and therefore possessed himself of it in the beginning of his reign this was the grounds of his quarrel with the athenians who claimed it as one of their colonies and made such a point of it that their setting up argaeus against him was not so much for his own sake or for the credit of imposing a king upon the macedonians as it was with a view to get the city restored to them by his means in case he should have succeeded in his pretensions philip was sensible of their drift and finding it necessary at that time to keep some measures with them would neither keep the place himself nor let them have it but took a middle course and declared it a free city thereby leaving the inhabitants to throw off their dependence on their old masters and making it appear to be their own act but the city continued no longer in this state than till he found himself at liberty to make a more thorough conquest of it which at this time he easily effected olymp  0    through the remissness of the athenians who refused to send any relief to it alleging in their excuse that it would be a breach of the peace which they had concluded with philip the year before but the truth is he tricked them out of it by a promise of delivering it up to them but instead of keeping his word with them he made further encroachments by seizing on pydna and potidea the latter of which being garrisoned by atbenians he drew them out and sent them home but dismissed them with such marks of civility as showed that he avoided coming to an open rupture with that state at least till his designs were more ripe for it though at the same time he did what he could to weaken them and drive them out of his neighborhood pydna and potidaea pydna with the territory belonging to it he gave up to the olynthians who were his fathers inverterate enemies his hands were too full at this time to revive the quarrel against so rich and powerful a city whcih for three years together had withstood the united forces of sparta and macedonia he therefore chose to buy their friendship for the present and to amuse them by the delivery of this town as he had done the athenians by the peace till he could attack them at more advantage in this step also he overreached the athenians who were at the same time courting the alliance of the olynthians in order to maintain their sooting in those parts which side soever the olynthians inclined to they were strong enough to turn the balance and therefore the gaining them became a matter of great contention between philip and the athenians  the next place he took and crenidae which be called philippi was crenidae which he enlarged and called after his own name philippi and which afterward was famous for the defeat of brutus and cassius there were near this town some gold mines which he worked and drew out of them an immense treasure the yearly produce of them amounted to a thousand talents which was reckoned at that time considerably more than the revenue of athens and yet that was thought the richest state in greece this was a very lucky discovery for one who knew the value and use of money so well as he did he was by this means enabled to keep up a good body of mercenary troops at home with a great number of spies and pensioners abroad and it was to this fund that he owed a great part of the successes of his reign  philip in this progress of his affairs met with little opposition from the athenians who had enough to do to support their jurisdiction in other parts factions in eubaea composed by the athenians euboea being at this time divided into factions one party had recourse to them and the other to the thebans who by this means got footing in the island but the athenians thought it of too great importance to them to be given up for besides other advantages they had formerly drawn a large revenue from it however they did not exert themselves so vigorously as the case required till they were spirited up by timotheus what said he the thebans in eubaea and you still here they are in action and you are deliberating you have not spread the seas with your shipping you are not running down to the piraeus you are not under sail this manner of haranguing had the effect he proposed in five days time they made the necessary preparations and put to sea forced the thebans off the island composed the differences of the inhabitants and brought them again under their dependence demosthenes takes particular notice of this speech of timotheus and quotes this part of it as an incentive to the athenians upon a like occasion when philip was overrunning their dominions in thrace  the athenians had no sooner put an end to these disturbances but byzantium with the islands of chios cos and rhodes the social war revolted and confederated against them and from thence gave rise to that which was called the war of the allies or the social war they forthwith sent out chares and chabrias with men and shipping to reduce them their first attempt was upon chios where chabrias who commanded at sea forced his entrance into the harbor attempt upon chios but being deserted by the rest of the fleet which put back to sea he was immediately surrounded by the enemy who beat upon him on all sides till his ship was quite disabled and pierced through with the enemies beaks whereupon the men on board leaped into the sea to save themselves by swimming but he not thinking it consistent with his honor and the duty of his post to quit his ship stood obstinately in the defense of it till he was mortally wounded chabrias killed nepos says contrary to the general account of this expedition that he served in it only as a private man which if it were so would be the best excuse that could be made for his conduct in it for considering him as a commander his character it was certainly too unconcerted and too rash and desperate an enterprise to be justified but it was agreeable to a maxim of his own that an army of stags led by a lion was more formidable than an army of lions led by a stag he had another maxim which showed more prudence and circumspection that he was the best commander who knew best what his enemies were doing however the spirit he showed upon this occasion with the many other instances of his bravery and zeal for the service of his country may be sufficient to rank him with the patriots of the best ages of greece  chares with the landforces had made some slight attacks upon the island but upon the death of his colleague he drew them off and put an end to the campaign olymp  0    but the next year great preparations were made on both sides for prosecuting the war with vigor and the allies having got together a fleet of an hundred sail harassed and plundered several of the islands under the dominion of athens and then besieged samos samos besieged by the allies the athenians sent out chares again with sixty galleys and then reinforced them with sixty more under the command of iphicrates and timotheus who were joined in commission with him they united their forces and agreed to besiege byzantium which drew the allies from samos to relieve it hereupon the two fleets met in the hellespont but just as they were ready to engage there happened a violent storm notwithstanding which chares proposed to proceed and join battle but could not prevail with his colleagues to come into it chares accuses his colleagues of treachery  whereupon he wrote to athens to accuse them of treachery and they were recalled and ordered to answer it to the state  chares was now at liberty to act without control but instead of pursuing his designs against the islanders and goes into foreign service he went over to artabazus the persian governor of some of the provinces of asia minor who had revolted from his master and was reduced almost to the last extremity by an army of seventy thousand men which was sent out against him chares upon a promise of being well rewarded engaged to assist him and having accordingly joined their forces they deseated the persians but the king was so incensed at it that he threatened to fit out a fleet of three hundred sail to support the islanders in their war with the athenians which so intimidated them that they clapped up a peace with the allies upon their own terms olymp  0    a peace with the allies which were that for the future they should remain free and independent this put an end to the social war which had continued three years though with very little action on either side at least not suitable to the preparations that were made for it  the news of this expedition of chares was at first very well received by the government of athens in regard the troops which were employed in it were paid by artabazus and that indeed was the only pretense that could be made for undertaking it but when they found in what manner the persian king resented it they made it a charge of treason against chares for having exceeded his commission chares accused but acquitted and deserted the service of his country however he found means to secure a party among the people who brought him off  iphicrates and timotheus were more hardly dealt with iphicrates and timotheus tried and for that which had much les the appearance of a crime in refusing to join with him in rushing headlong upon the enemy in a storm and combating the elements but this matter was so aggravated by chares that they underwent a formal trial for it and besides the revoking their commissions had an heavy fine imposed on them this is the account diodorus siculus gives of it but the fact is by others related differently and with more remarkable circumstances timotheus fined that timotheus was fined an hundred talents which being unable to pay he withdrew himself to chalcis where he died the people soon after repenting of their usage of him as it was generally the case with them when it was too late remitted nine parts of the fine but exacted the other ten talents of his son conon toward the repair of their walls it was an odd circumstance and a reproach to athens that those walls which had been rebuilt by conon the grandfather out of the spoils le had taken from the enemy should now be repaired by a fine unjustly raised upon conon the grandson  iphicrates apprehending the same fate with timotheus had introduced a number of young men into the court armed with daggers which they every now and then in the course of the trial took care to expose to the view of his judges in order to intimidate them this menace had the effect he proposed and accordingly he was acquitted ihicrates acqutted being afterward reproached with so violent a proceeding he said it would have been a madness in him if after having succeeded in war for his fellowcitizens he should not have endeavored to do the same for himself and certainly whatever insult it was upon the public justice it was owing to the people themselves who by their capricious jealous and ungratesul behavior toward their generals had forced them to these extremities for whatever their conduct were they never knew when they were safe they were no longer regarded than they were wanted and when their service was over it was approved or censured according as the faction for or against them prevailed in short they lay at the mercy of every little designing demagogue who had art enough to inflame the multitude under these discouragements it is not to be wondered at that many of them engaged themselves in foreign service or went into a voluntary exile insomuch that there were scarce any left to command at home this is to be looked upon as one principal cause of the decay of the power of athens which began now too visibly to appear nepos seems to fix it to this period of time and observes that chabrias iphicrates and timotheus were the last of the athenian captains however it must be confessed there were several considerable men after them who occasionally signalized themselves in the defense or other necessary service of their country but it is certain there was not any number or regular succession of such as were able to keep up the ancient spirit and discipline of the troops or the grandeur of the commonwealth  as to iphicrates whether after his trial he declined the service or was laid aside by the state we hear no more of his being employed either at home or abroad and yet he is said to have lived to a good old age however diodorus says he was dead when the great battle of cehronea was fought in the hundred and tenth olympiad but without mentioning the time and circumstances of his death and therefore we may reasonably suppose that he spent the remainder of his days in some bscure retirement character of iphicrates but whatever became of him he was at this time a great loss to the public he had served on many occasions and generally with success which was chiefly wing to his skill and prudence and his service had been very useful and seasonable he was not so much noted for the fame of his exploits as for his art and improvements in the military discipline wherein he was very exact and withal severe he was always upon his guard and left as little room for acidents as possible to this purpose when one asked him why he fortified his camp which he had pitched in a country belonging to his confederates he replied the worst speech a general can make is i did not think his men were so perfect in their exercise and so obedient to command that when the word was given to engage they knew their business and did it of themselves as if every private man had been directed by the ablest ossicer this was particularly experienced in the war at corinth where he put a stop to the progress of agesilaus who would otherwise have overrun the states which were then in alli ance with athens the men who served under him were known by the name of the iphicratensian troops and were in the same degree of esteem in greece as the fabian sol diers were in rome he compared the several parts of an army to those of an human body making the lightarmed infantry answer to the hands the cavalry to the feet the main body to the breast and the general t the head he changed the fashion of the arms and accoutrements then in use contriving them chiefly for ease and expedition and after such a manner as should most effectually answer the ends either of annoying or guarding against the enemy but notwith standing these proofs of his diligence and application he is said to have been naturally in dolent and impatient which does not seen very consistent with the character of a man who had worked his way into the world and raised himself from nothing for he was of very mean extraction some say a shoemakers son and yet he carried it off with good air when being reproached with it b one of his adversaries who was descended from harmodius it is true said he the luster of  family begins in me and that of yours ends  you the first thing that brought him in repute was that in an action wherein he was wounded he caught up one of his encmies and carried him alive and in his armor to his own ship besides the advancement he made by his personal merit he had the good fortune to obtain in marriage a daughter of cotys king of thrace by whom he had a son called menestheus who yet seemed to value himself more upon being the son of an alhenian captain than of a thracian princess for being asked to which of his parents e thought e owed the greatest obligation he answered to my mother for that my father did what he could to make me a thracian but my mothers part was to make me an athenian iphicrates in addition to his warlike talents had the reputation of a good speaker but plutarch blames him for going out of his province and says he made himself ridiculous by getting company to his house to declaim to them he likewise mentions an instance of his being quite overpowered by the eloquence of his antagonist but iphicrates would not give it up my adversaries said he have the better actor but mine is the better play  timotheus character of timotheus in a war against this cotys obtained great booty to the value of twelve hundred talents which he delivered into the public treasury without reserving any part of it to himself this was afterward remembered to the shame of his accusers when he was fined an hundred talents and forced to fly his country because he was not able to pay it he was the more sensibly affected with this misfortune because he had hardly known before what it was to suffer any he had generally succeeded in every thing he took in hand insomuch that some who envied him on that score painted him asleep with fortune by his side and casting nets over cities he did not understand raillery upon this head but insisted seriously that fortune had no share with him in his victories but that they were owing entirely to his merit hereupon says plutarch the goddess grew angry and forsook him and adds that from thenceforward nothing prosperd with him however in the main he was so successful that it is said the athenians owed to him the recovery of their dominion at sea he certainly contributed greatly toward it but his father conon had laid the foundation of it by the engagement at cnidus after which there were other circumstances concurred to the breaking the power of the spartans and it has been shown in what manner the athenians took advantage of the necessity of their affairs even when they were in alliance with them against their common enemics besides the military virtues of timotheus wherein he was equal to his father he was better skilled in the civil part of the administration he had by his parts and industry attained to a good degree of knowledge of all kinds and excelled particularly in the art of speaking  in this first year of the  0 th olympiad alexander the great was born on the same day that philip received the news of it he had an account of a great victory obtained by parmenio his general against the illyrians and likewise of his having gained the prize in the olympic games upon the birth of his son he wrote a letter to aristotle the philosopher to acquint him with it and to recommend to him the care of his education which he did with the highest compliment that could be made i return thanks to the gods said he not so much for having given me a son as for having given him me in the age in which aristotle lives  chap ii from the end of the social war to the end of the phocian war containing the space of  0 years the social war was no sooner ended but another broke out of a longer continuance and of much greater consequence this was called the phocian or sacred war as being raised and carried on upon a motive  religion and under that pretense greece be came by degrees universally involved in it the first occasion of it arose from the phocians olymp  0    the grounds of the phocian war who having ploughd up a piece of ground belonging to the temple of apollo at delphi their neighbors exclaimed against it as sacrilege and it was adjudgd so by the amphictyons who were assembled as the states general of greece for that purpose and an heavy fine was imposed on them which being unable to pay they refused to submit to the sentence alleging that the care and patronage of the temple belonged anciently to them and they quoted an authority for it from homer  this spirit of opposition was raised by philomelus a principal man among them philomelus the phocian general who encouraged them to take up arms and acted as their general he first applied himself to the spartans who had likewise been fined by the amphictyons at the instance of the thebans after the battle of leuctra for having seized the cadmea for this reason they were very well disposed to join with him but did not yet think it proper to declare themselves however they encouraged his design and supplied him underhand with money by which means he raised troops and without much difficulty got possession of the temple the chief resistance he met with in the neighborhood was from the locrians but having worsted them he erased the decree of the amphictyons which was inscribed on the pillars of the temple however to strengthen his authority and give a color to his proceedings he thought it convenient to consult the oracle and to procure an answer in his favor but when he applied to the priestess for that purpose she refused to officiate till being intimidated by his threats she told him the god left him at liberty to act as be pleased which he looked upon as a good answer and as such he took care to divulge it  this occasioned another assembly of the amphictyons the result whereof was a formal decharation of war against the phocians greece divided in this war and the quarrel being now become more general the several states took part in it according to their different interests and inclinations athens and sparta with some others of the peloponnesians declared for the phicians and the thebans thessalians locrians and other neighboring states against them philomelus at his first setting out had made great professions with regard to the riches of the temple which were immense that he would not touch any part thereof and that he had no design in making himself master of the temple but to restore the ancient rights and privileges of his country but having now formed his alliances and being pressed for mony to support them he grew less scrupulous he broke into the treasure and made it a fund for carrying on the war with this supply he increased the pay of his men and by that encouragement got together a considerable army he marched with above ten thousand horse and foot against the locrians the transactions of the two first years of it and beat them not withstanding that they were supported by the thebans he did the same by the thessalians who were likewise joined by their neighbors but the thebans at length coming up with thirteen thousand men put a stop to his progress as they had been the most active in procuring the decree both against the spartans and phocians so they were now the most zealous and inveterate against them and pursued them wit all the rage and rancour of a religious war insomuch that having surprised a great party o the phocian mercenaries that was foraging the condemned and executed them as sacrilegiou and accursed but the phocians made reprisal upon them and treating them in the same mar ner brought them to act more according to the law of arms however the however the thebans asterwar had the advantage of them in a woody part  the country and overpowering them with nurbers lomelus  made a great slaughter among them phlomelus in the pursuit was forced up a precipic and drove to a point of it where to avo falling into the enemies hands he threw him self headlong down the rock though justin say he was killed in the battle but however the were he made so vigorous a defense in tl action and had throughout conducted his affairs so well that if his cause had been better he might have been compared with the greatest men of his time but according to the part he acted he was no otherwise looked upon than as a bold and wicked adventurer who stood in defiance of gods and men and had involved his country in a war to support him in his impieties  these were the transactions of the two first years of the war during which time philip was enlarging and securing his frontier by taking in such places as were either convenient for him or troublesome to him philip takes methone and other places of this latter kind was methone which serving as a refuge to his enemies he took it by storm and having demolished it annexed the lands to macedonia during the siege one of his eyes was struck out with an arrow and the circumstance of it affected him more than the wound itself for one aster of amphipolis having offered him his service as an extraordinary marksman who could take a bird down flying well said philip when i wage war with sterlings i will employ you the man was so nettled with this answer that he threw himself into the town and shot an arrow at him with this inscription on it at philip s right eye philip returned it to him with another inscription that he would hang up after if he took the town and he was as good as his word however he was so ashamed of this accident that he did not afterward care to talk of an eye and could no bear the mention of the word cyclops  the thebans concluding olymp  0    onomarchus succeeds philomelus that the death  philomelus had deterred the phocians from prose cuting the war withdrew their forces but h was succeeded by onomarchus who was personally interested in carrying it on for the amphictyon had laid several fines upon him which he wa not able to discharge he therefore gathered up the remains of the army and recruited it for this purpose he coined money with which he also confirmed his confederates and bought off some of his enemies the thessalians who were the most formidable of them he engaged to stand neuter but philip soon after fixed them in his interest by freeing them from their tyrants their case was that lycophron of pherae who succeeded his brother alexander after he had assisted in his murder set out at first as their deliverer and governed with moderation busoon after treading in his predecessors steps the begged philips assistance against him lycephron at the same time had recourse to the phocians and thus by their quarrel among the selves they were drawn again into the gener one onomarchus therefore as well in behalf  the tyrant as to support the cause of the phcians began the hostilities he took sever places and invading boeotia the thebans wet again called out to stop his further progress which they did with some difficulty having ju before sent five thousand men under the command of pammenes to the assistance of artabazus in asia where they had good success and did honor to their country  onomarchus in the mean time gained great advantages against philip in two several actions his successes against philip and struck such a terror into his men that he had much ado to bring them again into the field however being reinforced it came to a general battle with twenty thousand men on each side but at length is defeated taken and executed six thousand on the side of the phocians were killed on the spot and three thousand taken prisoners among the former was onomarchus whose body philip caused to be hanged up and the prisoners he ordered to be thrown into the sea as guilty of the sacrilege this raised an opinion of his zeal for religion which he knew how to make a right use of and it passed likewise for a mark of his justice and generosity with respect to the thessalians who were by this means restored to their liberty for lycophron went off upon the general rout and he and his brother pitholaus quitted pherae though afterward they appeared again in arms and endeavored by means of the phocians to be reinstated the thessalians very well deserved this piece of service for the success of the battle was owing chiefly to their horse which philip was so sensible of that he took care to maintain a constant friendship and alliance with them and they had a great part in the successive victories of his reign  onmarchus was succeed in the command by his brother phayllus olymp  0    succeeded by his brother phayllus who took the same methods that his predecessors had done to support himself he had a great command of money which being distributed very liberally he increased the number of his confederates and easily got a fresh supply of mercenaries with which he marched into boeotia but was worsted there in three several engagements from thence he removed into locris where he had more equal success and after he had taken some towns he was seized with a lingering illness of which he died  the course of the war had like to have been interrupted by a quarrel between the spartans and the inhabitants of megalopolis the spartans create fresh disturbances the latter being unable to defend themselves called in the argives sicyonians and messenians to their assistance and the thebans afterward joining them they became an overmatch for the spartans who thereupon borrowed three thousand foot of the phocians and lycophron with his brother pitholaus came in to them with a small party of horse but notwithstanding these preparations after the taking a town or two which occasioned some sharp engagements wherein the spartans at length had the better a truce was agreed upon and the armies separated  upon the death of phayllus phalecus succeeds phayllus the command was given to phalecus the son of onomarchus who being very young mnaseas was assigned to him as his director and was killed in the first action that happened however the war was continued by skirmishes and mutual incursions and depredations the thebans had in this piqueering way got a good deal of plunder but as the burden of the war lay chiefly upon them they were so drained olymp  0    that they were reduced to the last extremity and sending to the king of persia for a supply he readily furnished there with three hundred talents  philip had not as yet been directly engaged in this war for what he had done against onomarchus was only by accident and in consequence of his protecting the thessalians against their tyrants however his success in that action and the general esteem he had gained by his other exploits had now enlarged his views and put him upon endeavoring to gain a footing in greece philip prevented in his design upon thermopylae in order to it under a pretense of marching against the phocians he attempted to possess himself of the famous pass in the streights of thermopyle which he called the key of greece but the athenians who were more immediately exposed by this passage took the alarm and prevented him so that he was forced to wait a more fit opportunity in the mean time he pursued his conquests at home enlarging his frontier toward thrace taking towns upon the hellespont and making such further encroachments on all sides as might facilitate his great and principal design of invading greece  the stopping his progress at thermopylae the rise and character of demosthenes was owing chiefly to demosthenes who had began to distinguish himself soon after the conclusion of the social war when the athenians were alarmed at the great preparations which were making in persia he afterward appeared in behalf of the megalopolitans and rhodians that they might be protected and supported against sparta or thebes or any other state which might by such an accession give umbrage to athens and destroy the balance of power but he began now to exert himself in a more extraordinary manner and he had from this time forwards so great a share in the affairs of the public that a particular account of him besides the doing justice to the character of so wonderful a man may serve in a great measure to explain and illustrate the history of the times he lived in the chief regard that has been paid to his memory has generally been on account of his eloquence but he was likewise a very able statesman and a good patriot and considering the embassies and expeditions the treaties and alliances and other various negotiations wherein he was employed together with the zeal and integrity with which he acted in them it may be questioned whether he did not excel as much in those capacities a in that of an orator though it must be confessed that his art of speaking was the foundation of his other merit or at least the means of producing it to advantage and improving it but notwithstanding that he arrived to such a perfection in this art he set out under great disadvantages for he had an impediment in his speech with a weak voice and a short breath and a very uncouth and ungracious manner however by dint of resolution and infinite pains he overcame all these defects he would climb up steep and craggy places to help his wind and strengthen his voice he would declaim with pebbles in his mouth to remedy the imperfection in his speech he would place  lookingglass before him to correct the aukwardness of his gesture and he learned of the best players the proper graces of action and pronunciation which he thought of so much consequence that he made the whole art of ratory in a manner to consist of them but whatever stress he laid upon the exterior part of peaking he was also very careful about the atter and the style the latter of which he ormd upon the model of thucydides whose history for that purpose he transcribed eight seeral times he was so intent upon his study at he would often retire ino a cave of the arth and shave half his head so that he could ot with decency appear abroad till his hair s grown again he also accustomed himself to harangue at the sea shore where the agita tion of the waves formed to him an idea of the commotions in a popular assembly and served to prepare and fortify him against them  from these several kinds of hardship which he imposed upon himself it is plain that he was not born an orator but was rather an instance how far parts and application may go toward the forming a great man in any profession to add to which he had a great deal of ambition to spur him on and that which heightened it or rather gave the first rise to it was a famous cause in a matter of dispute concerning or pus whether that city belonged to the attick of the theban frontier callistratus who pleaded in behalf of the athenians succeeded well and received extraordinary applause which so af fected demosthenes that from that instant tho he was then but sixteen years old he fixed hi resolution and turned his thoughts wholly the way and indeed the study of oratory was a that time the readiest and almost the only means of rising in the state his first essay at the bar was two years after this incident when he called his guardians to account for im bezzling his patrimony and recovered some par of it this encouraged him some time after a harangue before the people in their public assem bly but he acquitted himself so ill that they hissed him however he ventured a second time but with no better success than before so the he went away ashamed and confounded and quite in despair it was upon this occasion that satyrus the player accosted him and in a friendly way encouraged him to proceed with this view he asked him to repeat to him some verses of sophocles or euripides which he accordingly did the other repeated them after him but with such a different spirit and cadence as made him sensible that he knew very little of elocution but by his instructions and his own perseverance he at length made himself master of it and by the methods beforementioned he corrected the imperfections which were born with him as well as the ill habits which he had contracted it is not very clear wheter this passage be rightly ascribed to satyus who seems to be confounded with neoptolemus and andronicus who were likewise famous comedians and demosthenes is said to have been instructed by all three of them  with these advantages and improvements he appeared again in public and succeeded so well that people flocked from all parts of greece to hear him from hence he was looked upon as the standard of true eloquence insomuch that none of his countrymen have been put in comparison with him nor even among the romans any but cicero and though it has been made a question by the ancient writers to which of the two they should give the preference they have not ventured to decide it but have contented themselves with describing their different beauties and showing that they were both perfect in their kind but to confine myself to demosthenes hi kind of eloquence was grave and austere lik his temper but withal masculine and sublime bold forcible and impetuous abounding with metaphors apostrophes and interrogations which with his solemn way of invoking and appealing to the gods the planets the elements and the manes of those who sell at salamis and marathon had such a wonderful effect upon his hearers that they thought him inspired if he had not so much softness and insinuation as is often requisite in an orator it was not that he wanted art and delicacy when the cafe required it he knew how to found the inclinations of the people and to lead them to the point he aimed at and sometimes by seeming to propose that which was directly contrary to it but his chief characteristick was vehemence both in the action and expression and indeed that was the qualification of all others most wanted at this time for the people were grown so insolent and imperious so factious and divided so jealous of the power of the democracy and withal e n k into a state of pleasure and indolence that no arts of persuasion would have been so effectual as that spirit and resolution that force and energy of demosthenes to humble them to unite them and to rouse them into a sense of their common danger  but neither could demosthenes himself have made such impressions on them if his talent of speaking had not been supported by their opinion of his integrity it was that which added weight and emphasis to every thing he said and animated the whole it was that which chiefly engaged their attention and determined their counsels when they were convinced that he spoke from his heart and had no interest to manage but that of the community and this he gave the strongest proofs of in his zeal against philip who said he was of more weight against him than all the fleets and armies of the athenians and that he had no enemy but demosthenes he was not wanting in his endeavors to corrupt him as he had most of the leading men in greece but he withstood all his offers and plutarch says all the gold of macedonia could not bribe him and yet as inflexible as he was to philip he became more pliable in the reign of his successor and gave occasion to his enemies to accuse him of bribery for which he was fined and imprisoned and afterward banished this charge against him has by some been thought a malicious and groundless calumny and the rather because he was not allowed to justify himself but the fact is so generally related by others and with so many circumstances that it is not easily to be resuted the case in short was that harpalus an officer of allexanders having imbezzled a great part of the treasure that he had been entrusted with made up a purse and retired with it to athens for protection it was debated by the people whether they should admit him for fear of incurring his masters displeasure and involving themselves in a war and demosthenes considering it in that light opposed it harpalus to remove all difficulties dispersed his money pretty liberally among the orators and as he was displaying his wealth demosthenes happened to fix his eyes on a rich gold cup of the kings and admiring the sculpture and fashion asked the price of it harpalus took the hint and at night sent it home to him together with twenty talents in money the next day he appeared in the assembly muffled up about his throat and when he was expected to speak to the point in question he made signs that he had lost his voice but his transaction with harpalus had taken wind and when he found himself detected he rose up to excuse it but the people were so enraged that they would not hear him whereupon a certain wag stood up and said what will ye not hear the kings cupbearer others said surely the orator had not been seized that night with a silver squinzy and they had coined a  word on purpose to express it demosthenes could not stand this contempt and raillery of his fellowcitizens who had hitherto esteemed and respected him even to a sort of reverence and it affected him the more because he had piqud himself so much more than others upon the rigidness of his virtue which indeed was the chief foundation of that extraordinary respect which had been paid him but the itch of money had infected him and this was not the only instance of his receiving presents in a clandestine and unwarrantable manner as a further argument that he did not despise money he was reproached with dealing in bottomry which in those days was looked upon as a scandalous way of traffic and therefore zeno who likewise practiced it some time after him gave it up as a thing that would hurt the credit of his philosophy but however demosthenes was in some degree tainted with the general corruption of the times he does not seem to have loved money so much for its own sake as to serve the ends of his ambition wherein he copied after pericles whom he likewise chose to imitate in his manner of speaking he had not the command as the other had of the public money and therefore was not in a capacity of doing so many great and popular acts but he repaired the city walls sitted out ships ransomed slaves married poor maidens entertained the people with shows and sports and did such other things of that kind as were within the compass of his private fortune and this seems the most plausible way of accounting for the methods he took to get money and to improve it  but whatever might be alleged in his excuse as to money matters he had another failing which by his own confession he was guilty of and that was want of courage as will be more particularly related in its proper place in the mean time i would only observe the strange inconsistency in the composition of this great man who with such constancy and intrepidity opposed all the measures of the foreign and domestic enemies of his country and who so often at the hazard of his life braved the madness of the people in their assemblies and yet could not stand an enemy in the field he chose says plutarch to swear by those who fell at maratnon though he could not follow their example and what is still more extraordinary he afterward refused life when it was offered him and nobody died with greater fortitude these frailties which i have mentioned could not but take off a great deal from the luster of his chaacter insomuch that phocion who succeeded him though in several respects he was not equal to him besides that he was suspected to favor the macedonian interest yet being more remarkable for his personal justice and valor he was therefore looked upon as the greater man however demosthenes such as he was did more service to the state than any of his contemporaries he was the chief bulwark not only of athens but of greece in general and almost the only obstacle to philips designs of enslaving it which leads us now into an enquiry how those designs were laid and how far they succeeded  the two next years of the phocian war passed without any memorable action though it was still continued by skirmishes and mutual depredations philip had now no part in it but when he found himself shut out of greece by the athenians he turned his arms against those remote places which depended on them either as colonies or as conquests and particularly against the olynthians whom he had long looked upon with an evil eye but had courted and cajoled them whilst he was otherwise employed but he came now resolved entirely to reduce em olymp  0    philips design upon olynthus and advancing toward the city only sent them a short message to let them know that one of these two points was become necessary either that they must quit olynthus or he macedonia whereupon they sent immediately to athens for relief the matter was debated there with great solemnity and demosthenes was very earnest in supporting their demand demosthenes presses the athenians to relieve it in the doing whereof he took occasion to lay open the designs and practices of philip inveighing against him with great bitterness and urging every thing that might serve to incense the people against him he described him as a proud tyrannical usurper desertbes philip and a common disturber of mankind without faith or confidence without any principle of honor or justice or any regard to laws human or divine then as to the danger they might apprehend from him he represented him likewise as politic vigilant indefatigable intrepid and fortunate who fought as successfully with his money as his sword and knew how to corrupt where he could not conquer but lest from this account of him he should appear so formidable to the people that they might be discouraged from endeavoring to stop his progress he showed him in another light as vain presumptuous rash and imprudent forming schemes without any foundation and measuring the vastness of his designs only by the standard of his ambition from these different views of him which were varied according to the different impressions that were to be made upon the people we may collect almost the whole of his character but the orator in framing this picture of him must be said to have drawn the lines a little too strong and to have heightened the colors too much by the warmth of his zeal and the force of his elocution and yet these exaggerations were necessary at this time in order to inflame the people for philip had his partisans among the orators who combated and opposed every thing that was urged against him  one of the ablest and most zealous of them character of demades was demades who was very ready and acute and remarkable for speaking extempore as any occasion offered herein he had manifestly the advantage of demosthenes whose works were said to smell of the lamp and hence it was that theophrastus being asked his opinion of the two orators answered that demosthenes was worthy of the city of athens but that demades was above it however demosthenes had upon some very important occasions succeeded well in the unpremeditated way of haranguing but it being not his usual method nor his natural talent he discouraged the practice of it and therein he made use of an artful argument that to speak before the people in an abrupt manner and without due preparation was not treating them with respect that it had somewhat of an oligarchical principle in it and was rather bearing them down by force than winning them by persuasion as to demades whatever his wit and parts were he was very mercenary and corrupt and when he was charged with it he said he had often spoke against himself but never against his country but there is an instance recorded of him wherein he seemed rather to value himself upon it than to excuse it for meeting one day with a player who had received a talent as a reward for a part that he had excelled in it is not so extraodinary said demades to have one talent given you for speaking i had ten given me for holding my tongue his prostituting himself in this manner was chiefly to support his luxury for he was naturally profuse and gluttonous and hence it was that when he was grown old antipater compared him to a sacrificed beast of which all the parts were consumed but the tongue and the paunch he was sometimes upon good terms with demosthenes according as it served his present purpose but the rivaiship in their profession with the different cast of their tempers and their politics made it impracticable for them to live in any real friendship on the contrary they were generally at variance and at length it came to an open enmity which in the sequel will appear to have cost demosthenes his le  another of the same stamp with demades and of hyperides was hyperides both as to his parts and principles and his riotous manner of living he had a more premeditated way of speaking but with the same kind of wit and acrimony though he was not so quick he is generally ranked with demosthenes and is mentioned as one of the ten principal orators of that age though plutarch does not reckon him in that number he took a great deal of pains to ingratiate himself with the people and had no ties of faith or friendship but as they served that end however he was not much in the administration of affairs till the reign of alexander and then he acted such a double part between the patriot and the traitor that he was at last ensnared by his own politics and sell a sacrifice to the resentment of anpater such were most of the leading men in the assemblies and such was generally their end to carry on their own private views they inflamed the people and deluded them with false colors till they had drawn them either into an unnecessary war or a bad peace but sooner or later they suffered for it and were either made particular marks of vengeance or involved in the common ruin of their country this was more remarkably the case at athens which had been always looked upon as the chief seat of eloquence and never abounded with so many eminent speakers as at this time but that which was the glory of this commonwealth must at the same time be considered as one principal cause that hastened its downfall and drew along with it that of the other grecian states  but to return to demosthenes his steady and uniform conduct supported him for many years against demades and the rest of his antagonists and he got the better of them in the present case of the olynthians though he was not able to obtain such seasonable and effectual relief for them as the necessity of their affairs required notwithstanding that he pressed it with all the skill and arguments that he was master of demosthenes still presses the rlef of olynthus he told the people how much they were obliged in justice and honor to support their allies and how much their own safety depended on it for that if olynthus should be taken the next attempt would be upon athens he reproached them with their in sensibility and sloth to which he chiefly ascrib all philips greatness and cautioned them against the treachery and enchantment of their ora tors he advised them to reform abuses to restore the ancient order and discipline to serve in the wars in person as they had for merly done to lay aside their private ani mosities to unite against philip as their com mon enemy and to furnish the necessary supplies  but this latter was the great point in question and that which had occasioned most of their late dissensions the fund for the wa as has before been observed having been ap plied to the use of the stage the money arising from this fund was computed at a thou sand talents a year and a certain proportior of it was allotted to the citizens to defra the charge of their admittance into the the atre this distribution having been continue to them from the time of pericles they claim it now as their right especially since they ha lately obtained a law which made it capital t propose the restoring the fund to the uses so which it was originally granted hence it was that upon any pressing emergency extraordinary taxes were to be raised and they were laid so unequally and collected with so much difficulty that they seldom answered the se vice for which they were intended the wealthier sort complained that the burden lay wholly upon them and that the public money was squandered away in shows and festivals for the entertainment of the lower rank of the citizens who fat at their ease and contributed nothing to the support of the public either in their purse or their persons they retorted upon the rich that they enjoyed all the honors and great offices of the state exclusive of the common people and as they had the law on their side with numbers to support it they gave little attention to any remonstrances that were made upon this head demosthenes who had nothing in view but the general good thought it necessary to sound the people upon this subject and entered as far into it as he could with safety he proposed that commissioners should be appointed to inspect the laws in general not in order to make new ones for that there were already too many but that such of them as should be sound prejudicial to the public might be abolished at the same time he urged the present necessity of raising forces and mentioned the theatrical money as the only proper fund for it in conclusion he told them plainly that the law relating to it ought to be repealed however he took care to deliver it only as his opinion without proposing it in form so as to subject himself to the penalty  this was the substance of the three famous orations of demosthenes upon occasion of three several applications that the olynthians made to athens for succors the first of them produced no effect in their behalf upon the second chares was dispatched to them with thirty galleys and two thousand men but these being hirelings and strangers did them very little service which occasioned theird application wherein they desired true athenian troops whom they could better depend on and accordingly chares was sent out again with seventeen galleys and a body of two thousand foot and three hundred horse composed entirely of the citizens of athens  but the olynthians continued blocked up and whatever benefit they might have received from this last sapply they were prevented by philip who by the correspondence he held in the town had corrupted euthycrates and lasthenes the two chief magistrates olynthus beayd to philip who betrayed it into his hands he entered and plundered it and sold the inhabitants among the rest of the booty he also found in it his two bastard brothers whom he put to death as he formerly had the other of them being jealous of their supplanting him in the throne this circumstance of his brothers is related only by justin who also makes the harboring them in the town the pretense for philips investing it he found in it abundance of treasure which he reserved as a fund for the gaining other places in the same manner in the mean time he showed extraordinary marks of joy for the taking olynthus as a place of the greatest importance he celebrated public games gave shows and festivals and made presents to those who assisted at them  one of the remarkable occurrences of this first year of the  0 th olympiad death and character of plato was the death of plato which happened suddenly in the midst of an entertainment that he had made for his friends upon his birthday which completed the eighty first year of his age by his fathers side he was of royal extraction and by his mother he was descended from solon but he is not so much taken notice of for his high birth as for the figure he made in the world by his philosophy he was a scholar of socrates but was more lively and ferle in his imagination more sublime and flod in his diction and more copious and extensive in his matter instead of consining himself after his example to the study of moality only he took in the whole compass of hilosophy and had distinct masters for each rticular branch of it to add to the imrovements he made under them he traveled unto italy sicily egypt and persia in in egypt he  supposed to have been made acquainted with the ooks of moses by means of the jews who were try numerous there after the captivity hence it was that clemens alexandrinus called him the attick moses and he appears in several part of his works to have had some distinct no tions of a supreme being and of the immor tality of the soul some have pretended bu upon a very shallow foundation to discove in him an idea of the trinity and other my steries of christianity but whatever senti ments he had above the common received notions of the religion of his country the example of socrates had deterred him from de claring himself too planly and therefore h chose in the way of dialogue to couch hi opinions under the names of others but some say it was his extreme modesty and diff dence of himself and the great veneration he paid to his master that made him imitate him in this manner of writing and that for these reasons it was that socrates is made to speak wha plato thought his method of explaining things by numbers he learnt in the pythagrorean school in italy and his manner of expressing him self by allegories and symbols he took from the egyptians but those parts of his wri tings appeear too mysterious and refined as doe likewise his doctrine of ideas which notwith standing the many long dissertations of the learned upon it seems to have been very little understood upon his return from his tra vels he was courted to take a part in the go vernment but he chose to lead a quiet and contemplative life and he pursued his studies to the last day of it the teaching philosophy being at this time esteemed very honorable he set up his school in the academy just without the city and from thence he was styled the founder of the academick sect that he had no regard to the gainful part of his profession is plain from his contempt of riches for he divided his estate which was very considerable among his brothers reserving to himself only a little countryseat with a small garden notwithstanding his application to study he had none of that gloominess and austerity in his temper which was common to most of his profession on the contrary he was cheerful and facetious and sometimes loved raillery but it was always inoffensive and with good manners and only to enliven the conversation he prescribed the same rules of behavior to his scholars and hence it was that he recommended it so strongly to them to sacrifice to the graces he was as universally beloved and caressed for his engaging manner and the easiness of his temper as he was esteemed and admired for his knowledge after his death kings and commonwealths erected statues and dedicated altars to him so that his memory became sacred his doctrine was established and he has passed both with pagans and christians under the name of the divine plato  during the transactions at olynthus the phocian war was continued but such a terrible havoc was made of the treasure of the temple that the phocians themselves being at length grown ashamed of it appointed commissarie to inquire into it and turned phalecus out o the command however he was restored to i again after justice had been done on those wh had been employed as his agents olymp  0    the punishment of those who had rifled the temple the bull of the money had been entrusted with one phil who was condemned and racked to death i the extremity of his torture he named man of his accomplices who were likewife put t death notwithstanding that they had given u what was remaining in their hands the va lue of what had been risled in the course o the war in money and rich presents with o there things dedicated to the use of the tem ple amounted in the whole to above ten thou sand talents which was an immense sum and is said to be more than alexander afterward found in the treasury of the persians  philip had for the most part affected to ob serve a neutrality in this quarrel but by the small part he had already acted in it it wa easily seen that he intended to do more i the mean time he left the contending parties t harass and weaken one another that he might afterward fall in with those who could be  most use to him and the case happened no according to his expectations for the theban were so exhausted with the war that they were not able to carry it on to any advantage and therefore had recose to him for his assistance the thebans call in philip to their assistance which he made no difficulty of granting them this was a very lucky circumstance for the promoting his views but it was the most fatal step the thebans could have taken both with regard to themselves and the rest of greece the ill consequences of it their calling in one who was as yet to be looked upon as a foreigner and who only waited such an opportunity was sacrificing every thing to their obstinacy and inveteracy against the phocians it was giving up all those marks of superiority which they pretended to upon the credit of their victories under epaminondas in short it was consigning themselves over to slavery and forging their own chains and with regard to the public the consequences will appear to be still worse the thessalians who had been inveigled by philip ever since his accession to the throne were prevailed upon to join in this new confederacy and afterward several other grecian states when they sound themselves oppressed by their neighbors applicd to philip for relief as to a common friend and protector but this was not till he had a more immediate influence in their affairs by being admitted into the assembly of the ampictyons besides it was the thebans who set them the example and who are therefore to be looked upon as the principal betrayers of the liberties of greece  but though philip had entered into these engagements with the thebans he considered that the phocians were supported both by athens and sparta and therefore proceeded with caution and secrecy and took time to form his measures accordingly amidst these deliberations it happened just as he could have wished that the athenians being grown weary of a war which was so far from turning to their account that it only gave philip a better opportunity of wresting from them their possession in thrace had therefore sent to sound him upon a peace athens negotiates a peacewith philip ctesiphon and phrynon who were employed in this commission made their report that he was not at all averse to it and thereupon demosthenes with nine others were sent as ambassadors to negotiate it they went as far in it as they were authorized by their instructions and returned with antipater parmenio and eurylochus on the part of philip soon after the ten were dispatched back again with full powers to put the last hand to the treaty demosthenes in the first of these embassies had met with some athenian prisoners in macedonia whom he had promised to redeem at his own expense and he took the present opportunity for it in the mean time his colleagues were to proceed with all expedition in order to conclude with philip but they loiterd by the way and were three months in macedonia before they had access to philip who was all that time ravaging the athenian dominions in thrace when at last they got up to him he agreed to the terms of the treaty but still upon one pretense or other deferred the execution of it till at length being advanced with his troops into thessaly in order to proceed against the phocians he found it necessary to conclude with the athenians which at last is concluded and accordingly ratified the treaty  by these delays which he gained by bribing all the ambassadors in general except demosthenes he had kept the athenians in suspense till his other designs were ripe for execution however as the peace was at last concluded the generality of the people were well satisfied with it and the ambassadors at their return aeschines vouches for philips promises valued themselves upon the success of their negotiations aeschines in particular who was one of them and was entirely devoted to philip expatiated largely upon his candor and sincerity and vouched for his performance of several things which he had promised in behalf of the republic although they were not stipulated by the treaty as that thespiae and plataea should be repeopled that in case he should subdue the phocians he would not destroy them that he would put the thebans upon a reasonable footing that oropus should be secured to the athenians and that euboea should be given up to them as an equivalent for amphipolis demosthenes gives no credit to them demosthenes endeavored with his usual frankness to convince the people how little stress there was to be laid upon these promises of philip which he said were made only to amuse them and to divert them from his real design which was to make himself master of phocis and that their suffering him to succeed in that would be giving up every thing but all that he could say upon this occasion had no weight with them they were willing to be deceived and aeschines knew how to work upon their credulity he was in the first rank of orators and disputed the prize even with demosthenes account of the contest between him and aeschines of which there was a famous instance in the contest concerning the crown wherein the abilities of these two great men were displayed in their highest luster and engaged the attention of all the learned men of greece the case in short was that demosthenes among other necessary works that were committed to his charge had the care of repairing the city walls which he did partly at his own expense and the people in testimony of their gratitude decreed him a crown of gold aeschines being jealous of his rivals glory brought an action against ctesiphon as being the author of the decree and founded it upon a pretense that demosthenes had not passed his accounts to the public and therefore was not capable by law of receiving any reward for his services this fact happened in the hundred and tenth olympaid about the time of the battle of cheronea and the suit was commenced soon after but it was not heard till several years after philips death when aeschines taking advantage of demosthenes whose credit was then at a very low ebb brought it on however demosthenes prevailed as well by the justice of his cause as by the force of his eloquence and aeschines was so ashamed that he spent the remainder of his life in a voluntary exile  another famous man character of isocrates who encouraged the people in this peaceable disposition and confirmed them in their good opinion of philip was isocrates who yet did it with an honest intention he was a great master of the rules of oratory and most of the great men of his time had been instructed by him but he declined speaking himself in public having a weak voice and a natural diffidence and timidity however he was not wholly unconcerned in the affairs of the public but his way of desivering his sentiments upon them was in writing and in the form of an oration and in this manner he now addressed himself to philip with whom he was upon some terms of friendhip and confidence but not otherwise than he thought consistent with the duty of a good cizen he explained to him the several advanages that might be drawn from the peace he and concluded with athens his advices to philip and told him that in order to make a right use of it he should endeavor to compose the differences still subsisting between the other states and to restore the general tranquillity of greece that the reconciling them to one another and then leaving them to the free enjoyment of their laws and their liberty would endear him to them and would redound infinitely more to his honour than all the conquests he could make he then advised him to turn his arms against persia as the proper object of his ambition intimating to him that the grecians would readily act in conjunction with him against their common and inveterate enemy and that in that case there would be no room to doubt of the success for proof whereof he instanced to him the expedition of the ten thousand with the glorious circumstances of their retreat and that of ages laus afterward who with a body of spartan only would have subdued the whole persia empire if he had not been diverted from it b the divisions of his country he told him further that many who were prejudiced against him gave him the character of an artful and designing prince and were of opinion that whatever specious pretenses he made use of to disguise h approach toward them his real intention w to make himself master of greece he mentioned these things only as reports and suc as were injurious and without foundation a would not suffer himself to suppose that a prin who valued himself so much upon his being descended from hercules the deliverer of greece would ever make an attempt to enslave it however he exhorted him by a generous and disinterested proceeding to contradict these reports to govern his subjects with justice and prudence and to give peace to his neighbors in short to set bounds to his ambition at home and to extend his conquests in persia the main scope of this oration was to divert him from attempting any thing that might give umbrage to greece and isocrates chose this way of gaining upon him by mildness and complaisance but he was too easy and credulous demosthenes was more a man of business and knew the world and philip too well to imagine that one of his aspiring and intriguing temper who had during his whole reign fomented divisions in greece in order to reap the benefit of it to himself would be prevailed upon by any reasoning of this kind to give up his favorite design which he had so long projected and which was now so near taking effect however the sincerity and long experience of isocrates who was now eightyeight years old added great weight to his opinion which with the impressions that aeschines and the other pensioners had made upon the people together with their own natural aversion to war determined the point so far in favor of philip that he was suffered quietly to pursue his march into phocis philip suffered to gain the streights of thermopylae and to gain the streights of thermopylae  he did not immediately discover what use he intended to make of his entrance into greece but went on according to his agreement with the thebans a m      olymp  0    he puts an end to the phocian war to put an end to the phocian war which he easily effected his name and appearance struck such a terror among the phocians that though they had lately received a reinforcement of a thousand heavyarmd spartans under the command of their king archidamus they declined giving him battle and sent to treat with him or rather to submit themselves to any terms that he would give them he allowed phalecus to retire with eight thousand men being mercenaries into peloponnesus but the rest who were the inhabitants of phocis were left at his mercy as the disposing of them was a matter wherein greece in general was concerned he did not think fit to act in it by his own private authority but referred it to the amphictyons whom he caused to be assembled for that purpose but they were so much under his influence that they served only to give a sanction to his determinations they decreed that all the cities of phocis should be demolished that they who had fled as being principally concerned in the sacrilege should be stigmatized as accursed and proscribed a outlaws that they who remained as inhabitants should be dispersed in villages and obliged to pay out of their lands a yearly tribute of sixty talents till the whole of what had been taken out of the temple should be restored they were likewise adjudgd to lose their seat in the council of the amphictyons wherein they had a double voice this philip got transferred to himself he obtains a seat among the amphictyons which was a very material point and may be looked upon as the principal step toward his gaining that authority which he afterward exercised in the affairs of greece at the same time he gained in conjunction with the thebans and thessalians and the superintendency of the pythian games the superintendency of the pythian games which the corinthians had forfeited for their having taken part with the phocians  thus did philip without striking a stroke put an end to this war after it had for ten years together divided greece against itself and besides the other advantages that he had drawn from it he gained an universal esteem and applause for having vindicated the honor of religion diodorus siculus who generally abounds with sentiments of piety toward the gods but with a great mixture of credulity and superstition ascribes all the success of his affairs afterward to this single instance of his zeal for religion which in reality was nothing but artifice and hypocrisy he goes on to describe the several judgments which befell those who were concerned in the sacrilege and descends even to their wives who he says were made examples of the divine vengeance for having adorned themselves with necklaces and o there trinkets taken out of the temple h carries his reflections so far as to impute the loss of the power and liberty of the principa cities of greece which happened afterward un der antipater to their being engaged in this ac of profanation with the phocians  chap iii from the end of the phocian war to the battle of cheronea containing the space of   years philip having by these plausible methods succeeded in this expedition did not think it advisable by attempting any thing further at present to fully the glory he had acquired by it or to incense the body of the grecians against him wherefore he returned in a triumphan manner to his own dominions where we will leave him employed against his old enemies the illyrians to relate some remarkable occurrence which happened at this time in sicily affairs in sicily for tho that island be not strictly to be looked upon as  part of greece yet the tranfactions we are now speaking of as they were owing chiefly to the grecians will naturally fall in with their story and here it may be necessary to take a summary view of the state of that island the first inhabitants without entering into the fabulous accounts of the first ages of it for sicily like most other nations had its giants and monsters such were the cyclopes and laestrigones who are mentioned as the first inhabitants to them succeeded the sicani but whether they were natives or transplanted from spain is not clearly determined the next were the siculi who being drove by the pelasgi from that part of latium whereon rome was built and finding no proper seat on the continent transported themselves as adventurers to this island where they became so far masters as to give the name to it which it has ever since retained  about three hundred years after they were in possession of the island a considerable number of grecians settled themselves in it the grecians get footing three these were the chalcidians of euboea and they were soon followed by a body of corinthians who possessed themselves of syracuse which from the extent of its buildings and the convenience and capatiousness of the harbor became the metropolis of the island though it was rivalld by several other great cities which were independent of that and of one another these cities were originally governed by the people but as the power of the leading men among them increased they fell by degrees into aristocracies and were afterward erected into little principalities and tyrannies under the command of single persons and it frequently happened that some one of these tyrants of a more enterprising genius than the rest aspired to the conquest of the whole  such was the confused state of sicily for several ages before and after the grecians had any footing in it summary account of syracuse and the syracusians underwent the same changes and interruptions in the course of its government as the other parts of the island their first tyrant was gelon gelon the first tyrant who taking advantage of the dissensions between the magistrates and the people fell in with the former and under a pretense of restoring them to their dignities obtained the sovereignty for himself however he made no ill use of his power he signalized himself by many great actions both in peace and war he not only strengthened and adorned the city and enlarged the territory but saved the whole island from falling into the hands of the carthaginians who had set their heart upon the conquest of it as lying so convenient for their shipping and were further tempted by the fruitfulness of the soil and the riches of the inhabitants accordingly under the common pretense of assisting to compose the differences among them they threw a vast number of their own and other african troops into the island but their designs were seen through and the several cities uniting in their common defense the carthaginians were attacked and defeated and are said to have lost an hundred and fifty thousand men in this expedition the honor of this victory was ascribed chiefly to gelon who had by this and many other instances so far endeared himself to the people that they suffered his brothers hiero and thrasybulus to succeed him in their turns as lawful princes is succeeded by his brothers hiero and thrasy bulus the former held it eleven years and the latter ten months but their government became so odious to the people that they forced them to quit it and by this means they recovered their former liberty which they enjoyed near sixty years another usurpation by dionysius the elder till the elder dionysius by his bravery and cunning usurped again upon them and supported himself for thirtyeight years notwithstanding his many acts of violence and cruelty his character but he had some qualities which were vere very useful to the public he greatly increased the naval force and was very zealous in prosecuting the war against the carthaginians he had studied the art of speaking and found his account in it especially at his first setting out upon the foot of a patriot but that which he chiefly applied himself to was poetry which he affected to a degree that made him ridiculous he was so full of his performances of this kind that he not only courted applause but extorted it by rewards and punishments in short he valued himself more upon his writing bad verses than upon his gaining a victory against the enemies of his country  he was succeeded by one of his sons of the same name he is succeeded by his son dionysius who inherited his fathers vices but without his spirit or capacity however being of a milder temper his friends had hope of reclaiming him and of correcting those failings in him which they looked upon only as the effects of a bad education they who were principally employed in this work the character of dion were dio and plato the former was his brotherinlaw and was so remarkable for his honor and virtue and zeal for his country that he was not only the greatest man in sicily but might be ranked with the best men in the best age of greece but he had a rigidness and austerity of the spartan kind which was not very well suite to the task he had undertaken however be ing associated with plato who had a more en gaging manner they used their joint endeavor to give the young prince a tincture of science and literature and to instill into him principle of justice and moderation and they had i some measure succeeded in their design b his flatterers and his own natural disposition g the better of all their instructions and he soo relapsed into his former state of indolence an sensuality the consequence was that di was disgraced and banished who drives dionysius into italy but he returned ar drove the tyrant into italy and by this means p the syracusians into a condition of reestablising themselves in their freedom but instead improving this opportunity they quarrelled wi their deliverer and upon an illgrounded jealousy of his aspiring to the government treated him with great inhumanity and ingratitude which he generously overlooked and endeavored still to extricate them out of their difficulties but he was soon after killed by means of calippus an athenian dion is killed by calippus  who came over with him to assist him against dionysius who succeeds in the tyranny but began now to set up for himself and by getting rid of dion who was the chief obstacle in his way succeeded in the tyranny and held it about a year  dionysius after ten years absence dionysius is restored found means to reinstate himself in the government but he did not hold it long for his sufferings instead of making him wiser and better had hardened and exasperated him and he became more fierce and cruel than before hereupon the people had recourse to icetes who was a native of syracuse but at that time governed the leontines he readily espoused their quarrel against the tyrant but it was in order to succeed him and with that view he entered into a secret league with the carthaginians who lay hovering about the island with a numerous fleet this gave the syracusians a fresh alarm so that between their oppressions and divisions at home and their appehensions of an invasion from abroad they knew not who to apply to nor who to trust and they had brought themselves into these streights by their own ill conduct for they did not distinguish between their friends and their foes they had all the capriciousness and insolence of a free state without the power in short they knew neither how to govern nor to obey  in this distracted state of their affairs they turned their thoughts toward greece and applied for relief to corinth as being their mother country and a common patroness of liberty the corinthians sent them a favorable answer and ordered a body of troops to be dispatched to them under the command of timoleon timoleon ordered to the relief of the syracusians who was of one of the best families in corinth and who besides his many other great qualities had given a very extraordinary instance of his aversion to tyranny  he had an elder brother named timophanes account of his former conduct whom he loved passionately and had rescued him in an engagement against the argives with the utmost hazard of his own life this brother having afterward the command of the cityguards made use of them to subvert the government and declared himself king of corinth timoleon endeavored by all possible means to dissuade him from these violen measures and not being able of himself to bring him to reason engaged two of his friends to assist him in it upon their expostulating wit him he first laughed at them and then a they pressed him further he grew angry up on which timoleon finding that neither the prayers and entreaties nor their arguments an menaces had any effect upon him retired at a little distance from him and stood weeping with his face covered whilst the other two drew their swords and dispatched him diodorus siculus says timoleon killed him with his own hands in the marketplace he relates this story with several other different circumstances but the account which plutarch gives of it from the historians who lived at the time when the fact was committed is more probable and more consistent and uniform as well as more to the honor of timoleon this action was by some extolled and applauded as the highest pitch of human virtue and by others condemned as a base and unnatural parricide and timoleon himself when he came to cool felt such a remorse for it that he abandoned himself to despair and resolved to starve himself to death his friends with great importunity and even by force prevailed upon him to take some sustenance and at length he promised them he would live but upon condition that he might quit the service of the public and retire to some remote and desert corner of the country which he accordingly did and for near twelve years together wandered up and down the fields by himself in this anxious and sorlorn condition  he was returned to corinth when he was pitched upon for this command and as he lived still in a retired way he would gladly have declined it but that he did not think it consistent with the duty he owed to his country before he set out he was told that as to the affair of his brother the world would judge of it according to his behavior in this expedition that if he acquitted himself well in it he would be said to have freed his country from a tyrant if otherwise he would be looked upon as his brothers murderer  whilst he was preparing to embark there came letters from icetes to dissuade him from it icetes endeavors to prevent his landing in sicily as a dangerous and fruitless attempt for that he would be intercepted in his passage by the carthaginians whom for want of receiving succors in due time from corinth he had been forced to call in to his assistance against the tyrant whereupon timoleon was forthwith ordered away with ten galleys  being arrived on the coast of italy olymp  0    he arrives on the coast of italy he received advice that icetes had made himself master of the greatest part of syracuse that he had forced the tyrant into the citadel and that the carthaginians had orders to prevent his landing and accordingly at rhegium he found twenty galleys which had been detached from their fleet for that purpose they had likewise deputies on board from icetes to acquaint him that the affairs of sicily being in a manner settled there would be no occasion for his assistance but however that in case he would send home his galleys with the troops he might come up himself to syracuse and share with him in his conquests timoleon had no views of this kind but finding himself overpowered he seemed to hearken to their proposal and to submit to it as a case of necessity he lands in sicily by a stratagem however he desired for form sake and in order to justify his conduct at his return to corinth that what had passed privately between them might be declared in a more open manner before the people of rhegium as being common friends to both parties but the leading men among them were in his interest and this demand of his was a concerted thing between them as a project for his escaping out of their hands to carry on this design an assembly was called and timoleon and the ambassadors together with the captains of the carthaginian galleys were admitted to it but the people instead of entering upon the business for which they were convened fell into tedious and trifling debates about other matters and spun out the time till nine of the corinthian galleys got clear of the harbor and put to sea which timoleon having secret notice of found means to slip unobserved through the crowd and having got on board the remaining gally joined the rest of his squadron and he landed at tauromenium in sicily where andromachus the governor received him with open arms and  with him in his design of freeing the island but few of the other towns as yet came in to him they had a general distrust of all foreign commanders having found by experience that they had been allured by them with fair promises and afterward been more oppressed by them than by those from whom they pretended to deliver them the syracusians had a better opinion of him at least they had no body else to depend on and yet they had very little hopes of relief from him whilst icetes was in possession of the town dionysius of the citadel and the carthaginians of the harbor  his first scene of action was at adranum a small city below mount aetna his success at adranum where the inhabitants being divided one party called in timoleon to their assistance and the other icetes the former was glad to take this opportunity of advancing further into the country and the latter thought it so necessary to prevent him that he immediately marched thither with a detachment of five thousand men timoleon arrived there at the same time with his whole strength which amounted to no more than twelve hundred however taking advantage of the enemy whilst they were fixing their tents he fell upon them with great fury and put them to flight having killed three hundred of them and taken double that number of prisoners together with their camp and all their baggage  this prosperous beginning gave him great credit olym  0    other places submit to him and increased his followers so that not only adranum but most of the other neighboring towns submitted to him mamercus tyrant of catana a man of great wealth and power entered into alliance with him and the city of messina at the same time declared for him it likewise advanced his affairs at syracuse where dionysius finding his case desperate dionysius surrenders himself chose rather to give up himself and the citadel to him as a man of honor and bravery than to become a prey to icetes whom he despised for his behavior in the late action accordingly timoleon sent four hundred men to take possession of the citadel and they gained their entrance by stealth and in small companies they found there two thousand soldiers whom dionysius likewise gave up to them together with a vast magazine of stores and arms for seventy thousand men  as to dionysius himself he was conducted out privately olymp  0    and is sent to corinth and carried to timoleons camp from whence he was transported to corinth where he became a public spectacle people flocked from all parts to see the man who had made so much noise in sicily and whose name was become formidable even to greece but he appeared very easy and composed and without any marks either of terror or of dignity instead of endeavoring to retrieve his affairs he fell into a mean way of life sauntering about in the shops and the shambles drinking in taverns or squabbling with lewd women in the streets and at length being reduced to great necessity he is said to have taught school for bread  timoleon having met with such success timoleons further successes icetes was so terrified that he had sent for a further supply of forces from africa and magon the carthaginian came over to him with an hundred and fifty sail of ships and sixty thousand men whereupon he blocked up the citadel and marched in order to besiege catana likewise where timoleon then lay but before he had made any progress there he received advice that leon a corinthian who commanded in the citadel at syracuse had made a successful sally that he had killed one part of the besiegers and put the rest to flight and that having taken acradina the strongest quarter of the town he had added works to secure it and to join it to the citadel lcetes immediately returned to syracuse and timoleon having lately received a supply of two thousand foot and two hundred horse from corinth soon followed him  however he had as yet no more than four thousand men to oppose to a numerous army but there happened a lucky incident which gave him great encouragement whilst he lay before the town some of his corinthians falling into company with a party of mercenaries who served under icetes took occasion to expostulate with them upon their present alliance with the carthaginians they told them that as they were of the same grecian extraction with themselves they ought to be engaged in the same interest and reproached them with endeavoring to put syracuse and all secily into the hands of those who were not only barbarians but the vilest and most inhuman sort of them and such as they ought to nite against as their common enemy the rumor of this discourse was soon spread about the camp and it had such an effect upon magon that for fear of being betrayed and sacificed he forthwith embarked his troops the carthaginians quit sicily and was gone so suddenly that timoleons men in a way of pleasantry caused proclamation to be made offering a reward to any who should bring tidings of the carthaginian fleet magon at is return home being conscious of his misehaviour killed himself and the people were o incensed at him that they nailed his body upon a cross  timoleon to improve this advantage timoleon attacks syracuse made his disposition for attacking the town in three several parts of it which he accordingly did the next day and with such vigor and success that icetess troops giving way and gains it he carried t at the first assault and plutarch says there was not one corinthian either killed or wounded  it the first thing he did upon this victory was to summon in the inhabitants to demolist the citadel demolisheth the citadel which he called the nest of tyrants they soon levelled it with the ground and from thence proceeded to pull down the palace of their usurpers to tear up their tombs and to destroy every thing that might preserve an memorial of them in the place where the ci tadel stood timoleon ordered courts of justic to be erected but whilst he was thus endea vouring to give free scope to the laws and t put the government upon the ancient footing he found there were very few inhabitants left t enjoy the benefit of it for what with the divisions among themselves their wars with the carthaginians and the oppression of their go vernors such numbers of them had been de storyd and forced away that the city was in manner become a desert and the grass grew i the streets and this was the case of most  the great towns in sicily but as to syracus the corinthians at the instance of timoleon an those few who remained there repeopled i they sent to all the public assemblies of greec and into asia repeoples the city and the islands to notify the syracuse having recovered its liberty all suc as were willing to go and settle there should  transported thither and should have the lan equally divided among them by this enco ragement they got together a body of ten tho sand which with those who had fled and we banished and others who flocked in from parts to timoleon amounted in the whole to sixty thousand this generous proceeding of the corinthians is taken particular notice of that when they had it in their power to make themselves entire masters of syracuse they contented themselves with the glory of saving and replenishing it and of being a second time the founders of it  timoleon having thus far reestablished the affairs of syracuse olymp  0    he proceeds to free the rest of the island marched to the other parts of the island to free them likewise at leontium be obliged icetes to renounce his league with the carthaginians and to demolish his forts and then reduced him to the condition of a private man and leptines of appollonia surrendering himself up to him he spared his life but sent him after dionysius to corinth  but before he could root out all the remains of arbitrary government the carthaginians to secure those places which were still in their interest is opposed again by the carthaginians and to retrieve the disgrace of their last expedition sent an army of seventy thousand men with a fleet of two hundred sail besides  thousand transport ships laden with chariots engines of battery and all kinds of provisions these forces landed at the promontory of lilyaeum under the command of asdrubal and hamilcar and occasioned such a general consternation that timoleon could raise but twelve thousand men to make head against them plutarch reduces them to seven thousand and says that even of that number one thousand deserted him in their march  however he went on to give the enemy battle before they had got a thorough footing in the island and coming up with them in their pa sage over the river called crimesus olymp   0   the battle at the river crimesus he ordered his horse to break into their ranks before they were well formed but they were so exposed to the chariots which were placed in the front tha timoleon drew them off and taking a side compass with his whole strength attacked the enemy in the flank after the first onset ther happened a sudden storm of thunder and lightning wind rain and hail which drove full i the face of the carthaginians and beat so furiously upon them that they could neither se nor hear nor stand in their ranks and timoleons troops pouring in upon them whilst they were thus disordered made a great slaughter among them and put the main body to flight some who had gained the plain were overtaken and put to the sword great numbers were cut to pieces as they were climbing the hills they who made back to the river ell in among others who were coming over to them and were promiscuously carried with them down the current and others were plunged into little torrents and rivulets which were occasioned by the violence of the storm and the overflowing o the river where they rolled about in the mire and were so encumbered with their heavy armor that they were not able to disengage themselves or to make any defense in this manner their whole army was distressed on all sides and every thing conspired to make it an entire defeat timoleon gains the victory there is some variation in the accounts that are given of this action but not in the most material circumstances of it there is likewise some difference as to the number of those who were killed and taken according to the highest accounts of them there were above ten thousand slain besides three thousand who were natives of carthage of the best families and fortunes and of the most approved valor they were looked upon in the same light as the sacred band of pelopidas and went under the same appellation there were also above fifteen thousand taken prisoners together with the camp and baggage and a great quantity of gold and silver plate and other rich booty  timoleon upon this victory returned to syrause but whilst he was endeavoring to perfect his scheme of government there further attempts to restore the tyranny the seeds of tyranny which had not been thoroughly rooted out in the other parts of the island began to shoot up again the cities of catana and messa with their tyrants mamercus and hippo had revolted from him and icetes though he had been sufficiently humbled took this occasion to join with them and they invited the carthaginians to come and make another effort accordingly seventy sail of ships were dispatched under the command of gisco who likewise debauched some of the grecians into his service but this expedition had no better success than the former and served only to hasten the putting an end to these wars but defeated by timoleon for icetes mamercus and hippo appearing again in arms upon this reinforcement timoleon pursued them one after another and after he had killed several thousands of their followers they were all three taken and executed the wives and children of icetes were likewise condemned and executed by the syracusians which was looked upon as an ungenerous part in timoleon that he did not interpose in their behalf but it was the act of the people and was said to be done by way of retaliation for the like treatment of the family of dion whose wife and sister and infant son icetes had caused to be thrown alive into the sea  during these transactions of timoleon the carthaginians sued to him for peace and agreed among other conditions to renounce all leagues and associations with any of the sicilian tyrants which he considered as the most effectual means of suppressing them and it succeeded accordingly olymp   0   the public liberty restored for soon after this treaty they were utterly destroyed and the public liberty was restored  timoleon having finished this great work divested himself of his authority and chose rather to live as a private man at syracuse timoleon retires and lives private in syracuse with the pleasure of seeing so many thousands made happy in the enjoyment of the blessings he had procured for them than to grasp at any further power in sicily or to return in triumph to greece he was infinitely beloved and honored by the syracusians who in memory of what he had done for them made a decree that in all their future wars they should have a corinthian commander and so long as timoleon lived they made no law or treaty nor did any extraordinary act of government wherein he was not consulted as to what remains to be said concerning him it will fall in more properly with the account of his death which happened two years later  during the former part of these commotions in sicily philip was gaining ground upon the illyrians and settling his conquests at home but before the reestablishment of affairs in that island he had carried his arms into thrace and the hellespont among the athenian colonies and confederates and thereby given occasion to fresh disturbances which should have been related in their due order of time but i have chose rather to do it now by way of retrospect than to break into the narration of what passed at syracuse in the first year of the  0 th olympiad he marched into thessaly and having cleared out the remains of tyranny in the several cities there he not only confirmed the thessalians in his interest but gained over many of their neighbors  having strengthened himself in these parts he went the next year into thrace where he had formed a design against the chersonese philips design against the chersonese of thrace this peninsula had with some little interruption been for many years in the hands of the athenians but cotys as being king of the country had lately wrested it from them and left it in succession to his son chersobleptes he not being able to defend himself against philip gave it back to the athenians reserving to himself only cardia the capital city but philip having soon after routed him of the rest of his dominions the cardians for fear of falling again under the power of the athenians threw themselves into his protection he is opposed by dpithes diopithes who was the chief of the athenian colony lately sent to the chersonese considered this proceeding of philip in supporting the cardians as an act of hostility against athens whereupon he invaded the maritime part of thrace and carried away a great deal of botty philip being at this time in the upper part of the country was not in a condition to do himself justice but he wrote to complain of it at athens as an infraction of the peace and his creatures there were not wanting on their part to aggravate the charge against diopithes as having acted without orders  and taken it upon himself to renew the war they likewise accused him o committing acts of pyracy and of laying their allies under contribution but whatever grounds there were for this part of the accusation the government of athens was principally to blame in it for having no proper fund for the war they sent out their generals without money or provisions and left them to shift for themselves and yet made them answerable for any miscarriages that should happen for want of their being better supplied this was a great discouragement to the service and put those who were employed in it upon pillaging and plundering in such a manner as they would otherwise have been ashamed of demosthenes in an harangue that he made upon the state of the chersonese undertook the defense of diopithes demosthenes defends him and although that might be the principal design of his speech yet he entered into a great variety of other matter and laid open so much of the present situation of affairs both in athens and several other states of greece that it may be proper to give the reader a short account of it and the rather because it contains the substance of what demosthenes has said in some of his other orations in the same manner and almost in the same terms against philip and his partisans in the athenian assembly  he urged to the people in behalf of diopithes that he had done nothing but what his necessities had forced him to and that he had only followed the example of his predecessors who had constantly laid the islanders and other asiatick allies under contribution and that they who paid it found their account in it in having convoys to secure them from pirates and otherwise to protect their trade that instead of being questioned for using his industry to procure that subsistence for the troops which he could not obtain from the government they ought forthwith to send him a reinforcement and to provide better for their pay however he told them that whatever exactions or violences he had been guilty of he was their officer and it was always in their power to send for him home and to punish him as they found he deserved but he told them at the same time that this accusation was made use of only as an handle to divert them from inquiring into the motions and designs of philip and inveighs against philip who with a powerful army in thrace and upon the hellespont was ravaging their possessions debauching their allies and stirring up against them both the grecians and barbarians that whilst he was engaged in these practices he was to be looked upon as the first aggressor and that they were not to think themselves secure because he was not come up to the piraeus nor was attacking them in attica  among other arguments to induce them to make head against him he told them they had more to apprehend from him than their neighbors had and he explained it to them by an artful piece of flattery you must not imagine said he that philip will treat you in the same manner with the rest of the grecians and that he will content himself with barely making slaves of you no his design is to destroy and extirpate you for he is sensible that a people who have so long known what it is to command will never bear servitude and that you are incapable of doing it if you would he knows that you would be always struggling to break your chains and that you would give him more disturbance than all the rest of the world and therefore you may look upon it as an undoubted maxim that he can intend nothing less than you total ruin and destruction  from thence he proceeded to inveigh against the orators and the orators for the treacherous part they had acted upon these proceedings of philip and he did it with great boldness and acrimony by exposing their false reasoning their false zeal and their false courage he told the people it was in vain to think of their being victorious abroad so long as they nourished in their bosom these pensioners and creatures of their enemy these domestic foes who were as so many hidden rocks and shelves upon which they must one day unavoidably suffer shipwreck he went on to show them that the insolent behavior of philip toward them was wholly owing to these haranguers who saved him the trouble of managing and undermining them as he did the other states with an appearance at least of bearing them good will and doing them good offices he instanced in the thessalians tha though he had brought them under subjection h had taken some pains to inveigle them into it and had strowd the way to it with flowers by freeing them from their tyrants and by re storing them to their seat among the amphictyons that he had drawn the poor olynthians into hi snare by heaping his favors upon them and had lulled them asleep by his cession of potidae to them that he had at present got the thebans under his dependence but that he had thought it proper to gild their chains by putting them in the possession of beotia by laying waste the country of their enemies the phocians and by delivering them from a long and burdensome war but why says demosthenes does he not think it worth his while to amuse you with some such marks of his complaisance and his bounty why does he not endeavor to gain upon you by some real or pretended benefits on the contrary he infringes your treaties breaks into your alliances and seizes your possessions and does it with an high hand without so much as attempting to excuse or dissemble it he tells them the reason of this difference in philips conduct with regard to them was because he had no need of keeping any measures with them or of saving appearances for that he knew he had a party among them who were always ready to plead his cause and to justify all his proceedings athens says demosthenes is the only city of greece where a man may with impunity display his eloquence in defense and even in praise of the common enemy  he expatiated further upon the base and ungenerous artifices of the orators in persecuting their fellowcitizens they said he who have no real concern for the welfare of the public may with ease and safety censure arraign and condemn they can always secure themselves from danger by their inexhaustible fund of flattery and dissimulation by their daily shifting and changing their opinion according to the different taste and humor of the people and by disguising and concealing from them the weak and disorderly state of their affaris the truly brave and zealous citizen he describes in another manner that the only thing he has in view is the peoples interest that in order to promote it he opposes their inclinations combats their opinion and makes no concessions to them out of complaisance that he delivers his mind freely and openly according to the best of his judgment and makes himself accountable to them not only for the reasonableness of his advice but likewise for the success of it demosthenes does not directly apply this character to himself but it may be easily collected from what follows that he thought it belonged to him i know says he fellowcitizens as well as others how to flatter to accuse to proscribe and to practice all those other little arts of gaining credit with you but i have a soul above it i have no avarice nor ambition my chief aim is to repeat and inculcate those truths which because they are distasteful to you must therefore give my rivals the preference in your favor and yet they are such as if you would hearken to them would give you the advantage over your enemies it is to me a part unworthy of a good citizen to study ways of rising on a sudden to the highest rank of men in athens when you are at the same time sinking to the lowest rank of men in greece  when he had thus endeavored to open their eyes and to free them from their dependence on the other orators he pressed them to proceed forthwith to action it is my part says he to propose it is yours to resolve and to execute he concludes with exhorting them to supply the necessities of the state to keep their troops on foot and in good discipline to dispatch ambassadors to all parts with instructions to communicate their resolutions and to give notice of the common danger that threatened greece and thereupon to negotiate and conclude whatever should be thought requisite for the service of the commonwealth and above all he advised them to show no mercy to those who prostituted themselves for gain to the enemy of their country  whatever effect these remonstrances had for the present philip was not discouraged from making further attempts philip takes advantage of the divisions in peloponnesus and he was furnished with a pretense for it by the divisions which were now in peloponnesus and they were owing chiefly to the spartans who having little to do in the late foreign transactions were recovering their strengh at home and according to their usual practice as they increased in power made use of it to insult and oppress their neighbors the argives and messenians being at this time persecuted by them put themselves under the protection of philip and the thebans joining with them they all together formed a powerful confederacy the natural balance against it was an union between athens and sparta which the spartans pressed with great earnestness as the only means for their common security and philip and the thebans did all in their power to prevent it demosthenes spirits up the athenians against him but demosthenes exerting himself upon this occasion roused up the athenians and put them so far upon their guard that without coming to an open rupture with philip they obliged him to desist  this storm in peloponnesus was no sooner blown over but another happened which fell more immediately upon the athenians and that was an attempt upon euboea philips attempt upon euboea philip had long formed a design against this island as being not only a rich acquisition but an easy passage into the continent of attica and in order now to execute it he had gained some of the principal men who suffered him to throw in a body of macedonians by means whereof he demolished some places and fortified others and erected several petty tyrants who acted in his name and under his authority plutarchus of eretria or clitarchus as he is otherwise called sent to let the athenians know that the island must be lost if it were not immediately relieved whereupon they dispatched some few troops thither under the command of phocion this plutarchus upon their arrival changed his opinion and made head against them however phocion was not discouraged he gave him battle and routed him and having gained a signal victory returned home he was succeeded in the command by one molossus who was not equal to it and suffered himself to be taken prisoner but it does not appear that philip prosecuted this war to any further advantage the island preserved by phocion so that the recovery of the island may be ascribed to phocion  he had before this action given several proos of his courage and capacity his character but he began now to distinguish himself as a general and to bear a principal part in the affairs of the government as he had talents very well suited to both these capacities he did not approve the modern practice of allotting the civil power to one set of men and the military to another but was for having them united in the same persons as they formerly were in solon aristides and pericles he had studied philosophy under plato and xenorates and in oratory he was upon a level with the best speakers of his time he was not so pompous and diffuse as they but was better heard than most of them his manner was plain and concise strong and pointed full of matter and good sense and always to the purpose when he was one day in the assembly observed to be very pensive and his friends asked him the reason of it i am considering said he how to contract what i have to say and demosthenes who had a secret jealousy of him was wont to call him the pruningbook of his periods this brevity and simplicity in his diction was of the spartan kind and he had still more of the spartan in his manner of deportment he had such a settled composure in his countenance that he was never seen either to laugh or cry he was grave and austere even to moroseness insomuch that they who were strangers to him did not care to accost him but this severity was more in his appearance than in his temper for he was naturally very easy and conversable humane and beneficent and a great patron of the distressed even of those who had most opposed him his friends reproving him for pleading in behalf of an ill man he told them the innocent had no need of an advocate in the camp he went very thinly clad and generally barefoot and he lived at home with his family much in the same coarse hardy way there is upon this occasion a remarkable saying of his wife who was noted for her virtue and good housewifery and being visited by an ionian woman of distinction who showed her all her jewels embroidery and other rich ornaments for my part said she to her my only ornament is my good man phocion who has commanded the athenians now these twenty years he was not so happy in his son who being inclined to luxury and excess he sent him to sparta to be put into a stricter way of education and demades repoarchd him with it publicly as an attempt to introduce the spartan manners and discipline he certainly had a very bad opinion of the manners of his country and would gladly have reformed them but he could not do it otherwise than by his example and that was of small force against so general a corruption however as to his own particular it gained him an awe and attention from those who would not imitate him it created such an opinion of him that he was chosen general upon forty five several expeditions and always in his absence for though he did not decline the service when he was called to it he never put himself in the way of it he was so far from making a servile court to the people or soothing them in their follies that he took all occasions of thwarting and opposing them and he would never give up a point which he thought necessary for the good or safety of the public the oracle having upon a certain occasion told the athenians that there was one man in the city of a different opinion from the rest and enquiry being made who this should be i said phocion am the man i am pleased with nothing that the common people say or do another time when he had delivered his opinion to them and found that it was generally approved i wish said he turning to his friend that what i have proposed be not wrong he was so tenacious in what he thought most advisable that he would rather suffer himself to be treated as a coward than enter into a war which did not appear to him to be just and necessary there is an instance of this kind when being pressed to engage the enemy at a disadvantage no said he you cannot at this time make me valiant nor i you wise the truth is he was naturally inclined to peace and considered war no otherwise than as the means of procuring it he endeavored by several private negotiations to put an end to the war with the macedonians and herein he seemed to act the part of a mediator but the moderation and complaisance which he showed in this correspondence with the enemies of his country created a suspicion of his being too well affected to them and at last it cost him his life he certainly was upon good terms with philip alexander and antipater who all successively esteemed and caressed him and would have loaded him with presents but he could not be prevailed upon to accept any upon this occasion antipater was wont to say i have two friends at athens phocion and demades of whom the former will not suffer me to gratify him at all and the other is never to be satisfied phocion upon the whole was one of the wisest and best sort of men that athens ever bred but the steadiness of his virtue and the singularity of his manners would not let him drive on with the current of the times he lived in and plutarch mentions it as his misfortune that he came to the helm when the public bottom was just upon sinking  when philip found his affairs advance slowly in euboea he thought fit to retreat and marched back to thrace in order to distress the athenians in those parts from whence they received a great part of their provisions with this view in the last year of the  0 th olympiad he laid siege to perinthus philip besieges perinthus  and firmly attached to the athenians he invested it with an army of thirty thousand men and having raised his works to a great height so as to command those of the enemy he made his assault with all kinds of battering engines the inhabitants were no less active and resolute on their part so that when philip had made a breach in the wall which he thought sufficient to gain his entrance into the town he found they had run up another wall within side by means whereof together with the natural advantage of the place which rose up gradually in the form of a theater they made a vigorous defense and held out till they were relieved from byzantium  philip to cut off this communication divided his army and marched with one half of it to form the siege of byzantium leaving the other to carry on that of perinthus and byzantium these violent proceedings gave a general alarm both in greece and persia the lieutenants of the provinces near the coasts were ordered to assist the besieged with what forces they could spare the islands of chios cos and rhodes united in the same design and the athenians began now to exert themselves in earnest demosthenes had before endeavored to awaken them out of their lethargy and to convince them that the first attack against perinthus was an open violation of the peace and they so far gave attention to him that chares was sent out with a fleet but he was a bad man and of a mean capacity and as such he was pitched upon by the creatures of philip for this service he behaved according to their expectations and had so little credit with the allies of athens upon the hellespont that they did not care to admit him into their ports but the people now being grown more sensible of their danger thought it necessary to appoint some other commander on whom they could better depend and accordingly phocion was ordered out with a fresh supply of forces  philip had hitherto endeavored by many specious pretenses to cover his designs and to keep measures with the athenians but when he found they had taken the alarm and were arming so many others against him he wrote them an expostulatory letter he endeavors to justify his proceedings wherein he charged them with the infraction of their treaties and with many other injuries which he pretended to have received from them it was full of complaints reproaches and menaces and was drawn in a very masterly manner with so much art and delicacy with such a variety of facts and such plausible reasoning upon them and with such a spirit of majesty throughout the whole that it may be looked upon as one of the finest pieces of antiquity it was calculated for the use of the partisans at athens so as to furnish them with materials for pleading his cause in the assembly and the intent of it was to try if it were yet too late to divert the people from pushing things to an extremity the point that he laid the greatest stress upon was the engaging the persians against him and this he imputed to the athenians it does not clearly appear how far they were concerned in it but it is certain that in order to check the growth of his power demosthenes had prepared the people for an alliance with persia and still pressed it and pausanias says that the persian troops which were employed on this occasion were commanded by apollodorus an athenian from such circumstances as these philip thought himself sufficiently warranted to remonstrate in the manner he did to the athenians he told them that by this instance of their calling in the persians and that at a time when he was in peace with them they had shown more hatred and rancour against him than in cases of the most open and declared enmity between them that they had acted in it contrary to all the rules of prudence and policy and to the constant practice not only of their ancestors but of themselves likewise and to this purpose he reminded them that they had some time since passed a formal resolution to invite him to act in conjunction with them and the other grecians against the persians as barbarians and as their common enemy his applying these appellations of barbarians and foreigners to the persians was an artful way of disclaiming them with regard to himself and of blending together the interests of greece and macedonia as if they were inseparable demosthenes to prevent the impressions this letter might make upon the people demosthenes refutes him endeavored by way of answer to expose the fallacy of the arguments contained in it they were founded wholly upon a presumption that the athenians were the aggressors but it was notorious that philip was taking their places intercepting their provisions attacking their allies and making every day fresh encroachments upon them and that in a time of profound peace as he calls it and before any measures had been taken by the athenians to oppose him this was the truth of the case and tha which demosthenes thought it more necessary to convince the people of than to go about to justify or to refute the facts they were charged with he told them the lette was wrote in a style not suitable to the people of athens that it was a plain declaration of war against them that philip ha long since made the same declaration by his actions and that by the peace he had conclude with them he meant nothing further than a bar cessation of arms in order to gain time and t take them more unprepared from thence h proceeded to his usual topic of reproving them for their sloth and for suffering them selves to be deluded by their orators who were in philips pay at the same time he advis them to change their generals for that the who had ruined their affairs were not ver likely to retrieve them phocion declared h opinion to the same effect concerning the generals phocion succeeds chares in the command and it was upon this occasion that h was appointed to succeed chares  the byzantines received him with great mark of confidence and friendship and he by acting in concert with them soon obliged philip  abandon his design both upon byzantium and perinthus he raises both the sieges he also took some of his ships recovered several places which he had garrisoned ravaged the flat part of the country and drives philip out of the hellespont and drove him out of the hellespont it is said that the siege of perinthus was raised before by the persians but whatever hand they had in it the inhabitants of that place as well as of byzantium ascribed their deliverance wholly to the athenians and testified it in the most solemn manner giving them liberty to settle among them and intermarry with them and granting them greater privileges and immunities than their own citizens enjoyed they also consecrated crowns and erected statues to them the inhabitants of the chersonese in token of the like deliverance raised altars to the athenians and decreed to them a crown of gold so terrible was the name of philip grown to the people in these parts that they thought they could never give sufficient proofs of their gratitude to those who had freed them from him and as to himself his disappointment in this expedition with the loss of a good number of his men was the greatest mortification he had hitherto received this reduced him to his old artifice of endeavoring to renew the peace with athens and he kept up the appearance of negotiating it for the next two years after the siege of perinthus but he was arming all the while and making new infractions and the subsequent account of his proceedings will show that there was no way left of bringing things to a determination but by the sword  without waiting the result of his last overture of the athenians philips expedition into scythia he marched against atheas king of scythia upon a pretense that he had not gratified him for the assistance he had given him in his wars against the istrians the scythians gave him battle but though they were far superior in number he defeated them and carried off a great deal of booty which consisted chiefly of women and children and cattle and among the latter there were twenty thousand mares for breeding in his return the triballi of moesia pretending to a share of the spoil disputed his passage and thereupon ensued a sharp conflict wherein his horse was killed under him and himself so wounded that he must have fallen into the enemies hands if he had not been rescued by his son alexander who was with him in this expedition and gave this early token of what might one day be expected from him  the peace in the mean time was under consideration at athens his overtures of peace rejected at athens and the people were divided concerning it according to the different sentiments of their leaders phocion was for accepting it but was strongly opposed by demosthenes and his advice for rejecting it prevailed when philip sound the athenians would not treat with him and that they were acting offensively against him especially at sea where they blocked up his ports and put an entire stop to his commerce whereupon he forms new alliances he began to form new alliances against them particularly with the thebans and thessalians without whom he knew he could not keep open his passage into greece at the same time he was sensible that his engaging these powers to act directly against athens and in his own personal quarrel would have so bad an aspect that they would not easily come into it for which reason he endeavored underhand to create new disturbances in greece and creates fresh divisions in greece that he might take such a part in them as would best answer his views and when the flame was kindled his point was to appear rather to be called in as an assistant than to act as a principal  these fresh commotions took their rise from the locri ozolae who bordered upon the phocians and were accused of the same act of profanation which they had committed in breaking up a piece of ground belonging to the temple of apollo at delphi and this case was referred in the same manner as the former was to the amphictyons who in order to form their judgment upon the matter in dispute went to take a view upon the place but were so insulted and attacked by the locrians that they were forced to fly for it hereupon both sides had recourse to arms and there was all the appearance of a second holy war but it was not carried on with the same zeal as the former it was ended almost as soon as it began and served only to advance philips authority in greece his designs promoted by aeschines this was owing chiefly to aeschines who was secretly his agent and had by his means got himself to be deputed on the part of athens as one of the members in the present assembly of the amphictyons when he found the war went on so heavily and that they who were to contribute toward it were very backward in sending in their quotas he proposed to the rest of the deputies that the several states which they represented should either hire foreign troops and tax themselves to pay them or that in order to save that trouble and expense they should choose philip for their general they readily swallowed the bait that was laid for them and agreed to the latter of these proposals hereupon a formal embassy was sent to philip to demand his assistance in avenging the honor of the deity and to notify to him that the grecians had by their representatives in the council of the amphictyons philip chosen general against the locrians chosen him their general for that purpose with full power to proceed in the manner he should judge most proper  philip did not want much persuasion to accept the offer of that which he had so eagerly pursued and which was in effect the completion of all his other designs he unmediately got his troops together and began his march but instead of going on to chastise the lorcrians he seizes upon elatea he made a sudden turn and seized upon elatea a capital city of phocis which was very well situated for awing the thebans of whom he began to grow jealous and for preparing his way to atheans but by so extraordinary a step as this he fairly threw off the mask and bad defiance to the whole body of the grecians the athenians alarmed at it   the news of it arriving at athens in the evening the trumpets sounded the alarm and the city was filled with terror and amazement the next morning the assembly met and all the generals and orators assisted at it but when it was expected that some of the members should rise to offer their advice upon the present exigency every body sat mute and confounded the crier made proclamation and demanded according to the usual form who of them was disposed to speak no body yet offering the same question was several times repeated but still to no purpose at length they are animated by demosthenes in this general dead silence demosthenes rose up and endeavored to dispel their fears and to animate them for their defense the most immediate danger they apprehended from philip was his late alliance with the thebans and this was the point that demosthenes labored chiefly to clear up to them and to make it appear that the thebans were not so strongly attached to him as they imagined for if it were so said he we should not now have heard of his being at elatea but in attica to which he added that however the thebans might before have been deluded by him this last proceeding of his had more fully opened their eyes it is true said he some part of them he had gained by money and artifice and he has drawn down his troops to keep them in heart and to intimidate the rest who are the greatest part and who have hitherto opposed him and would still continue to do so if they had any prospect of being supported wherefore he proposed that all who were able to bear arms should march out of the city and make a general rendezvous at eleusis as well to set an example to the rest of greece for asserting the common liberty as to show the thebans in particular that they were ready to protect and assist them and in regard to that inveterate enmity and rancour which had so long subsisted between athens and thebes he advised the people to suppress it for the present and not to revive the memory of past injuries which he told them would only serve to hinder or retard that union and good correspondence which were now become so necessary for their mutual preservation he further proposed that ambassadors should be sent to the several states of greece to make it a common cause but especially and in the first place to the thebans as they were more immediately exposed and as they were the barrier to athens the assembly readily agreed to this advice of demosthenes and pursuant thereto a decree in form was drawn up with an additional clause that a fleet of two hundred sail should be fitted out to cruize near thermopylae  there being no time to be lost in this negotiation with the thebans his negotiation with the thebans ambassadors were forthwith dispatched to them with demosthenes at the head of them and they were met by others on the part of philip python opposes him the principal of them was python who was a byzantine by birth and had been made a free citizen of athens but was now in philips interest he was a very able and forcible speaker and therefore was upon this occasion opposed to demosthenes the macedonians were heard first the preference being given to them as friends and allies they set out with large encomiums upon philip and after a long recital of the many benefits and advantages the thebans had received from him and the many injuries and provocations they had received from athens they endeavored to excite their gratitude on the one hand and to fire their resentment on the other they also tempted them with the hopes of booty which they told them they should find in great abundance in attica and that they would at the same time prevent the ravaging their own country and making it the seat of the war which would be the necessary consequence of their entering into an alliance with athens upon the whole they proposed to them in the alternative either that they should join with philip in the invasion of attica or that they should sit still and give him a free passage thorugh boeotia  demosthenes by way of reply used the same king of reasoning with the thebans as he had done with the athenians to convince them of the necessity of proceeding against philip as their common enemy for that whatever words or pretenses he made use of his designs were too visible from his actions he instanced particularly in the manner of his seizing upon elatea he told them that in case he should succeed so far as to conquer attica thebes would suffer in its turn that he would go on from one city and one province to another and would never stop till he had made himself master of the whole  the thebans were not very inclinable to enter into any engagements on either side they had too lively a sense of the miseries they had undergone especially whilst the wounds they had received in the phocian war were still fresh upon them but demosthenes fired them to such a degree that they were no longer masters of themselves the force of his eloquence upon this occasion is said to have cast a mist over their understanding to have carried them away like a whirlwind and to have worked them up to a sort of enthusiasm insomuch that laying aside all fear and gratitude the thebans enter into an alliance with athens and other prudential considerations they declared themselves for the alliance with athens  that which animated demosthenes next to his zeal for the public safety was his having to do with a man of pythons abilities and he some time after took occasion to value himself upon the victory he had obtained over him i did not give way said he to the boasting python when he would have bore me down with a torrent of words demosthenes values himself upon his success he gloried more in the success of this negotiation than of any other he had been employed in and spoke of it as his masterpiece in politics it was certainly of the greatest importance to athens at this time when philip seemed fully bent on her destruction and when she had no other immediate prospect of relief but from the gaining the thebans demosthenes therefore to do himself justice put the people in mind of the danger they had escaped he told them it was he who had dispersed that cloud which hung over the city and that by this instance of his unwearied diligence and zeal for the public he had exceeded all that had been done by the greatest orators of former ages he was generally more modest than he appears to have been in this case but it must be considered that what he said upon this occasion was some time after in his defense against aeschines who by his artful and invidious insinuations had put him under a necessity of enumerating his services to the commonwealth and of setting them in the strongest light they would bear  when philip found himself thus disappointed of the thebans philips artifices to avoid fighting he sued again to the athenians for peace but they saw his drift too plainly to trust him and were too much exasperated to hearken to any terms of accommodation however he resolved to stand it out with them and both sides prepared for battle but before it came to action he tried another stratagem which was by bribing the oracle to terrify them with fatal omens and predictions concerning the event of it demosthenes to prevent these warnings making any deep impression treated them with the utmost contempt and it was upon this occasion that he charged the priestess with philippizing he put the thebans in mind of their epaminondas and the athenians of pericles who he told them were governed by reason and good sense and would not suffer themselves to be carried away by such idle superstitious fancies which they looked upon only as a cloak for cowardice the athenians were so eager for the war that they easily got the better of these frightful apprehensions and demosthenes had by his las treaty gained such an ascendant both ove them and the thebans that they submitted themselves entirely to his directions  accordingly they took the field olymp   0   the battle at cheronea and encamped together near cheronea in boeotia where philip met them with thirty thousand foot and two thousand horse he was somewhat superior to them in numbers and more so in the goodness of his officers he gave the command of the left wing of his army to his son alexander but in regard to his youth he placed the best of his officers about him and the right wing he took to himself in the grecian army the thebans were on the right and the athenians on the left at sunrising the two armies joined battle and behaved with such equal courage and bravery that it was long before any impression was made on either side till at length alexander exerting himself in an extraordinary manner broke in upon the sacred band of the thebans and cut them to pieces after which the rest of that wing were easily routed philip who had to do with the athenians forced them likewise to give way but they soon recovered their ground and lysicles who in conjunction with chares commanded the athenian troops pushed forwards into the center of philips army where imagining himself victorious he cried out to his men come on let us pursue them to macedonia philip observing what passed and that lysicles instead of attacking his phalanx in flank when he had so fair an opportunity went on a wild disorderly pursuit said cooly the athenians dont know how to conquer and thereupon h drew up his phalanx on a little eminence from whence he poured down upon them and takin them both in flank and rear philip gains the victory entirely route them it was upon this occasion that de mosthenes threw down his arms and was one  the first who fled and there is a ridiculou circumstance told of him that in his flight hi clothes catching hold of a bush he took it fo an enemy and cried out for quarter ther were above a thousand athenians killed in the action and above two thousand taken prisoners and the loss on the part of the thebans was much the same  philip was transported with this victory beyond measure his behavior upon it and having drank to excess at an entertainment which he gave upon that occasion went into the field of battle where he insulted over the slain and upbraided the prisoners with their misfortunes he leaped and danced about in a frantic manner and with an air of burlesque sung the beginning of the decree which demosthenes had drawn up as a declaration of the war against him demades who was in the number of the prisoners had the courage to reproach him with this unge nerous behavior telling him that fortune ha given him the part of agamemnon but that h was acting that of thersites he was so struck with the justness of this reproof that i wrought a thorough change in him and he was so far from being offended at demades that he immediately gave him his liberty and showed him afterward great marks of honor and friendship he likewise released all the athenian captives and without ransom and when they found him so generously disposed toward them they made a demand of their baggage with every thing else that had been taken from them but to that philip replied surely they think i have not beat them this discharge of the prisoners was ascribed in a great measure to demades who is said to have new modeled philip and to have softened his temper with the attick graces as diodorus expresses it and philip himself acknowledged upon another occasion that his frequent converse with the athenian orators had been of great use to him in correcting his morals justin represents his carriage after the battle in a very different light as that he took abundance of pains to dissemble his joy that he affected great modesty and compassion and was not seen to laugh that he would have no sacrifice no crowns nor perfumes that he forbad all kind of sports and did nothing that might make him appear to the conquerors to be elated nor to the conquered to be insolent but this account seems to have been confounded with others which were given of him after his being reformed by demades it is certain that after his first transport was over and that he began to recollect himself he showed great humanity to the athenians and that in order stil to keep measures with them he renewed the peace he renews the peace with athens but the thebans who had renounced their alliance with him he treated in another manner he his severity toward the thebans who affected to be as much master of his allies as of his subjects could not easily pardon those who had deserted him in so critical a conjuncture wherefore he not only took ransom for their prisoners but made them pay for leave to bury their dead it is further said that either by the sword or by banishment he cleared the city of the principal men who had stood in opposition to him and confiscated their goods that he recalled all such as had been banished for espousing his interest and made em judges and magistrates with a power of life and death over those who had been the authors of their exile after these severities and after having placed a strong garrison over them he granted them a peace  chap iv from the battle of cheronea to the death of philip of macedon containing the space of above one year the generality of the athenians were not much dejected upon this overthrow especially since philip had shown so much moderation toward them but they who saw further into the consequences of it were not very easy in their present situation isocrates was more particularly affected with the loss and disgrace they had suffered and was so apprehensive that philip would make some further use of his victory that he chose rather to starve himself to death isocrates starves himself than to survive the liberty of his country which is a sufficient proof that his intimacy with philip which has before been mentioned was with an intent to serve the commonwealth and that his end was good though he was mistaken in the means of attaining it and in the man he had to deal with the truth is he was not conversant enough in public affairs his proper province was his school wherein he succeeded beyond any man of his time and he got so much money by it that he was obliged to build a gally and maintain it at his own charge plutarch condemns him for his unactive and recluse way of life and sets him in a very pedantick light that he sat poring at home in his study when every body else was in arms that instead of sharpening his sword and his spear and brightning up his helmet he was adapting ranging and polishing his words and sentences and that he was three olympiads in composing his panegyric one single oration how says he would that man have been terrified at the clattering of weapons or the routing of a phalanx who was so afraid of suffering one vowel to clash with another or to pronounce a word where the syllables were uneven but notwithstanding this piece of raillery he was generally respected and admired not only as a perfect master in his profession but as a thorough wellwisher to his country  the enemies of demosthenes were not wanting on this occasion to accuse him as the author of their misfortunes but the generality of the people still retained their former good opinion of him the conduct of demosthenes approved and not only acquitted him of all that had been laid to his charge but restored him to the management of their affairs and put themselves wholly under his care and guidance to provide for their future security as a further instance of their regard for him they pitched upon him as the most proper person to speak the funeral oration upon the interment of the slain nothing could be a stronger mark of their approbation of his services than the appointing him who had advised the war to celebrate the memory of those who were killed in it and it is mentioned to the honor of the people likewise that contrary to their usual practice they had distinguished so rightly in the present case of demosthenes and judged of him according to the zeal and intention of his service and not according to the success  this defeat was attributed chiefly to the ill conduct of the generals lysicles put to death lysicles and chares the former whereof the athenians put to death t the instance of lycurgus who had great credit and influence with the people but was a seere judge and a most bitter accuser you lysicles said he was general of the army a thousand citizens are slain two thousand taken primers a trophy has been erected to the dishonor f this city and all greece is enslaved you had the command when all these things happened and yet you dare to live and view the light of the um and blush not to appear publicly in the forum  lysicles who are born the monument of your countrys shame character of lycurgus the orator this lycurgus was one of the orators of the first rank and free from the general corruption which then reigned among them he managed the public treasure for twelve years with great uprightness and had all his life long the reputation of a man of honor and virtue he increased the shipping supplied the arsenal drove the bad men out of the city and framed several good laws he kept an exct register of every thing he did during his administration and when that was expired he caused it to be fixed up to a pillar that every body might be at liberty to inspect it and to censure his conduct he carried this point so far that in his last sickness he ordered himslef to be carried to the senate house to give a public account of all his actions and after he had refuted one who accused him there he went home and died notwithstanding the austerity of his temper he was a great encourager of the stage which though it had been carried to a excess that was mainfestly hurtful to the public he still looked upon as the best school to instru and polish the minds of the people and this end he kept up a spirit to emulation mong the writers of tragedy and erected t statues of aeschylus sophocles and euripides  left three sons who were unworthy of him an behaved so ill that they were all put in prison but demosthenes out of regard to the memory  their father got them discharged  it does not appear and of chares that chares underwent an prosecution for his share in this action tho according to his general character he deserved  as much or more than his colleague for he had no talents for command and was very little different from a common soldier timotheus sai of him that instead of being a general he was fitter to carry the generals baggage his person indeed was of that robust kind of make and  was that which served in some measure to recommend him to the people but he was more man of pleasure than fatigue in his militar expeditions he was wont to carry with him band of music and he defrayed the expenc of it out of the soldiers pay notwithstanding his want of abilities he had a thorough goo opinion of himself he was vain and positiv bold and boisterous a great undertaker an always ready to warrant success but his p formances seldom answered and hence it wa that charess promises became a proverb and yet as little as he was to be depended on he had his partisans among the people and among the orators by whose means he got himself to be frequently employed and others to be excluded who were more capable as he had no true merit of his own he could the less bear it in those who had this was the grounds of his malicious charge against iphicrates and timotheus and the manner in which it was carried on has already been mentioned as a reproach to the commonwealth in short he was a bad man as well as a bad officer and did very little real service or honor to his country either at home or abroad  this year olymp   0   the death and character of timoleon being the last of the hundred and tenth olympiad died timoleon he had some time before lost his sight which he bore very patiently and the syracusians to alleviate his affliction and to show their respect and gratitude to him went in great numbers to visit him and carried with them all the strangers in those parts to entertain them with the sight of their great benefactor notwithstanding his blindness he continued to the last to give his attention to the public when any matter of moment came before the assembly he was conducted to the theater in a sort of carr and was ushered in with the joyful acclamations and benedictions of the people and when he had delivered his opinion they were always determined by it he was buried at the charge of the public with great pomp and with a general lamentation and anniversary games were in stituted to do honor to his memory tha which endeared him so much to the syracusians besides the great things he had done for them was his living and dying among them as their common father and as a native of sicily without regard to the honors and applause that he might have received upon his return to greece but he was a wise and moderate man as well as valiant and fortunate he knew where to stop and how to enjoy the fruits of his conquests there is hardly an instance of any other grecian who after such success went quietly to his grave without exposing himself further so as to fall a sacrifice either to his own ambition or to the insolence and ingratitude of his countrymen plutarch observes a remarkable difference between the achievements of timoleon and those of his contemporaries that in those of timotheus agesilaus pelopidas and even of epaminondas who was the pattern that timoleon copied after there was a certain stiffness labor and struggling which took off from the merit and luster of them but that those of timolcon were like the poetry of homer and the painting of nicomachus which besides the strength and beauty that they had in common with others were more free and easy more gracesul and more masterly we can never too much admire and extol the easy progress that he made with an handful of men in sicily by driving out the tyrants dispersing the numerous fleets and armies of the carthaginians and taking syracuse one of the strongest cities of the world and which had so long withstood all the power of athens though it must be confessed that it was not so well fortified nor so well defended now as in the time of the peloponnesian war but though his actions were so generally applauded it happened once that two of the syracusians who were popular speakers brought a charge against him for some part of his conduct as general and one of em demanded that he should give security for his appearance which the people were highly offended at as thinking that in his case the ordinary forms of justice ought to be dispensed with but he would not suffer himself to be exempted from a due observance of the laws which he had taken so much pains to enforce against others however when the matter came to be heard he treated it as a piece of calumny and instead of going about to refute it he only thanked the gods that they had granted his request for that he had lived to see the syracusians now at liberty to say whatever they thought fit he lest them in full possession of the liberty both of speaking and acting and they enjoyed it about twenty years till the ill use they made of it gave rise to the tyranny of agathocles who brought them again into their former condition  the battle of cheronea was so decisive tha from thence we may date the downfall of the liberties of greece for though philip did not pursue his advantage so far as might naturally have been expected yet the terror of his arms kept the whole country in awe and paved the way to its more entire subjection philip proposes an expedition against persia the point which he had in view and which he had long formed in his thoughts was an expedition against persia and as this was not easily to be carried on without the assistance of the grecians he engaged them under a pretense of revenging the wrongs they had received from the barbarians to join with him in it and got himself to be declared their captain general and is declared captain general which was a principal motive with him in this undertaking  but whilst he was making the necessary preparations for this war he was diverted from it by the affairs of his family he suffered great uneasiness with his wife olympias he divorces olympias who was of a turbulent jealous and revengeful temper and had also given him strong suspicions of her chastity insomuch that though there was no formal proof against her he made it a pretense to divorce her marries cleopatra and married cleopatra a very beautiful young woman and niece to attalus one of his principal officers attalus was transported with the honor done to his family and being heated with wine at the marriage feast said publicly the macedonians ought now to invoke the gods that the new queen might bring philip a lawful successor alexander who was before disgusted at the treatment his mother had met with was now more thorougly provoked at that which so nearly concerned himself what said he do you then take me for a bastard and in a rage threw his cup at him which attalus returned philip who sat at another table was so incensed at what had passed uarrels with his son alexander that he drew his sword and run at his son as the disturber of the feast but being lame he fell down and gave the company time to interpose but alexander was not to be pacified they had much ado to keep him from destroying himself he was so far from submitting himself to his father that he rallied him upon his fall in troth said he the macedonians are mighty well fitted with a general to conduct them out of europe into asia who is not able to go from one table to another without danger of breaking his neck with this sarcasm he quitted the room and retired to illyrium having first carried his mother to epirus but this affair was afterward made up by means of demaratus a corinthian who being in great credit and confidence with philip made him sensible that he had gone too far in his resentment against his son and thereupon was sent to bring him back  philip soon after this accident met with another of the same kind which proved more fatal to him the marriage of his daughter cleopatra this happened upon the marriage of his daughter cleopatra with alexander king of epirus and brother of olympias philip to add to the solemnity of the nuptials and to do himself honor upon his intended expedition which he had still very much at heart made a most magnificent entertainment and invited all the most considerable men of greece taking this opportunity to testify his gratitude for their having chosen him their general the several cities from whence they came were not wanting on their part to compliment him on the occasion and to flatter his vanity they vyd with one another in sending him crowns of gold and athens was not less zealous and devoted to him than the rest the next day after the feast there were public shows to be exhibited and philip went in great pomp to assist at them being dressed in a white robe and his nobles and guards attending him in the form of a procession there were carried before him twelve images of the gods of exquisite sine workmanship and a thirteenth was added which was more splendid than the rest and was to represent himself as one among the number of the deities but in the height of the solemnity amidst the joyful acclamations of a numberless crowd of spectators from all parts and just as his statue entered the theater the ceremony was interrupted by pausanias a young macedonian nobleman he had some time before been grossly affrnoted by attalus who after he had made him drunk carnally abused him and then prostituted him to others pausanias made his complaint to the king and demanded justice but philip did not care to hearken to an accusation against the queens uncle the young man renewed his suit and was so importunate for redress that at last philip to pacify him gave him a commission of the first rank in his guards pausanias did not look upon this as a satisfaction for the injury he had received and though he stifled his revenge for some time he took the present occasion of executing it in the most public manner upon the person of the king philip had ordered his guards both before and behind to keep at a proper distance from him so as to leave him room enough to appear more conspicuously to the people and as he marched alone in that intermediate space pausanias made up to him drew his dagger and stabbed him philip killed by pausanias and left him dead upon the spot  pausanias had horses ready for his escape and had like to have succeeded in it but one of his feet being hampered in a vinc he was taken and cut to pieces olympias is said to have provided the horses for this purpose olympias accessory to the murder and was looked upon not only as privy to the murder but as the chief promoter of it neither was alexander himself quite free from suspicion but his mother was so far from concealing the part she had in it that she affected to make it public and was only afraid lest the proofs should not appear strong enough against her the very night she went to assist at the kings funeral she caused a crown of gold to be put upon the head of pausanias whilst he was hanging upon a cross some days after she buried him and erected a tomb for him and appointed an anniversaryday to be kept in honor of his memory she likewise consecrated the dagger with which he committed the fact then she turned her rage against cleopatra for whom she had been divorced and having murdered her infant child at her breast caused her to be hanged from these and several other instances which might be given of her cruelty and revenge it may easily be believed that she was more than consenting to the assassination of the king and that she made use of the resentment of pausanias to satisfy her own  the news of philips death was a joyful surprise in greece and particularly in athens where the people crowned themselves with garlands the manner in which the news of philip s death was received at athens and decreed a crown to pausanias they sacrificed to the gods for their deliverance and sung songs of triumph as if philip had been slain by them in battle but this excess of joy did ill become them it was looked upon as an ungenerous and unmanly insult upon the ashes of a murdered prince and of one whom they just before had revered and crouchd to in the most abject manner these immoderate transports were raised in them by demosthenes who having the first intelligence of philips death went into the assembly unusually gay and cheerful with a chaplet on his head and in a rich habit though it were then but the seventh day after the death of his daughter from this circumstance plutarch at the same time that he condemns the behavior of the athenians in general upon this occasion takes an handle to justify demosthenes and extols him as a patriot for not suffering his domestic afflictions to interfere with the goodfortune of the commonwealth but he certainly might have acted the part of a good citizen with more decency and composure and more to the honor of himself and his country  this accident happened to philip in the forty seventh year of his age a m      olymp       and the twenty fifth of his reign during which time he was constantly in action till by degrees he changed the whole face of affairs both in greece and macedonia the steps by which he advanced his character were firm and sure but withal so slow and imperceptible that he seemed to have no great share of ambition and yet in reality nobody had more but nobody had it so much under command nor knew so well how to disguise it it was varnished over as as his actions in general were with false colors it had the appearance of justice and humanity and beneficence to mankind in protecting the innocent redressing the injured and extirpating tyranny but his acts of this kind were only plausible methods of advancing his own grandeur and authority and of subverting the public liberty under a pretense of defending it  he was admirably well qualified for the part he acted for he had an equal mixture of fire and phlegm which served to correct each other the first put him upon forming great designs and the latter conducted him in the execution of them so that his success was owing chiefly to this due temperament which made him cautious without fear and bold without rashness when he had taken his point he kept it always in view and concealed it from every body else for he trusted no body further than was necessary he had favorites but no confidents he was his own minister his own general and his own treasurer and as he had all the capacity vigilance and activity which these several offices required he was entirely master of his own schemes and of the execution of them which demosthenes takes notice of as a particular advantage that he had over the athenians by being so secret in his deliberations and so uncontrolled in his actions and the case was much the same in the other republics where matters of the most secret importance were canvassd and debated in their popular assemblies the resolutions taken upon those debates were made public and the hands of those who were to executed them were tied up and by these means they generally lost their effect especially with regard to philip who knew so well the constitution of greece and the use that was to be made of such a method of proceeding  he looked upon all means of attaining his ends to be justifiable and he had expedients of all kinds and for all occasions he knew all the different ways that were to lead him to his mark but he generally chose that which was most dark and intricate and out of the common road he loved feints and stratagems for the pleasure of deceiving and he valued himself less upon the success of a battle than of a negotiation for which reason he seldom employed force till his artifices failed him and yet when he found himself obliged to have recourse to arms no body behaved with more bravery and intrepidity nor with better conduct plutarch therefore bears too hard upon him when speaking of him by way of comparison with epaminondas he says he had none of the principal virtues of that great man and among his other defects mentions his want of courage but there does not appear to be the least foundation for this charge and it has been refuted by his greatest enemy demosthenes who describes him with his eye out his collarbone broke his hand and his leg maimed and then adds that he had seen this philip thus wounded from head to foot still ready to throw himself into the midst of dangers and to sacrifice the rest of his body in the further pursuit of glory  he infused the same spirit into his soldiers who were so animated by his example and so inured to action that he could always depend on them he had also a way of gaining their affections he would call them his comrades and treat them otherwise with great familiarity and he did it in such a manner as neither to lessen his authority nor relax the discipline they were grown so hardy and expert under him that the macedonian troops were reckoned at this time almost as much superior to the grecians as the grecians were to the persians these were the men whom clytus afterward reproached alexander with when he told him it was his fathers troops by which he had conquered alexander was too sensible of the truth of it and it cost the old man his life  if philip had been equal in other respects to what he was in the field he had made a glorious figure but his tricks and subterfuges and deep dissimulation his gross bribery trea chery and breach of faith which make up the main of his character have cast such a shade over his real good qualities that they are hardly to be distinguished and have given occasion to call even his military virtues in question but in that respect he was undoubtedly superior to all the captains of his time and he had otherwise great talents he had a fine understanding with a strong and clear judgment great prudence and foresight great variety of learning and other acquired knowledge he spoke and wrote with great ease propriety and dignity but with too much art and subtilty for there was design and insincerity in every thing he said whether he were in jest or in earnest he always promised more than he intended to perform and he had as little regard to his oath as to his promise to this purpose he had a saying that children were to be cheated with playthings and men with oaths and yet notwithstanding this impious maxim of his he made a great show of religion and it was that which gained him his first footing in greece in the phocian war among his other arts of hypocrisy by which he imposed upon the world we may reckon that of his being attended every morning by a servant to put him in mind of his mortality his friendships were governed wholly by his interest they were only mercenary engagements that he had entered into with bad men and for bad ends and when they had served his purpose he had done with them this was the case of most of his agents who sold their country to him he paid them their price and then discarded them for he loved the treason but not the traytor of which there was a memorable instance in his treatment of the two magistrates who betrayed olynthus to him when they found themselves universally scouted and contemned for that act of treachery and even by the common soldiers in his own army they applied to him for protection and redress but he gave them a very short answer and a very cutting one o said he you must not mind what such blunt fellows say who call every thing by its own name he had a particular faculty of setting two friends at variance and by that means of getting into their confidence and this was his main artifice in the carrying on his designs against greece by sowing jealousies fomenting quarrels and playing one state against another and when he had by these methods broke into their alliances and separated their interests the remaining part was not difficult his hardest task was with the athenians with whom he was continually either fighting or treating and though they had till his time the reputation of a more resined wit than their neighbors and of more sagacity penetration and attention to their interests yet he found means to amuse and confound them to delude and insatuate them to corrupt and divide them  he was not so taken up in the pursuit of his ambition but that he found time for his pleasures wherein he indulged himself in a very dissolute and licentious manner and in this part of his life he acted openly and without reserve he loved riot and drunkenness and intemperance of all kinds and encouraged them so much in others that he was surrounded with a set of lewd parasites and debauchees players buffoons and pantomimes who engrossed all his favors and shared all his bounty but amidst these excesses he had or affected to have some sense of shame so that when he had committed any acts of violence or injustice he would easily bear reproof and often repair the injury there was a woman who put her self in his way after he had been sitting long at table and demanded justice of him he heard her case and determined against her then said she i will appeal what from your king said philip and who is it you would appeal to to philip when he is sober she replied whereupon he examined the afsair over again and finding he had given a wrong judgment made a new one in her favor another woman had long solicited an audience of him upon a like occasion and being put off from time to time with a pretense that he was not at leisure she could bear no longer but said to him if you have not time to do me justice cease to be king he was so far from resenting her manner of reproaching him that he immediately redressed her grievance and from thenceforwards he became more exact in giving audience to his subjects there was another instance of a good sort of man whom he was advised to banish for having spoken ill of him no said philip let me consider first whether i have not given him occasion for it and being afterward informed that he had never given him any mark of his favor and that he was in bad circumstances he relieved him when the man had tasted of his bounty he changed his note and spoke as much in his praise which gave occasion to philip to make another reflection that kings have it in their own power to be beloved or hated he has given several other proofs of his swallowing injuries as longinus calls it and some remarka instances of his clemency and forbearan have been already mentioned in the recit of his actions  thus by a mixture of some good qualities with a great many bad ones he accomplished his ends so far at least that he had thoroughly opened the way to the destruction of the liberties of greece and laid the foundation of all his sons glory and if the actions of each of them be duly weighed it will be found that philips part was the more difficult of the two for it was certainly easier to conquer asia with the assistance of the grecians than to break the power of the grecians who had so often beat the asiaticks wherefore we may venture to pronounce that though alexander was the greater conqueror philip was the greater man however they were both formed for the task they undertook if philip had lived to pass over into asia his artful and deliberate valor would not in all likelihood have had so good an effect there as the heroic ardour and impetuosity of his son which bore down every thing that opposed him and which carried him on with such rapidity through the whole body of the persian empire but however philip might have succeeded in that expedition it seems pretty extraordinary that he should think of entering upon it before he had made a more entire conquest of greece which was certainly his original plan and the point in which all his other views centered and his success at cheronea had given him the airest prospect he ever had of subduing the whole country it had put the athenians and the thebans so far in his power that they were expecting every hour to have his yoke imposed on them as to the spartans though they had avoided entering into the quarrel it is hardly to be supposed they would tamely have submitted to him after the battle he wrote them an haughty letter to try how they would relish his authority but in answer to it their king archidamus the son of agesilaus sent him word that if he measured his shadow he would find it no bigger after his victory than it was before the answer they sent him to another letter of the same kind was dionysius to corinth however they were not in a condition singly to make head against him and the other subordinate states were so weak and disunited and withal so indolent and remiss that there was no immediate appearance of forming any considerable league against him but whether he thought the grecians were still too formidable for him to act in open defiance of them and that his show of moderation and humanity and his arts of insinuation were easier and safer methods of gaining further ground upon them or whether he really contented himself with the having humbled them and with the honor of presiding in their great council and of leading them forth to battle under the title of their general it is certain that he did not pursue his first scheme of conquest against them nor make use of the advantages that he had then in his hands he had still lest them in a condition to recover their former liberty if they had had any remains of their former spirit but that was so broken and decayed that they became an easy prey to his successors  index a a brocomas a persian general
