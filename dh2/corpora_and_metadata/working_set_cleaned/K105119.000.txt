an essay concerning the effects of air on human bodies  an essay concerning the effects of air on human bodies  by john arbuthnot md fellow of the royal colleges of physicians of london and edinburgh and of the royal society  london printed for j tonson in the strand mdccxxxiii  the preface in the preface to my essay on the nature and choice of aliment i promised to treat the other nonnaturals air rest and motion after the same manner i now choose to perform my task imperfectly rather than break my word  air is the next in order which reflecting what a share it has in all animal operations i am of opinion has not been as yet sufficiently considered as to the physiology of its effects philosophers mathematicians chemists the professors of agriculture and gardening have attended to the effects of air on the subjects of their several arts more than the physicians the reason of which neglect may be that air is one of those ingesta or things taken inwardly which neither can be forborne nor measured in doses but the use of air being unavoidable is no reason against inquiring into its effects besides it is incumbent upon the professors of our art to know and assign as far as they can the true causes of the changes which happen in human bodies and there are many more useless inquiries than this about the effects of air which are daily the subject of human curiosity but though abstinence from air is not the sort of air which they use is in the power of a great many people and as the choice of air is a subject about which a physicians advice is often demanded its nature and different qualities is a proper one of his studies and it seems preposterous that there should be so many minute inquiries about the qualities of every drug which we take but seldom and none into the effects of a substance that we take inwardly every moment  the most famous physicians have observed with great assiduity the effects of air in the economy of diseases and none perhaps with so much accuracy as the first founder of our art the great hippocrates air is the  in diseases which he takes notice of air is what he means by the powers of the universe which he says human nature cannot overcome and he lays it down as a maxim de aere locis and aquis that whoever intends to be master of the art of physic must observe the constitution of the year that the powers and influence of the seasons what are seldom uniform produce great changes in human bodies dr sydenham endowed with the genius of hippocrates has left us epidemicks wrote upon the model of those of hippocrates containing a history of acute diseases as depending upon the constitution of the season some eminent physicians in italy and germany have imitated dr sydenham and a society of learned and ingenious gentlemen of the profession at edinburgh are now pursuing the same scheme i was so uninquisitive as not to have seen till my essay was almost finished an excellent performance in the same way the nosological commentary of dr clifton winteringham conprehending the history of epidemical diseases with a journal of the weather in the city of york from      to      my misfortune in not seeing it sooner was lessened in some degree by finding some of my reasonings confirmed by observations  in an oration i made some years ago before the college of physicians i recommended the keeping a journal of the weather and reigning diseases as a thing which might be of singular use especially to posterity i have had the pleasure to see this executed by the learned and industrious professor mussenberg with such an elegant contrivance and so nice an accuracy in his meteorological tables that if the design is pursued for many years it may perhaps reduce the physiology of the air to a science  as for the following essay i propose it only as a model of something more perfect to be done afterward by an abler pen upon the same subject it contains at least a methodical disposition of the several heads of inquiry in reasoning upon this part of the physiology of the air in compiling it i purposely avoided turning over a great many books or considering any thing indeed but matter of fact upon which i founded my reasonings and i ought to beg pardon for the presumption of the attempt rather than say any thing for the merit of the work in excuse for the imperfections inaccuracies and perhaps mistakes that are in it i have the following particulars to plead that a great part of it was wrote with frequent interruptions in small portions of time and some things from my memory that weariness in thinking about the same subject incident to me perhaps with others of mankind made me abandon several particulars too soon that i did not know any friend who had studied the subject enough to give me advice and therefore i now set it before every body who is capable of putting me right and i shall be far from thinking that he that corrects refutes me if there be any inaccuracies in the numbers they will not invalidate the reasoning i think i may venture so far as to affirm that he who reads the whole over with due attention will find it not quite an useless speculation  the contents chap i

air is not visible what we see in the stream of light let in by a small aperture into a room is not air but dust and other bodies floating in the air air is sensible to the touch by its motion and by its resistance to bodies moved in it  ii air is the principal instrument of nature in all its operations on and within the surface of the earth except magnetism and gravity no vegetable nor animal terrestrial nor aquatic can be produced live or grow without air eggs cannot be hatched nor vegetables grow in a void water purged of air will not make plants vegetate at least very slowly and that only by some quantity of air that is left in the water air is the chief instrument in the economy of fossils all operations natural and artificial on fossils depend upon air for without the assistance of air fire and heat cease in a word air is the principal instrument in the generation accretion resolution and corruption of all terrestrial bodies for it enters into the composition of all fluids and solids all of which generate or produce air in great quantities oak has generated of its weight in air pease as much indian wheat substances oily and tenacious either do not produce it so much or part not with it so easily as honey which does not yield    or beeswax which yields     minerals yield a great quantity of air new castle coal of its weight antimony about    times its bulk acid spirits in solution of metals generate great quantities those who desire to know more of this subject may consult the vegetable staticks of the ingenious and industrious mr hales animal substances are replete with air more than any other blood will generate    times its bulk of air and solid animal substances yield more air than the fluids a human calculus or stone yields more than     times its bulk of air but of this more afterward at present we will briefly enumerate the most considerable contents of this wonderful fluid the air near the surface of the earth in which all animals live and breathe contains the steams effluvia and all the abrasions of bodies on the surface of the earth when they are so small and light as to float in it from whence it is evident that the contents of it must be different in different places of the surface of the earth  iii i shall not enter into a dispute about the nature of fire but if it be an element that pervades all the space of the universe as the learned boerhaave imagines air must contain its proportion of this element  iv air contains water which is daily exhaled and daily falls from the air a surface of water exposed to the air evaporates an inch in    days a surface of earth with a summer heat evaporates about an inch in  0 days which water when the air is overcharged with it is returned again and falls upon the surface of the earth in rain and dew which by observation in this part of the terraqueous globe at a medium in a year makes about    inches of rain and   inches of dew the dew falls chiefly when the sun is down and near double the quantity in a winter of what falls in a summers night thus it is plain that there is a great quantity of water constantly floating in the air and many other experiments demonstrate the same  v fixed alkaline dry salts attract and are dissolved by the watery particles of the air so as to increase in weight from    to    in three days and this effect may be carried on so as to quadruple the weight   ounce of salt of tartar making   ounces of oil of tartar per deliquium only by attraction of water from the air reckoning a cubical inch of air to weigh    of a grain the additional weight of   ounces would make  0 0 cubical inches of air near   cubical feet there are many consequences which seem paradoxical to be drawn from this experiment for example that the most ponderous of liquors except mercury should be made of salt and air that of salt and water drawn from the air there should be made a liquor of greater specific gravity than the mixture of the ingredients for the oil of tartar per deliquium is in weight to water as   to   and one part of salt of tartar with three parts of water will make a liquor which is to water as   to   what naturally follows from the experiment is that either there is a great quantity of water in the air or that the water attracted by the salt is drawn from a great quantity of air  vi the air is perhaps most charged with water when it is clear for when the air is heaviest the vapors ascend the highest but when they are highest they are more eluted and better mixed with the particles of air they ascend at least as high as the tops of the highest mountains by the clouds and snow that are seen there and where the vapors often form springs when the watery vapors turn a little heavier than the air they gather into smoke or clouds which when their weight cannot be any more sustained by the air fall down in a thin rain and these particles by falling from greater heights unite and form great drops of rain and when frozen by the extreme coldness of the air snow and hail but the manner of generation of these fruits of the air is foreign to my present subject when by the weight of the air the vapors ascend highest and are most intimately mixed with the air the lower region in which we breathe may be said to be dry in respect to human bodies  vii dew is another ingredient of air dew is not mere water but a composition of all the watery volatile oily saline vapors which exhale from the earth which as long as they are agitated by the sun are not to be seen but as soon as the air cools they become visible the air being a rare body cools much sooner than the earth which continues still to sweat out this substance after the sun is down and by the cold of the night a great deal of it falls down again in the form of water for you may observe when there is no wind there is always to be seen a coat of this vapor near the surface of the earth this dew is a collection of all the substances that transpire from that spot of earth and consequently very different in different places which is the reason as the learned boerhaave observes that the chemists can never agree about the contents of it because their experiments are made upon the dews of different places and consequently of different contents in some places it contains highly volatile and explosive particles so that in distillation it has broke the glass in others it has stained the glass with the colors of the rainbow which nothing could take out maydew being let stand to putrify will gather a fat substance like cream atop with vegetables and insects of different sorts the seeds of the one and eggs of the other being exhaled there is an account of dew falling in some places in the form of butter or grease which grows extremely foetid abridgment of the philosophical transactions vol ii p      so that the analysis of the dew of any place may perhaps be the best method of finding such contents of the soil as are within the reach of the heat of the sun  viii the air likewise contains the watery exhalations with the fragrant and volatile spirit of all vegetables spicy odours are smelt at great distances from the countries where the spices grow the quantity of these exhalations of vegetables must be very considerable in summer by experiments of the most ingenious and industrious mr hales a vine perspires in a day      of an inch over its whole surface a sunflower      a cabbage      an apple tree   0  which is at a medium      of an inch in a day or a whole inch in     days the duration of the summer by an experiment of the same ingenious gentleman a hopyard of an acre of ground perspires as much as would cover the whole acre an inch in  0  days an inch of this perspirable watery substance rarified into air would make as one might call it a vegetable atmosphere of    feet high in the summer the ground is covered over with vegetables even the grass exposes a great surface to the sun and is not without perspiration the heat arising from vegetable perspiration is very sensible in a hot day near a field of corn upon this single account of the perspiration of vegetables the air of the summer must be very different from that of the winter the odours of some plants have very sensible effects upon many people the oils salts seeds and the insensible abrasions of vegetables float in the air the production of plants in some places where the plants were not indiginous has puzzled philosophers perhaps it may be accounted for from the two methods of propagating plants the seed and the slip both may float in the air as the bigness of the slip from whence the plant is propagated is not determined who can say but the insensible abrasions of a plant may produce it this by the way  ix earth is another content of the air earth calcined flies off into the air the ashes of burning mountains in vulcanos will be carried to great distances  x salts of all kinds are another ingredient of air fixed fossile salts may be digested rendered volatile and evaporate in air markasites attract vitriolick salts from the air vitriol stones must be exposed to the air to produce vitriol alum robbed of its salt recovers it in the air there may be obtained nitrous salts from old walls in most places the air either supplying these salts as an ingredient or producing them as an agent in some countries the air will corrode the bricks and tiles in places abounding with markasites vitriolick salts disperse themselves through the air which has been observed to rot the hangings of rooms and lie upon the surface of the ground like a white efflorescence there are in the air likewise the particles of all minerals gold the heaviest of them can be rendered volatile and quicksilver likewise dr leister imagines thunder to be produced by the exhalations of the pyrites there is indeed something very remarkable in great thunders having sometimes changed the polarity of the needle all the fumes which are raised by natural or artificial fires vanish into air the poisonous steams of mines produce the same effects as they would do in distillations all the smoke of culinary fires and steams of fermenting liquors vanish in the air and make up a part of the contents of that in which we breathe  xi another ingredient of the air is the perspirable matter of animals the perspiration of a man is about     of an inch in    hours all over the surface of the body consequently one inch in    days the surface of the skin of a middle sized man is about    square feet consequently the surface of the skins of   0  such men would cover an acre of ground and the perspird matter would cover that acre of ground   inch deep in    days which rarified into air would make over that acre an atmosphere of the steams of their bodies near    foot high the great quantity of animal substances which are in the air appears further from this that all excrements and all the carcases of animals vanish into air of those that are burnt very soon of those that are exposed later of those that are buried in length of time but all the parts of the carcases at last vanish into air except perhaps a small quantity of bones into earth eggs of insects float in the air boerhaave  flesh hung up by a thread where no fly could come was filled with maggots the caterpillars and other insects which so suddenly eat up the leaves of trees perhaps are produced by the eggs of those insects floating in the air at least one does not easily perceive how they could be lodged in the plants themselves in africa there are showers which affect the bodies of men with rigors the drops are found to have insects in them and perhaps there are insects in the air invisible to human eyes one may observe in that part of a room which is illuminated with the rays of the sun flies sometimes darting like hawks as it were upon a prey  xii sulphurs arise from many parts of the earth in great quantities in mines there are fumes stinking oily inflammable these sulphurous exhalations combined with some salts or mettalline particles produce explosions and all the effects of gunpowder in earthquakes thunder etc there are instances after thunder of sulphurous burning showers some of these sulphurous steams seem to rise by a projectile motion to great heights so they do likewise in vacuo with a great celerity this appears by meteors such as that in the year      which dr halley has proved by observations to be  0 miles high of a mile diameter and run  00 miles in a minute there must have been air to propagate the sound of the explosion of that meteor which was heard in some places though the air at that height was  0000 times rarer than that near the surface of the earth it seems it was capable of producing sounds the coruscations which have often of late appeared in this country seemed to be of the same nature particularly that remarkable one      in those coruscations one might observe the sulphurous steams rise from the earth with a projectile motion to a great height and being consumed have not discovered any ill effect upon human bodies  xiii the air near the surface is charged with all those heterogeneous particles and many others not possible to enumerate and yet the wise author of nature has tempered this heterogeneous mixture so as to make it salubrious to the animals that live in it except in a few accidental cases and perhaps pure air without any of those contents is unfit to sustain animals and vegetables to make this element wholesome the wise author of nature has so ordered that the whole mass is never overcharged with those contents for example since human bodies are so contrived as not to bear excesses of any kind as too much dryness or too much fluidity there is a constant circulation of the water in the air and the air of any place contains very near the same quantity of it the action of the sun or the sum of all its force upon the same surface of land and water and the heat of the surface of the earth within the year is pretty near uniform and consequently the quantity of evaporation the same the air has a power of imbibing and sustaining only a certain quantity of this water and the sum of the quantity that falls from the air over the whole surface of the earth in rain snow or hail is the same though by accidental causes of winds and the stoppage of the clouds by tracts of mountains more of these vapors may be carried and fall in one place than another this water is again carried by its natural gravity in streams to the sea and other reservoirs of water and from thence again exhaled only there is left a sufficient quantity for the nutrition of plants and animals the moisture of whose bodies is again exhaled and this circulation is constantly maintained only there remains one doubt that the solid parts of animals vegetables and perhaps of fossils being mostly produced from watery fluids and some quantity of those solid parts not being by the common powers of nature convertible again into water whether the solids of the earth do not gain upon the fluids the first increasing and the second decreasing the economy is the same in the other contents of the air the perspirable matter of vegetables and animals the oils salts and sulphurs fall down again and repair the bodies that are on or near the surface of the earth  xiv nature makes use of all possible ways to preserve this heterogeneous fluid in a wholesome state the ingredients are digested and attenuated by heat they are stirred and constantly agitated by winds which mix the air of different regions together there are fermentations succeeded by violent motions and explosions in lightning and thunder and imitable by the mixture of like ingredients in chemical operations in those storms the redundant and noxious sulphurous particles are consumed there are instances of some places becoming habitable by earthquakes and inundations that were not so before the perspiration of the earth is by turns stopped and restored there are congelations of the redundant water precipitations and many other operations unknown to art producing a great variety of effects air is the instrument of all those operations when performed by art and those heterogeneous bodies act upon one another in the air it self by many unconceivable ways many experiments and observations demonstrate the mutual action of bodies floating in the air upon their approach some chemical processes will succeed in one sort of air which will be attempted in vain in another tartarus regeneratus can be made only in a laboratory where they distill vinegar it is impossible to conceive the result of all such operations in a heterogeneous mixture mankind may be sensible of their effects but can never know their nature  xv though nature preserves the mass of this fluid in a wholesome state it must necessarily happen that the air of particular regions seasons and places may differ very much in their proportions of the mixture of the ingredients enumerated and such air must affect human bodies variously by such excesses or defects too great moisture affect human bodies with one class of diseases and too great dryness with another the powers of human bodies being limited and intolerant of excesses of any kind air replete with the steams of animals especially of such as are rotting has often produced pestilential fevers in that place of which there are many instances as that mentioned by ambrose paree      raised by carcases thrown into a ditch such have likewise been raised by great quantities of dead locusts and by dead whales the steams of great quantities of corrupted vegetables have produced the same effects in their neighborhood the effluvia of human live bodies are extremely corruptible the water in which human creatures bathe by keeping smells cadaverous by n xi of this chapter less than three thousand human creatures living within the compass of an acre of ground would make an atmosphere of their own steams about    feet high which if not carried away by winds would turn pestiferous in a moment from whence it may be inferred that the very first consideration in building of cities is to make them open airy and well perflated pestilential constitutions have been often preceded by great calms from hence the air of prisons produces often mortal distempers and ships crews turn sickly in bays and harbors which would be healthy in the open sea it ought to be the principal care of such as attend hospitals to give a thorough passage to the air since the putrescent parts of carcases buried under ground by no xi are carried off though slowly into the air whether this is not an objection against burying in churches and whether it is not proper that all burying places should be without cities in the open air by what was observed no viii the air of the summer differs considerably from that of winter in summer the air is replete with the perspirable matter of vegetables abounding with volatile spirits and oils which perhaps stimulates and exhilirates the spirits and that of some plants is too powerful for some people who cannot support the smell of some of them  xvi it follows from observations no xi that the air of great cities differs considerably from that of the country there is more of the perspirable matter of animals which is never entirely blown off there is more of the steams of culinary fires there is a smaller perspiration of the ground by the paving of the streets and consequently as the steams are hurtful or wholesome less effect from them in either case though the air of the country is brought into cities by winds there is always less of the steams of vegetables in cities than in the country  xvii of all contents of air none are more noxious to human bodies than sulphurs the steam of charcoal suffocates in a moment therefore when sulphurous steams are too redundant nature sets them on fire by lightning some people are sensibly affected by the air before thunder and hurricanes in hot countries the benefit which the inhabitants receive from thunderstorms abates the terror of them there are sulphurous vapors which infect the vegetables and render the grass unwholsom to the cattle that feed upon it vid abridgment of philosophical transactions vol ii p   0  miners are often hurt by these steams observations abridgment of phisolosophical transactions vol ii p     made in some of the mines in derbyshire describe four sorts of those damps the first the miners call the common sort perceived at first by the candles burning orbicular and the flame lessening by degrees the effects of it upon human bodies are fainting convulsions suffocation the second is what they call the peasebloom damp which the miners imagine is the steam of a vegetable growing lower than the level the third is the most noxious the miners tell you they see in the highest part of the roof in those passages which branch out from the main groove a round thing of the bigness of a football with a film or skin about it which when broken by accident disperseth it self and suffocates all the company the miners who are but coarse philosophers reckon that is the steam of their own bodies which is not impossible for the oil of this steam may possibly produce this film or coat the fourth is the fulminating damp resembling in its nature and effects gunpowder or that matter which produces thunder when this takes fire it kills by explosion as thunder and gunpowder the remedies of the miners are the same which nature uses in like cases making communication with the whole mass of outward air by shafts perflation with artificial winds and bellows and setting fire to those sulphurous steams after which they are able to go on with their work there are likewise in some deep wells and pits sulphurous steams which will take fire with a candle in some the sulphur is combined with sal ammoniack which does not fulminate sulphur it self is not unfriendly to the lungs and the exhalations from sulphurous spots of earth in the open air are recommended as wholesome as the air about the city of naples but it must be considered those are in the free and open air not too redundant and perhaps unmixed with oother noxious salts which those abovementioned may be replete with it will appear in the following part of this discourse that sulphur destroys the elasticity of the air  xviii metalline acid salts which perspire from certain spots of the earth and by their gravity rise only to a certain height are extremely noxious taken in by the breath they contract the vesicles or immediately coagulate the blood in the capillary vessels which creep along the surfaces of the vesicles of the lungs which have very thin coats and are in immediate contact with the outward air such is that mortiferous steam in the grotto del cane near naples  xix some have imagined the plague to proceed from invisible insects this system agrees with many of the appearances in the progress or manner of propagation of that disease but is altogether inconsistent with others these are a few obvious inferences relating to our subject drawn from the consideration of the contents of the air and considering it as a heterogeneous body many others of the same kind may be made which the brevity in this essay will not admit i proceed to the consideration of the properties of the air  chap ii of the properties of air i the first property of air is fluidity which by no power of art or nature yet known can be destroyed it preserves its fluidity in cold    degrees greater than any natural cold the sparkling which boerhaave observed in air illuminated by the rays of the sun and which he at first imagined to proceed from some congelation of the air he afterward discovered to proceed from watery particles floating in the air no condensation fermentation nor coagulation of mixtures where air resides have ever destroyed its fluidity which quality is absolutely necessary to an element in which vegetables and animals grow no vegetable nor animal can expand its fibers in their natural figure but in a fluid that resists equally the elongation of its fibers the pressure of the atmosphere keeps both vegetables and animal fibers within certain limits of accretion it being always fluid the pressure is equal upon every part of their surfaces therefore if you would give a human creature the due figure which nature affects it must be kept as free as possible from the pressure of any hard body human creatures by being a great part of their time upon their feet which is but a small part of the surface of the whole body acquire a better shape and the feet by bearing the pressure of the whole body grow callous if a human creature were always recumbent it would not take its natural figure confinement by stays or strait clothes must spoil or change the natural shape water being a fluid much denser than air admits supports and keeps together the bodies of larger animals than air can do  ii the particles of air are not discernable by a microscope though they may be larger than the particles of light they do not reflect it in visual angles  iii notwithstanding the minuteness of the particles of air many denser fluids will pass where it cannot oil will enter through leather which excludes air  iv lubricity or divisibility by the smallest force is another property of air by which animals move in it without much resistance if there were experiments of the swiftness of the motion of birds and fishes one could determine the proportion of their force birds and fishes move through their respective element after the same manner fishes are the birds of the water fishes pass through an element  00 times denser than air upon which account they must employ a force proportional to the greater resistance of the mediums on the other hand a great part of the force of birds is employed to support their bodies in a much rarer medium whereas the bodies of fishes are equilibrated with the water in which they swim yet the air has some degree of tenacity whereby the parts attract one another as appears by the spherical figure of bubbles which attract and run into one another at the same time by their elasticity the particles of air in other circumstances seem to have a power of repulsion or flying off from one another those two properties are consistent as we see in light  v the resistance of air is very considerable in bodies moved swiftly through it or by its swift motion against bodies the resistance in the first case increases in the duplicate proportion of the celerity of the moving body that is the resistance is  00 times greater when the celerity is but ten times so therefore if light bodies be moved with a great velocity the resistance of the air will throw them back in another direction air moved with rapidity in violent winds has very sensible effects upon human bodies we see the powerful effects of a large surface of air or wind in moving great bodies and turning engines a stream of air of   square feet near the half of the surface of a human body moved with a velocity of a great wind or    feet in a second of time presses against a human body with a force equal to water moved   feet in a minute to which if you add the celerity of the person moving opposite the pressure is very considerable so that riding or walking against great winds is a great exercise the effects of which are redness and inflammation of the parts exposed to the air all the effects of a soft press or verberation heat and drousiness  vi gravity is another property of air whereby it counterpoises a column of mercury from    inches to  0 the gravity of the atmosphere varying   0 which are its utmost limits so that the exact specific gravity of the air cannot be determined when the barometer stands at  0 inches with a moderate heat of the weather the specific gravity of the air is to that of water about   to  00 and to that of mercury as   to  0 00 dr halleys account of the causes of these variations of the gravity of the air seems very satisfactory for they must either proceed from the air in one time and place being charged with greater or lesser quantities of ponderous contents which by what is said in the foregoing chapter it imbibes plentifully or from being accumulated more in one place than another the airs being accumulated more in one place than another must proceed from the currents of air or winds thus contrary currents of air tending to the same place must accumulate the air in that place and consequently raise the mercury in the barometer as a westerly wind in the atlantic and an easterly in the german ocean two currents of air from the same place must sink the air in that place and consequently the mercury in the barometer this is very possible in liquids and happens even in the motion of the tides if there was always a perfect calm the aequilibrium could only be charged by the greater or smaller quantity of ponderous contents in confirmation of this system it is found where the winds are not variable as near the line the alterations of the baroscope are very small these alterations of the gravity of the air cannot proceed from its letting fall its ponderous contents as in great showers it is true that a heavy body falling through a fluid during its descent does not press upon it but by the resistance which the fluid gives to its motion in descent but the decrease of the weight of the atmosphere during the fall of rain snow or hail is not proportional to this cause nor can be accounted for from it  vii the air being fluid and heavy presses equally upon the surface of a human body with a weight equal to a column of mercury whose basis is equal to the surface of a human body and altitude that of the barometer perhaps in a middlesizd man with a weight of   000 pounds as it is possible for the air to vary   0 in its weight such a human body must be pressed with   00 pound weight more at one time than another and if the height of the mercury varies only one inch there is the difference of above  000 pounds such alterations affect both the fluids and solids very sensibly but as the counterpoise between the air within and that without the body is quickly restored by the free communication that is between them these alterations are suffered without any sensible inconvenience and this indeed proves the ready admission of the external air into the vessels of the body and the escape of aerial particles within the body in each case of the alteration of the gravity of the external air from less to more or more to less for if this aequilibrium was not kept between the external air and that within the body both the fibers and fluids being elastick in the case of an increase of the gravity of the external air the fluids and solids would be too much compressed and in the case of a decrease of this gravity would expand themselves with a dolorous sensation and danger to the life of the animal a fall of the mercury in the barometer is the same with the exsuction of so much air in an airpump in which case we perceive the fluids and solids expand themselves and the animal swells i have observed very sensible effects of sudden falls of the mercury in the barometer in tender people and all the symptoms they would have felt by the exsuction of so much air in an airpump animals in the airpump are relieved of their symptoms in a great measure by voiding of air or wind out of their bodies therefore if these alterations of the air were very sudden and to great degrees they would produce very great and troublesome symptoms in human bodies as the case stands now the variations of the gravity of the air keep both the solids and the fluids in an oscillatory motion synchronous and proportional to their changes and which by the different degrees of tension of the fibers and expansion of the fluids must necessarily affect human bodies variously and produce alterations of which the inhabitants of countries where the mercury in the barometer stands at the same height are not sensible but of this more afterward  viii air is a fluid in constant motion one may perceive in that part of a room which is illuminated by the sunbeams entering at a small hole the bodies floating in the air are in continual motion a constant undulatory motion is perceived by looking through telescopes these undulations of the air affect small and tender bodies yet not so much as to alter their figures when the air enters or escapes out of bodies it does not divide it self at first into its minutest particles but gathers into bubbles and the nature of air is such that the smallest quantity of it has the force of the whole atmosphere by its spring or elasticity of which in the next article if air bubbles are generated in the cavities of the vessels of human bodies they must produce prodigious effects  ix air is likewise compressible and elastick it can be compressed into spaces reciprocally proportional to the incumbent weights and expands it self again in proportion as the compressing force is removed if the weights compressing be as       the spaces into which the air is compressed will be as   consequently the density of the air will increase in direct proportion to the compressing weights therefore as you approach toward the surface of the earth the density of the air increases because of the greater height of the column of incumbent air as you go higher the air expands itself and grows rarer by the force of its spring or elasticity having so much of the incumbent weight taken off were the whole air of equal density the atmosphere would not much exceed the height of   miles and in the ascent of  00 foot the mercury would sink   inch and so on but as i said before the expansion of the air increasing that is the air growing rarer as the incumbent weight is taken off an ascent of     feet from the surface of the earth sinks the mercury   inch but as you ascend higher it requires a greater space of this thinner air to make the mercury sink another inch and that is found to be      feet or more than double the former height and to sink the mercury   inches requires an ascent of      which is more than triple of     the height of   mile is required to sink the mercury     that is about   inches and of an inch at   miles high the mercury will be reduced from  0 inches to      inches that is    inches and near  0 of an inch the height answering to an inch of mercury still increasing in a proportion determined by an easy geometrical calculation of which it would be impertinent to say more because it is equally useless to those who do or do not understand geometry repeating to the first what they know already and endeavoring to teach the others what they cannot comprehend  x from the different density of the air in higher or lower regions the same effects are produced upon the inhabitants of these regions as by the variations of the gravity of the air abovementioned  xi the elasticity of the air is a force equal to its gravity for as i said the smallest bubble of air by its elasticity will counterpoise the whole atmosphere of equal density by those two qualities of gravity and elasticity and the variations of them the air produces great effects upon human bodies by these respiration is performed and the balance kept between the external air and that within the vessels of the body yet i cannot but observe that there is something very hard to be understood in the gravity and elasticity of the air suppose air is in specific gravity to water as   to  00 if there be   00 of water in air the air it self must weight nothing because so much water is equiponderant with the same quantity of water i have seen a summer shower of long duration which has filled a tub   inches perpendicular    feet of water weighs equally with the whole atmosphere   inches of water is of     or      of the weight of the whole atmosphere much more than   00 it would seem that so great a quantity of water could not be at once in the air of that place but must have been collected in clouds from a great quantity of air water is mixed with air in the form of smoke which is perhaps a collection of bubbles with a viscous coat of water about them and are lighter than air but still there is so much water in the air whatever form it is in besides water there are a great many other contents in the air specifically heavier than air if the proportion of those contents is not extremely small air it self must weigh nothing then as to the compressibity of air that must have certain limits and can never go beyond the quantity of water and other incompressible substances that are in air the rarity and density of air has likewise its bounds for if the law of expansion obtained constantly a globe of air of an inch diameter at the distance of a semidiameter of the earth would fill all the space of the planetary regions further than the sphere of saturn as to the density of the air suppose a tube or as the miners call it a shaft were sunk from the surface of the earth to the center within the surface of the earth the gravity of bodies is as the distance from the center yet according to the laws of density by a computation too long to insert here at  0 miles deep air would be denser than mercury and near the center infinitely denser than gold this is an impossible supposition and all the air above and within the earth of the density of mercury would not compose a ring round the surface of the earth of perhaps a yard high therefore the compressibility density and rarity of the air have limits which they cannot exceed  xii true air never loses its elasticity though it exerts it only when collected into a mass by its elasticity it insinuates it self in the spaces of liquors not sufficiently saturated with air and there it remains divided in its minutest parts as it were in a fixed state but when it is expanded by heat or the incumbent pressure is taken off it is collected in greater masses and exerts its elasticity in proportion to the diminution of the incumbent pressure  xiii animal fluids and solids contain more air in them in proportion than perhaps any other substances mr hales hartshorn will yield    of its whole substance or     times its bulk in air a human calculus can be almost all evaporated by fire animal fluids do not contain so much air as the solids but they contain a greater proportion of air than other watery fluids blood contains     part of its weight in air and    times its bulk whereas    inches of wellwater yield but   inch of air supposing the specific gravity of water to be to that of air as  00 to   water contains only     00 of its weight in air bristolwater and holtwater yield much the same proportion as common water but pyrmontwater double the quantity the activity of chalybeat water is owing to some aerial particles in them when these are evaporated they are insipid and without any virtue by the quantity of air which blood and other animal fluids contain they expand themselves to a great degree in an exhausted receiver therefore the variation of the gravity and elasticity of the air which proportionally expand and dilate the liquors with which the external air communicates must have sensible effects upon animal fluids as air is a principal instrument in all the animal economy and therefore a principal ingredient in the composition of animal substances it must in a particular manner affect animal bodies and variously by its changes influence all their operations this only in general  xiv air of double density has double the force for if air of a certain density keeps up the mercury in the barometer    inches the same capacity filled with air of a double density will keep it up    inches heat increases the elasticity of the air  xv the heat of boiling water will augment the force of the spring of the air if the air is shut up or expand it into more of space if it is at liberty if the air be doubly dense the same degree of heat acts with a double force upon it for example if common air keeps up the mercury in the barometer at  0 inches the heat of boiling water will increase its force and make it sustain the mercury at  0 inches but if air is doubly denser the augmentation of the spring by the same degree of heat would be  0 inches and such an air with double the density and the same degree of heat would sustain the mercury  0 inches  0 upon account of its double density and  0 which is the augmentation of of the force by heat so that denser air heated must have great effects such as subterraneous air in great depths for example air  00 times denser with the heat of boiling water would have above     times the force of common air the heat of boiling water will increase the force of the air or expand it more but greater heats as that of melting iron such as may happen in subterraneous places would produce much greater effects the greatest alteration of the density of the air by the difference of heat and cold in our climate does not exceed which is indeed very considerable this by mr hauksbees experiment but there are others in which the difference is greater cold likewise increases the elasticity of the air by increasing its density or weight to which its elastical force is proportional we shall treat more fully in the following part of this essay of these qualities of the air of heat cold moisture and dryness and as they are combined with its properties of gravity and elasticity and of their effects on human bodies  xvi by what has been said of the elasticity of the air and which the smallest mass of it passes so as to be able to resist the pressure of the whole incumbent atmosphere one may perceive the great force of hot and elastick air in the cavities of human bodies whither airbubbles may be generated in the vessels of human bodies i shall not positively determine strong probabilities for the affirmative are that airbubbles are apt to get into pipes which carry any fluid even into those which carry water and their effects are well known it is likewise certain and what i have known by frequent experience that there are pains in the extremities of the body which seems flatulent and i have often perceived by friction of these parts immense quantities of wind to come out of the stomach by belching by which the patient was relieved air is not tied to the laws of circulation but will break out wherever it can have a vent the force of an airbubble to produce tension and pain is sufficient by what is said  xvii it seems likewise probable that spasms and convulsions are produced by hot and elastick air or steams pent up the symptoms of animals shut up in an exhausted receiver are convulsions and as soon as those animals have voided air through all the emissaries of their bodies so as to bring the air within their vessels to a balance with the outward rarer air of the recipient they seem to recover for a moment till by a new exsuction of air they relapse into the same condition as i observed before some tender human creatures are apt to fall into lypothymies upon a sudden fall of the mercury in the barometer which puts them in the same case with the first exsuction of air in the airpump  xviii human creatures can live in air of very different densities the air in the same place may differ  0 in density or weight so much being the variation of the height of the mercury but what is more strange human creatures can live in airs where the difference of the densities is double in the bottom of mines where the mercury stands at    inches and at the top of the highest mountains which supposing them to be   miles of perpendicular height the mercury must stand at a little above    inches  xix though human creatures can support such a difference of pressure as in the common variation of gravity in the same place makes the difference of pressure upon a body of an ordinary size   00 pound weight and in the difference of altitude in the bottom of mines and at the tops of the highest mountains the difference of   000 weight yet such a difference of pressure must produce great difference in the tension of the fibers and expansion of the fluids of a human body in the case of a greater weight the fibers being more strongly braced and the fluids more compacted and as i observed before were there not a free communication between the external air and the air within the animal fluids these changes would be insupportable and the animal would be in the same case as in an airpump with the exsuction of half the air in which case the blood would boil up and expand it self to a great degree by so much of the pressure of the external air being taken off all this is prevented by the quick expulsion and admission of the air within and without the body  xx it seems probable that the diminution of the force of the pressure of the external air in bracing the fibers must create a debility in muscular motion which is the reason that some people have imagined they breathed shorter than usual in ascending the tops of high mountains but the true reason is that by the diminution of the pressure of the air upon the muscles less exercise puts one out of breath and perhaps the overbalance of the air within the thorax may have some effect but then it may be objected that mountaineers are not less active and strong than the inhabitants of low countries to which i answer that there are two causes which hinder this effect the first is the excess of coldness of the air on the tops of mountains above that of lower situations which counterbalanceth the less weight and braceth the fibers more strongly by reason of this excess of coldness in greater altitudes the decrease of the densities of the air does not precisely answer calculation another reason seems to be this that such as live in a rarer air are habituated to the exercise of a greater muscular strength they are as it were in the case of birds which performing their motions in a rarer medium must always use a greater muscular strength which though indeed nature has endued them with the very habit of using it must strengthen their fibers a tame bird cannot fly so well as a wild one  xxi the pressure of the air upon the lungs is much less than it has been computed by some but still it is something and the alteration of  0 of its force upon the lungs must produce some difference in elutriating the blood as it passes through the lungs which are the chief instruments of sanguification the variations of the pressure of the air in its gravity and elasticity must produce proportional oscillatory motions in the fluids and solids of human bodies and when the excursions are extreme and frequent such great agitations of the fluids and solids may produce great alterations in human bodies for which there is no need to have recourse to occult qualities in the air there is a sort of torture if i remember right used by the inquisition which by sweathing the body very hard and immediately unbracing it will produce a most exquisite pain and feverish symptoms the air by the softness of its contact does not hurt animal fibers much but the bracing and unbracing the fibers strongly by turns may produce changes analagous to this torture and such alterations are producible not only by the variations of the gravity and elasticity but by the qualities of heat cold moisture and dryness of which i shall say something in the following chapter  chap iii of the qualities of the air i i call fluidity gravity elasticity etc properties of the air residing constantly in the whole mass and every part of it heat cold dryness and moisture i choose to term qualities because taken in the vulgar sense they are variable and do not constantly inhere in the whole nor in the parts  ii the air by these variable qualities of heat cold dryness and moisture must necessarily produce great variety of changes in human bodies let us conceive a fluid permanently warm as human blood enclosed in a system of tubes thin flexible to which the outward air has admittance by innumerable passages let us conceive this system with its enclosed fluid steaming and reeking hot through innumerable passages changing situation sometimes within sometimes without doors and exposed to the cold hot dry wet air and all the variety of changes which happen in that element the changes which must happen to this system or machine in these circumstances are not the twentieth part of what happens to human bodies which besides the real influence of the circumambient air is affected by the changes with a dolorous or pleasant sensation which it has not always in its power to avoid or enjoy  iii heat and cold are qualities relative to our senses and cold perhaps only a privation or less degree of heat or motion the spirit of wine in thermometers being affected with the smallest changes of heat and cold is a proper index of these alterations though the degrees marked in the tubes are not the exact measures of the quantity of them however waving the imperfections of that instrument i shall only advertise the reader that in my observations of the degrees of the heat of the air i refer to those made by two thermometers farenheits and one invented by mr hales fitted to observations upon his subject in farenheits thermometer at    degrees the water in the air begins to freeze which is known by hoar frosts the cold increasing will sink the spirit to   degrees and it has been known to sink it to 0 by cold in which scarce any animal could live by common artificial cold it can be sunk   degrees below 0 and by an uncommon experiment has been sunk  0 degrees below 0 the air is temperate at    degrees and by natural heat seldom reaches  0 and if you by artificial heat raise it     degrees more so as to reach     this is the heat of boiling water so that     is the distance between the greatest artificial cold and the heat of boiling water and  0  degrees the distance between the greatest natural cold common in this climate and the heat of boiling water by this thermometer the natural heat of an adult person is    and of children    no animal can live long in an air of  0 or near the natural heat of the body  iv mr haless thermometer is chiefly contrived for experiments of vegetation he begins his 0 at the first degree of cold or the freezing point and his last degree of heat is that in which melted wax swimming on hot water begins to coagulate the space between those two extremes he divides into  00 degrees justly reckoning that a heat which keeps wax fluid is too strong for vegetation human heat can expand the spirit of wine  0 when the air is in a freezing condition  v by mr haless thermometer the heat of animal blood is to that of boiling water as        to    by the same thermometer the heat of the skin is    degrees of the  00 the point at which wax begins to coagulate and is somewhat more than that of water in which you can put your hand this heat no vegetable can bear at least in this climate though i remember mr boil mentions heat in some country which melts wax which is unsupportable by human bodies and yet vegetables survive it by haless thermometer the heat of milk from the cow is    of urine    that of an extreme hot day was    a common sunshine day at noon in july  0 in the shade    of a may or june day from    to  0 the most temperate for vegetation and therefore the properest perhaps for human bodies what was most surprising was the heat of    which exceeding    the natural animal heat human creatures could not have endured it long he told me that it was extremely hot for a while and his thermometer stood in the sun  vi the rarity of the air makes it more sensible of the changes of heat and cold than any other fluid the smallest increase of heat expands it and the abatement of that contracts it immediately in all its parts the heat of boiling water as was mentioned before expands it the degrees of expansion of the air are not determinable for the greatest degree of heat will not totally expel it but by this continual contractibility and dilatibility by different degrees of heat the air is kept in a constant motion the different degrees of heat create a proportional expansion of liquors so as to make a sensible alteration in their specific gravity that of rectified spirit of wine about the pole makes the difference of    of its bulk and consequently of its price bought by measure  boerhaave mercury can be condensed by cold so as to be as heavy as gold by heat the air contained in animal fluids is expanded for glass bubbles in any fluid rise and fall with the changes of heat as well as by those of the gravity of the air  vii a certain degree of heat not strong enough to dry or destroy animal solids lengthens and relaxes the fibers from whence proceed the sensation of faintishness and debility in a hot day the effect abovementioned of relaxation of the fibers and expansion of the fluids by heat are evident to the sight and touch for the outward parts of human bodies swell and are plumper in hot weather than in cold there are many experiments which demonstrate the same thing needless to be inserted  viii air extremely hot is capable of reducing animal substances to a state of putrefaction and is particularly hurtful to the lungs blood is cooler in the veins than in the arteries and returns to the right ventricle of the heart where it is still rendered cooler by a fresh mixture of chyle which is cooler than blood but by the circulation through the lungs it is heated again to a degree so as to render it spumous the surface of the vesicles of the lungs is exposed to the outward air which has a free admittance to it refrigeration by cool air is one though not the principal use of air in respiration but when this outward air is many degrees hotter than the substance of the lungs it must necessarily destroy and putrify both the solids and fluids and this is found true by an experiment for in a sugarbakers dryingroom where the air was heated     or    beyond that of a human body a sparrow died in two minutes a dog in    minutes but the most remarkable thing of all was that the dog voided a red saliva foetid and putrid we owe this luciferous experiment to the industrious boerhaave from which many important inferences may be drawn for why might not this putrid saliva of the dog be infectious consequently it is possible for pestilential distempers to begin from excessive heats no human creature can live long in an air hotter than their own bodies  ix there are some experiments which seem to indicate that air heated to a certain degree beyond that of boiling water cooled again and retaining all its common properties of gravity elasticity loses something so as to render it unfit for respiration but i am apt to believe with the ingenious mr hales that in the experiments which were made the air was infected with the poisonous steams of the bodies through which it passed in heating for the air that passed through hot glass did not kill animals as that which passed through charcoal but however it is certain that air heated with sulphurous steams of candles or animal bodies loses some part of its elasticity and becomes unfit for animal functions such as the air in which people of fashion pass a great deal of their time but of this more afterward  x another great effect of the heat of the air upon human bodies is that by the degrees of it the quantity of perspiration sensible and insensible is regulated by journals that have been kept it appears that the perspiration of england scarcely equals all the other excretions and that the summer perspiration is near double to that of winter whereas in paduan air the perspiration the year round is to all the other excretions as   to   and perhaps in hotter countries the proportion is greater this must occasion a great variety of human constitutions and diseases according to different climates the serous part of the blood being carried off by sweat or sensible perspiration which is much greater in hot countries than in cold or temperate must make the craffamentum or red cake of the blood more and a physician who has practiced in those countries has assured me that the case is so that the blood is commonly black and dense when drawn i have often been surprised that the quantities of spices which the inhabitants of hot countries take do not hurt them but on the other hand i consider that nature is wise and had not made those plants indigenous unless they were useful and necessary perhaps for attenuating the blood deprived of its fluidity by the great quantity of sensible perspiration and to recruit it with the volatile and oily parts of which it is deprived both by sensible and insensible perspiration  xi i would likewise observe that the real quantity of animal pluid carried off by perspiration can never be known by ponderation for as it is plain that the outward air enters the pores of the body and is sometimes imbibed or absorbed by the animal the quantity of perspirable matter is only the difference of the excess of that beyond the quantity of air that is imbibed of this more in the following part of this chapter  xii winds do not cool the air by their motion but by bringing along with them the air of cooler regions the thermometer does not change by winds nor by the strongest blast of a bellows unless it be blown through ice or any body colder than the air and such a blast will sink it the rapid motion of great storms rather agitates and heats the air but winds cool animal bodies by driving away the hot steam that surrounds them suppose the heat of an animal body to be  0 and the heat of the air    the animal body by blowing off the hot steam will be surrounded with an atmosphere of    near the half of its natural heat taken off in a second of time therefore resting in a cool air after exercise may be the cause of great diseases especially such as affect the lungs inflammations asthmas catarrhs this change of their atmosphere happening as was said every second of time is the same thing as putting on a cold suit of clothes every such time  xiii on the other hand as human bodies can be cooled by air cooler than their own temperature perhaps sooner than by any other means there is great use to be made of temperating feverish heat by outward air so that it be done with safety this is known by experience in inflammatory distempers as in the smallpox no liquor taken inwardly can cool human blood so soon as cool air boiling water is reduced to its own temperature in a short time by cool air two liquors of equal density and unequal degrees of heat being mixed in equal quantities reduce the heat of the whole immediately to half the sum for example boiling water hot as     pound to an equal quantity of water cold as    makes the heat of the whole           a liquor of less density such as air is indeed longer in producing this effect and air cools the blood by its contact or admission into the surface of the skin or the lungs innumerable mischiefs arise from keeping the air of the room of a feverish person too hot by depriving the patient of the benefit of refrigeration by cool air from the bad effects of animal steams which spoil the air and destroy its elasticity as will appear by what is said afterward it is known by experience that patients in fevers affect cool air and will use their utmost efforts to come at it even by getting out of bed i am of opinion that renewing and cooling the air in a patients room giving it a free admission by opening the door the bedcurtains and in some cases the windows or letting it in by pipes changing the hot atmosphere about him so as not to disappoint the intention of keeping up a due quantity of perspiration and in general the right management of the air is one of the chief branches of a regimen in inflammatory distempers and by the scrupulous care of silly nurses in this particular the disease is often increased lengthened and proves fatal and this error is still more dangerous in vigorous strict and ponderous bodies than in lax for heat is detained in proportion to the density of bodies  xiv the effects of cold air may be inferred from what has been said of hot air cold being a privation or abatement of so many degrees of heat induces a proportional diminution of the effects of heat or contrary qualities cold air is the immediate cause of freezing it first begins in the air by congelation of the watery particles in it and the effects of this cold sometimes do not reach so far as the surface of the earth so as to freeze the water on it as in summer hail and icy showers such as that which fell in somersetshire and oxfordshire in      so destructive of vegetables abridgment of philosophical transactions vol ii p     the surface of the earth was not frozen in farenheits thermometer freezing begins at    and increasing will sink the spirit of wine to o which is a degree scarcely supportable by animal bodies artificial freezing will sink it below that point vegetables endure greater degrees of cold than animals and yet great destruction is made of them by winters cold sometimes as that of      and in some countries   0  because human creatures have defenses against the injuries of the air  xv cold condenseth the air proportional to the degrees of it it contracts animal fibers and fluids which are denser as far as the cold reaches in cold weather animals are really of less dimensions cold braceth the fibers not only by its condensing quality but likewise by congealing the moisture of the air which relaxeth extreme cold works on human bodies as a stimulus producing at first a pricking sensation and afterward a glowing heat or a small degree of an inflammation in the parts of the body which are exposed to it by bracing of the fibers more strongly condensing the fluids and stimulating it produces strength and activity which is very sensible to some in clear frosty weather if the effects of cold air are so considerable upon the outward surface of the body they may be much more so upon the loogs in which the blood is much hotter and the coat very thin in immediate contact with the outward air and were it not that the warm air is not entirely expelled in expiration the contact of the cold air would be intolerable and indeed the effect of cold air in producing inflammations of the lungs is very sensible especially upon the blowing of cold northwesterly winds in some of our northern plantations in the west indies cold condenseth all fluids except water which it rarifies to    of more bulk ice emergeth so much out of water as frost separates air from water and collects it into bubbles it may be suspected that the small specific gravity of ice is not owing to invisible masses of air in the ice for air separated from any liquor takes up a greater space than in the liquor and consequently renders the same aggregate of air and water specifically lighter perhaps this may solve the difficulties mr boil had about this matter freezing cold contracts all other liquors besides water as oleaginous liquors and spirits as to make them specifically heavier air it will condense   0  xvi cold by contracting the fibers of the skin and cooling the blood too much in those vessels which are exposed to the air suppresseth some of the grosser parts of the perspirable matter by which many salts which would evaporate in warm air are retained and likewise by a stimulus the cold air vellicates and inflames these vessels producing scurvies with the most dismal symptoms scurvy is the disease of cold countries the fatal extremities of it one may see in the journals of such as have been left to winter in greenland and other cold countries the cold that froze their spirituous liquors had nearly the same effect upon the blood reducing to a gangrenous state the animal substances mortifications of their limbs gums the putrid flesh being forced to be cut off a total inability of chewing immobility and intolerable pains in many parts of the body livid spots and blisters on their skins and by regarding the motion of the blood and suppression of perspiration giddiness sleepiness pains in the bowels looseness bloodyfluxes but what is very strange seldom a decay of appetite these were not entirely the effect of salt provisions besides they had often fresh both vegetable and animal if living in such cold countries be practicable it must be so far underground as reaches beyond the frost which feldom pierces above the depth of  0 feet the air in the grotto of the observatory of paris of   0 foot deep is equable and temperate there is a certain distance at which the natural heat of the earth is not destroyed by the outward air frost in such a degree as does not congeal animal fluids may increase insensible perspiration liquors lose their volatile parts in frosty weather more than in hot by condensing the watery parts the volatile fly off scents are not abared by cold vide memoirs de lacadem de science   0   but as i said before some of the grosser salts are retained in perspiration  xvii extreme cold and extreme heat destroy or reduce to a gangrenous state animal substances with this difference that the cold which produces mortifications in living bodies preserves the dead from putrefaction for there must be a concurrence of heat and motion in the animal juices with the stimulus of the cold to produce the change we cannot raise a blister on a dead body  xviii the interchanges of heat and cold and the constant oscillatory motions of contraction and dilatation produced by them are necessary for the economy of animals and vegetables but neither can bear the extremities of them in all probability the same degree of heat has persisted about the earth ever since the creation the causes which produce it are the same animals and vegetables have been produced and continued to grow after the same manner which is a sign that the heat has wrought after an uniform manner and that the quantity of it upon the surface of the earth has continued the same it may be increased in particular places but when the pabulum which produced it is consumed there is no more heat communicated to the rest of the matter there does not seem to be any natural cause for the increase of heat on the body of the earth unless it be the approach of a comet the spots that appear and disappear on the surface of the sun can make no great alteration  xix as to the degrees of heat a heat of  0 by farenheits thermometer turns the white of an egg liquid sanious and putrid a heat of  00 will harden it vegetable heat in which plants will live or grow is from   to  0 animal heat terrestrial from  0 to    of fishes that have gills    and which can bear heat to  0 but fishes which have lungs can bear heat from    to    water begins to grow hot at    and boils at      00 is a melting heat a catoptrical or dioptrical heat is superior to any vitrifying the hardest substances  xx the effects of moisture on the air both on animals and vegetables are relaxation of their fibers by many experiments i have found that the single fibers both of vegetables and animals are lengthened by water or by moist air a fiddlestring moistened with water will sink a note in a little time and consequently must be relaxed or lengthened     the steam of hot water will sink it a note in   or   minutes that moisture relaxeth is evident by daily experience of paper vellum a drum leather vegetable or animal fibers first moistened and afterward dried contract more than before they were moistened it must happen indeed that water insinuated into the pores of any body increases its dimensions and perhaps by this mechanism it shortens ropes by increasing their thickness a cold bath makes a momentary contraction of the fibers by the cold and the sensation of which in live bodies works as a stimulus but the water itself would relax and constantly does so when its degree of heat is equal to that of our bodies and continuing long in cool water at last relaxeth swimming long dispirits more by the relaxation of the water than exercise water and air produce volatility or putrefaction in bodies and still in a greater degree if assisted by heat moisture helps air to insinuate itself into the pores of bodies a bladder will sooner burst than let air pass when dry but when moistened lets it easily pass moisture diminishes the elasticity of the air in rainy weather the air is less elastick thus moisture relaxeth human fibers by weakening the spring of the air dry air either abates those effects or produces their contraries dry air sucks up the volatile oils of animal bodies by which means it influenceth perspiration freezing cold separates air from water for as the water freezeth the air appears in bubbles which are sometimes enclosed in ice  xxi to the relaxation of the fibers by moist air are owing a great many symptoms which human bodies feel in moist weather by which relaxation they lose some of their elasticity or force for circulating the fluids especially those aches and pains which they feel in those parts where the circulation of the juices is not perfect as in cicatrices of wounds luxated or bruised parts i wish i could thoroughly understand the cause of a corns aching before rain from which i should be able to explain the causes of all those pains which affect some bodies in wet weather  xxii moist air is properly that which is overcharged with vapors near the surface of the earth and when those vapors are rather in a falling than an ascending state the body of air may contain more water in it at other times but as was said before the water and air are better mixed the vapors are higher and a less quantity of them in contact with our bodies we call air in such a state dry the air may be said to be sometimes in a state of imbibing and sometimes in a state of precipitating its water  xxiii the effects of dry air are contrary to these of moist because they are an abatement or privation of them dry air imbibes volatile animal oils and spirits and consequently influences perspiration great dryness may change the very texture and situation of the pores of the skin of the two extreme dry seasons have proved more dangerous to human bodies than wet our bodies are not made to bear extremities of any kind but extreme droughts have been found most dangerous to human bodies all these forementioned properties and qualities of the air gravity elasticity heat cold moisture dryness act in their several combinations on human bodies and when their actions conspire the effect produced is the sum when contratiwise the effect is the difference of their actions  xxiv air by the properties and qualities enumerated must produce very sensible changes in human bodies because it not only operates by outward contact but we constantly imbibe it at all the pores of the body which is evident by what has been said before for if the air had not a constant admittance into the body how could the balance of the external air and that within the vessels be so quickly restored upon this the life of the animal depends to balance the air within and without the body it requires indeed some time in descending in the divingbell there is one troublesome sensation and it is a strong pressure upon the membrane of the ear where it has not so ready an admittance but changing the density of the air not too fast by the free communication of the denser outward air and that of the body there is no danger nor uneasy sensation the skin of an animal dried or leather excludes air but the skins of live animals are moist and oily through which air will pass wherever there are emissaries there are likewise absorbing vessels many bodies denser than air as mercury cantharides garlic enter the pores of the skin while we perspire we absorb the outward air and the quantity of perspired matter found by ponderation is only the difference between that and the air imbibed so that after great labor and abstinence which produces a vacuity and a great diminution of perspiration it is possible that the quantity of the air absorbed may exceed the perspired matter this is true if the journals of perspiration be faithful in dr keils journal there is an instance of a person growing    ounces more ponderous by absorbing air the people of newmarket who try the methods of wasting assirm this to be true though i own i should be very glad to have it confirmed by some faithful trial hippocrates and galen took the doctrine of absorbing of air for granted and reason from it this quality of generating air and absorbing it at different times has been demonstrated by the ingenious mr hales in many bodies especially in vegetables by plain experiments by which it appears that air enters freely through the bark steam and leaves and all the outward surface of vegetables which are sometimes not in a state of perspiring but in a state of imbibing air as in the night another very remarkable thing is that air passes easier through the barks of old trees than of young q if by dryness shrinking and hardening the pores of the skins of old people may not grow wider they are indeed more coreacous but air passes through dry membranes when moistened by an experiment of the ingenious professor mysschenberg it appears that air transmitted through clavellated ashes into an exhausted receiver loses weight as it passes through them and more or less according to the degree of moisture in the air volatile salts such as those of animals do not generate but absorb air and it is very probable that human bodies absorb the water from the moist air as fixed dry alkaline salts do which will explain a great many symptoms arising from cold and moist air many great effects must follow and many sudden changes may happen in human bodies by absorbing outward air with all its qualities and contents nothing accounts more clearly for epidemical diseases seizing human creatures inhabiting the same tract of earth who have nothing in common that affects them except air such as that epidemical catarrhous fever of      and of this present year it could not proceed merely from the suppression of perspiration by cold the weather having been felt colder at other times besides it is known by experience that the mere suppression of perspiration does not always produce a catarrh nor that keeping it up prevents one it seems rather to be occasioned by effluvia uncommon either in quantity or quality infecting the air  chap iv of the nature of air in different situations regions and seasons i after having said something of the contents properties and qualities of air in general and their effects it behooves us to take notice of its local and temporary qualities which may be deduced not only by conjecture but demonstrative reason from what has been said before as to the contents of air it is evident that they must differ according to the nature of the surface of the earth or water from which they exhale and this difference would be permanent in every spot of the surface of the terraqueous globe did not the whole mass of air communicate as a fluid and were not its parts agitated and mixed together by the motion of winds and other methods of the wise author of nature yet the mixture is not so perfect but it leaves some difference in the nature of the air sensible to the inhabitants of the same tract of ground where the exhalations are constant and constantly mixed with the air dew is the exhalation of the earth returned again and precipitated upon it consequently the nature and contents of the dew of any place seem to be the best mark of the exhalations of the soil of that place dew by chemical trials yields different contents according to places as the soil is watery salt unctuous saline mineral and differs according to the quantity of heat by which it is raised either from the sun or inward from the earth the local qualities of the air are more permanent in calms than in winds this is evident from fogs which are the consequence of calms therefore the air retains its local qualities long in mines grottos ditches not perflated and in valleys longer than on the tops of mountains  ii the exhalations from great surfaces of water as the sea are scarcely any thing but water the sun neither acting upon the bottom nor exhaling the salt winds raise some of the salt with the spray as has been known by experience in great storms the bars of windows and iron exposed to the sea air are apt to rust this salt is not unfriendly to human constitutions but the great mass of exhalation is fresh water and were it not for constant winds which blow off the coat of vapors which invests the sea i am of opinion that sea air would be intolerable to human bodies  iii the contents of the air must differ much in frost and open weather great frosts stop the perspiration of the earth and consequently deprive the air of the ingredients of those exhalations accordingly it has been found by experience that when there are noxious exhalations in the air the case perhaps of pestilential seasons that they have been stopped by frost frost congeals and separates the water from air on the other hand in thaws the perspiration of the earth being restored and its exhalations more copious frequently render such seasons unhealthy such was the constitution preceding the last plague of london a hard winter sudden thaw a great quantity of water upon the ground attended with heat such an air could not miss to produce great sickness wherein mankind lived as it were in a wet cellar with a great fire summer air differs considerably from that of winter from the airs being replete with the perspirable matter of vegetables rains after great droughts must in some measure produce the same effect as thaws after great frosts the air of cities differs from country air for many reasons see numb viii xi chap i  iv the contents of the air of any place differ according to its situation in respect of adjacent places from whence the air is brought by winds a high ground dry and naturally healthy bordering upon low marshy ground must necessarily be sickly when the winds blow over those marshes besides high grounds attract vapors as they rise from low grounds in choosing situations not only the nature of the soil on which you build but the nature of the neighboring grounds and soil is to be considered  v a rich fertile soil abounding with variety of active volatile and unctuous particles with a considerable degree of heat must necessarily produce inflammatory distempers in human bodies such are rich meadow grounds upon the banks of rivers which with the increasing heat of the spring bring fevers especially intermitting such rich grounds in very hot climates are extremely unhealthy as we find by the relations of travelers on the other hand a gravelly soil on the banks of a running stream is generally healthy  vi mountainous places abound with watery vapors hills attract vapors woods attract vapors and stop the perflation by winds yet chalky and gravelly high grounds which have no unwholsom perspiration nor are in the neighborhood of marshy and low grounds are generally healthy  vii both the superficial effluvia of the earth and those of minerals which lie lower affect the air as is known by experience people who pass over ground abounding with mines are sensible of offensive steams the averni in hungary kill animals and also birds that fly over them mr boil is of opinion that more places abound with minerals especially marcasites than are suspected minerals must needs affect the air when they enter the very substance of plants of which there are very few that have not iron in them the ascending fumes from the mines in devonshire have blasted all the vegetables as grass fern etc all mineral steams are not unwholsom mr boil gives instances of some that emic a sweet and refreshing savor as in a mine in hungary affording an ore called rot gulden erts the steam of which is so refreshing that people choose to enjoy it in taking the air the tinners are not more unhealthy nor shorter lived than other people limestone is reckoned wholesome it is warm and quickly dissolves snow and causes excellent and wholesome grass mr boil from a white earth extracted a rich volatile spirit there are methods to discover what sorts of steams are in the air which it may be of importance sometimes to try  viii the methods which mr boil advises for discovering what salts are in the air are to expose such bodies as are affected with those salts as died silks of particular colors which will be tarnishd with nitrous salts preparations of sulphur are blackened with vitriolick salts to try what alterations are made upon white linen freed from soap and lie by steams or dews experiments of bodies discolored or otherwise affected by different spirits spirit of nitre makes with copper a palish blue spirit of salt a green spirit of urine a deep blue in some places as in amsterdam plate tarnishes soon the coppermines in sweden affect the silver that is near them and make it black in some places furniture rots metals rust but i think there is no better way of judging of the air of any place than by the water which must necessarily imbibe the salts sulphurs and other minerals through which it flows and when it is free from any savor from those substances it is probable the ground is so too sulphurous steams arising by subterraneous heats whiten the waters of springs and are certain prognostics of an earthquake and i think it may be concluded that where the water is good the air is so likewise sulphur in the air may be discovered by smell as is perceived in vulcanos and storms sulphurous airs may be fired with a candle  ix moisture in the air is discovered by hygroscopes and an air naturally moist discovers it self by its effects upon furniture plate and several other bodies and is sometimes to that degree in thaws after great frosts as to wet the staircase wainscot pictures and other furniture  x as to the gravity and elasticity of the air they decrease with the height as was mentioned chap ii and it seems almost incredible that a human creature can live at the bottom of a mine with the mercury at    inches high and at the top of a mountain of three miles perpendicular height where the mercury stands at    that is with the weight of the atmosphere in the first case at   000 pounds and in the second at   000 perhaps there are scarcely any human creatures who reside constantly in those extremes if there were such there must be a great diversity of constitutions and diseases but a smaller difference in the weight of the air must create a great diversity of the effects of the air on the inhabitants of those different regions  xi the changes of the gravity of the air affecting human bodies with oscillatory motions of the solids and fluids the more frequent and great those changes are the greater effects they will have upon the nerves and spirits but so it is that within the tropicks where there are no variable winds the variations of the height of the mercury are but small from whence there must arise a diversity of tempers and constitutions between the inhabitants of small and great latitudes upon account of the greater variableness of the gravity of the air of these particulars we shall say more afterward  xii the air by elasticity concurring with its gravity insinuates itself into animal bodies there are substances which mixed with air abate and destroy some of its elasticity especially sulphurous steams as those of candles animals which render the air unfit for respiration the air in which such steams reside is very different from pure air  xiii heat as far as it depends upon the action of the sun is mensurable in different climates the quantities of it have been geometrically determined by dr halley abridgment of philosoph transactions vol ii p      for example the equinoctial heat under the line is to the equinoctial heat in  0 degrees of latitude as   to   to that of the latitude of  0 somewhat less than  0 to   the tropical heat under the line is less than in a latitude of  0 nearly in the proportion of   to    the tropical heat under the line is the least of any situation upon the globe the tropical heat under the pole is greater than that under the line in the proportion of   to   the duration of the sun above the horizon the whole    hours overbalancing the difference of the inclinations of its rays in all appearance if there was no sun the fluids above the surface of the earth or within a certain depth of it would be absolutely rigid and frozen so that there would be no fluid at all perhaps the air it self without the action of the sun would not continue fluid the fluids are so much frozen in great latitudes by the absence of the sun that the quantity of heat is not sufficient during its stay to melt them and warm the atmosphere which is kept cold by the ice on the surface of the earth heat and cold are retained longer in bodies in proportion to their densities  xiv there is a crust of solid ice round the pole perhaps for some degrees which by a hard and cold winter may get more ground than it loses in the succeeding summer and being carried by winds affects the air of lesser latitudes with great coldness the neighborhood of great bodies of ice produce in great tracts of land greater and more lasting degrees of cold than are proportional to their latitudes and which never cease till that ice is melted the cold in the parallel of london is much greater in the west indies the midland countries of great continents are colder than those that have the sea air moscow in the same latitude with edinburgh is much colder  xv the same southern latitudes are colder than the northern from an astronomical cause which if the reader does not understand he may take it in this light the time from the vernal equinox to the autumnal is   days more than from the autumnal to the vernal consequently the summer in our hemisphere is   days longer than that of southern latitudes which cause working a vast number of years must heat our hemisphere more than the southern dr halley met with a sea unnavigable for ice in the latitude of    in the month of january which is the same thing as ice in our seas in the month of july  xvi it is plain that the degrees of heat in several places of the earth bear no regular proportion to the action of the sun which is uniform the great diversity of seasons in the same place may perhaps depend in some measure upon some action of the sun upon the earth resembling the operations of chemistry raising some subterraneous steams of different qualities and quantities at different times in the year     it is reported by an glycus historian that the mediterranean was frozen along the coast to the distance of  0 leagues  xvii the heat of the air depends in some measure upon the constitution and temper of the surface of the earth which in some places retains heat more than in others black earth imbibes the suns rays expose a black and a white marble ball to the sun beams in a clear hot day the white will be perfectly cool while the black acquires a heat that would roast an egg sandy ground by reflecting the sunbeams every way heats the air is offensive to the eyes and by the heat of the sand in some countries insufferable to the feet the heat of the island of ormus which lies beyond the tropic of cancer is so intolerable at some time of the day by the reflection of the sunbeams from the white mountains of salt that the inhabitants are forced to immerge themselves in water  xviii hot steams rising from the surface of the earth heat the contiguous air the heat of particular days depends sometimes upon the reflection and refraction of sunbeams from clouds by the laws of catoptricks and dioptricks the greatest degree of heat is producible by attrition the parts abraded by the attrition of flint and steel are glass which is the utmost effect of the heat of a burningglass and more quick and it is possible that the greatest degrees of heat in the air as storms and thunder may be produced by the collision and fall of icy bodies in the air  xix the heat decreaseth with the attitudes from the surface of the earth it being less on the tops of mountains than in valleys because the air being a fluid extremely rare retains heat but a short time the incidence of the rays of the sun does not create any lasting heat in the air the air at a small distance from the focus of a burningglass which vitrifies metal is not hotter than other air the heat excited in the air by the rays of the sun is immediately extinguished by intercepting them in a greenhouse the parts not touched by the reflected rays of the sun grow rather cooler than outward air dense bodies retain heat excited by sunbeams a longer time in proportion to their density the air not the smallest instant as on the tops of mountains where it is deprived of the heat and reflection from the surface of the earth in the middle of the torrid zone in the island of ceylon as you ascend the air grows still cooler the tops of mountains in very hot countries are covered with snow ludolph as you ascend from the red sea in aethiopia the air grows still more temperate till on the tops of mountains it grows more unsufferable than the heat in the valleys it is by hot air and not by the action of the sun that ice melts the heat of the sun in a clear frosty day has but a small effect upon a surface of ice joseph dacosta tells us that the air in one very high mountain of peru is mortal at the first blast and by its coldness preserves the dead bodies from putrefaction he tells us that on the top of the mountain of peru perhaps the highest in the world he and his company were seized with bilious vomitings perhaps from the thinness as well as coldness of the air  xx as the air in higher regions is colder so it seems to begin there and descend toward the surface of the earth it affects the water at the top first which in extreme frosts will freeze to the depth of   inches in    hours the supposition of frost being produced by nitrous particles in the air is not well supported the steams of nitre have no greater effects than those of other saline liquors in producing cold spirit of nitre dissolves ice in general the supposition contradicts experiments where nitre rather dissolves ice than produces it  xxi mere freezing is not the measure of cold for it begins to freeze at    but the cold may increase till it brings the rectified spirit to o a cold insufferable by human bodies and in which the most spirituous liquors freeze the strongest motion and the greatest artificial heat by fires can hardly preserve human bodies from freezing the natural heat of a human body is  0 and it can subsist in degrees of heat between less than  0 and somewhat above as the difference of the gravity of the air which human bodies can sustain is surprising no less so are the limits of heat and cold sufferable by the help of art and custom in cold to o in the thermometer and in heat beyond the limits of  0 degrees mentioned there are some countries as in suagena in which wax is melted though locked up in cabinets where bodies in summer are excoriated by heat as in northern by cold shoes are burnt as it were with a hot iron but human creatures must have some means of defending themselves from those excessive heats else they could not live  xxii as the heat decreaseth from the surface of the earth upwards the effects of frost scarcely reach  0 feet within the surface beyond that depth the heat is more uniform the thermometer at the depth of   0 feet scarcely varying except from accidental causes from substances within the bowels of the earth by the relations of some who have gone down great depths into the bottom of mines coming out of the warm air descending a few fathoms they find themselves colder afterward the heat increases as they go lower so that the laborers are forced to work in some mines without their clothes and no doubt this heat is different according to the difference of those mineral substances the heat produced by the action of the sun in the superficial parts of the earth is longer in decreasing and increasing than in the air or in the surface so that the seasons within the surface of the earth do not begin so soon as in the open air  xxiii great alterations are produced in the temperature of the air as to heat and cold by winds not by their motion but as they blow over hot or cold grounds and mix air of a hotter or colder temper with the air of that place which as they add or substract degrees of heat produce half the sum for example air hot as  0 mixing with air hot as  0 makes air hot as  0 air hot as  0 mixed with air of  0 makes air hot as    there are hot winds in africa which blow over sandy deserts that kill even elephants on the other hand a northerly wind blowing at the moderate rate of   miles an hour would bring the air of the pole to london in    days for this reason in hot climates on this side the line northern winds are wholesome and southerly winds bring diseases the sickness and health of the inhabitants of egypt keep regular periods with those two winds the air of any place may be heated or cooled to great degrees by winds for as i observed before blowing with a bellows the air of the room where the thermometer stands neither raises nor sinks it but if you blow through hot metal or ice the first raises and the second sinks it in a moment winds cool human bodies if they are cooler than the atmosphere of perspirable matter that surrounds them by blowing off that hotter atmosphere and investing the body with one somewhat cooler the sea and land breezes refresh the air of countries within the torrid zone and are extremely comfortable to the inhabitants wherever the air is extremely rarified by heat the neighboring cooler air rusheth in to restore the balance the nights in hot countries are often very cold and upon that account extremely dangerous to the health of such as expose themselves to it an easterly wind in this country blows fresh after the sun is down and after a hot day chills human bodies exposed to it too much often occasioning fevers and other diseases  xxiv in large tracts of land there is a much greater uniformity of the weather than is commonly imagined the colds and heats differ as to their degrees but begin and end much about the same time this is confirmed by journals of the weather kept at upminster zurich and paris remarkable changes of weather happening at those places near the same time the changes of the gravity of the air are yet more uniform the mercury by observations rising and falling about the same time at paris upminster dublin lancashire the winds likewise when they are strong agree very well when they are less violent they differ as depending upon local causes it appears likewise that the alpine snows have an influence upon the weather of england as well as upon that of zurich the weather being uniform in great tracts of grounds makes the diseases uniform likewise which we have of late seen by plain observations  xxv the cold of some winters in britain and some parts adjacent particularly   0  has nearly equaled in its effects that of great northern latitudes by destroying several animals as fishes and some sorts of birds which continued scarce for some years afterward vid abridgment of philosophical transactions vol i p  0   but most of all vegetables and yet did not produce any great mortality amongst mankind because of the artificial defenses human creatures use against extreme cold the causes of those great excursions of the seasons into the extremes of cold and heat are very obscure but seem rather to depend upon effluvia that rise out of the earth than the action of heavenly bodies  xxvi as to moisture and dryness as far as they affect human bodies they are to be considered only in the region of the air in which we live and breathe wherever there is a cloud there is moist air or what would feel so to a human body but if it is at such a height as not to be contiguous the body is not affected with it  xxvii in dry weather the water in the air is intimately mixed with it and the vapors being higher do not affect human bodies with a sensation of moisture but when watery vapors ascend or descend in masses then they affect human bodies and probably are imbibed with the air which feels more moist when the water is descending than ascending more when the water is in small than in great drops in meazling and soaking rains than in great showers the effects of moisture are more sensible to human bodies before than after great showers  xxviii the quantity of vapor raised and the quantity of water precipitated from the air as i observed before seems to be pretty uniform the year round over the surface of the terraqueous globe perhaps about    inches deep over the whole but from accidental causes it differs considerably as to quantity in different places and in the same place in different years in a period of eight years the quantity of water fallen from the clouds was observed to be inches at zurich    at paris    at upminster    at pisa    at lancashire    the quantities vary in another cycle but the proportions not so much the causes which vary the quantities of rain seem to be  st a wetter or more watery surface exposed to the action of heat by which the vapors are raised  dly cold in the upper regions of the air to condense those vapors which when they grow too heavy must fall down in the form of rain hail and snow therefore a moist surface of earth with a succession of heat and cold must necessarily occasion a rainy season  die winds which vary the quantity of rain in a particular place by carrying the clouds of one place to another hills attract vapors and the valleys near mountainous places have generally great quantities of rain as to the moisture and dryness of regions within the torrid zone the most general rule is that the rain is greatest when the sun is nearest and the drought the greatest when the sun is most oblique this joseph d acosta affirms though not without some exceptions in our climate the most copious showers with the biggest drops are in the summer within the tropic the rainy season is what they call their winter there is perhaps a greater quantity of rain falls between the tropicks than in greater latitudes there are greater rivers and lakes and by the greater heat greater quantities of vapors are raised this freer circulation of water balanceth the great heat which without moisture would render human bodies sickly and the ground unfruitful the moisture of a season is not to be exactly estimated by the quantity of rain for many rainy days during which the weather may be said to be moist do not often produce so great a quantity of rain as one great shower succeeded by many dry days but the changes wrought in human bodies are proportional to the continuance of moist or dry seasons the quantity of water falling upon any tract of ground may be estimated by the condition of the springs where they fall to be sure there has been wanting a sufficient quantity of water from the clouds to supply them and the surface of the earth is no doubt for that reason dryer and supplies a smaller quantity of vapors there is scarce any better measure for the moisture of the surface of the earth the quantity of vapors and in general the moisture of the season than the quantity of water and indeed this is in places under the influence of variable winds very different in different years at upminster in the year   0  there fell of rain more than    inches of rain in the year      less than    inches above the difference of   to   at paris in the year      there fell      in   0       a difference of near   to   great excursions of the seasons as to drought and moisture produce great alterations in the constitutions and diseases of mankind and as far as observations reach dry seasons seem to be the most dangerous of the two the year      was fatal to the cattle for want of water but it was likewise unhealthy to mankind perhaps from the want of a due quantity of water in the air  xxix moist air insinuates it self into the pores of the most compact bodies and as was observed before human bodies absorb it with air and perhaps a due quantity of it is necessary for a right state both of the fluids and solids a sponge will increase   0 of its weight by the moisture of air in spite of a fire in the room but as the fire diminishes it will acquire more weight sheeps leather imbibes the moisture of the air plentifully bones are susceptible of this moisture rots amongst sheep are occasioned by excessive moisture in the air by hygroscopes especially those made of spunges many useful observations may be made as to the weather and its influence on human bodies by hygroscopes it is observed that winds often abate the moisture of the air by blowing away the vapors from whence they are drying and so likewise they increase the quantity of evaporation by blowing away the coat of vapors which invests a surface of water and letting a new one arise  xxx moisture increases the weight and dimensions of vegetable substances and as was observed relaxeth all simple fibers both vegetable and animal consequently from moist air may be produced all the diseases which proceed from laxity of fibers and such must be the diseases and constitutions of moist countries and moist seasons on the contrary extremely dry air sucks up the moisture of animal bodies especially combined with heat heat relaxeth and combined with moisture still more of these matters i shall treat afterward  xxxi what i observed no vii chap ii of the great limits sufferable by human bodies in the weight of air is likewise true of the other qualities of the air it is wonderful to observe one creature that is mankind indigenous to so many different climates generally speaking the animals of warm countries cannot subsist in cold african animals can hardly endure the coldness of the open air of england which is too warm for rain deer yet a human creature can subsist in air from under the line to perhaps    degrees of latitude what makes the difference between mankind and other animals is that mankind is assisted by many contrivances of art to bear extremities brutes left to their own choice as far as they can procure their ends by local motion choose the countries and climates most adapted to their constitutions and so perhaps would a human creature if he were left to his own choice but he is in society and under government and subject to passion to which he sacrifices the greatest blessings of health and life itself there are likewise other causes of migrations of great herds of mankind which is their swarming so as to overstock the countries which they inhabit  chap v of the use and effects of air in respiration i in order to come at the clearest light possible in this enquiry it is necessary to state facts as they appear by experiments and observations all animals live in air or water or sometimes in one and sometimes in the other therefore they may be called aereal aquatick or amphibious all animals have some organ by which they draw in and expel by turns some of the fluid in which they live by which the aereal draw in air and the aquatick water in the aereal this organ is called lungs in fishes gills fishes which sometimes breathe air and cannot always live under water as the cetaceous kind have lungs and not gills  ii no animal which has once made use of this reciprocal motion of lungs or gills can live any considerable time without continuing the same  iii air is so necessary for the life of every animal aquatick as well as aereal that without it life is extinguished in more or less time according to their different structure  iv fishes in the airpump as the air is drawn out of their water swell emit airbubbles swim on their backs and at last die but if fresh air be again admitted before they are quite dead the symptoms vanish and they recover some fishes as carp tench eel live longer in air than in water without air some of the testaceous and crustaceous kinds live very long in an exhausted recipient oysters have lived    hours in an exhausted recipient a crawfish may be killed in one aquatick animals live longer without air than the amphibious and the amphibious longer than the aereal and of these some a longer and some a shorter time according to the structure of their lungs vide philosophical transactions a duck holds out longer in an exhausted receiver than a hen a viper can live   hours in an exhausted receiver and a frog as long a snake  0 hours when some of those animals seem as they were dead they revive upon the readmission of fresh air but no animal revives that has been kept in a perfect vacuum  v young animals live longer in the airpump than adult a kitling longer than a cat as a foetus in the mothers belly or newly excluded may live without air before it has breathed  vi the symptoms which animals feel in an exhausted receiver do not all proceed from the extreme rarity or want of air to breathe but many of them from the expansion of the air in their vessels by taking off the incumbent pressure which throws them into convulsions from which they are relieved as they emit air out of their bodies as was observed before the balance between the outward air and that within the animal must be preserved and if this balance is too quickly changed for the capacity of those passages of communication between the external air and the internal of the animal the animal during that time must suffer it was observed that a human creature changing its situation by degrees can live in air differing one half in density but in an exhausted recipient sinking the mercurial gage    inches would throw a human creature into convulsions by the suddenness of the change drowning kills aereal animals by depriving them of air if the air in receivers could be exhausted all at once want of air would kill in the same time as drowning which in some animals is very short small birds are killed by being kept under water half a minute a duck in   minutes yet even waterfowl though they can stay under water longer than other birds by particularities in their structure they do not bear the want of air much longer than other birds  vii what is remarkable not only in respiration but may perhaps take place in other qualities of the air that assuefaction or being accustomed makes animals still endure those experiments better and better a duck used to an exhausted receiver can endure it longer than a fresh one another fact settled by a fair experiment of the ingenious mr hales is that the lungs of animals that die in vacuo are shrunk and sink in water like the lungs of a foetus yet the lungs of an animal that died in vacuo being afterward put into a recipient and the air exhausted swell  viii as no animal can live without air so none can live long in breathing the same individual air a gallon of air cannot supply a human creature   minute by an experiment of the ingenious mr hales    cubical inches of air could not supply him half a minute without uneasiness and not   minute without danger of suffocation but if he had been shut up with a proportional quantity of air which consequently must have been spoiled not only by the steams of the lungs but of the whole body the same quantity would not have supplied him so long a time  ix the rarer the air is it is the sooner spoiled a linnet can live in about half a gallon of air for   hours sick but not quite dead but in air of half the density not   hour a lark expired in   pints of air with of it exhausted in   minute animals cannot live long in air extremely rare rarity is the want of so much air  x the lungs are the chief instrument of sanguification working somewhat after the manner of a press churning and mixing together the blood and chyle by a reciprocal expansion and dilatation which cannot be performed without the admission and expulsion of fresh air a foetus through which the mothers blood already elaborated circulates does not stand in need of such an organ but as soon as the animal wants a proper sanguification he wants the use of lungs accordingly as soon as the infant is exposed to the air being out of the common integuments the least motion of the muscles of the thorax and diaphragm must change the dimensions of the cavity of the thorax upon the enlargement of which the air enters by the windpipe into the cavity of the lungs which consists of a congeries of airbladders dilatable by the admission and contractable again by the expulsion of air the whole mechanism being nothing but that of a pair of bellows by this dilatation of the lungs the pulmonary vessels are unfolded and a new passage for the blood from the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery is opened and the foramen ovale by which the blood passed from one ventricle to the other is shut by a valve and by degrees obliterated by this mechanism the blood refluent into the right ventricle of the heart continues to circulate through the lungs as long as respiration or the reciprocal motion of expansion and contraction of the lungs is continued but that ceasing the circulation through the lungs which begins with respiration must likewise end with it and the blood in quantity half of that of the whole body is at this time deprived of its passage by the foramen ovale and being stopped the animal must die thus the animal being totally deprived of air to perform respiration as in an exhausted receiver must die the flaccid state of the lungs and their being more ponderous than lungs in their natural state as by no vii demonstrate this to be the case and that the blood stagnates in the vessels the blood vessels creep along the surface of the airbladders upon the dilatation of the airbladders they must be unfolded and lengthened whereas in a collapsed state they are corrugated and as it were folded yet warm water can be easily injected into the lungs in a collapsed state  xi the capacity of a human lungs full grown or the sum of the capacity of all the airbladders is at least   0 cubical inches for so much air is possible to be taken in at one inspiration by an experiment of the learned and accurate dr jurin the quantity of air taken in by a common inspiration is various in different subjects and times but hardly reaches  0 inches perhaps at a medium  0 at which rate  0   parts of the cavity of the lungs continue full of air or some other fluid after every expiration the surface of the vesicles of the lungs of a human creature is much larger than the whole surface of the skin by a mensuration and calculation of mr hales the surface of the lungs of a calf bears a proportion to that of its whole body as  0 to    xii the blood in the lungs is warmer than on the surface of the skin the coat of the vessels extremely thin and those exposed to the outward air and yet the perspiration from the lungs is not half of that from the skin q what is the reason of this small proportion is the air absorbed for the quantity of perspiration is the difference between the air absorbed and the humor prepared there are several things may be said for and against the airs entering into the blood vessels of the lungs in respiration   from the flaccid state of the lungs of animals that die in vacuo it seems evident that the lungs do not expand themselves upon the exsuction of the air consequently the air is sucked out or escapes through the blood vessels of the lungs else if retained it would expand and swell them if the air has a free egress through the coats of the vessels of the lungs it may have a free ingress on the other hand attempts to force air into the blood vessels of the lungs by the windpipe have proved unsuccessful and the lungs of animals that die in vacuo afterward swell in the airpump things may happen in a live animal which will not succeed in a dead one air will pass through any membrane when moist the quick restoration of the balance of air within and without human bodies shows that there is a free communication and it is probable that it is so in the lungs as well as in other parts of the body  xiii by no viii of this chapter the air is quickly spoiled by the fumes of the lungs so as to render it unfit for respiration this must happen from several causes the grosness of the vapors hinders the ingress of the subtler parts of the air into the vesicles which are so small as hardly to be discerned by a microscope if there be any salts in any sort of fumes they must contract the vesicles and perhaps the tainted air may likewise affect the lungs by its heat another cause is the destruction of the elasticity of the air by sulphurous steams animal steams are sulphurous and as such inflammable the sensation felt upon breathing air tainted already with your breath is like that after a strong expiration and the lungs feel as they were much fallen the air not entering into them by the loss of elasticity by which it rusheth into any vacuity allowing  0 inspirations for   minute and  0 cubical inches of air for every inspiration this would make   000 cubical inches of air in an hour some of the elastick power of the air is destroyed at every inspiration by the sulphurous vapors lodged amongst the airbladders and supposing the same numerical air to be inspired the   000 cubical inches of air would lose so much of its elasticity as to render it unfit for respiration  xiv vapors absorb true air or destroy its elastick force at a great rate but the loss of elasticity is not the sole cause of air tainted being unfit for respiration mr hales a rat lived    hours in  0   inches of air during which time     of the whole was absorbed a cat   months old lived an hour in     cubical inches of air with the loss of   0 of true air and    parts in  0 of the air of detonizd nitre is destroyed in    days the air produced by distillations loses its elasticity burning matches destroy the elasticity of the air at a great rate the air generated from fermenting sulphurous mixtures is quickly absorbed as in burning of filings of iron and brimstone antimony and brimstone the lungs and all the parts of the thorax undoubtedly perspire if this perspirable matter retained any elasticity it would be a counterpoise to the outward air and stop the expansion of the lungs as much as a wound in the thorax stops the respiration of that lobe till the outward air is excluded the air therefore in the perspirable matter of the thorax is absorbed and the steam is unelastick sulphurous vapors destroy elastick air only to a certain degree for when air is saturated with vapors to a certain quantity no more elastick air is absorbed which is a happy contrivance of nature else the air for a great extent might be spoiled with sulphurous steams but though the elasticity of the air is never totally destroyed the same once destroyed is never recovered yet in some cases this absorption of air will reach to a great degree the suffocation of animals and the extinction of candles in mines proceed from sulphurous vapors mr hales has found out the best expedients for preventing immediate suffocation from tainted air and to enable a man to sustain it a longer time in case of necessity which is by breathing through mufflers which imbibes these vapors and this answers experience for the mufflers increase in weight by the vapors which they imbibe salts are likewise strong imbibers of sulphurous steams therefore he combined both these substances together and by dipping his mufflers in a solution of sea salt salt of tartar or white wind vinegar he was able still to breathe longer in this tainted air steams of vinegar are reckoned antipestilential and for the same reason salts may be so by sucking up the noxious vapors in salt mines great numbers of people live in good health who never breathe the air aboveground it seems likewise to follow from this experiment that a room hung with some woollen manufacture must be wholesome by imbibing the steams of animals fire and candles or any noxious vapors  xv from the foregoing experiments a natural account may be given of the sufferings of people who pass a long time in a room overcharged with the steams of animals fire and candles a gallon of air is spoiled by the steams of the breath in one minute so as to be unfit for respiration consequently a tun or    gallons would not supply a human creature an hour if he was shut up in this tun of air the air would be tainted by the steams of the whole body in of the time or about  0 minutes and i believe it answers experience that a human creature could not live in a tun of the same air  0 minutes consequently  00 people shut up in a room of  00 tun capacity so as to have no communication with the outward air would be dead or in convulsions and other fatal symptoms in  0 minutes or in a room of  000 tun capacity in   hours this is indeed never the case and there is always in every room some vents for the inward air and inlets for the outward air notwithstanding which the air is much tainted and though it is not fatal it is hurtful ladies and other tender people pass a great part of their time in rooms extremely well fitted up so as to admit scarcely any outward air except by opening of doors and windows the air of the room is tainted very much with the steams of animals and candles q whether some of their nervous symptoms may not proceed from this cause fire and candles taint the air a middlesizd candle as much as a human creature and are as soon extinct by sulphurous steams and by the destruction of the elastick force of the air therefore fire fed by cool air burns most briskly and most of all in a keen frost heat by weakening the spring of the air abates the force of fire the light of the sun will put out a fire and a small fire will not burn near a large one mr hales fire seems to be produced by the action and reaction of sulphur and air for salt water and earth are not inflammable there is something analogous to this in human creatures air weakened in its spring is not so fit for respiration nor perhaps for any other animal purposes we find by experience that asthmaticks cannot bear the air of hot rooms and cities where there is a great deal of fuel burnt except in summer when the consumption of fuel is less  xvi as to the force or pressure of the outward air upon the lungs it is not so great as has been calculated by some whose calculations have been rectified by one of dr jurins who makes the pressure of the air upon the lungs not much more than that of falling dew the force of a smiths bellows will raise mercury one inch a bellows has but one airbladder and a human lungs millions and it requires a greater force to draw in and expel the air through a capacity of   0 cubical inches distributed into millions of little cells than through one cell of the capacity of   0 cubical inches the friction in the first case must be very considerable it requires a considerable force to move a pair of bellows of the capacity of a human lungs with a nose of the capacity of the windpipe and would require still more if they were divided into as many cells as a human lungs therefore it seems to me that the force of the air upon the lungs is at least   0 of the weight of the atmosphere but whatever be the force of the air upon the lungs it varies with its gravity and elasticity consequently the variation of those must have proportional effects upon the motion of the blood through the lungs the expansion of the lungs by respiration being necessary for the circulation through the lungs the circulation is more easy in proportion to that expansion on the contrary whatever stops the circulation through the lungs must hinder the dilatation by which it is plain respiration must have an influence upon the pulse as to frequency strength hardness or softness whether it bears any proportion as to time i leave to be determined by future observations as far as i have observed the frequency of a natural pulse is to that of respiration about  0 to   this i suggest only as a matter worth the inquiring into too great repletion or too great emptiness of the lungs occasion a quick pulse the increase of the frequency of the pulse in animals dying by loss of blood is a very curious experiment of the ingenious mr hales a smaller quantity of blood circulates with greater ease through the lungs in which case the heart acts like a voluntary agent who when there is a less weight of the fluid to be forced through pipes by pumping is able to redouble its strokes the experiments and calculations about the force of the heart in propelling the blood do not determine its absolute force but only that which it exerts in that circumstance the heart employs various degrees of force to carry on the circulation and preserve the life of the animal according to the quantity of resistance but whatever the pressure of the air is upon the lungs it is diminished and increased in proportion to its density some have supposed the weight of the atmosphere to be the antagonist force to the muscles which dilate the thorax but the resistance of the air to any motion is so small that it may be reckoned nothing and when the inspiration is ended the external air and that within the lungs are equally balanced and the air can have no force in relaxing those muscles an ingenious countryman of mine has given a solution of this motion of restitution which i have not yet examined the action of respiration is in some measure subject to the will for it can be suspended for some time and there are instances one at least that i have heard of a voluntary suffocation by holding the breath respiration being carried on in sleep is no argument against its being voluntary what shall we say of the noctambulos there are voluntary motions carried on without thought to avoid pain  xvii the causes of a faulty respiration are multifarious whatever creates any degree of immobility in the thorax as stiffness in the motion of the ribs or cartilages and consequently abates the quantity of its dilatation in proportion to which a smaller quantity of air must enter the lungs fullness from any cause even from wind in the lower belly which pressing upon the diaphragm resists its contraction by which the cavity of the thorax is enlarged repletion or obstruction of the vessels of the lungs humidity of any kind in the cavity of the airbladders contraction of their fibers from any saline stimulus these causes by diminishing the cavity of the airbladders must proportionally abate the quantity of the air inspired likewise all inflammatory and stimulating causes which disturb the motion of the muscles membranes and other organs of respiration such are an impediment to respiration by making a full respiration painful lastly such causes as arise from the qualities of the air as sulphurous steams or too great heat which destroy its elasticity or render it too gross to enter the airbladders watery vapors the least quantity of water entering the windpipe must be immediately rejected by coughing acid mineral steams which immediately contract the fibers of the bronchia and coagulate the blood and many others too long to enumerate but perhaps reducible to some of the abovementioned heads  xviii such as have a faulty respiration must necessarily have an imperfect sanguification the blood of asthmaticks is viscid and imperfectly mixed being not sufficiently attenuated by the action of the lungs and being imperfectly mixed the serous part is easily separated from the globular for slow motion approaches to a quiescent state in which the serum is entirely separated from the crassamentum the secondary uses of air in respiration to form the voice and speech to perform suction or taking of aliment expulsion of the faeces etc refrigerate the blood in the lungs by what was observed no viii chap iii animals cannot breathe air much warmer than the natural heat of their body for such air reduces their fluids to a state of putrefaction if a human creature is deprived of this refrigeration by cool air for a moment by holding his breath he grows hot in proportion the whole mass of blood circulates through the lungs in  0 minutes the blood moves in the small vessels of the lungs    times faster than in the capillaries of other parts of the body the attrition is greater in the lungs than in any other of the viscera because the lungs work as a press and are constantly kneading or churning the blood the attrition of the blood by the surfaces of the capillary vessels through which it flows is caeteris paribus in the inverse proportion of the diameters but by this attrition the blood is retarded and the capillaries acquire a greater plenitude which serves many purposes of nature without this refrigeration by cool air the blood in the lungs would grow extremely hot  xix the lungs of cold animals such as serpents frogs etc consist of larger and less numerous airbladders than those of warm animals for which reason in these the attrition on the lungs is greater the blood warmer the perspiration greater and consequently a more constant reparation by aliment necessary serpents can live long without aliment a degree of heat beyond that of the element in which they live is necessary for all animals the blood of fishes has some degree of warmth beyond that of the water in which they live a certain degree of heat is necessary to keep the blood from coagulating and too great a degree of heat actually coagulates that of a human creature approaches very near the degree of coagulation but this heat of the blood does not proceed merely from the saline sulphurous parts that are in it for fishes have rather more salt and oil in their blood than terrestrial animals the heat of the blood is the effect of motion and attrition of elastick particles and for that reason is greater in the lungs than in any other organ no doubt the saline and oily parts of which the blood consists makes it more susceptible of heat by motion than a mere watery fluid  xx though we have endeavored to explain the use and effects of air in respiration as far as is obvious to our senses and deducible from mechanical principles we are far from imagining that air has not many uses and effects in the animal economy which we shall never be able to account for and that there is in it some other vital principle which makes it so necessary for the life of all animals air conveyed by other passages than the lungs as into the vena cava ductus thoracicus and even by the anus into the intestines will restore the motion of the heart in agonizing animals the motion of the hearts of animals cut out of their bodies and the motion of insects which continue some time after their heads are cut off cease in vacuo immediately hippocrates imagined the air to be the principle of animal motion lib de flaubus and morbo sacro  animal life is presently extinguished without communication with the outward air and may instantly be restored by it all animals have some passages to inspire the outward air some insects have their windpipes on the surface malpighius de bombyce of their body and are therefore killed by the contact of oil not as a poison but as it excludes the air borelli supposes that the air inspired by an oscillation depending upon its elasticity regulates the animal motions as a pendulum of a clock this hypothesis is subject to many difficulties air in liquors does not exert its elasticity till collected in masses it has always the power of exerting it but till a certain quantity of the incumbent pressure is taken off it continues in a fixed state and divided into its minutest parts many have endeavored to explain this vital force of air i think unsuccessfully therefore i would advise such as deal in those subjects to be contented to reason from the sensible effects of air of which they are sure from experience the lungs being of a lax delicate texture with a surface of a larger extent than of the whole skin exposed to the outward air and of a much hotter temperature must be extremely sensible of the qualities of the outward air and affected by them as by outward contact therefore the choice of air to people of tender lungs is a matter of great importance first as to humidity the least quantity of it must produce a cough as for hot air the lungs cannot bear air that is hotter than the animal fluids heat and moisture together produce putrefaction consumptive people often die in a hot day but those two qualities seldom reside long in air together it ought likewise to be considered that heatingrooms by any contrivance which does not let the vapors escape may be dangerous to the lungs on the contrary air intensely cold by its contact may condense and coagulate the blood through the thin coats of the vessels so as to produce inflammations which reign here in the winter and in many countries upon cold blasts we have seen the effects of some cold and moist exhalations in two epidemical cartarrhous fevers air dry and not intensely hot must be favorable to the lungs accordingly countries where the air has those qualities are pretty free from pulmonick consumptions  xxi besides these sensible and variable qualities of the air there may be saline exhalations which must affect the lungs still in a greater degree not only contracting the airbladders but corroding the solids and coagulating the fluids it seems probable that there are a great many such exhalations in britain for it abounds with mineral waters such as is the water such is the air the air of holland is more benign to tender lungs than that of england though it must necessarily be moister but it is free from mineral steams of which there are none in the country the lungs being the chief organ of sanguification good air must help the second digestion and we often feel the effects of good air as well in stomachick as in pectoral cases in short air has so great an influence both upon the fluids and solids of human bodies that it is matter of experience that some people find themselves much disordered in one sort of air and weather and perfectly well in another the cause of which change is easily discoverable by any person who understands the physiology of air and the constitution of the patient and for this single reason the nature and effects of air are a very proper subject of study because the choice of it is often a necessary part of advice the effects of air when it enters the thorax by an aperture are very much to be regarded in the management of wounds in the thorax for first the air which enters into the thorax is a counterpoise to that which enters by inspiration and must stop the expansion of that lobe of the lungs where the appetite is the air entering into the cavity of the thorax corrupts and converts into pus blood and other animal juices if there is a communication through the lungs with the air admitted by respiration it may produce bad symptoms and even suffocation though the case seldom happens it has therefore been the practice of judicious surgeons not to dress such wounds with large tents which amongst other inconveniences have that of admitting air at every dressing  chap vi concerning the insluence of the air on human constitutions and diseases i though i have given some general observations and reasonings on this subject as i went on in the foregoing part of this essay yet i think it demands a particular consideration the effects of the air on human bodies are as various as the diversity of the weather climates and countries the physiology of them is very obscure and imperfect not only in that part which will be always hard to find out viz the different qualities of air and the manner of their action upon human bodies but in that likewise which lies within the compass of human industry and sagacity a history of facts or a journal of diseases compared with the weather which if it should be kept for any great period of time and in many places i will venture to affirm that mankind would arrive at more than a conjectural knowledge in this matter the ancient physicians seem to have been more attentive to this than the moderns and those of the moderns who have attended to it have perhaps made no inconsiderable figure in their profession  ii hippocrates thinks it incumbent on a physician de aere li and aquis to consider the situation air and water of a city in order to come at the knowledge of their popular diseases and their seasons and his own observations are very particular and suppose the attraction of air by human bodies for instance that cities exposed to the sun and winds being well perflated at the same time supplied with wholesome water are exempt from many diseases which those in different circumstances are subject to that cities in greece shut up from northerly winds were unhealthy that in a dry summer diseases end sooner than in a wet one in which they are obstinate and disposed to suppurations heat and moisture in the air producing putrefaction that cold air occasions defluxions and hoarseness that serous defluxions and redundant pituite were the product of the winter which made women subject to abortions children to convulsions and such as were exposed to cold subject to inflammations of the eyes and lungs this sagacious great man pretends that he could predict the diseases from the weather and contrariwise that heat ensuing upon a wet season produces serous defluxions upon the head and belly and acute fevers that cool weather about the dog days if it is not succeeded by a temperate autumn is dangerous for women and children producing quartans and the consequence of them dropsies a mild rainy winter succeeded by northerly winds in the spring dangerous to childing women producing defluxions on the lungs colicks in the phlegmatic and inflammations in the bilious that obstructions after relaxations occasion palsies and sudden death to old people a rainy spring and autumn make a sickly winter burning fevers in middleagd people and phlegmatic pleurisies and inflammations of the lungs in the bilious a dry summer with northerly winds succeeded by a wet autumn headaches apoplexies a dry autumn with northerly winds profitable to phlegmatic but dangerous to bilious constitutions because the watery parts which dilute the gall are absorbed no less judicious are all his observations upon the diseases of the season of the year as they depend upon the temperature of the air he advises to consider the constitution of the air in chirurgical operations excepts against the solstices in cutting for the stone what he says about the equinoxes and rising and setting of the stars seems to be fanciful conformable to the opinions of that age this great man goes still further he ascribes the different shapes complexions tempers of mankind and even their different forms of government to the difference of the constitution of the air that the fertile countries of asia from moderate heat and moisture produce animals large and handsome that the mildness of their climate disposes them to be soft and effeminate not enduring labor and hardship like the greeks frequent changes in the body affecting the mind from thence the asiaticks are less bold and courageous slavish and subject to masters and therefore easily slide into monarchies that though they are forced they are not willing to abandon their ease and families or to hazard their lives for the power and wealth of their masters in expeditions from which themselves reap no advantage that on the other hand the greeks and northern asiaticks were bold hardy and warlike and being their own masters willingly underwent dangers of which they themselves reap the advantage afterward on the same subject he writes to this purpose that as the equability of the temperature of the air rendered the asiaticks lazy the great variety of heat and cold in europe by variously affecting the body likewise affected the mind rendering them active activity begetting fortitude and fortitude begetting laws to secure their property and being governed by laws they were susceptible of the rewards and fruits of their industry of which such as live under absolute monarchs are not this good old man seems to have been no friend to monarchy the phasians says he from the excessive moisture of their air are tall soft bloated pale there can be no better philosophy than this for such effects proceed from lax fibers and lax fibers from excessive moisture such as inhabit mountainous places are fierce and active and contrariwise the inhabitants of fertile plains with stagnating waters inhabitants of barren and dry ground are proud and obstinate a fat soil produces a fat understanding a barren soil with cold winters makes the inhabitants hasty and warm in their tempers proud and quick of apprehension in this book de flatibus if it be his he ascribes the causes of all distempers especially of the pestilential to the air in his book de morbo sacro he goes still further and asserts that air gives sensation life and motion to the members  iii his most excellent books of epidemical diseases are a history of diseases and the weather from whence he drew many of the forementioned and other observations and through the whole one may observe a great conformity between the constitution of the air and that of diseases of which one could give not a few instances the constitution of his first section a wet autumn dry winter with northerly winds a cold spring a mild summer from whence he observed few suppurations the constitution of his second section a moist autumn a winter moist and afterward cold a cold northerly spring the natural product of such a cold moist year were inflammations of the eyes colicks fluxes of the belly great fluidity catarrhous fevers few continued fevers tertians semitertians some quartans no great thirst or haemorrages attending fevers catarrhs defluxions upon the joints in short all the effects of moist air imbibed by human bodies what seems remarkable in the constitution of his third section is an excess of drought a dry cold winter spring and summer this year was noted for palsies as the last after a great drought was in london dysenteries haemorrages of all sorts the effect of a stricture of the fibers from cold and drought continued fevers with delirium and thirst the diseases most dangerous to the young and vigorous great and repeated feverish rigors both in winter and summer which were cold in his second book he ascribes the great riness of carbuncles in the summer to the great heats and observes that sweats ensued upon showers moisture relaxing that burning fevers were most violent in a hot and dry summer that in constant weather the diseases are more uniform and more easily resolved and contrariwise in variable weather that the diseases of the spring are least pernicious in this book he likewise observes that a mild winter with southerly winds a dry spring and a summer with meazling rains like dew were attended with fevers and parotids or tumors behind the ears a sort of a pestilential season described in his third section of his third book was a hard winter succeeded by a rainy warm spring and an extremely hot summer without winds not very unlike the constitution of the year of the plague of london this year described by hippocrates was remarkable for all inflammatory eruptions upon the skin and all diseases of putrefaction in the sixth book he observes that frequent changes of the winds from north to south produce inflammations of the lungs and in general that the proper weather of the season as it happens later or sooner dry cold hot with or without winds determine the nature of the diseases these are a few instances of the sagacity and industry of this great man and his great application to this part of his profession of the influence of the air upon human constitutions in which no question he was assisted by the observations of his predecessors and i hope to show in the sequel of this chapter that a great many of his observations even those that seem most fanciful depend upon natural causes adequate to their effects  iv as i observed before the subject of the influence of air upon the constitutions and diseases of human bodies has not been treated of by modern physicians with that accuracy it deserves observations of that kind are but few and there is no series of them in any country what would give most light into this matter is a collection of observations in countries where both the qualities of the air have great excursions toward extremes where the seasons and these excursions and the diseases depending upon them are regular egypt is a country which answers all those intentions in some degree and it happens luckily that a very eminent physician who lived some time and practiced among them has given us a very good account both of the constitution of their seasons and their popular diseases  v egypt is situated between aethiopia the mediterranean sea arabia and barbary which lie in the order mentioned south north east and west of it grand cairo where prosper alpinus preached lies in  0 degrees northern latitude as ptolemy says   degrees beyond the tropic of cancer who for that reason must suppose the angle of the equator with the eclyptick    degrees  0 minutes more than it is now observed to be this great city is situated at the foot of the mountains of the story arabia which lie toward the east it is quite exposed to the northerly winds which blow over the mediterranean toward the south there is a hot sandy soil so that the alterations of heat and cold as the winds blow north and south over the mediterranean or over this hot sand are excessive and the alterations of heat and cold from the other winds but small lying near the tropic the soil being sandy and fructifyd only by the slime of the nile without rain there is hardly any humid perspiration from the ground itself the air receiving moisture only from the watery surface of the nile during the inundation or from the vapors brought from the mediterraneah by the northerly winds from these causes the air is extremely hot and the tropical heats would be insufferable if it were not for the northerly winds and indeed the heats are sometimes so vehement that the inhabitants defend themselves from them by many contrivances fountains in the middle of their houses pipes to convey fresh air by grottos and high edifices by which their streets are shadowed from the sun and a temperate diet and during the tropical heats the air is sometimes so much moistened and cooled by the northerly winds and the watery surface of the nile that the acute and pestilential distempers are checked by this constitution of the air the inhabitants often suffer from catarrhous distempers more than in northern countries their bodies being more delicate and their pores more open by the preceding heat as to their seasons their spring lasts from the beginning of january to march their summer is double the first from the beginning of march to the solstice and the second from the solstice to the beginning of september and this second summer is more constant healthy and less scorching than the first by reason of the difference of the winds and other causes aftermentioned their autumn lasts september and october and their winter november and december the extreme heat of the first summer proceeds from the hot winds which blow from the south and southeast called by the inhabitants campsin from their continuance of  0 days though they have no determined time but last sometimes more than   months and reign commonly march april and may they blow over the sands which they raise in clouds sometimes so as to obscure the sun during this time many epidemical diseases rage especially inflammations of the eyes a fever which the inhabitants call dmelmuia attended with a deliti and proves often mortal in a few h and even the plague it self this exme heat has sudden interruptions of cold which makes the inhabitants still more unhealthy the inhabitants during the campsin live under ground the heat during the months of june and july which by the course of the sun should be the greatest is so moderated by the northerly and moist winds blowing over the mediterranean and by the overflowing of the nile that the inhabitants grow healthy and sow their seed in the months of september and october their winter has seldom any snow frost or rain or any thing besides dew unless in some places bordering upon the mediterranean and receiving clouds from thence so the reigning winds in egypt are the southerly blowing as it were from an oven and the northerly moist and cold over the mediterranean and this last perhaps two thirds of the year and during the greatest solar heats another cause by which both the heat and drought of the air is tempered is the overflowing of the nile which rising in the mountains of aethiopia bends its course northerly through a tract of land near  0 degrees by the rains falling in those mountains the nile has ever since the memory of man begun to swell the   th of june new style it rises every day about   or  0 inches and begins to fall in august decreaseth till may when it is in a manner stagnating the limits of its height are from    the highest of all to    the lowest in cubits the middle       is a height barely sufficient to make an inundation its water not only refreshes the air with a kindly moisture but is the most delicious drink in the world when purified by the deposition of its sediment being of it self a cure for most distempers where dilution a diuresis or sweating is necessary which prosper alpinus found by experience during the time of the increase of the nile the clouds pass over egypt driven by the northerly winds and no doubt fall down in the mountains and contribute to moisten and cool the air prosper alpinus gives credit to the experiment of judging of the increase of the nile by a lump of earth taken out of the river and kept dry which begins to increase in weight as the river begins to swell and by the quantity of this increase they judge of the quantity of the inundation that the earth will increase by moisture is certain that the quantity of moisture may be a measure for that of the rain and that for the quantity of the inundation are all probable but a sponge perhaps might be a better hygrometer than the earth of the river  vi there are several things remarkable in the constitution of the egyptian air the perspiration of the soil which is sandy and barren cannot affect the air very much the exhalations being mostly either from the surface of the inundation or the mud and slime after it is over the natural heat and dryness of the air and the change from that to cooler moisture the abatement of the tropical heats by northerly winds the extremity of heat and drought by the southerly winds blowing over sands and the moisture again induced by the clouds from the mediterranean and the inundation the exhalations from stagnating and putrid water when the inundation is quite over and lastly the temperance and regular diet of most of the inhabitants must give a fair experiment of the effects of air upon human constitutions accordingly those who labor live hard and cannot defend themselves from the injuries of the wind mostly dry and hot are extremely lean and squalid the rich by a plentiful and nourishing diet and preserving themselves from the heat and drought by bathing relaxation of their fibers by drinking the water of the nile are often fat  vii the air of egypt having no noxious qualities from the perspiration of the ground were it not from the accidental ones abovementioned would be extremely wholesome and the people who know how to defend themselves from those accidents live to great ages the frequent changes of heat and cold moisture and drought produce all the distempers of the catarhous kind arthritick diseases and by the strong perspiration leprosies even the elephantiasis the effects of a hot dry air by a southerly wind blowing over a sandy country are felt strongly inflammatory distempers especially a raging fever with a phrensy called demelmuia mortal in a few hours they feel likewise all the good effects of the abatement of this heat and drought by northerly winds the overflowing of the nile they are likewise subject to all the diseases from putrid and stagnating water and exhalations from heat after the inundation is over and these are often pestilential therefore such as can live remote from the channel of the river  viii pestilential distempers are frequent in egypt it is a popular opinion there that they are brought from syria barbary and constantinople all i can infer from hence is that the plague has something infamous as well as terrible and no country will own it to be their own product for the people of constantinople allege it is imported to them from egypt but what i think demonstrates the plague to be endemial to egypt is its regular invasion and going off at certain seasons beginning about september the time of subsidence of the nile and ending in june the time of the inundation in the first case are all the causes productive of putrefaction heat and putrid exhalations and no winter frost to check them but what is wonderful the plague and the fevers from the heat of the campsin go off by the northerly winds and the overflowing of the nile the wholesome quality of northerly winds for checking pestilential distempers has been observed by all ancient physicians and to show that the plague depends upon the temperature of the air prosper alpinus takes notice that upon the swelling of the nile the infection and even the danger from infected clothes and furniture goes off besides the cooling of the air the northerly winds may dissipate the stagnating vapors and the running of the nile the stagnating water galen and hippocrates both observed that the elysian or northerly winds blowing in summer made a wholesome season this observation is more sensible in hot countries than in ours  ix i thought it worth while to inquire into the effects of the air within the tropic and particularly in some place under the line it happens luckily that boutius a very learned and sagacious physician has left us a description of the air and diseases of the inhabitants of java though its situation under the line must make it hot and as therefore some would imagine extremely dry boutius says it is moist from the great quantities of rain and stagnant water and from moisture and heat and perhaps from salts produced from those qualities the putrefying quality of the air is very manifest in rotting of clothes and rusting of metals from these qualities the air feels to human bodies piercing and active all the inhabitants of hot countries have that sensation of the penetrating quality of air cold after great heats which perhaps proceeds chiefly from the pores of their skin being relaxed before by heat such bodies must imbibe the outward air faster in java as in egypt the northerly winds render the air wholesome by abating the extreme heat some land winds carrying along with them the stagnant vapors are often otherwise the soil being fruitful and rich emits steams consisting of volatile and active parts which fructify the soil but are hurtful to human bodies the seasons here cannot be distinguished by their heat by reason of the smallness of their latitude there are only two what may be called winter is the rainy season this season is attended with diseases which depend upon putrefaction the inhabitants measure their seasons of heat and cold by the times of the day the mornings and nights are cooler by the absence of the sun and by the sea breezes the scorching heat of the middle of the day makes that time unfit for business  x the popular diseases here are  st a species of palsy called by the inhabitants of this and some other countries of the east indies beriberium the cause of which is evidently cold air imbibed by the pores of the skin extremely relaxed by heat before and therefore invades such as incautiously expose themselves to the morning air or throw their bedclothes off in the night another nervous disease called catalepsis is likewise popular in this country and proceeds from the penetrating quality of the air imbibed by relaxed bodies in this disease the patient grows rigid like a statue and dies in a few hours diarrhoeas and dysenteries are common from the same cause from sudden suppressions of perspiration the plentiful use of cold fruits from the same causes they invade us in autumn it is matter of observation that great heats exalt the bile perhaps by the exhaustion of the watery particles which dilute it by a strong sensible perspiration and therefore the cholera morbus and other diseases of the liver are common and fatal in the east indies and from diseased livers dropsies are common in java atrophies are likewise frequent in java in this country then fevers are seldom intermitting but continual with phrensies and other dreadful symptoms as during the campsin in egypt proving mortal in a short time the author describes a species of fever in the islands of solor and tymon with very particular symptoms if the fever interrnits the patient is seized with convulsions resembling a  viti the inhabitants ascribe this disease to the exhalations of the santalum tree there are likewise spittings of blood and ulcers in the lungs in such as expose themselves to the night air the author takes notice of blindness as being common in the coasts of amboyna and the molucca islands which the inhabitants ascribe to the immoderate use of hot rice therefore they expose their rice after it is boiled to the cool air perhaps they may be mistaken likewise as to the cause of this  xi the diseases of fort st george though it lies in    degrees of northern latitude resemble very much those above described in java when the wind blows from the westerly points from april to the end of july it renders the air so hot and dry that were it not for seabreezes from the southeast in the afternoons the inhabitants could not bear it the effects of this heat are a dense thick blood inflammatory diseases fevers with phrensies cholera morbus beriberium the barbiers as the inhabitants call it here the same and depending upon the same cause as that in java from the middle of october to the beginning or middle of december the wind blows commonly between the north and east and is called their monsoon or rainy season the most remarkable diseases of that season are obstinate diarrhoeas from the moisture and coolness of the air and i believe it will be found an observation generally true that a wet season produces catarrhs or serosities of all kinds likewise putrid fevers and intermitting fevers for during the extreme heats the fevers are continual the air is temperate from december to march the acute diseases which invade in that season especially the smallpox are less dangerous than those which invade in a hotter  xii the effects of air extremely cold you will find in the journals of such as have navigated in great northern latitudes or have wintered in greenland and other countries these are taken notice of no xvi of the third chapter and must needs be very different and destroy mankind by another class of symptoms than those of hot air what joseph dacosta says of the coldness of one mountain of peru seems to make it exceed even that of greenland in winter its fatal effect upon human bodies being more sudden by a few observations collected in this chapter the reader may easily perceive that upon a general notion of the weather and diseases of different countries a piece of knowledge almost scientifick might be founded not incurious or useless to mankind  xiii there are some few modern physicians who have left us observations of the seasons and the cotemporary epidemical diseases as bernardini ramazini a physician of modena who has distinguished himself by several ingenious pieces which he has published in his history of the constitutions of the years    0                     and the epidemical diseases about modena and the adjacent countries there are many things remarkable in the year    0 after four or five years preceding of great drought attended with great plenty there began to fall in the spring      great rains upon which ensued a most destructive mildew upon the corn and legumes the rains still increased and continued the year    0 with this destructive plague amongst the vegetables which ramazini observes to be often succeeded with epidemical diseases amongst mankind the whole year was cold cloudy rainy attended with a great inundation of the po and other rivers the country being all covered over with water what was observable was the silence of the grasshoppers and croking of frogs and bees not making honey no remarkable diseases in the winter because the heat had not begun to raise the vapors a great run of intermitting fevers in the spring which still multiplied and ended in double tertians in the summer which were the most epidemical that ever were known and the country more unhealthy than the towns an unusual vermination or quantity of worms in human bodies parotids suppurating diarrhoeas and all other catarrhous distempers these fevers not very mortal considering the vast numbers that were seized except amongst children and tender women no continued fevers other animals sickly cattle with eruptions about their heads what was still most remarkable was the nocturnal accession of the fevers being the worst and a great relaxation or debility of patients till the sun was up the fever depending upon acidity rather than bile and for that reason the bark was generally ineffectual and the copious use of wine generally beneficial ramazini assigns probable causes for all those symptoms the unusual vermination caused by indigestion of the eggs of insects which are commonly taken in with aliment sucklings dying from the acidity and other bad qualities of the nurses milk he reckons the silence of grasshoppers a presage of a sickly time and quotes mercurialis who observed the same thing at padua in      the      was directly contrary in its temperament to the preceding a frosty dry winter a hot dry spring a hot summer and as the seasons so were the symptoms of diseases almost opposite the popular diseases of the winter were apoplexies quinzies pleurisies inflammations of the lungs catarrhs all with sizy blood letting of blood and whatever gave fluxility to it relieved the country people who used labor and exercise were more healthy than citizens in cold dry weather the inhabitants of the country and cities are equally free from the noxious qualities of the perspiration of the earth therefore the advantage as to the other qualities of the air is on the countrys side especially in distempers inflammatory because of the less exercise more plentiful and less simple diet of citizens in the spring scabious irruptions upon the skin were epidemical this perhaps from the acidity of the blood contracted the former year and the salts retained beginning now to perspire by heat madness amongst the dogs was epidemical from great heat and drought a prodigious number of fevers of the bilious kind in the summer which turned mortal in the autumn the remedies of which were directly opposite to those of the fevers of the preceding year for these wanted cordials and as it were a spur but those of the year      wanted a bridle and were generally relieved by bloodletting cooling acid medicines all the symptoms proceeding from a bilious acrimony the bark which had been ineffectual in the intermittents of the former year was successful in this ramazini observes in the succeeding years                though dissimular in their temperature yet were not very unlike in their epidemical diseases but especially in a petechial or spotted fever which raged most at the new and full moon he ascribes this to an unusual duration of southerly winds which has been observed by all physicians to make an unwholsom constitution of air he ascribes it to this cause because the inhabitants of the foot of the appennines being defended from the southerly winds were not infested with these petechial fevers i think i may venture to add one reflection to those of the judicious author that if the great rains and moisture of the year    0 had been succeeded with great heat the fevers would have put on another genius and perhaps been pestilential  xiv there is also published the epidemical history of germany by several eminent physicians in which the reader will find many things remarkable which it would be too tedious to insert but from which we shall draw some observations in the last chapter our learned president sir hans sloan has given us a journal of the weather of jamaica and the history of the popular diseases of that country the resemblance of the constitution and diet of the inhabitants to those of their mother country occasion a great affinity likewise in the popular diseases except in some few cases which are the product of a warmer climate but as there is still a great penury of such observations all we can do is to reason from the laws of mechanics and the known properties and qualities of air what must be their natural effects it seems agreeable to reason and experience that the air operates sensibly in forming the constitutions of mankind the specialities of features complexion temper and consequently the manners of mankind which are found to vary much in different countries and climates as to features what an infinite variety arises from the combination of the parts of a human face so that since the creation of the world perhaps there were never two that upon a narrow inspection perfectly resembled one another there are faces not only individual but gentilitious and national european asiatick chinese african grecian faces are characterisd this diversity of national features and shapes is not altogether the effect of propagation from the same original stock for it is known by experience that transplantation changes the stature and outward shape both of plants and animals hippocrates makes great account of the influence of the air upon the foetus both before and after birth he is of opinion that the great variety of european faces is owing to that of the air and seasons there being such great excursions in the extremities of heat and cold their offspring is at it were begot and brought forth in different climates that the shape of animals should be modified by the air is no ways unaccountable an animal growing expands its fibers in the air as a fluid which by a gentle pressure resists the motion of the heart in the expansion and elongation of the fibers and though the fibers of several animals shoot as it were in this fluid according to their original shapes yet such a fluid resisting by its pressure is in respect to the animal like a soft mold in which the body is formed and therefore according to the quantity of its pressure depending upon its most permanent state of dense rare hot cold dry moist must have some influence in forming the outward figure of such a body in a state of accretion besides this outward pressure the air being mixed with the animal fluids determines their condition as to rarity density viscosity tenuity and several other qualities  xvi that the complexion depends much upon the air is plain from experience the complexion of the inhabitants of several countries being fair swarthy black and adust according to the degrees of heat drought moisture or coolness of the air the inhabitants of countries in great latitudes are generally fairer than those that live nearer the sun  xvii that the temper and passions are influenced by the air is no less certain people of delicate nerves and moveable spirits are often joyful sullen sprightly dejected hopeful despairing according to the weather and these changes happen but pass unobserved in stronger constitutions there are days in which the intellectual faculties of memory imagination judgment are more vigorous therefore it seems probable that the genius of nations depends upon that of their air arts and sciences have hardly ever appeared in very great or very small latitudes the inhabitants of some countries succeed best in those arts which require industry and great application of mind others in such as require imagination from hence some countries produce better mathematicians philosophers and mechanics others better painters statuaries architects and poets which besides the rules of art demand imagination it seems to me that labor is more tolerable to the inhabitants of colder climates and liveliness of imagination to those of hot  xviii there are two things common to all mankind air and aliment both indeed differ very much in their qualities in different countries and climates but those of the air are perhaps more different than those of the aliment in perusing the accounts of the temper and genius of the inhabitants of different countries we discover in them a great uniformity even though the race has been changed the temper of the gauls described by caesar and other writers is much the same with that of the present french there is a remarkable instance of this in the misopogon of the emperor julian if i rightly remember he tells us that he had passed a winter at paris where there were more comedians dancers and fiddlers than there were citizens besides and i believe if a race of laplanders were transplanted thither in a few years they would be found in the condition described by the emperor julian how is the rugged temper of the northern nation mellowd by the softer air of the countries which they conquered governments stamp the manners but cannot change the genius and temper of the inhabitants and as far as they are unrestrained by laws their passions and consequently their national virtues and vices will bear some conformity with the temperature of the air the inhabitants of cio are described by the ancient greeks as loose and dissolute and voluptuous and so they are at present some modern travelers affirm that there is a softness in their air that disposes to a sort of indolence and mirth nations as well as individuals have their constitutional vices and i think there is no stronger proof of the force of christian morality than the reformation it produced in national vices in primitive times when it was believed and practiced in its perfection  xix if we consider the causes assigned by hippocrates of the different temper of the inhabitants of different climates we shall find them sufficiently proportioned to their effects in northern countries where the alterations of the height of the barometer and consequently of the weight of the air are frequent and great the fibers of human bodies are in a continual oscillatory motion from a pressure of   00   00 yea   00 more at one time than another and though this by the softness and rarity of the fluid is insensible and not dolorifick it is a sort of exercise which the inhabitants of countries where the variation of the height of the mercury is small or nothing by the difference of the tension of the fibers the whole nervous system and the animal spirits are in some measure affected let us again consider the extremes of heat and cold in great latitudes operating after the same manner relaxing and constringing the fibers by turns and the extreme cold acting likewise as a stimulus in consequence of which we find an activity and tolerance of motion and labor in dry frosty weather more than in hot whereas the people within the tropicks are constantly in the state of our hottest weather whoever considers mankind in such different circumstances will find that the temper both of their body and mind must be different and that a greater variety in the oscillatory motion of the fibers of northern people must produce the same in their spirits and therefore a proportional inequality in their passions and consequently greater activity and courage that the inhabitants of climates where the difference of the weight heat and cold of the air is but small feel only the changes of the tension of their fibers proceeding from drought and moisture being free from the agitations and uneasy sensations of northern people proceeding from the causes above enumerated and the motions of their fibers and spirits being more uniform they may be for that reason and from excessive heats lazy and indolent from inactivity and indolence there will follow naturally a flavish disposition or an aversion to contend with such as have got the mastery of them hippocrates tells us that the europeans owe their courage to the variety and coldness of their climate and their laws which secure their property to their courage thus far i have ventured to explain the philosophy of this sagacious old man by mechanical causes arising from the properties and qualities of the air to which i shall add another somewhat foreign to my subject that in countries which do not produce without much labor the landholder must have assurance of the necessaries for his culture as his seed granary domicile workingtools etc this must create some property and where there is property there must be laws to secure it from which i beg leave to draw one corollary that despotick governments though destructive of mankind in general are most improper in cold climates for where great labor is necessary the workman ought to have a certain title to the fruits of it there are degrees of slavery and generally speaking it is most extreme in some hot and fruitful countries  xx i will venture to add another observation which though it may seem a little too much refined is not improbable that the air has an influence in forming the languages of mankind the serrated close way of speaking of northern nations may be owing to their reluctance to open their mouth wide in cold air which must make their language abound in consonants whereas from a contrary cause the inhabitants of warmer climates opening their mouths must form a softer language abounding in vowels another observation is that people in windy countries naturally speak loud to make themselves be heard in the open air  xxi that the constitutions of mankind differ according to the qualities of the air in which they live is an uncontested matter of fact and depends upon obvious causes hippocrates observed that the inhabitants of moist countries were bloated leucophlegmatick and dull from the relaxation of their fibers and the moisture imbibed with the air and contrary causes must produce contrary effects heat indeed relaxeth the fibers but by absorbing the moisture may likewise harden and render them more solid the bones of animals in hot countries are more solid and specifically heavier than of those in cold climates as may be seen in comparing the bones of the limbs of african horses and those of northern countries the blood too in hot countries is thicker and blacker by the dissipation of the serous part by sensible perspiration this is matter of fact attested by physicians who have practiced in those hot countries from this black adust state of their blood they are atrabilarious great heats exalt the bile by dissipating the moisture which dilutes it bile of it self is the most unperspirable of animal fluids it stops at the surface of the skin and discolours it the animal juices in hot countries are more exalted this is true in venomous creatures there is some analogy between plants and animals and both are longer in coming to maturity in cold and moist air the prolifick age of mankind is much earlier in hot than cold countries the females being in that state at ten years of age the inhabitants of warm countries are not subject to be fat for a strong perspiration keeps an animal from being so a copious diet and inactivity will always occasion exceptions from the general rule  xxii cold and moist air must necessarily produce phlegmatic and lax constitutions and by stopping perspiration with a copious diet accumulate the animal oil dry and cold air in a degree tolerable to human bodies which is the state of our winter frosts creates a strict constitution of the fibers and all the effects thereon depending vigor and activity  xxiii as to different heights and regions of the air it seems probable that the constitutions of miners and mountaineers must differ considerably and i wish the differences were well observed mountaineers by having a less pressure of air upon them must exert a greater degree of muscular strength like birds who move in a rarer element and by steep ascents and descents a greater variety and force in progressive motion the coldness of their air in some measure balanceth the deficient pressure by weight these causes naturally produce strength and activity and even the pride and ferocity ascribed to them by hippocrates as air has a great influence upon the fluids and solids of human bodies it will stamp and form them according to its most permanent state during the cycle or period of the season in that region of the earth but leaving this matter to be further pursued when there are more data from natural history to proceed upon i shall make a few observations upon the qualities of the air as far as they are nosopoetick that is have a power of producing diseases  xxiv popular diseases depend upon what is common to all the people these are chiefly air and aliment it is easy to distinguish the effects of both the genuine effects of air in producing diseases is best discovered in people who live on wholesome aliment and are temperate  xxv acute popular diseases are commonly the effects of the temperature of the air they often invade at stated seasons of the year their rifeness duration different symptoms and periods seem to depend upon the alterations of the weather and the state of the air preceding and consequent upon these alterations i think this may be inferred from the great uniformity that is observed in the symptoms of the epidemical diseases of the same season i believe no body doubts that the late distemper which affected all europe was the pure and genuine effect of the state of the air a person in perfect health going into a place infected with an epidemical disease shall be seized with it without any other error in his diet and even without suspicion of infection  xxvi as the force of human bodies is limited they are not capable to bear extremities of any kind of too great rarity density heat cold moisture drought in the air from the same cause human bodies do not easily sustain violent and sudden changes which agitate the fluids and solids too much for as the state of our fluids and solids change with the air violent alterations in the latter produce the same in the former therefore variable weather is commonly productive of diseases for example suppose such a state of the air as makes a great stricture of all the external parts of the body and consequently an abatement of the circulation in the vessels exposed to the air and in those which immediately communicate with them suppose again the air is suddenly changed from this state to one which violently relaxeth the fibers by their relaxation it is possible that the vessels which were destined before to carry the serum or lymph may admit the blood which is an inflammatory state accordingly we find that inflammatory distempers of several kinds are rife in moist and warm weather preceded by hard and lasting frosts frost stops the perspiration of the earth which being restored by thaw fills the air with an unusual quantity of vapors which affect human bodies not only by relaxation but as they imbibe them with the air  xxvii the weather and diseases of countries have a good deal of uniformity but the unusual excesses of heat cold moisture and drought produce either a greater plenty or unusual symptoms in diseases and operate more strongly if the alterations are sudden and extreme  xxviii by the doctrine and observations of chap iii it is plain that human bodies cannot long sustain heat approaching to their natural heat far less that exceeding it an animal dies of an inflammatory distemper with all the symptoms of putrefaction in a sugarbakers dryingroom there are some countries in which during their greatest heats wax will melt mankind without some defenses by art cannot bear such an air the symptoms which one feels in extremely hot weather are feverish a pulse quicker than natural profuse sweats great thirst debility dejection of appetite by great sweats the blood is rendered dense by debility the force of the heart itself is diminished and indeed by the continuance of the heat the whole body in time may be rendered dry and squalid add to this sudden refrigeration by cool air so desirable to mankind in such a state for the sake of which they often incautiously expose themselves i say it is very accountable how such a constitution of the air may work as a stimulus and produce dangerous continued fevers and that catarrhs and diseases depending upon defluxions of serosity upon any part of the body in coughs rheumatisms gouts diarrhoeas should in such a constitution much abound both by suppression of perspiration and by a sudden admission imbibing of this serosity by all the pores of the skin of cool air and then he may undergo all those symptoms in a greater degree accordingly hot days with cool nights are commonly productive of diarrhoeas such is our weather in the autumn  xxix heat as was observed numb xix of this chapter naturally exalts the bile therefore bilious fevers and cholera morbus may be the natural product of such a hot constitution of air  xxx cold both congeals the fluids and constringeth the solids it acts like a small ligature upon the vessels by which the circulation through the vessels is retarded the natural effect of which is a greater secretion of serosity through the glands contiguous for the extremities of the vessels near the glands being pressed they cannot so plentifully carry off the refluent fluid by which there must be a greater flux of liquor toward the glands and a greater consequently from its emunctories therefore catarrhs or serous defluxions upon all the parts of the body but especially from the glands of the head and throat are a natural effect of cold  xxxi obstructions by cold in the outward parts of the body drive the blood pressing with a greater force upon the inward parts and increase heat sizy blood may be another effect of cold this is extremely well illustrated by the ingenious dr thomas simson chandos professor of physic in the university of st andrew who has explained the effects of cold upon the humors very clearly by a plain experiment showing that blood after a strong ligature upon any joint will be sizy upon the letting it out of the vein with a free stream and the professor reasons very justly if the white chyle is made red by the force of motion by the retardation of this circulation in some parts the blood may grow white and crude again cold is a small sort of ligature upon the vessel affected with it constringing the vessel  xxxii it was observed no xxii chap iii that these qualities of the air act either by the sums or their differences as they conspire in the same effect or act oppositely thus heat and moisture both relax but if the air is cold with moisture in that case the vessels may be constringed and such a constitution may produce all the effects of cold water relaxeth all fibers vegetable and animal yet a cold bath constringeth the fibers for a while any moist steam relaxeth in proportion to its heat besides water may obstruct as well as relax  xxxiii the more pliant the vessels are as in tender and young people they are more sensible of impressions by the outward air they have a greater play in the degrees of tension than the vessels of old people therefore the qualities of the air in constringing and relaxing the fibers produce greater effects upon them the longer animal fibers are kept in any state the more they lose their power of restoring themselves therefore the most permanent state of the air of any country may produce endemial chronical diseases  xxxiv cold is capable of producing all the diseases which depend upon too great a stricture of the fibers and by diminishing the quantity of perspiration either increases that of the other secretions or produces a greater fullness and inward heat the summer perspiration being near double of that of winter the appetite and consequently the aliment not diminished may induce all the symptoms of a plethora if the other secretions are not proportionally increased  xxxv cold by suppressing the perspiration of salts in the blood by congealing the blood and likewise by a dolorifick stimulus corroding the skin is apt to produce scurvies and other cutaneous irruptions and in extremity is capable of freezing the fluids and reducing animal substances to a gangrenous state  xxxvi cold air is capable of making inflammatory distempers with cutaneous irruptions more dangerous by hindering the relaxation of the skin i believe it will be found that the smallpox is most fatal during hard frosts and cold northeasterly winds i remember that the smallpox which were exceeding mortal during such a season grew more favorable by the tepor and moisture in april and may the artificial qualities produced in the air of the patients room are not sufficient to balance its natural state  xxxvii cold air by its immediate contact with the surface of the lungs is capable of abating or stopping the circulation of the blood and bringing them into an inflammatory state and by producing catarrhs and coughs is productive of all the effects of such defluxions upon the lungs ulcerations and all sorts of pulmonick consumptions  xxxviii as to moisture and drought the excesses of them most necessarily bring human bodies into a morbid state because they are incapable of bearing these extremes there is a certain degree of humidity necessary to relax the outward parts of the body to preserve the pores of the skin in their due symetry the same due degree of humidity is perhaps necessary to be absorbed with the air by the pores of the skin  xxxix long droughts have been found most dangerous of all to human bodies the year   0  the coldest winter that perhaps was ever felt in england was not attended with any great mortality amongst mankind the year following   0  was the wettest that was ever known there having fallen about    inches of rain in essex yet there were no extraordinary diseases nor mortality that year the year succeeding indeed the smallpox were rife and mortal the year      was the driest year that has been yet observed there having fallen that year in essex not much above    inches of rain so that the difference as to moisture between   0  and      was above half and their proportion as    to    the bills of mortality in london in      increased      and the mortality begun that year amongst the cattle there has been an unusual drought for these two years past for i think the best estimation of the dryness of the surface of the earth must be taken from the falling of the springs the consequence of which has been unusual diseases amongst several animals and a great mortality amongst mankind it is true this did not happen during the dry weather the sudden alteration as well as the preceding state might operate the surface of the earth being by the drought first shut up and afterward opened by the rain might affect human bodies variously as in warm weather and thaws after great frosts  xl moisture relaxeth unless it be combined with a greater degree of cold which subducts so much of its relaxing quality the inhabitants of cold and moist countries are leucophlegmatick bloated and have all the symptoms of relaxation therefore effects of such a state of air are all the diseases which the methodists class under the title of the laxum if air is imbibed by human bodies the watery parts and perhaps these chiefly enter and catarrhous distempers seem to depend upon the moisture as well as the coldness of the air the least moisture taken in by the windpipe immediately is rejected by coughing it is not merely the suppression of perspiration by cold or moisture that is the cause of the coughs and defluxions upon the breast by inducing a plethora and a proportional one in the glands but the moist air is really imbibed and affects the glands by immediate contact or as a stimulus it appears by the journals of perspiration that coughs and colds have often invaded where there was no suppression of perspiration and that a suppression of perspiration is not always attended with a cough or a cold moisture imbibed with the air after relaxation of the pores of the skin may affect all the glandulous parts of the body even those of the guts producing diarrhoeas i know it to be true by experience that moist air is productive of nephritick colicks in such as are subject to them however i propose this as a probability which by future observations and experiments may be better cleared  xli hot and moist air producing relaxations and consequently an abatement of the force of the solids in propelling the fluids must produce stagnation tumors and putrefaction in the liquids and all the other diseases depending upon a lax state of fibers hippocrates observed such diseases always consequent upon a moist constitution of air with southerly winds which are warm and i have observed the same in this country as perspiration is the last action of perfect animal digestion that constitution of air which suppresseth perspiration must hinder digestion therefore cold and moist air must be hurtful to stomachicks catarrhs and coughs are the effect of cold and moist air and those habitually affecting the lungs may produce pulmonick consumptions yet it seems probable that where those consumptions are a popular disease they proceed from some particular acrimony in the air of that country affecting that tender organ by immediate contact and perhaps all the glands of the body for our consumptions are scrophulous scrophulous distempers are very common in this country if the air be charged with any saline acid particles they will naturally coagulate the fluid where they touch from the abundance of mineral waters of all sorts in england it may be inferred that there are abundance of mineral steams  xlii the surgeons prove the effects of air in their profession even more than the physicians for when the fibers of human bodies gape by a wound or sore the outward air has an immediate access to the open vessels and affects the fluids in them by immediate contact and affects a wounded part as it were raw flesh the healing of this wound or the union of its parts is performed by the elongation of the fibers and that depends both upon the state of the influent fluid and its vascular fibers as to flexibility rigidity strength or degrees of resistance and those depend very much upon the air which is in immediate contact for example a wound in cold frosty weather must gape more because the cold contracts the fibers more than tepid weather therefore in the latter the fibers must be more pliant and flexible such a constitution of the air as would naturally putrify raw flesh must endanger by a mortification defenses by emplastick applications are not sufficient to defend a wound or sore from being affected with the air which touches it therefore surgeons are somewhat nice in the choice of the seasons in which they perform certain operations from the qualities of the air it happens that wounds in different parts of the body are some easier some harder to be cured in different countries an eminent surgeon of our army during the last war with france was pleased to tell me two very remarkable things relating to this subject one was that after the battle of hochsted the wounded in the hospital of norlingen in germany fell all into adematous swellings of which many miscarried that after they were removed into another air this symptom went off another observation was that at the siege of lisle there was a great disposition in every wound to turn gangrenous especially those of the head so that few recovered of those that were trepand this he observed to be peculiar either to that season or to that place in the hospitals at paris wounds in the head are much disposed to gangrenes  xliii from what has been said on the subject of the effects of the air on human bodies it is plain that no vicious state either of the solids or fluids but is producible by the common properties and qualities of air and their changes and combinations by the qualities of air the solid parts may be stimulated for example the stimulus of extreme cold is very sensible heat or any quality of air so excessive as to produce a dolorifick sensation acts as a stimulus what obstructs the passages of the vessels which communicate with the air is stimulating by increasing the force of the heart and the fibers to overcome the obstruction this either cold or moisture may do which often produce first chilness and then a succeeding heat which are feverish symptoms many volatile particles floating in the air as the odoriferous of vegetables act as a stimulus and we find can produce headaches that the fibers are constringed and relaxed by the alternations of the properties and qualities of the air we have already demonstrated that the fluids may be vitiated in the same manner is no less plain that the blood may be condensed by heat by absorbing the most fluid part that a certain degree of heat will attenuate and a greater coagulate the serum and heat in general is capable of producing great acrimony and putrid fevers of all sorts is true from experience and any degree of heat greater than that of a human body will do so for our natural heat is near the degree of coagulation cold likewise condenseth the fluids in immediate contact with it cold is capable of producing sizeness and viscosity in the blood by the same causes acrimony of all sorts to the degree of putrefaction is producible by air evacuations of all sorts from all the glandulous parts of the body are producible by the stoppage of perspiration for example there is no diuretic medicine which works so strong in a flux of urine as a suppression of perspirable matter in hysterical cases cold promotes all catarrhs coughs and moist air diarrhoeas and copious secretions from the glands of the guts without which evacuations stoppage of perspiration produces a plethora or accumulation of the humors in the vessels from these considerations it appears that the diseases especially the acute of any season chiefly depend upon the constitution of the air by which they are modified as to their rifeness duration degrees of danger their particular symptoms circulations and periods in which we must not only consider the present but the preceding state of the air because as they are more similar or contrary the alterations produced in human bodies are less or more violent particularly i believe it will be found that sudden changes from the extremes of cold and dry to heat and moisture are causes which operate strongly in modifying the diseases of that season that long and excessive heats by inducing debility are apt to stamp the succeeding fevers with nervous symptoms that such a dry constitution of air as is apt to curb the skin and obstruct its pores makes the crisis by sweating more difficult perhaps the different periods of fevers quotidian tertian quartan may depend upon a preceding greater viscosity or obstruction in the vessels produced by the constitution of the air that the more dangerous state of smallpox and other inflammatory cutaneous irruptions depends upon the air i think seems very plain as it induces a greater laxity or stricture of the fibers or creates a greater obstruction in the vessels of the skin that diseases of the lungs as far as they are not the product of bad diet depend chiefly upon the qualities of the air seems evident the lungs are exposed to the outward air which has an immediate admission into the airbladders and perhaps into the blood vessels and whatever effect the air has upon the skin this must be expected upon the lungs in a particular manner it is needless to enumerate many particulars which the reader may easily collect from the chapter that treats of respiration  xliv i have hitherto considered only the common properties and qualities of the air which are sensible and shown that they are productive of all the symptoms of diseases and for which there is no occasion to have recourse to its qualities occult or extraordinary which probably it is often endued with for besides the qualities of hot cold moist dry the air may be saline oily both which qualities it discovers sometimes by its effects on bodies besides from the action of the heterogeneous bodies contained in it some new substances may be produced of a nature different from the ingredients the saline exhalations from the earth may be different at different times such salts exhaled at particular times from the earth may enter human bodies and operate like poisons and suddenly infect the whole mass of blood as the venom of a poisonous animal or as other substances injected into the blood vessels which produce immediately mortal symptoms or they may operate more slowly and produce unusual diseases this is not an impossible nor improbable supposition yet there is no necessity always to have recourse to it there being no change in human bodies known but is producible by the contents properties and qualities which we are sure the air is endued with and especially by their great enormities and sudden successions and alternations to such occult qualities in the air many have ascribed plagues and pestilential distempers upon which i shall make a few remarks in the following chapter  chap vii remarks on the pest and pestilential fevers as far as they are influenced by the air i that it is very difficult to come at truth in the history of plagues this is not to be wondered at considering the terror superstition and credulity of the vulgar and the public disorder during pestilential seasons there never was any plague better attended nor better inquired into by physicians than the last of marseilles yet the facts especially those relating to its original cause asserted by some of the town physicians are as positively denied by the physicians sent down by the regent and perhaps upon a more exact inquiry and better evidence  ii there is something infamous as well as terrible in the plague so that no nation will own it to be natural to their country prosper alpinus the egyptians affirm it is brought to them from barbary syria and greece the people again in and about constantinople affirm as confidently that it is brought to them from egypt as far as the plague depends upon the air these questions seem naturally to arise whether any constitution of air is capable of producing it in a place where it was not brought by infection what influence the air has in propagating it in a matter both so uncertain and important i shall hardly venture to determine positively but lay the evidence fairly before the reader and leave him to judge and for the sake of some readers i think it necessary to explain some terms of art  iii an endemial disease is what is common to the people of the country a disease is epidemical when it affects multitudes at any particular season or time a sporadical disease is an endemial disease when in a particular season affects but a few people i shall likewise beg leave to adopt another word an indigenous disease is what is natural only to one country and from it propagated to others by infection for example the smallpox was perhaps a disease indiginous to arabia and from thence propagated amongst all mankind but now in those places where it has once come it may be properly said to be endemial or popular but not indigenous there is no need of any new infection from its original country to carry it on and it has become almost universal missing few who live long enough to have it this is manifestly different from the case of the plague for though it has been at times and great intervals of years in most countries of europe and during those seasons epidemical yet one can hardly call it endemial except in some places of turkey where the plague invades and goes off regularly at stated seasons it is probably there both an indiginous and endemial disease  iv the plague seems to be a particular disease characterisd with its proper symptoms which are nearly uniform wherever it invades an inflammatory distemper with eruptions upon the external parts of the body in buboes by the inflammation and suppuration of the axillary inguinal and other glands or in beginning gangrenes by carbuncles in some parts or spots red livid black over all the body or lastly in stigmata or what they call the tokens which are mortifications quite complete the parts being insensible  v the symptoms of the plague resemble those of other inflammatory distempers with eruptions particularly st anthonys fire in which after a continued fever of two days invading with a rigor there appears a tumor discoloration and a sort of carbuncles upon the skin at the same time the axillary glands are often inflamed and sometimes suppurated this analogy between the plague and st anthonys fire was observed by dr sydenham there is the same analogy between the plague and the smallpox the fever invades in both cases with the same symptoms pains in the head back vomiting anxiety sparkling eyes high color in the face etc this fever after two days produces in the plague an inflammation and tumor in some glands about the head neck armpits groin in the smallpox the same in the glands of the skin these glands in both cases suppurating kindly make what one may call a favorable plague or smallpox if those eruptions end in gangrenes in either case it proves the disease to be dangerous or mortal according to the number or condition of them the sudden deaths in the plague seem as in the smallpox of such as die in the first stage of the disease only the plague more malignant the prognostics both in the plague and smallpox depend upon the same principles and the danger in both to subjects of the same kind as to childing women young vigorous people after irregularities of diet in such it begins with haemorrages especially bloody urine such symptoms being the marks of the degrees of inflammation astriction of the belly in the beginning of the distemper is good in both cases buboes increasing fast flatulent without the natural inflammation and suppuration buboes too hard and horny or with a rainbow that is a mortification about them fatal in the plague in short buboes well inflamed producing a laudable matter generally end well these prognostics are analagous and hold in the smallpox nor do i mention these things as strange since they depend upon the same causes but only to show that the plague seems to be an inflammatory distemper of its own kind like the smallpox the havoc made in the inward parts by the plague and smallpox is much alike what likewise proves the plague to be a species of disease different from all others is that if we can believe the relations of travelers there are countries where it never was at all as the east indies china the kingdom of timquine cochine china and most places of the west indies those considerations make it probable that it is a disease indigenous to some tract of ground and from thence propagated to other places by contagion and yet  vi as to the first question whether the air is capable of producing the plague without infection in a place where it is not an endemial disease i think the affirmative is very probable for first in a country where it is both an indigenous and endemial disease it must be probably owing to some particular quality of the air secondly it has been proved by the doctrine of the foregoing part of this essay that there is hardly any alteration even to the utmost degree of putrefaction but may be produced by the enormities combinations and alternations of the common qualities of the air and that still more extraordinary effects may be produced by some contagion of the air by uncommon effluvia from bodies near the surface of the earth the honorable mr boil a philosopher most learned in physiology of the air gives instances of steams of a particular nature being emitted from the earth at particular times that mines will emit steams noxious to vegetables at particular times that there may be indeed some tracts of ground free from such minerals as emit those noxious effluvia and consequently free from the plague as proceeding from the local qualities of their air but then those effluvia may be carried and mixed with the air of that place by winds mezeray tells us that the plague which happened in france in the year      the most universal and fatal that ever was known began in the kingdom of cathay by a vapor most horridly foetid that breaking out of the earth like a kind of subterraneal fire consumed and devoured above  00 leagues of that country even to the trees and stones and infected the air after a wonderful manner that from thence it passed through asia into greece africa and europe the learned philosopher abovementioned gives instances of the noxious qualities as well as abundance of some minerals particularly orpiment and of the hurtfulness of arsenick worn outwardly in amulets producing all the symptoms of the plague and which were cured by antipestilential and alexipharmick remedies there are credible relations of facts during the plague of london whereby it appeared that the air near pestiferous houses discolored the walls there is nothing improbable in the hypothesis of extraordinary effluvia thirdly those plagues which have cut off the greatest part of mankind in different and distant countries without mutual commerce must have an universal cause and there is hardly one imaginable besides air there were two such plagues in the time of marc anthony and one in the year    0 fourthly there has been generally observed something particular in the seasons and constitutions of the air preceding the plague as great droughts lasting southerly winds sometimes lasting calms this was the constitution always suspected by hippocrates and other ancient physicians such was that before the plague of nimiguen diemerbroke  great droughts as has been observed before have been always found noxious to human bodies the constitution previous to the plague of london was very singular a hard winter frost lasting till near the end of march a sudden thaw the ground covered with water from melted snow and ice and great heats succeeding mankind being as it were in a room flooded with water with a great fire in some places it has been observed that the exacerbation of the disease kept time with the lunations raging most at the new and full moons that there has been in pestilential seasons an unusual quantity of sulphurous vapors in the air flesh and other animal substances putrefying sooner than ordinary wild birds leaving the infected places and tame ones dying in their cages all other diseases being more rife and mortal and as it were participating of the plague before the plague of london inflammations of the lungs were rife and mortal as were likewise the meazles fifthly what seems to demonstrate that the disease depends upon some noxious quality of the air is not only the suddenness of the stroke attended often with a predisposition of the body for example it has been observed that any thing which induces a sudden change in the motion or qualities of the blood subjects the person to the infection in a woman abortion or childbed sudden passions of fear anger etc all excesses and irregularities of diet young and florid blood rather than vapid and cachectical all these cases resemble a sudden taint of the animal fluids by air as some liquors are spoiled by a thunderstorm and by the way seem to demonstrate that the contagion does not proceed from an animate cause for invisible insects would bite or sting whether a person was in a passion or calm for here is a concurrence of a disposition in the fluids with something which operates very suddenly upon them which can hardly be supposed any thing besides air insinuating some poison like that of a venomous animal and tainting the blood when it is most agitated violent exercise likewise disposes to the pestilential infection by admitting after it the pestilential air through the pores of the body the diet which promotes a generous perspiration without inflaming is the best preservative and the poor who are unprovided with such aliment and most exposed to the air suffer most during a copious perspiration the outward air is not so much absorbed and the noxious qualities of the air affect those who are most exposed to it this agrees with experience for the europeans preserve themselves from the plagues that rage in turkey by shutting themselves up which perhaps operates not only as avoiding the infected people but the tainted air the best remedies in the plague are diaphoreticks such as expel noxious steams out of the body these observations seem to point at the air as the efficient cause of the plague but some of them indeed do not prove more than that air is the medium through which the infection is propagated and sixthly it has been observed that there is a great analogy between the symptoms of the plague and st anthonys fire and that they differ only as to the degrees of the inflammation therefore i believe hardly any one would venture to deny that a constitution of air which makes st anthonys fire epidemical and violent in its symptoms heightened in its malignant qualities might possibly carry the eruptions upon the skin from red to livid from inflammation to mortification and likewise the inflammation of the axillary and inguinal glands to large tumors and suppurations in which case it would be termed the plague dr sydenham observes that the epidemical fever which preceded attended and succeeded the plague of london was the same with the pestilential fever only during the plague it was more violent producing those eruptions from which the plague is denominated seventhly all the symptoms of the plague proceed from a high alkaline bilious acrimony this is evident from the symptoms of the disease for one effect is the same with the alkaline salts which raise an eschare and by experiments made during the plague of marseilles a small quantity of the gall of a pestiferous body mixed with water and injected into the vein of a dog infected immediately with all the symptoms of the plague the animal who had conversed safely before in the hospitals of the infected such a bilious acrimony is certainly producible by air and by many other causes besides what demonstrates a malignant quality of the air in a pestilential season is the great mortality of other diseases the whole mortality during the plague of london was    0  the mortality by the plague  0 0  whence the mortality of other diseases must have been     0 considering the great emptiness of the city at that time this must needs have been above three times the common proportion from all these considerations i think one may infer that the plague may be produced by some malignant quality of the air without any contagion  vii but that the air is the chief instrument both of propagating and extinguishing it i believe no body can deny and this must be true from what cause soever you deduce the plague if from an animate cause as from invisible insects the favorable constitution of the air to their propagation must be supposed if from infection of any kind the air is the medium through which it is propagated and must favor it more or less in different seasons because by the change of the qualities of the air it is quite extinguished and generally speaking by cold after the pestilential season is over people return to their houses with safety i believe one may safely affirm that there is hardly any year in which there are not in london fevers with buboes and carbuncles and that there are many petechial or spotted fevers is certain what shall we call diseases with the same symptoms when they seize many or few in the first case when it spreads and turns epidemical and infectious we call it the plague and when it does not spread perhaps it is the same disease only sporadical all this depends upon the constitution of the air  viii it is no less clear that the plague is often brought into infected places by accident and that it may and necessarily must be spread by contagion marseilles by its commerce with egypt and turkey has been more frequently infected with the plague than any city in europe there are upon the records of that city an account of twenty great plagues by the histories of plagues and particularly that last of marseilles the manner of spreading of the disease seems to be gradual at first seizing houses then streets quarters of the town and at last like an universal conflagration the whole city what was remarkable in the plague of marseilles an open and airy street well perflated where the better sort of inhabitants lived was the last infected this is easily accounted for from what was said in the first chapter about the noxiousness and quantity of animal steams  st let it be considered to what a large extent the effluvia of some bodies will infect the air for example the snuff of a candle by what was said in the first chapter the perspirable matter of less than  000 human creatures would make an atmosphere    feet high over an acre of ground in    days this perspirable fluid is to air in density perhaps as  00 to   therefore if you extend the  000 people over a hundred acres of ground there will remain   inches the greatest part remaining unblown off and spread with the infinite tenuity of odorous effluvia will infect the whole air of that city it is easy to conceive how the steams of pestiferous bodies may taint the air while they are alive and hot but i think it appears likewise by their being frequently opened and dissected in marseilles without any danger to the surgeon or assistants that there is no danger from them when cold and not putrified i think from the facts abovementioned one may easily account for the propagation and continuance of the plague in some places infected and the preservation of neighboring places from the infection if there is no particular disposition in the air to propagate the distemper any infectious distemper is easily propagated amongst human creatures living close together the plague of copenhagen      cut off the greatest part of the common people who are most narrowly lodged in that city  ix as to the pestilential levains conveyed in goods it is a popular and safe opinion but many writers about the plague and particularly diemerbroke seem to despite it the fact of its being brought into marseilles by infected goods is positively asserted by the town physicians and as positively denied upon a stricter examination by those sent down by the regent in the last plague of london dr hodges positively affirms that he saw a patient in westminster with carbuncles the winter before the plague broke out as to the plague being propagated by infected goods there is this one difficulty which is not easily solved in a city infected with the plague notwithstanding all the pains taken by artificial purifications to extirpate the contagion there must be more of the pestilential levain left in goods than could be brought over in a whole fleet yet when the pestilential season is over people return to their houses lie in the infected beds and use the same goods safely and indeed if pestilential levains were always capable of producing the infection i cannot see how it is possible for the plague ever to be extinguished in a place once infected so that i think one may conclude that the constitution of the air is the chief instrument perhaps in producing but surely in propagating and extinguishing this distemper and that there is no need with diemerbroke to have recourse to some miraculous operation of divine vengeance the most common and feeble powers of nature are capable of executing the will of the creator even in the extraordinary dispensations of his providence the inhabitants of those countries which have never been afflicted with the plague are not less sinners than others i think it likewise probable that the turkish contempt of the contagion does not propagate the disease more than the christian dread of it which brings public disorder want of care both of the sound and infected for in general contagions more perish for want of care and necessaries than by the malignity of the disease they being as it were sequestrated from mankind in the plague of marseilles many were buried alive in the same plague when good order was reestablished of above   000 who had gentler symptoms and were better attended the greatest part recovered if the turkish principles were joined with the christian care and skill no doubt the havoc made by this disease would be small in respect of what it is commonly in infected cities  x as to the method of cure of this distemper it is foreign to my subject only by the conformity of its symptoms with other inflammatory distempers especially the smallpox the same methods seem be indicated in both as to preservatives there seems scarce any to be depended upon but flight from the infected place as the disease seems to produce a general dissolution of the blood in haemorrages of all kinds even those inflammations upon the skin are extravasations of blood ending in mortifications acid and styptick medicines are indicated both as a cure and preservative it has likewise been observed by the writers on this disease that it is apt to invade such as are subject to intermitting fevers which often degenerate into the plague there has lately been discovered in the peruvian bark a virtue to resist and cure mortifications and what cures a symptom may preserve from it therefore i would propose in a pestilential constitution the peruvian bark as an antidote or preservative it prevents as well as cures some sorts of fevers it tempers bilious acrimony is styptick cures haemorrages and resists mortifications then why not use an antidote so promising if not effectual at least harmless a surgeon at marseilles told a friend of mine that he was sure that he preserved himself from the plague by taking large doses of the bark and that it had its effect after he felt himself attacked with the first symptoms  xi there have been of late two remarkable instances of the influence of the air in producing an epidemical disease perhaps over the greatest part of the surface of the earth the first happened in the year      the last in the latter end of the year      and beginning of      which being the more recent and remarkable i shall give a short description of it till a more particular one can be procured from the collected memoirs of the several countries which it invaded of which i have seen only a few  xii the previous constitution of the air was in england and in the greatest part of europe a great drought which may be inferred from the failure of the springs in the abatement of the fresh water in all its usual currents and reservoirs which are the best measure of the quantity of moisture falling from the clouds what is most generally taken notice of in the accounts i have seen from germany france and some other places was that the air in the beginning of winter especially in november was more than usually filled with thick and frequent fogs the matter of which was not precipitated upon the earth in rain snow or any other fruits of the air fogs are so usual in this country in november that there was nothing particular observed about them that i know but there was hardly any thing fell from the clouds during the month of november except a very small quantity of snow attended with a frost of no long duration and this was all the winter we had in the northern parts of france there was a very small quantity of snow which lasted from their   th and our  th of november till after christmas this was succeeded by southerly winds and stinking fogs during which there was observed by some surgeons a great disposition in wounds to mortify both before and during the continuance of the disease in england the air was warm beyond the usual temper of the season with great quantities of sulphurous vapors producing great storms of wind from the southwest and sometimes lightning without thunder  xiii as to the time of invasion of the disease they were different in different countries it invaded saxony and the neighboring countries in germany about the   th of november and lasted in its vigor till the   th of the same month it was earlier in holland than in england earlier in edinburgh than in london it was in new england before it attacked britain in london before it reached some other places westward as oxford bath etc and as far as i can collect from accounts it invaded the northerly parts of europe before the southerly it lasted in its vigor in london from about the middle of january     for about   weeks the bill of mortality from tuesday the   d to tuesday the  0th of january contained in all      being higher than any time since the plague it began in paris about the beginning of their february or the   st of our january and lasted till the beginning of their april or the   st of our march and i think its duration was longest in the southerly countries it raged in naples and the southern parts of italy in our march the disease in traveling from place to place did not observe the direction but went often contrary to the course of the winds  xiv the uniformity of the symptoms of the disease in every place was most remarkable a small rigor or chilliness succeeded with a fever of a duration in such as recovered seldom above three days this fever was attended with a headache sometimes pains in the back thirst in no great degree a catarrh or thin defluxion occasioning sneezing a coryza or running at the nose a cough with expectoration of a thin pituite at first and afterward of a viscous matter in which if there was observed a clear oily matter it proved generally the case to be mortal for this clear matter was purulent these were the most common symptoms but a great many during that season were affected with spitting of blood pleurisies and inflammations of the lungs dangerous and often mortal in some places particularly in france the fever after six or seven days ended in miliary eruptions in holland often in imposthumations of the throat in all the blood was sizy and every where the disease was particularly fatal to aged people what was observable was that the fever left a debility and dejection of appetite and spirits much more than in proportion to its strength or duration and the cough outlasted the fever in some more than six weeks or two months  xv there was during the whole season a great run of hysterical hypochondriacal and nervous distempers in short all the symptoms of relaxation these symptoms were so high in some as to produce a sort of fatuity or madness in which for some hours together they would be seized with a wandering of their senses mistaking their common affairs at the same time they had not any great degree of a fever to confine them to their beds but in several who were thus affected the urine was observed often to change from pale to turbid alternately so that there was some fever though i did not observe nor hear that the bark was effectual but the saline febrifuge draughts had generally a most surprising good effect since this disease has been over the air has continued to be particularly noxious in diseases which affect the lungs and for that reason occasioning a great and unusual mortality of the meazles at the rate of  0 in a week from which one has reason to expect some specialities in the diseases of the succeeding season  xvi the remedies commonly successful in this epidemical catarrhous fever were bleeding sweating promoted by watery diaphoreticks blisters and the common pectoral medicines and what i observed before febrifuge draughts of salt of wormwood juice of limon etc i have not particulars enough to enable me to enter into the aetiology of this distemper  xvii it was matter of fact that there was a previous ill constitution of the air noxious to animal bodies in autumn and long afterward a madness among dogs the horses were seized with the catarrh before mankind and a gentleman averred to me that some birds particularly the sparrows left the place where he was during the sickness  xviii the previous great drought as has been observed before must have been particularly hurtful to mankind great droughts exert their effects after the surface of the earth is again opened by moisture and the perspiration of the ground which was long suppressed is suddenly restored it is probable that the earth then emits several new effluvia hurtful to human bodies that this appeared to be the case by the thick and stinking fogs which prceeded the rain that had fallen before  xix it is likewise evident that these effluvia were not of any particular or mineral nature because they were of a substance that was common to every part of the surface of the earth and therefore one may conclude that they were watery exhalations or at least such mixed with other exhalable substances that are common to every spot of ground  xx lastly it is agreeable to experience that watery effluvia are hurtful to the glands of the windpipe and the lungs and productive of catarrhs  chap viii of the effects of natural explosions of the air upon human bodies i explosions of the air by lightning and thunder produce more sudden and terrible effects upon human bodies than any other alterations of the air whatsoever therefore in a history of the effects of air on human bodies they ought not to be omitted though there is little more to be said of them than that their effects resemble those of gunpowder and other artificial explosions  ii there may be imagined many natural causes of those violent explosions of the air salts and sulphurs of which there are great quantities in the air mixed and kindled will produce great explosions nitre sulphur and charcoal compose gunpowder of tartar nitre and sulphur is composed the pulvis fulminans which has a greater explosive force than gunpowder acid spirits and chemical oils produce explosions filings of iron sulphur and water heat flame and at last produce explosions dr leister imagines lightning to be produced by the pyrites for the vapor raised by lightning seems by some observations to have a magnetical quality it having sometimes changed the polarity of ships compasses see abridgment of philosophical transactions vol ii p   0  but i think they are naturally accounted for by the ingenious mr hale in his appendix to his treatise of haemostaticks in which he has demonstrated that sulphurous air and clear air ferment together therefore that lightning is produced by the mixture of the fresh pure air above the clouds with the sulphurous vapors that rise below which when the effervescence is over cools the air  iii no instrument of art or nature kills a human creature so suddenly as lightning they being often arrested by the stroke in the very same posture and attitude in which they were struck see abridgment of philosophical transactions vol v p   0 and following  the effects and marks on their bodies sem to proceed from two causes burning and percussion their clothes being lacerated and torn their bodies often pierced with wounds sometimes round resembling those from small shot sometimes of larger diameters these wounds are without any haemorrage they being seared or burnt at the same time from their resembling gun shot wounds so much some have imagined that they were made by hail produced that instant but whoever considers the history of such accidents will find that the wounds are made by some penetrating flame  iv in many thunderstorms there have been observed balls of fire perfectly round which produce as they move along all the effects of percussion of a solid body which is very strange those meteors or balls of fire falling from the clouds have plowed up and pierced the ground very deep like a bomb ibid vol v p      those balls of fire have been likewise observed upon meeting with any obstacle to divide themselves into lesser striae and it seems to me that those cauterizd wounds are produced by fiery piercing darts or balls the effects of burning appear often upon the skin which parched shrivelled black and burnt the flame taken in with the breath has often shrivelled the lungs  v a second effect has been the moving bodies from the place by the blast like that of being blown up by gunpowder of which there are many instances  vi a third effect is a great stroke from the air returning with great violence to restore the balance after the vacuity made as upon the blowing up of a powdermill the windows of adjacent houses are all bent and blown outward by the elastick force of the air within the houses exerting itself by being delivered from the counterpoise of the air without the velocity of the air rushing into an exhausted receiver is at the rate of a mile   seconds of time a velocity of a mile in of a minute is capable of producing prodigious effects i have talked with persons who have been near a blast of lightning and have been knocked down very near dead they told me they felt a great blow as it had been from a hard body many such people who have not been within the action of the flame have recovered from this percussion bodies thunderstruck have often contusions upon them there are some thunderstruck people who have recovered after a fever attended with a delirium therefore such as have been wounded are very hard to cure as all burns are the serpentine and crooked dartings of lightning are not occasioned by the train of sulphurous vapors for almost the same appearance happens upon striking a glass exhausted receiver with the palm of the hand  chap ix practical aphorisms relating to the air drawn from the doctrine of this essay and from other writers of epidemical diseases of which some are certain others confirmed by some observations and are set down as subjects of further enquiry i air is the principle of life without which no animal can subsist a moment  ii good air as it is the chief instrument of health may justly be reckoned amongst the greatest natural blessings we find by the influence of good air whole nations are able to support the want of many comforts of life with cheerfulness and mirth and the contrary is likewise true  iii mankind by reason and their lacomotive faculty have in some measure the power of defending themselves from the injuries of the air but few have the choice of the air in which they live  iv custom enables human creatures to support the effects of air and renders the alterations produced in their solids and fluids familiar and less hurtful by no vii chap v animals by custom can better support the airpump therefore  v every human creature whose manner of life demands and whose constitution can bear it ought to inure themselves to the outward air in several sorts of weather  vi in the choice of habitations for mankind the wholsomness of the air is a principal consideration  vii air is as much a particular in the purchase of a seat as the soil  viii the endemial diseases of temperate people are the product of the air and the best mark of the wholsomness of the air is the customary longaevity of the inhabitants or the rate of their bills of mortality  ix the local qualities of the air depend upon the exhalations of the soil and those of its neighborhood which may be brought thither by winds  x a soil gravelly chalky sandy has but a small quantity of perspiration for it imbibes moisture and therefore is free from noxious exhalations  xi from a rich fat marshy soil a great quantity and variety of vapors are raised by the action of the sun and the heat communicated to the surface of the earth which must at certain times and seasons variously affect the inhabitants by its contents consisting of water oils salts and several other ingredients of which the analysis of the dew is the best index accordingly rich soils on the banks of rivers in hot countries are extremely unhealthy  xii mere watery exhalations perhaps are not so unwholsom soils which abound with these are such as retain water as clay and level grounds where the water stagnates and spungy grounds on the tops of hills which attract vapors  xiii the qualities of the springs are the mark of those of the air for both the air and water imbibe the saline and mineral exhalations of the ground therefore where the water is sweet and good it is probable the air is so likewise  xiv dampness of wainscot rotting of furniture tarnishing of metals rusting of iron efflorescence of salts upon any bodies discolourations of silks and linen are marks of salts of an unusual nature or quality in the air see chap iv no viii  xv the steams of dry ground without any of those noxious qualities are naturally wholesome and refreshing upon opening with a spade or plow  xvi in choosing situations regard ought to be had to the local steams of the neighboring soil a gravelly situation may be rendered sickly by the air of a neighboring marsh brought thither by winds  xvii epidemical diseases which proceed from noxious local steams affect cities less than the country for in cities there is less perspiration from the ground and the air is in some measure artificial on the contrary in dry frosts when the perspiration of the ground is stopped inflammatory epidemical diseases affect the citizens most being more lazy and luxurious see chap vi  xviii the air of cities is not so friendly to the lungs as that of the country for it is replete with sulphurous steams of fuel and the perspirable matter of animals therefore the consumptive and asthmatic are better in the country  xix the air of cities is unfriendly to infants and children every animal is adapted to the use of fresh natural and free air the tolerance of artificial air as that of cities is the effect of habit which young animals have not yet acquired the great mortality of children under two years in london is not entirely owing to the small care of the brood of the necessitous and of bastards  xx the first care in building of cities is to make them airy and well perflated infectious distempers must necessarily be propagated amongst mankind living close together  xxi private houses ought to be perflated once a day by opening doors and windows to blow off the animal steams  xxii houses for the sake of warmth fenced from wind and where the carpenters work is so nice as to exclude all outward air are not the most wholesome  xxiii people who pass most of their time in air tainted with steams of animals fire and candles are often affected with nervous distempers living constantly in air that kills vegetables cannot be wholesome for animals  xxiv burialplaces ought to be without the precincts of great cities  xxv the country air in spring and summer has a considerable influence upon mankind by the steams of vegetables which variously stimulate and perhaps exhilerate the spirits and upon the same account the air of a planted and enclosed country is different from that of an open and in some cases less refreshing  xxvi in great latitudes where the difference of heat and cold are great the diet and clothing of the inhabitants ought to vary with the season  xxvii the qualities of winter air as the weight density coldness dryness of air in frosty weather are such as induce a stricture of the fibers and the distempers are analogous therefore the diet ought to be relaxing such are the use of tepid watery liquors and bathing  xxviii the copious use of spirituous liquors is more hurtful in the winter and evacuation better tolerated not only by the greater stricture of fibers but by reason of a more copious aliment  xxix cold in most people increases the appetite it is remarkable in the history of such as perished by cold in northern countries that they kept their appetite to the last  xxx exercise in the winter is more easily tolerated necessary for promoting perspiration as the most durable and best defense against outward cold and likewise for the digestion of a more gross and copious aliment  xxxi in winter the aliment as well as the weather contribute to produce the scurvy to correct which the use of vegetables as far as they can be supplied is necessary in the winter and a diet almost vegetable in the spring and the more so because then bilious distempers begin to rage  xxxii defenses against intolerable extremities of heat as rest shade venilation grottos or souterrains are as necessary preservatives of health as those against extreme cold  xxxiii air approaching to animal heat or  0 degrees is dangerous and the effects of it more sudden than of cold heat exceeding  0 degrees coagulates the white of an egg hot weather of long duration must produce great alterations in human bodies  xxxiv the heat of our summer is seldom excessive or durable and consequently not unhealthy during the summer in our climate many chronical distempers and the acute ones of the spring are silent  xxxv the diseases of our summers are most commonly the effects of sudden alternations of heat and cold  xxxvi the most sudden and dangerous effects of heat are from insola or  of the sunbeams  xxxvii the heat of air ought to be  managed as not to produce too great  which thicken the fluids and relax the solids  xxxviii too great and sudden refrigeration by ventilation may be dangerous  xxxix feverish heat may be abated by cool air the management of the air in the patients room is a necessary and important piece of the regimen in acute distempers the too great heat and dryness and other bad qualities of the air have been often successfully tempered by the steams of some vegetables in a patients room especially of some of the soporiferous kind as henbane cowslips poppies etc  xl great colds succeeding great heats are productive of diseases even cold nights after hot days many of the acute diseases of europeans in hot countries are occasioned by their exposing themselves incautiously to the serene or nightly dew  xli from the effects of different qualities of the air it is easy to determine what air is fit or unfit for what constitutions a moist air relaxeth therefore unfit for such as have weak fibers or are phlegmatic and bloated a dry cold air with the barometer high contracts the fibers therefore apt to throw such as have a strict constitution into inflammatory distempers a dry hot air is unfit for the lean scraggy and atrabilarious and fit for such as are of a contrary constitution  xlii the best indications for the choice of air are taken from the constitution of the patient and the popular diseases of the inhabitants the air of france fit for hypochondriacal and stomachicks the air of holland where coughs are not frequent has been found better for some sorts of pulmonicks than that of warmer countries the air of countries which by heat often disposes to spittings of blood promotes too great sweating and consumes the muscular flesh can never be good for some sorts of consumptions  xliii the scurvy of seafaring people is not merely the effect of salt provisions but likewise of moisture  xliv great alterations are produced in human bodies by great enormities of the seasons and by sudden alterations of the weather from one extreme to another by change of situation into air of contrary qualities as an inhabitant of a cold climate going into a hot one by such changes the solids and fluids are agitated and the motions being uncustomary stimulate more  xlv air exceeding the natural heat of the body cannot be long endured with safety especially if the humors are in an inflammatory state i have known two instances of malignant fevers produced by the hot air of a bagnio  xlvi the diet of the inhabitants ought to vary with the season and climate perhaps in a cold moist air a greater indulgence in spirituous liquors is allowable  xlvii in seasons climates and countries extremely hot cordials of some sort are necessary such as wine and spices  xlviii the diseases proceeding from a cold and moist air indicate diaphoreticks  xlix the complexion of the inhabitants being clear and vivid is a sign of a wholesome air and contrariwise  l the lungs of young people in the prime of their age are hot and tender and being in immediate contact with the outward air may be variously affected with its contents and qualities therefore the choice of air is of great importance to pulmonicks in those of a more advanced age the lungs are less hot and more coreaceous or tough  li the mark of tender fibers even of the lungs is a vivid sanguine complexion transparency of the skin is a sign of slenderness and delicacy of its fibers  lii young pulmonicks are subject to consumptions and the old to asthmas  liii air charged with sulphurous steams such as that of cities is noxious to asthmaticks not only by the danger of suffocation but by the chronical distempers induced by an imperfect respiration for when the respiration is imperfect the sanguification is so likewise  live experience is the best guide in the choice of air or the freedom of the inhabitants from the disease of the patient  lv a good digestion depends upon perspiration and a good sanguification and that upon a good respiration therefore the choice of air is of great importance to stomachicks a cold moist air renders both the perspiration and respiration imperfect  lvi the earth may be considered as a compound body under digestion by heat by the different degrees of which heat there may be raised effluvia of several sorts succeeding one another and epidemical diseases may be the product of these effluvia accordingly we find the spring and autumn to be seasons of epidemical diseases the alterations of heat are the greatest before and after the equinox for then the declination of the sun changes the fastest  lvii epidemical diseases with all the specialities of their character depend upon the constitution of the air previous and present a healthy person without any error in the nonnatural is often seized soon after his arrival with the epidemical disease of that place  lviii the methods successful in the cure of epidemical diseases of one season are often hurtful in those of another this diversity proceeds from the temperature of the air which is necessary not only to be observed but to be recorded  lix great heat and cold succeeding one another occasion pleurisies and quinzies  lx vernal and autumnal diseases like vegetables come sooner or later as the weather favors them hippocrates in the diseases of the autumn takes notice of the nocturnal accessions in that season the nights grow cooler and longer after hot days  lxi cholera morbus is commonly confined to august when the bile is most exalted by great heats a strong perspiration of the day and perhaps abatement of it at night likewise by the too copious use of cold fruits  lxii the dangerous symptoms of different sorts of acute distempers of the same season depend upon the constitution of the air and by reason of that universal cause the methods successful in one seem to be indicated in the other  lxiii the epidemical disease that is the masterdisease of the season imparts its genius to the other diseases as malignant smallpox and a malignant fever without the smallpox the fever preceding accompanying and succeeding the plague was the same dr sydenham from whom these six last aphorisms are deduced confirms this observation by several instances therefore according to the opinion of the same sagacious person  lxiv it may be useful to physic to give general signatures and names to diseases from the season  lxv there may be taken proper and useful indications both preservative and curative from the qualities of the air what produces relaxation and fluxility seems to be indicated in cold diaphoreticks in moist cooling acid styptick remedies in hot and dry air  lxvi no artificial defenses as by keeping within doors are effectual against a general contagion of the air this was evident in the late epidemical catarrh fever yet such defenses may abate something of the effect  lxix moisture that opens the surface of the earth succeeding great droughts which shut it produces a sickly constitution of the season such are thaws after long frosts rains after great droughts  lxx infants by their pliant and tender fibers are more sensible of the impressions of air than adults but as they must afterward endure them they ought to be made hardy by all safe means such as have been inured to the injuries of the outward air and accustomed to a great simplicity of diet are no more sensible of the injuries of outward air than the cattle i know some strong instances of this  what follows is deduced from the epidemical history of germany  lxxi a watery winter succeeded by great heats often produces malignant and mortal fevers among mankind and mortality amongst cattle  lxxii epidemical and mortal diseases often succeed earthquakes  lxxiii the weather and the epidemical diseases of the same climate resemble one another the epidemical history of germany fits britain  lxxiv like weather produces like diseases in every season a warm winter diseases of the spring a cold and wet summer catarrhs  lxxv such as have had acute distempers of one kind are often affected with new and uniform symptoms by the enormities of the succeeding season  lxxvi southerly winds of long duration often produce petechial or spotted fevers  lxxvii from rains after great frosts in the winter glandulous tumors and suffocative catarrhs from the same constitution in the spring quinzies and spottedfevers what was remarkable in such a season pestilential buboes formerly cured began to run  lxxviii diseases of a very odd and peculiar nature have sometimes succeeded an inconstant season as melancholy madness furor uterinus which seemed infectious this at mansfield school  lxxix from an april extremely cold and wet all the diseases of the winter madness epilepsies catarrhs of all kinds  lxxx in the epidemical history of germany many of the observations of hippocrates are confirmed  lxxxi from an unusual inconstancy of the weather and perpetual changes of the wind from east to west epidemical dysenteries  lxxxii from extremity of heat in the dog days a rainy season a malignant spotted fever  lxxxiii from frost and snow in april and may an extremely mortal smallpox and dysentery in autumn  lxxxiv from rainy seasons headaches toothaches rheumatisms asthmas  lxxxv from great enormities of the seasons a great run of epidemical distempers  lxxxvi from frequent great and sudden changes of the weather acute distempers with dangerous symptoms  lxxxvii in orderly seasons the common popular diseases neither rife nor mortal  lxxxviii from hoar frosts in the morning succeeded by hot days in the summer an unusual run of dangerous intermitting fevers and jaundices according to that of hippocrates from heat and cold in the same day expect autumnal diseases  lxxxix the sickly constitution attending thaws is mended by winds blowing off the vapors  xc from extreme and lasting cold a great run of apoplexies and other congenerous diseases catarrhs vertigoes  xci from great heat and drought burning continued fevers attended with haemorrages bilious vomitings and dejections  xcii in mildews which corrupt vegetables the morning and evening air dangerous northerly and easterly winds which stop the perspiration of vegetables abating their fragrancy have probably the same effect upon mankind  xciii epidemical diseases depend not only on the present but the previous constitution both of the air and patient a hot season often produces the scurvy and other cutaneous irruptions after previous cold there have been scurvies which were exasperated by heat as that in the memoirs of the academy de sciences  xciv weather which produces no uneasy sensation in human bodies is wholesome as long as it lasts but the indolence produced by such weather may make them more sensible of the agitations both of their fluids and solids by the change  xcv the epidemical diseases of animals much exposed to the air and whose diet is simple depend upon the constitution of the season the difference of the quality of the fruits of the ground operate likewise but not so much as the air  xcvi journals of the weather reigning diseases and remedies successful would be of great use to mankind and more especially to physicians from such journals perhaps it might be possible to predict both the weather and the epidemical diseases  xcvii in judging of the constitution of the air many things besides the weather ought to be observed the diseases of vegetables and brutes in some countries the silence of grasshoppers want of mellification in bees desertion of birds quantities of insects sulphurous vapors mortality of diseases commonly not dangerous such things have been observed to be significant  xcviii in cities infected with the plague the most effectual care of the police is an early and quick separation of the infected houses streets quarters of the city from the uninfected with proper assistance of the sick and a removal of the other inhabitants into some airy and well perflated incampment in tents or barracks  xcix by good government many of the infected may be saved and many sound preserved from the infection in the history of the plague of marseilles one may see the bad effects of confusion and neglect in the beginning and the good effects of order toward the end  c the peruvian bark has promising qualities as an antidote in a pestilential constitution  finis
