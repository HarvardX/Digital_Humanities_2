odd not o of all this multitude was at home they were a bound to a far distant country though it w permitted by the lord of the land that these pgrims might associate together for their prese mutual comfort and convenience and each w not only allowed but commanded to do the othe all the services he could upon their journey  it was decreed that every individual travell must enter the far country singly there was  great gulf at the end of the journey which eveone must pass alone and at his own risk and t friendship of the whole united world could be no use in shooting that gulf the exact time wh each was to pass was not known to any this the lo always kept a close secret out of kindness  still they were as sure that the time must come a that at no very great distance as if they w informed of the very moment now as they kn they were always liable to be called away at  hours notice one would have thought they wo have been chiefly employed in packing up a preparing and getting every thing in order  they indeed it was almost the only thing wh they did not think about  now i only appeal to you my readers if any  ou are setting out upon a little common journey f it is only to london or york is not all your leisure time employed in settling your business at ome and packing up every little necessary for our expedition and does not the fear of neglecting any thing you ought to remember or may have ocasion for haunt your mind and sometimes even trude upon you unseasonably and when you re actually on your journey especially if you ave never been to that place before or are likely  remain there dont you begin to think a little out the pleasures and the employments of the ace and to wish to know a little what sort of a y london or york is dont you wonder what  doing there and whether you are properly quafed for the business or the company you expect  be engaged in do you never look at the map  consult brookess gazetteer and dont you try  pick up from your fellow passengers in the stage ach any little information you can get and ough you may be obliged out of civility to nverse with them on common subjects yet do  your secret thoughts still run upon london or ork its business or its pleasures and above all  you are likely to set out early are you not afraid  oversleeping and does not that fear keep you  on the watch so that you are commonly up and ady before the porter comes to summon you ader if this be your case how surprised will  be to hear that the travelers to the far coun have not half your prudence though bound  a journey of infinitely more importance to a d where nothing can be sent after them and  which when they are once settled all errors  irretrievable  i observed that these pilgrims instead of being upon the watch lest they should be ordered o unprepared instead of laying up any provision or even making memorandums of what they would be likely to want spent most of their time i crowds either in the way of traffic or diversion at first when i saw them so much engaged in coversing with each other i thought it a good sig and listened attentively to their talk not doubtin but the chief turn of it would be about the clmate or treasures or society they should prbably meet with in the far country i suppos they might be also discussing about the best an safest road to it and that each was availing himself of the knowledge of his neighbor on a subje of equal importance to all i listened to eve party but in scarcely any did i hear one wo about the land to which they were bound thou it was their home where their whole interest pectation and inheritance lay to which also gr part of their friends were gone before and wther they were sure all the rest would follo their whole talk was about the business or  pleasures or the fashions of the strange cotry which they were merely passing through and which they had not one foot of land which th were sure of calling their own for the next quar of an hour what little estate they had was perso and not real and that was a mortgaged lifehold nement of clay not properly their own but only  to them on a short uncertain lease of which thr score years and ten was considered as the long period and very few indeed lived in it to the  of the term for this was always at the will of  lord part of whose prerogative it was that he ould take away the lease at pleasure knock own the stoutest tenement at a single blow and urn out the poor shivering helpless tenant naked o that far country for which he had made no rovision sometimes in order to quicken the ilgrim in his preparations the lord would break own the tenement by slow degrees sometimes he ould let it tumble by its own natural decay for as it as only built to last a certain term it would somees grow so uncomfortable by increasing dilapidaons even before the ordinary lease was out that e lodging was hardly worth keeping though the nant could seldom be persuaded to think so but ng to it to the last first the thatch on the top of e tenement changed color then it fell off and left  roof bare then the grinders ceased because ey were few then the windows became so darked that the owner could scarcely see through m then one prop fell away then another then  uprights became bent and the whole fabric mbled and tottered with every other symptom  a falling house on some occasions the lord dered his messengers of which he had a great vaty to batter injure deface and almost demolish  frail building even while it seemed new and ong this was what the landlord called giving rning but many a tenant would not take it and s so fond of staying where he was even un all these inconveniences that at last he was  out by ejectment not being prevailed on to ve his dwelling in a proper manner though one uld have thought the fear of being turned out uld have whetted his diligeace in preparing for a better and more enduring inheritance for thoug the people were only tenants at will in these cra enements yet through the goodness of the sa lord they were assured that he never turned the out of these habitations before he had on his pa provided for them a better so that there was not su another landlord in the world and though their prsent dwelling was but frail being only slightly  up to serve the occasion yet they might hold the future possession by a most certain tenure the wo of the lord himself which was entered in a cvenant or titledeed consisting of many shee and because a great many good things were give away in it a book was made of which eve soul might get a copy this indeed had not aways been the case because till a few ages bac there had been a sort of monopoly in the case an the wise and prudent that is the cunning an fraudful had hid these things from the babes an sucklings that is from the low and ignorant an many frauds had been practiced and the poor ha been cheated of their right so that not being alloed to read and judge for themselves they had be sadly imposed upon but all these tricks had be put an end to more than two hundred years when  passed through the country and the meanest man who could read might then have a copy so that  might see himself what he had to trust to and eve those who could not read might hear it read on or twice every week at least without pay but  surprised me to see how few comparatively ma use of these vast advantages of those who had  copy many laid it carelessly by expressed a genral belief in the truth of the titledeed a gener satisfaction that they should come in for a share of the inheritance a general good opinion of the lord whose word it was and a general disposition to take his promise upon trust always however intending at a convenient season to inquire farther into the matter and this neglect of theirs was construed into a forfeiture of the inheritance  at the end of this country lay the vast gulf mentioned before it was shadowed over by a broad and thick cloud which prevented the pilgrims from seeing in a distinct manner what was doing behind it yet such beams of brightness now and hen darted through the cloud as enabled those who sed a telescope provided for that purpose to ee the substance of things hoped for but it was not very one who could make use of this telescope o eye indeed was naturally disposed to it but an arnest desire of getting a glimpse of the invisible ealities gave such a strength and steadiness to the ye as enabled it to discern many things which ould not be seen by the natural sight above the loud was this inscription the things which are  are temporal but the things which are not n are eternal of these last many glorious deriptions had been given but as those splendors ere at a distance and as the pilgrims in general d not care to use the telescope these distant ances made little impression the glorious heritance which lay beyond the cloud was alled the things above while a multitude of triing objects which appeared contemptibly small hen looked at through the telescope were called the things below now as we know it is nearness which gives size and bulk to any object it was not wonderful that these illjudging pilgrims were more struck with these baubles and trifles which by lying close at hand were visible and temping to the naked eye and which made up the sum of the things below than with the remo glories of the things above but this was chief owing to their not making use of the telescope through which if you examined thoroughly t things below they seemed to shrink almost down t nothing while the things above appeared the mo beautiful and vast the more the telescope was used but the surprising part of the story was this no that the pilgrims were captivated at first sight wit the things below for that was natural enough bu that when they had tried them all over and over and found themselves deceived and disappointed in almost every one of them it did not at a lessen their fondness and they grasped at the again with the same eagerness as before ther were some gay fruits which looked alluring but o being opened instead of a kernel they were found to contain rottenness and those which seemed the fullest often proved on trial to be quite hollow an empty those which were most tempting to the ey were often found to be wormwood to the taste o poison to the stomach and many flowers that seemed most bright and gay had a worm gnawing at the root  among the chief attractions of the things below were certain little lumps of yellow clay on which almost every eye and every heart was fixed when i saw the variety of uses to which this clay could be converted and the respect which wa shown to those who could scrape together the greate number of pieces i did not much wonder at the general desire to pick up some of them but when i beeld the anxiety the wakefulness the competitions be contrivances the tricks the frauds the scuffling e pushing the turmoiling the kicking the shovg the cheating the circumvention the envy the alignity which was excited by a desire to possess is article when i saw the general scramble among ose who had little to get much and of those who d much to get more then i could not help applying to these people a proverb in use among us at gold may be bought too dear though i saw at there were various sorts of baubles which enged the hearts of different travelers such as an  of red or blue ribbon for which some were ntent to forfeit their future inheritance commitg the sin of esau without his temptation of hunr yet the yellow clay i found was the grand obct for which most hands scrambled and most souls re risked one thing was extraordinary that the arer these people were to being turned out of ir tenement the fonder they grew of these pieces  clay so that i naturally concluded they meant  take the clay with them to the far country but oon learnt this clay was not current there the rd having declared to these pilgrims that as y had brought nothing into this world they could ry nothing out  i inquired of the different people who were raisg the various heaps of clay some of a larger e of a smaller size why they discovered such remitting anxiety and for whom some whose es were immense told me they were heaping up  their children this i thought very right till on ting my eyes round i observed many of the chilen of these very people had large heaps of their own others told me it was for their grandchildre but on enquiry i found these were not yet born a in many cases there was little chance that they ev would the truth on a close examination prov to be that the true genuine heapers really heap for themselves that it was in fact neither for frie or child but to gratify an inordinate appetite  their own nor was i much surprised after this  see these yellow hoards at length canker and  rust of them become a witness against the hoarde and et their flesh as it were fire  many however who had set out with a high he of their fathers raising before they had got o third of their journey had scarcely a single pie left as i was wondering what had caused the enormous piles to vanish in so short a time i spi scattered up and down the country all sorts of o inventions for some or other of which the va possessors of the great heaps of clay had truck and bartered them away in fewer hours than the ancestors had spent years in getting them togeth o what a strange unaccountable medley it wa and what was ridiculous enough i observed th the greatest quantity of the clay was always echanged for things that were of no use that i cou discover owing i suppose to my ignorance of  manners of that country  in one place i saw large heaps exhausted  order to set two idle pampered horses a runnin but the worst part of the joke was the horses  not run to fetch or carry any thing but merely let the gazers see which could run fastest n this gift of swiftness exercised to no one use purpose was only one out of many instances  talents used to no end in another place i  hole piles of the clay spent to maintain long anges of buildings full of dogs on provisions which would have nicely fattened some thousands f pilgrims who sadly wanted fattening and whose agged tenements were out at elbows for want of little  help to repair them some of the piles ere regularly pulled down once in seven years  order to corrupt certain needy pilgrims to  their consciences others were spent in playng with white stiff bits of paper painted over ith red and black spots in which i thought there ust be some conjuring because the very touch of ese painted pasteboards made the heaps fly from e to another and back again to the same in a ay that natural causes could not account for here was another proof that there must be some agic in this business which was that if a pasteboard th red spots fell into a hand which wanted a black e the person changed color his eyes flashed e and he discovered other symptoms of madness which showed there was some witchcraft in the case hese clean little pasteboards as harmless as they oked had the wonderful power of pulling down e highest piles in less time than all the other ses put together i observed many small piles re given in exchange for an enchanted liquor which when the purchaser had drank to a little exss he lost all power of managing the rest of his ap without losing the love of it  now i found it was the opinion of sober pilgrims at either hoarding the clay or trucking it for any ch purposes as the above was thought exactly e same offense in the eyes of the lord and it is expected that when they should come under  more immediate jurisdiction in the far country the penalty annexed to hoarding and squanderi would be nearly the same while i examined t countenances of the owners of the heaps i oserved that those who i well knew never intend to make any use at all of their heap were f more terrified at the thought of losing it or of bei torn from it than those were who were employi it in the most useful manner those who  knew what to do with it set their hearts least upon it and were always most willing to leave it b such riddles were common in this odd country  now i wondered why these pilgrims who we naturally made erect with an eye formed to loo up to the things above yet had their eyes almo constantly bent in the other direction rivetted  the earth and fastened on things below just lik those animals who walk on all four i was to they had not always been subject to this weakne of sight and proneness to earth that they ha originally been upright and beautiful having be created after the image of the lord who was himself the perfection of beauty that he had place them in a far superior situation which he had give them in perpetuity but that their first ancesto fell from it through pride and carelessness th upon this the freehold was taken away they lo their original strength brightness and beauty an were driven out into this strange country whe however they had every opportunity given them  recovering their health and the lords favo and likeness for they were become so disfigured an were grown so unlike him that you would hard believe they were his own children though in some the resemblance was become again visible the lord however was so merciful that instead  iving them up to the dreadful consequences of eir own folly as he might have done without any peachment of his justice he gave them immedie comfort and promised them that in due time  own son should come down and restore them  the future inheritance which he should purchase r them and now it was that in order to keep up ir spirits after they had lost their estate through e folly of their ancestors that he began to give em a part of their former title deed he conued to send them portions of it from time to e by different faithful servants whom however ese ungrateful people generally used ill and me of whom they murdered but for all this  lord was so very forgiving that he at length  these mutineers a proclamation of full and free rdon by his son who though they used him in  more cruel manner than they had done any of  servants yet after having finished the work his ther had given him to do went back into  country to prepare a place for all them who lieve in him and there he still lives begging d pleading for those unkind people whom he ll loves and forgives and will restore to the chased inheritance on the easy terms of their ing heartily sorry for what they have done thoghly desirous of pardon and convinced that he  able and willing to save to the utmost all them that  unto him  i saw indeed that many old offenders appeared  be sorry for what they had done that is they did  like to be punished for it they were willing ough to be delivered from the penalty of their  but they did not heartily wish to be delivered  the power of it many declared in the most public manner once every week that they we very sorry they had done amiss but it was  enough to declare their sorrow ever so often  they gave no other sign of their penitence  there was so little truth in them that the lord rquired other proofs of their sincerity beside the own word for they often lied with their lips an dissembled with their tongue but those who prfessed to be penitents were neither allowed  raise heaps of clay by circumventing their neigbours or to have great piles lying by them usele nor must they barter them for any of these id vanities which reduced the heaps on a sudden for i found that among the grand articles of futu reckoning the use they had made of the hea would be a principal one  i was sorry to observe many of the fairer pa of these pilgrims spend too much of their hea in adorning and beautifying their tenements  clay in painting and white washing and enameling them all those tricks however did not prserve them from decay and when they grew ol they even looked worse for all this cost and vanish some however acted a more sensible pa and spent no more upon their mouldering tements than just to keep them whole and clean an in good repair which is what every tenant oug to do and i observed that those who were modrate in the care of their own tenements were mo attentive to repair and warm the ragged tenements  others but none did this with much zeal or acceance but those who had acquired a habit of ov looking the things below and also by the consta use of the telescope had got their natural we and dim sight so strengthened as to be able to  pretty distinctly the nature of the things above e habit of fixing their eyes on these glories ade all the shining trifles which composed the  of things below at last appear in their own minutive littleness for it was in this case partiularly true that things are only big or little by mparison and there was no other way of makg the things below appear as small as they really re but by comparing them by means of the teleope with the things above but i observed that e false judgment of the pilgrims ever kept pace th their wrong practices for those who kept their es fastened on the things below were reckoned  in their generation while the few who look forward to the future glories were account by the bustlers or heapers to be either fools  mad  well  most of these pilgrims went on in adorng their tenements adding to their heaps graspg the things below as if they would never let em go shutting their eyes instead of using their tescope and neglecting their title deed as if it was  parchment of another mans estate and not their n till one after another each felt his tenement mbling about his ears  o then what a busy stling anxious terrifying distracting moment was at what a deal of business was to be done and that a strange time was this to do it in now to e the confusion and dismay occasioned by having  every thing to the last minute first some  was sent for to make over the yellow heaps to other which the heaper now found would be of  use to himself in shooting the gulf a transfer which ought to have been made while the tenement s sound then there was a consultation between two or three masons at once perhaps to try to pat up the walls and strengthen the props and stop  decays of the tumbling tenement but not till  masons were forced to declare it was past repairing a truth they were rather too apt to keep back di the tenant seriously think it was time to pac up prepare and begone then what sending  the wise men who professed to explain the tit deed and oh what remorse that they had nelected to examine it till their senses were too confused for so weighty a business what reproache or what exhortations to others to look better after their own affairs even to the wisest of the inhbitants the falling of their tenements was a solemn thing solemn but not surprising they had lo been packing up and preparing they praised the lords goodness that they had been suffered to sta so long many acknowledged the mercy of their frequent warnings and confessed that those ver dilapidations which had made the house uncomfortable had been a blessing as it had set them  diligent preparation for their future inheritance had made them more earnest in examining their titl to it and had set them on such a frequent application to the telescope that the things above ha seemed every day nearer and nearer these desired not to be uncloathed but to be clothed upon for they knew that if their frail tabernacle was dissolved they had an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens  the end
