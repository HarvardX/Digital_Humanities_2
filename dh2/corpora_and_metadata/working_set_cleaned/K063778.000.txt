a sermon preached before the university of cambridge  dangers incidental to the clerical character stated  in a sermon preached before the university of cambridge at great st marys church on sunday july  th being commencement sunday  by william paley d d archdeacon of carlisle etc  london printed for r faulder new bondstreet       to lowther yates d d vice chancellor and the heads of colleges in the university of cambridge as a testimony to many of them of the affection with which the author retains his academical friendships and to all of the respect with which he regards their stations the following discourse is inscribed by their faithful servant w paley    corinthians ix  part of the   th verse lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway these words discover the anxiety not to say the fears of the writer concerning the event of his personal salvation and when interpreted by the words which precede them strictly connect that event with the purity of his personal character  it is extremely material to remember who it was that felt this deep solicitude for the fate of his spiritual interests and the persuasion that his acceptance insofar as it is procured by human endeavors would depend upon the care and exactness with which he regulated his own passions and his own conduct because if a man ever existed who in the zeal and labor with which he served the cause of religion in the ardour or the efficacy of his preaching in his sufferings or his success might hope for some excuse to indulgence some license for gratifications which were forbidden to others it was the author of the text which has been now read to you yet the apostle appears to have known and by his knowledge teaches us that no exertion of industry no display of talents no public merit however great or however good or sacred be the cause in which it is acquired will compensate for the neglect of personal selfgovernment  this in my opinion is an important lesson to all to none certainly can it be more applicable than it is in every age to the teachers of religion for a little observation of the world must have informed us that the human mind is prone almost beyond resistance to sink the weakness or the irregularities of private character in the view of public services that this propensity is the strongest in a mans own case that it prevails more powerfully in religion than in other subjects inasmuch as the teachers of religion consider themselves and rightly do so as ministering to the higher interests of human existence  still farther if there be causes as i believe there are which raise extraordinary difficulties in the way of those who are engaged in the offices of religion circumstances even of disadvantage in the prosession and character as far as relates to the conservation of their own virtue it behooves them to adopt the apostles caution with more than common care because it is only to prepare themselves for dangers to which they are more than commonly exposed  nor is there good reason for concealing either from ourselves or others any unfavourable dispositions which the nature of our employment or situation may tend to generate for be they what they will they only prove that it happens to us according to the condition of human life with many benefits to receive some inconveniences with many helps to experience some trials that with many peculiar motives to virtue and means of improvement in it some obstacles are presented to our progress which it may require a distinct and positive effort of the mind to surmount  i apprehend that i am stating a cause of no inconsiderable importance when amongst these impediments i mention in the first place the insensibility to religious impression which a constant conversation with religious subjects and still more a constant intermixture with religious offices is wont to induce such is the frame of the human constitution and calculated also for the wisest purposes that whilst all active habits are facilitated and strengthened by repetition impressions under which we are passive are weakened and diminished upon the first of these properties depends in a great measure the exercise of the arts of life upon the second the capacity which the mind possesses of adapting itself to almost every situation this quality is perceived in numerous and for the most part beneficial examples scenes of terror spectacles of pain objects of loathing and disgust so far lose their effect with their novelty as to permit professions to be carried on and conditions of life to be endured which otherwise although necessary would be insupportable it is a quality however which acts as other parts of our frame do by an operation which is general hence it acts also in instances in which its influence is to be corrected and amongst these in religion every attentive christian will have observed how much more powerfully he is affected by any form of worship which is uncommon than with the familiar returns of his own religious offices he will be sensible of the difference when he approaches a few times in the year the sacrament of the lords supper if he should be present at the visitation of the sick or even if that were unusual to him at the sight of a family assembled in prayer he will perceive it also upon entering the doors of a dissenting congregation a circumstance which has misled many by causing them to ascribe to some advantage in the conduct of public worship what in truth is only the effect of new impressions now by how much a lay frequenter of religious worship finds himself less warmed and stimulated by ordinary than by extraordinary acts of devotion by so much it may be expected that a clergyman habitually conversant with the offices of religion will be less moved and stimulated than he is what then is to be done it is by an effort of reflection by a positive exertion of the mind by knowing this tendency and by setting ourselves expressly to resist it that we are to repair the decays of spontaneous piety we are no more to surrender ourselves to the mechanism of our frame than to the impulse of our passions we are to assist our sensitive by our rational nature we are to supply this infirmity for so it may be called although like many other properties which bear the name of vices in our constitution it be in truth a beneficial principle acting according to a general law  we are to supply it by a deeper sense of the obligations under which we lie by a more frequent and a more distinct recollection of the reasons upon which that obligation is founded we are not to wonder at the pains which this may cost us still less are we to imitate the despondency of some serious christians who in the impaired sensibility that habit has induced bewail the coldness of a deserted soul  hitherto our observation will not be questioned but i think that this principle goes farther than is generally known or acknowledged i think that it extends to the influence which argument itself possesses upon our understanding or at least to the influence which it possesses in determining our will i will not say that in a subject strictly intellectual and in science properly so called a demonstration is the less convincing for being old but i am not sure that this is not in some measure true of moral evidence and probable proofs in practical subjects however where two things are to be done the understanding to be convinced and the will to be persuaded i believe that the force of every argument is diminished by triteness and familiarity the intrinsic value of the argument must be the same the impression may be very different  but we have a disadvantage to contend with additional to this the consequence of repetition will be felt more sensibly by us who are in the habit of directing our arguments to others for it always requires a second a separate and an unusual effort of the mind to bring back the conclusion upon ourselves in constructing in expressing in delivering our arguments in all the thoughts and study which we employ upon them what we are apt to hold continually in our view is the effect which they may produce upon those who hear or read them the further and best use of our meditations their influence upon our own hearts and consciences is lost in the presence of the other in philosophy itself it is not always the same thing to study a subject in order to understand and in order only to teach it in morals and religion the powers of persuasion are cultivated by those whose employment is public instruction but their wishes are fulfilled and their care exhausted in promoting the success of their endeavors upon others the secret duty of turning truly and in earnest their attention upon themselves is suspended not to say forgotten amidst the labors the engagements the popularity of their public ministry and in the best disposed minds is interrupted by the anxiety or even by the satisfaction with which their public services are performed  these are dangers adhering to the very nature of our profession but the evil is often also augmented by our imprudence in our wishes to convince we are extremely apt to overstate our arguments we think no confidence with which we speak of them can be too great when our intention is to urge them upon our hearers this zeal not seldom i believe defeats its own purpose even with those whom we address but it always destroys the efficacy of the argument upon ourselves we are conscious of the exaggeration whether our hearers perceive it or not and this consciousness corrupts to us the whole influence of the conclusion robs it even of its just value demonstration admits of no degrees but real life knows nothing of demonstration it converses only with moral evidence and moral reasoning in these the scale of probability is extensive and every argument has its place in it it may not be quite the same thing to overstate a true reason and to advance a false one but since two questions present themselves to the judgment usually joined together by their nature and importance viz on which side probability lies and how much it preponderates to transgress the rules of fair reasoning in either question in either to go beyond our own perception of the subject is a similar if not an equal fault in both cases it is a want of candor which approaches to a want of veracity but that in which its worst effect is seen that at least which it belongs to this discourse to notice is in its so undermining the solidity of our proofs that our own understandings refuse to rest upon them in vitiating the integrity of our own judgments in rendering our minds as well incapable of estimating the proper strength of moral and religious arguments as unreasonably suspicious of their truth and dull and insensible to their impression  if dangers to our character accompany the exercise of our public ministry they no less attend upon the nature of our professional studies it has been said that literary trifling upon the scriptures has a tendency above all other employments to harden the heart if by this maxim it be designed to reprove the exercise to check the freedom or to question the utility of critical researches when employed upon the sacred volume it is not by me to be defended if it mean simply to guard us against an existing danger to state an usual and natural consequence the maxim wants neither truth nor use it is founded in this observation when any one by the command of learning and talents has been fortunate enough to clear up an obscurity or to settle a doubt in the interpretation of scripture pleased and justly pleased with the result of his endeavors his thoughts are wont to indulge this complacency and there to stop or when another by a patient application of inferior faculties has made as he thinks some progress in theological studies or even has with much attention engaged in them he is apt to rest and stay in what he deems a religious and meritorious service the critic and the commentator do not always proceed with the reflection that if these things be true if this book do indeed convey to us the will of god then is it no longer to be studied and criticized alone but what is a very different work to be obeyed and to be acted upon at least this ulterior operation of the mind enfeebled perhaps by former exertions of quite another nature does not always retain sufficient force and vigor to bend the obstinacy of the will to describe the evil is to point out the remedy which must consist in holding steadfastly within our view this momentous consideration that however laboriously or however successfully we may have cultivated religious studies howmuchsoever we may have added to our learning or our fame we have hitherto done little for our salvation that a more arduous to us perhaps a new and it may be a painful work which the public eye sees not which no public favor will reward yet remains to be attempted that of instituting an examination of our hearts and of our conduct of altering the secret course of our behavior of reducing with whatever violence to our habits loss of our pleasures or interruption of our pursuits its deviations to a conformity with those rules of life which are delivered in the volume that lies open before us and which if it be of importance enough to deserve our study ought for reasons infinitely superior to command our obedience  another disadvantage incidental to the character of which we are now exposing the dangers is the moral debility that arises from the want of being trained in the virtues of active life this complaint belongs not to the clergy as such because their pastoral office affords as many calls and as many opportunities for beneficent exertions as are usually found in private stations but it belongs to that secluded contemplative life which men of learning often make choice of or into which they are thrown by the accident of their fortunes a great part of mankind owe their principles to their practice that is to that wonderful accession of strength and energy which good dispositions receive from good actions it is difficult to sustain virtue by meditation alone but let our conclusions only have influence enough once to determine us upon a course of virtue and that influence will acquire such augmentation of force from every instance of virtuous endeavor as ere long to produce in us constancy and resolution a formed and a fixed character of this great and progressive assistance to their principles men who are withdrawn from the business and the intercourse of civil life find themselves in some measure deprived virtue in them is left more than in others to the dictates of reason to a sense of duty less aided by the power of habit i will not deny that this difference renders their virtue more pure more actual and nearer to its principle but it renders it less easy to be attained or preserved  having proposed these circumstances as difficulties of which i think it useful that our order should be apprised and as growing out of the functions of the profession its studies or the situations in which it places us i proceed with the same view to notice a turn and habit of thinking which is of late become very general amongst the higher classes of the community amongst all who occupy stations of authority and in common with these two descriptions of men amongst the clergy that which i am about to animadvert upon is in its place and to a certain degree undoubtedly a fair and right consideration but in the extent to which it prevails has a tendency to discharge from the hearts of mankind all religious principle whatever what i mean is the performing of our religious offices for the sake of setting an example to others and the allowing of this motive so to take possession of the mind as to substitute itself into the place of the proper ground and reason of the duty i must be permitted to contend that whenever this is the case it becomes not only a cold and extraneous but a false and unreasonable principle of action a conduct propagated through the different ranks of society merely by this motive is a chain without a support a fabric without a foundation the parts indeed depend upon one another but there is nothing to bear up the whole there must be some reason for every duty beside example or there can be no sufficient reason for it at all it is a perversion therefore of the regular order of our ideas to suffer a consideration which whatever be its importance is only secondary and consequential to another to shut out that other from the thoughts the effect of this in the offices of religion is utterly to destroy their religious quality to rob them of that which gives to them their life their spirituality their nature they who would set an example to others of acts of worship and devotion in truth perform none themselves idle or proud spectators of the scene they vouchsafe their presence in our assemblies for the edification it seems and benefit of others but as if they had no sins of their own to deplore no mercies to acknowledge no pardon to entreat  shall the consideration then of example be prohibited and discarded from the thoughts by no means but let it attend upon not supersede the proper motive of the action let us learn to know and feel the reason the value and the obligation of the duty as it concerns ourselves and in proportion as we are affected by the force of these considerations we shall desire and desiring endeavor to extend their influence to others this wish flowing from an original sense of each duty preserves to the duty its proper principle let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven the glory of your heavenly father is still you observe the termination of the precept the love of god that zeal for his honor and service which love which gratitude which piety inspires are still to be the operating motive of your conduct because we find it convenient to ourselves that those about us should be religious or because it is useful to the state that religion should be upheld in the country to join from these motives in the public ordinances of the church for the sake of maintaining their credit by our presence and example however advisable it may be as a branch of secular prudence is not either to fulfill our lords precept or to perform any religious service religion can only spring from its own principle believing our salvation to be involved in the faithful discharge of our religious as well as moral duties or rather that they are the same experiencing the warmth the consolation the virtuous energy which every act of true devotion communicates to the heart and how much these effects are heightened by consent and sympathy with the benevolence with which we love our neighbor loving also and seeking his immortal welfare when prompted by these sentiments we unite with him in acts of social homage to our maker then has every principle its weight then at length is our worship what it ought to be exemplary yet our own not the less personal for being public we bring our hearts to the service and not a constrained attendance upon the place with oftentimes an illconcealed indifference to what is there passing  if what we have stated concerning example be true if the consideration of it be liable to be overstretched or misapplied no persons can be more in danger of falling into the mistake than they who are taught to regard themselves as placed in their stations for the purpose of becoming the examples as well as instructors of their flocks it is necessary that they should be admonished to revert continually to the fundamental cause of all obligation and of all duty particularly to remember that in their religious offices they have not only to pronounce to excite to conduct the devotion of their congregations but to pay to god the adoration which themselves owe to him in a word amidst their care of others to save their own souls by their own religion  these i think are some of the causes which in the conduct of their lives call for a peculiar attention from the clergy and from men of learning and which render the apostles example and the lesson which it teaches peculiarly applicable to their circumstances it remains only to remind them of a consideration which ought to counteract these disadvantages by producing a care and solicitude sufficient to meet every danger and every difficulty to remind them i say for they cannot need to be informed of our lords solemn declaration that contumacious knowledge and neglected talents knowledge which does not lead to obedience and talents which rest in useless speculations will be found in the day of final account amongst the objects of his severest displeasure would to god that men of learning always understood how deeply they are concerned in this warning it is impossible to add another reason which can be equal or second to our lords admonition but we may suggest a motive of very distant indeed but of no mean importance and to which they certainly will not refuse its due regard the honor and estimation of learning itself irregular morals in men of distinguished seize render them not despised for talents and learning never can be despicable but subjects of malicious remark perhaps of affected pity to the enemies of intellectual liberty of science and literature and at the same time of sincere though silent regret to those who are desirous of supporting the esteem which ought to await the successful pursuit of ingenuous studies we entreat such men to reflect that their conduct will be made the reply of idleness to industry the revenge of dullness and ignorance upon parts and learning to consider how many will seek and think they find in their example an apology for sloth and for indifference to all liberal improvement what a theme lastly they supply to those who to the discouragement of every mental exertion preach up the vanity of human knowledge and the danger or the mischief of superior seize  but if the reputation of learning be concerned in the conduct of those who devote themselves to its pursuit the sacred interests of morality are not less so it is for us to take care that we justify not the boasts or the sneers of infidelity that we do not authorize the worst of all skepticism that which would subvert the distinctions of moral good and evil by insinuating concerning them that their only support is prejudice their only origin in the artifice of the wise and the credulity of the multitude and that these things are but too clearly confessed by the lives of men of learning and enquiry this calumny let us contradict let us refute let us show that virtue and christianity cast their deepest foundations in knowledge that however they may ask the aid of principles which in a great degree govern human life and which must necessarily therefore be either powerful allies or irresistible adversaries of education of habit of example of public authority of public institutions they rest nevertheless upon the firm basis of rational argument let us testify to the world our sense of this great truth by the only evidence which the world will believe the influence of our conclusions upon our own conduct  finis
