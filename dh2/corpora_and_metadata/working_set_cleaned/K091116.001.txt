the ecess or a ale of other times  the recess or a tale of other times  by the author of the chapter of accidents  are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we but the penalty of adam the seasons difference vol i  london printed for t cadell in the strand  mdcclxxxv  to sir john eliot baronet sir i should but affront a heart which finds its first pleasure in obliging by asking a formal permission to publish its merits which alone could induce me to surprise you with this address time and distance may have erased the author from your memory but neither can obliterate from hers the gratitude due to a gentleman who uniting sympathy with science and generosity with both becomes to the suffering a subordinate providence indebted to your friendly endeavors till my heart is as cold as those even your skill could not save i shall always remain  sir your highly obliged humble servant sophia lee bath advertisement not being permitted to publish the means which enriched me with the obsolete manuscript from whence the following tale is extracted its simplicity alone can authenticate it  i make no apology for altering the language to that of the present age since the authors would be frequently unintelligible  a wonderful coincidence of events stamps the narration at least with probability and the reign of elizabeth was that of romance if this lady was not the child of fancy her fate can hardly be paralleled and the line of which she came has been marked by an eminent historian as one distinguished alike by splendour and misery  the characters interwoven in this story agree in the outline with history and if love or friendship veil a fault or irradiate a virtue it is but reasonable to allow of a weakness all feel in some particular instance history like painting only perpetuates the striking features of the mind whereas the best and worst actions of princes often proceed from partialities and prejudices which live in their hearts and are buried with them  the depredations of time have left chafms in the story which sometimes only heightens the pathetic an inviolable respect for truth would not permit me to attempt connecting these even where they appeared faulty  to the hearts of both sexes nature has enriched with sensibility and experience with refinement this tale is humbly offered in the persuasion such will find it worthy their patronage  the recess etc to adelaide marie de montmorenci after a long and painful journey through life with a heart exhausted by afflictions and eyes which can no longer supply tears to lament them i turn my every thought toward that grave on the verge of which i hover oh why then too generous friend require me to live over my misfortunes such has been the peculiarity of my fate that though tortured with the possession and the loss of every tie and hope that exalts or endears humanity let but this feeble frame be covered with the dust from which it sprung and no trace of my ever having existed would remain except in the wounded consciences of those who marked me out a solitary victim to the crimes of my progenitors for surely i could never merit by my own the misery of living as i have done  of dying as i must do  alas your partial affection demands a memorial which calls back to being all the sad images buried in my bosom and opens anew every vein of my heart yet consummate misery has a moral use and if ever these sheets reach the public let the repiner at little evils learn to be juster to his god and himself by unavoidable comparison but am i not assuming an insolent consequence in thus admonishing alas it is the dearbought privilege of the unfortunate to be tedious  my life commenced with an incident so extraordinary as the following facts alone could incline any one to credit as soon as capable of reflection i found myself and a sister of my own age in an apartment with a lady and a maid older than herself  every day furnished us with whatever was necessary for subsistence or improvement supplied as it seemed by some invisible hand for i rarely missed either of the few who commonly surrounded me this recess could not be called a cave because it was composed of various rooms and the stones were obviously united by labor yet every room was distinct and divided from the rest by a vaulted passage with many stairs while our light proceeded from small casements of painted glass so infinitely above our reach that we could never seek a world beyond and so dim that the beams of the sun were almost a new object to us when we quitted this retirement these remarks occurred as our minds unfolded for at first we were content through habit and ignorance nor once bestowed a thought on surrounding objects the lady i have mentioned called us her children and caressed us both with parental fondness  blessed with every gentle charm it is not wonderful she fully possessed the affections of those who had no one else to idolize every morning we met in a larger room than the rest where a very venerable man performed mass and concluded with a discourse calculated to endear retirement from him we learnt there was a terrible large place called the world where a few haughty individuals commanded miserable millions whom a few artful ones made so that providence had graciously rescued us from both nor could we ever be sufficiently grateful young hearts teem with unformed ideas and are but too susceptible of elevated and enthusiastic impressions time gave this man insensibly an influence over us as a superior being to which his appearance greatly contributed imagine a tall and robust figure habited in black and marked by a commanding austerity of manners  his features bore the traces of many sorrows and a kind of early old age which interested every observer the fire and nobility of his eye the gracefulness of his decay and the heartaffecting solemnity of his voice while on his reverend temples grew the blossoms of the grave gave an authority almost irresistible to father anthony as we called him from hearing our mamma to whom we understood he was brother he usually partook our dinner and from that time till the next morning vanished for we knew not how or where he went the interval we passed in little useful works or in conversation with our mamma whose only employment was that of forming our minds for the world we were taught to dread  she was our world and all the tender affections of which i have since proved my heart so full centered in her and my sister time and sorrow had given a wan delicacy to features exquisitely regular while the soft symmetry of her person united every common idea of beauty and elegance to a feminine helplessness which is when unaffected the most interesting of all charms her temper was equal and her understanding enriched by a most extensive knowledge to which she was every day adding by perpetual study inclined strongly by nature to serious reflection and all her favorite employments i used to pass those hours at her side ellinor devoted to her playthings or to alice whose memory was overcharged with those mavelous tales children always delight in as our ideas every day expanded we thought more and more concerning our origin and our imprisonment we knew father anthony constantly disappeared but how or where was a secret beyond our comprehension for in all our researches we never found a door except those common to the family and which shut us from the world ellinor whose lively imagination readily imbibed the romantic and extravagant conjectured we were in the power of some giant nay such was her disgust to father anthony that she sometimes apprehended he was a magician and would one day or other devour us i had a very different idea and fancied our retreat a hallowed circle to seclude us from the wicked while father anthony was our guardian genius frequently we by agreement interrogated alice who though fond to the common degree of an old nurse of both but more especially ellen resisted those little arts nature herself inspires our mamma we now and then ventured to sound but her gravity always disconcerted us and we retreated from a vain attempt  she once absented herself fourteen days and left us to our own conjectures in a spot truly chearless part of the time we spent in searching once more for a door and the rest in childish lamentations for her loss which alice still assured us would be but a temporary one inflexible in the discharge of her duty she still persisted in locking our apartment every day after dinner at which time all who had occasion doubtless passed in and out of the recess  being deprived of my customary resource books to amuse a part of our melancholy leisure we mutually agreed to invent tales from the many wholelength pictures which ornamented the best room and to take them as they came alternately ellinor readily invented a ludicrous story upon the portrait of an old man which made us both laugh heartily i turned my eyes to consider what i should say about the next they rested on the figure of a man of noble mien his dress i then knew no name for but have since found to be armor a page held his helmet and his hair of a pale brown fell over his shoulders he was surrounded with many emblems of martial merit and his eyes which seemed bent on me were full of a tender sweetness a sentiment of veneration mingled with a surprising softness pierced my soul at once my tongue faltered with a nameless idea and i rested my head against the shoulder of my sister that dear girl turned to me with quickness and the beam of her eye was like that of the picture i surveyed her over and over and found in every feature the strongest resemblance when she frowned she had all his dignity when she smiled all his sweetness an awe i could not conquer made me unable to form any tale on that subject and i directed my attention toward the next it represented a lady in the flower of youth dressed in mourning and seeming in every feature to be marked by sorrow a black veil half shaded a coronet she wept over if the last picture awakened veneration this seemed to call forth a thousand melting sensations the tears rushed involuntarily into our eyes and clasping we wept upon the bosoms of each other ah who can these be cried we both together why do our hearts thus throb before inanimate canvas surely every thing we behold is but part of one great mystery when will the day come destined to clear it up we walked arm in arm round and moralized on every portrait but none interested us like these we were never weary of surveying or talking about them a young heart is frequently engrossed by a favorite idea amid all the glare of the great world nor is it then wonderful ours were thus possessed when entombed alive in such a narrow boundary i knew not why but we lived in the presence of these pictures as if they understood us and blushed when we were guilty of the slightest folly  the moment our mamma returned we flew into her arms and interrupted her tender caresses with importunate enquiries concerning these favorite pictures she regarded us with astonishment  her eyes filled with tears and she bade us leave her to recover herself alone shortly after she summoned alice and held with her a conversation which restored her tranquillity but she carefully avoided our enquiries endeavoring to diversify our hours by music drawing poetry geography and every ornamental branch of education whenever we verged toward an hint about the retreat  wait my dear girls she would say the appointed hour  alas one may follow it when you will wish yourselves still uninformed  impressed with an undefinable melancholy our years passed on till womanhood approached  pardon me if i linger over these scenes i have but few such to relate and they are all of my life upon which my heart dares to pause how are we born to invent our own miseries we start forward from the goal of youth fearless and impatient nor know the heights and depths through which we must labor oppressed in turn by every element and often over whelmed with that most in supportable of all burdens our own dissatisfied souls how have i wept the moment i quitted the recess  a moment i then lived but in hope of to be always erring is the weakness of humanity and to be always repenting its punishment  alas could we learn wisdom without experience mankind would perhaps be too happy  father anthony in time ingratiated himself with us by his continual remonstrances against our being shut up in a place which bounded our ideas so much that he despaired of making us comprehend half of what he taught us we seconded his advice with endless entreaties our mamma who was persuasion itself in her own person was not proof against it in that of another alas my children would she often say by what fatality do you so passionately desire to leave a home you will hereafter remember with a pleasure full of regret in vain you would return to it  you will lose a taste for the tranquil enjoyments this solitude offers without perhaps finding any to supply them yet far be the selfish weakness from my heart of punishing you even for your welfare you shall see this admired world may it ever please you as it will at first sight  we embraced her with youthful transport and then each other  we shall go at last exclaimed both together we shall see many more like ourselves  what say you children cried she ah you will see few indeed like yourselves  the next day was appointed for our enfranchisement we packed and unpacked our little luggage fifty times over for mere employment till the appointed hour came when we were summoned to the chamber of our only friend who was walking about apparently agitated with a secret  are you grieved mamma cried i that we are going to be happy  ah no matilda i am grieved because i think you are just ceasing to be so in this peaceful solitude i could supply to you every lost relation  the adopted children of my heart i stood between you and a fate at once distinguished obscure and affecting  alas why do you wrest yourselves and your secret from me why do you oblige me to tell you you must never more call me any thing but mrs marlow  never more call you mamma sighed i incoherently who then are our parents  you have no father he who gave you a being sleeps in the bosom of god  our mother    lives  but not for you  enquire no farther let this specimen of knowledge teach you to fear it  when the time requires it i shall disclose your whole story  weep no more my lovely my affecting girls i have lost but a name for my nature is unalterable all who will see us know i never was married which absolutely compelled me to this discovery but i dare believe they will rely on my rectitude and welcome you by whatever name i shall give you reasons you will hereafter know induce me always to conceal a retreat where alone i could have hid you and both must ere we leave it solemnly promise never to disclose the secret  chilled with this solemn preparation our desire of liberty vanished we felt like links struck from the chain of creation and still with restless imaginations explored the remainder of a mystery which we wept by anticipation she lives but not for you were words whose sound vibrated to my heart while pleasure danced around me and the doubt attending the future often robbed the present of enjoyment  after we had made at her knees the strict promise required she muffled our faces and taking my hand as alice did my sisters led us through many cold passages for some minutes when unbinding our eyes we found ourselves in a noble cloister we flew into the garden it bordered and how strong was the impression of the scene before us from the mansion which stood on a hill spread a rich and fertile valley mingled with thickets half seen or clustered hamlets while through the living landscape flowed a clear river  and to the main the liquid serpent drew his silver train   the sun was sinking involved in swelling waves of gold and purple upon whom we almost gazed ourselves blind for though we had often read and heard of his effulgence the author of universal being can alone display it imagination madam may sometimes surpass the wonders of art but those of nature leave all imagination far behind  mrs marlow led us through the abbey which might rather be called a palace it was erected upon the ruins of a monastery destroyed at the reformation and still was called by the name of st vincent it had all the gothic magnificence and elegance and we learnt with pleasure that mrs marlow the sister of its owner lord scroope was considered by every servant as its mistress a noble apartment within hers was allotted for us and the charms of the new world mingled with our melancholy reveries alike destroying our rest the rising of the sun whose first beams gilt our windows rouzed us entirely methinks while i expatiate on these trifles time seems suspended and the scene still existing before me the rich dewdrops those jewels with which nature decks her bosom glittering to the rays that wandered over the grass the various animals that seemed to derive a daily existence from the return of that glorious orb the morning hymn of the winged creation all united to awaken our gratitude and humble us before the author of our being accept oh god would we cry spontaneously the adoration of two hearts who know no claim in this mighty universe but thee oh deign to bless the desire of doing right with the power and if only sorrow touch our hearts sanctify it with resignation so when time delivers us up to eternity hope may be our conductor  we were delighted with a playful group of fawns and deer with whom we longed to frolic and stole through mrs marlows chamber into the park by a passage she had pointed out to us the day before what was our surprise when we saw those with whom we had in idea mingled were large fierce creatures and that had they not run from us we must from them that every bird feared its natural protector and that man lived in continual warfare with every things in creation even to his own species  i am tedious and must have done with these puerilities which yet on reflection yield the purest pleasures of our lives mrs marlow procured for us the best instructors in every art and science that remote residence afforded and by her own example gave that elegant finish to our manners precept never can extremely detached by our situation from society we easily discerned mrs marlow was willing we should be so for she frequently expressed anxiety at the thoughts of lord scroopes return who i understood was sent ambassador to the hague from queen elizabeth our masters our servants and the various rustics who tenanted the estate met in the chapel of st vincents abbey once a week and those were all our intercourse with society on the evening of every sunday we regularly went to the cell of father anthony which was a cot raised by lord scroope to whom he stood in the same relation as mrs marlow on the verge of a large wood which sheltered the mansion behind here while we were indulged with all those simple repasts novelty gives charms to our minds were enlarged by conversations on every thing sublime or instructive if benevolence drew mrs marlow abroad she made us always her companions and gave her alms but through our hands ordering us ever to add some mite of our own in proportion to our means avarice is rarely the vice of youth at least if i may judge by my own heart for the chief joy of receiving to me was that of giving nor could charity have descended to earth in a more lovely form than that of mrs marlow at a tale of distress her eye assumed a melting benignity rarely seen and never described while her approach gave that pleasure to every sufferer one should feel at the visible presence of a guardian angel  three years elapsed in this manner ere lord scroope returned and when he did he was so deeply engaged in politics that the various presents he continually sent from london was to us the only difference  still the sad found  your mother lives  but not for you rung through our hearts occasionally still we equally desired to discover the recess and wandered through st vincents abbey with the same curiosity we once before did through that the more we reflected the more we were convinced it must be near us but the respect we had for mrs marlows solemn injunctions sealed our lips to every servant and we never were allowed to ramble unattended  mrs marlow endued with the purest principles justly conceived happiness the noblest use of understanding and bent her whole attention toward convincing us the fate appointed us was the most desirable in the world here would she say in a happy retirement free alike from the drudgeries of high or low life peace and innocence becalms your hearts and blooms on your cheeks unenvying and unenvied as now may that moment find you none can avoid ah how unlike the vices and miseries of a court there you can have no vice so injurious to yourselves as sincerity no merit like hypocrisy love and friendship are unknown and their names made use of but to entrap the unwary women that have beauty are destroyed by it and all who have not are neglected the gifts of man take place of the gifts of god and money alone constitutes merit  ah never never my dear girls can you enough bless that indulgent providence which withdraws you from it  shall i confess my vanity when i looked in the glass i did not think i should be neglected even at court i had no opportunity for forming any just comparison indeed for the rustics around us scorched with toil had only charms enough left to show what they might have been with care the clearness of my complexion and the delicacy of my features left me no equal but my sister nay even our habits though often only of a finer camblet than theirs were made in so different a manner that they did not appear to be composed of the same materials  however disposed to profit by the advice of our more than parent heaven did not permit us to be happy the clouds broke at once over our heads mrs marlow our only tie on earth and therefore doubly prized was seized with a fever the more dangerous because it was not violent enough at first to show itself to paint our distraction would be a vain attempt kneeling on each side her bed for fourteen days and nights we by tears and inward supplications persecuted the almighty affectionately attached to us she struggled for our sakes with the disorder till having worn her down to a skeleton it began at last to abate but notwithstanding every effort of art could never be eradicated scarce had we breathed after this distress when an express from london delivered a packet to mrs marlow which occasioned her instantly to summon father anthony they remained in consultation for some time when they bade alice order us instantly to join them  my children said mrs marlow faintly an unforeseen event obliges us once more to retire to the recess every thing is at this moment preparing for our reception you are now at years to judge of the importance of its concealment nor will i longer make it a mystery  but why thus afflict yourselves for a temporary restraint if i am willing for your sakes to be carried thither like a corpse into a tomb surely you will not be so ungenerous as to vent one selfish lamentation  effectually silenced by this noble reproof we collected in confusion and grief our clothes and ornaments when returning to her room we found there father anthony an old domestic called james alice and the housekeeper who having dispersed the other servants preceded us to a storeroom on the ground floor and opening a press unfastened a false back which conducted us into a closet dark but for our torches she then lifted a part of the floor fitted very neatly and discovered a narrow pair of stairs down which we went leaving her behind and effectually secured ourselves by bolting it firmly on the inside we past through several subterraneous passages built on arches and preserved from damps by cavities which passed through every statue that ornamented the garden till at last we reached our prison but judge of my astonishment when i found the so oftensought entrance was a door of the size of that portrait which first gave me such singular sensations and which i perceived was made to fall together with a spring almost imperceptible  father anthony silenced the exclamations i would have made and drew me at once to mrs marlow who pale and lifeless with the fatigue of this removal gave additional terrors to the moment whether the agitation of her mind increased her malady or it was originally beyond cure i know not but saw with spechless affliction from the moment of our return to the recess she would never leave it alive enclosed in a spot without sufficient air attendance or advice we saw her finish her generous attachment to us by resolutely resisting our entreaties  let us quit this dreary place i would say if but for a cottage let us not in losing you have the cruel aggravation of contributing to so great a misfortune  oh what more can we have to fear than the loss of all we love  why why my children returned she thus embitter a common fate can i who have voluntarily passed my youth in a tomb dread to bury my dust in it you know my opinion is singular nor do i think man could avert the stroke when god recalls us however wise or willing if i had been taken earlier from you indeed heavy to all must have been the calamity but after having taught you to live there remains this only lesson and my duty is complete you now are enabled to judge for yourselves confide in god and he will not desert you  alas would i cry drowned in tears from your eye alone have we learnt when we did any thing aright we shall no longer know good from evil when that dear eye is closed  matilda replied she with a solemn air remember only when you are called to any important action to consult your heart in solitude god has placed in that heart an unerring monitor and if we hear not the small still voice it is because we drown it in the noise of the world then shall we meet again to part no more then at the tribunal of the most high i shall gladly say these treasures o lord did thou entrust to my hand unfullied behold even so i restore them  rising up as she pronounced these words she held a hand of each of us to her heart while her eyes streamed with a kind of glory when lifted toward her creator never did i see such an animated figure her soul seemed that moment bursting from its beauteous mansion to join its sister angels  matilda and ellinor my more than children you recollect said she i suppressed your curiosity once by telling you i would reveal your secret finally when the hour demanded it that hour is come alas i cannot but weep to remember that a thousand interesting ideas are now going to withdraw your affections from her who agonizes over you  we kissed her hand in speechless sorrow   it is true continued she my brother might hereafter disclose your story but there are among its incidents some that need the gentleness of a woman to teach you to bewail without imitating in this little history you will find the full motive of my retreat and the means by which it was effected  you already know i am sister to the present lord scroope but you know not that i derived my birth from the illjudged zeal of my mother bred up a papist she no sooner entertained a passion for lord scroope than she formed a design to convert him to the catholic religion she was handsome as i have always heard and he was young he affected to be sensible of her efforts which redoubled her zeal she thought the love of heaven alone actuated her heart but he took advantage of those moments and she found too late she had sacrificed her own souls welfare to his indulgence her relations who had the more encouraged her as my father was a great match in point of fortune exasperated at an error they ought rather to have charged themselves with shut her up and treated her with the utmost rigor   in this terrible situation she was delivered of me her relations took me instantly from her sight they wrapped me in the most disgraceful habiliments and sent me with a letter full of the bitterest threats and taunts to my father far from feeling that indifference very young men usually behold their offspring with he received me as the first gift of heaven and committing me to the charge of proper people made me of no less consequence than if i had been his legitimate daughter and heiress of his estate  in the mean time my mother was kept in total ignorance of the fate of her child miserable in her own heart and eternally taunted for the disgrace she had brought on her family she at length resolved to make her escape to lord scroope  she effected it and found in his house the treasure of all her hopes her child but as she was not of an age to be independent on her being discovered by her kindred she was again torn from his arms and i was forever bereaved of a mother before i was sensible i had one how often did my father repent his injustice to her it hung heavy on his soul in life and was most terrible in death in vain he sought her for never from that hour did heaven permit the erring pair to meet a few years afterward he married and had by his wife the present lord this circumstance far from lessening his affection endeared me still more to him he remembered i had no fortune but from his bounty no claim but on his heart his lady having no more children began to consider me as her daughter and the misfortune of my birth was almost forgotten in this situation i grew up caressed by all his friends and admired infinitely more than i deserved for from the time my brother grew of an age to appear in the world lord scroope had left st vincents abbey for the court many matches offered of which my father often entreated me to choose i however saw no man with a preference and as i was sensible my heart was too tender not to become partial i wished to evade all proposals till then i had in this interval the misfortune to lose my father whose senses failing him in his last sickness he had no power to make a necessary provision for me yet in his delirium he raved of me and my mother continually i felt this loss the less sensibly as i was treated with the utmost generosity and tenderness by my brother and the dowager lady scroope but i found my train of admirers diminish apace when one appeared who atoned in my eyes for the loss of a thousand he was a young westindian possessed of a considerable fortune an amiable person and an untainted heart when i say i loved him i speak but coldly you will know how well hereafter mr colville for that was his name was of a character too much resembling the young lord scroopes not to be favored by him he proved by the generosity or his behavior the sincerity of his love neither the misfortune of my birth or want of riches diminished his ardor but rather on the contrary augmented it his fortune was independent and i was not desirous of more than a very moderate competence the day of our marriage was fixed and arrived equally wished by both we were united in the presence of the lord and lady scroope who had loaded me with noble presents our hearts were gay and a large company assembled on the occasion invented a thousand diversions i was sitting after dinner at the head of the table singing when a servant entered and whispered my husband he rose up and followed him into the next room my eyes were industrious to find him and as he left the door open i perceived him from an opposite pier glass take a packet of letters from a man he held them in his hand till i ceased singing and then began reading he continued to do so some minutes when i saw his hand shake with great violence which soon diminishing he fell to the ground i started up in the utmost agitation  he was cold and convulsed i took up the papers but had not read half as far before i was as insensible as himself  mrs marlow was so affected at this passage she had not power to proceed at last recovering she held up her hands while her sine eyes were drowned in tears and repeated  let me not oh god since i survived that moment sink under the remembrance of it i must cut short description my children on a circumstance which so nearly affects my heart the letters were from his mother after telling him she had suffered him to depart with the more ease for england as she wished to have an opportunity of declaring a secret to him shame had long suppressed and which her decaying health forbid her longer to conceal she related the incidents of her life a few of which decided our fate and convinced me the same parents gave birth to both what a terrible discovery i shall pass over those events you already know and only mention that on being forced by her tyrannical relations from lord scroopes house they sent her under the care of an uncle in the spanish service to the west indies during the passage she found herself again with child her kinsman exasperated at this circumstance used every means to prevail on her to marry mr colville a settler whose plantations joined his and who was a passenger on boardthe same vessel without acquainting him with her situation persecuted and distressed on all sides she at last took a resolution on the first occasion to declare all to her lover his assiduity furnished her with one ere long which she did not neglect as soon as he had conquered his surprise he assured her she should never repent her generous confidence in his honor which affected him the more sensibly as his friend would meanly have deceived him he owned himself so attached that if she could give up fruitless hopes to partake his fortune he would marry her directly without claiming any right from the ceremony but that of releasing her from the tyranny of her kindred and hereafter providing in the same manner for her child as he would for any of his own overcome with the severity of her treatment from those who were bound to pity her and sensible the stranger who could speak so generously on the subject might make her as happy as she now durst hope to be she requested time to deliberate on the proposal he granted it some days elapsed during which she resolved to secure to herself the privilege of keeping one of her children by consenting they were united by a holy father then on board who at mr colvilles desire gave out he had married them two months before in london but concealed it from some motives respecting the ladys friends her uncle under whose care she was not suspecting the eclaircissement was astonished how she had brought her lover to consent to this but as his authority was at an end by her compliance with his wishes he affected the utmost satisfaction and offered them some valuable presents mr colville whose ingenuous heart abhorred his meanness refused with contempt those poor compensations for a deceit which might have proved so fatal to his happiness nor left him to suppose he was ignorant of the favor intended him he painted the infamy of the proceeding in the strongest colors and on their arrival at jamaica carried his bride to his own plantation without deigning to take leave of her relation here said the dear lady i gave birth my son to you and here i first learnt to be happy the generous kindness with which mr colville treated you the unwearied attention he showed to me deserved and obtained my whole heart it seemed as if the sincerity of my conduct had cancelled its errors i may truly say i never saw him caress you without ardently wishing you had a claim to the name he bestowed on you you grew up without my ever hearing of your real father and as it little became me to wound the heart of my husband i preserved an absolute silence on the subject nor seemed to remember such a person ever had existed i will not say i never thought of him nature taught you to recall him to my mind by a thousand artless gestures  i gave you after some years two sisters and a brother the loss of whom you doubtless remember a generous though silent struggle continued during their lives between mr colville and myself i always attempted to convince him you though the elder had not more than a just portion of my love and he no less anxiously sought to satisfy me his own children had not made him forget what he had promised respecting you heaven however took them to itself and mr colville divided between you and me a fortune too dearly gained by his loss though you have paid the tribute of filial gratitude over his grave my son remember that is insufficient you owe him every thing and can never discharge the obligation your youth and the pleasure mr colville took in being called your father made it very improper i should entrust to you a secret so humiliating to myself and diftressing to him yet sensible of the necessity i have since his death a thousand times resolved on it and as constantly given up the design at last my dear child you rendered it easier to me by proposing to visit england and i suffered you to go with less regret because i hoped you there would find another parent one whose claim in you is the same with mine and one who i am assured will proudly acknowledge you go then my dear anthony to lord scroope show him this letter tell him for i am not afraid to say it even to yourself i send him a son worthy of a nobler name than theweakness of your mother has given you tell him i will not allow him to provide for your sister gertrude since the fortune i possess is already destined to her if living do you my dear anthony repair my loss to her for never in respect to my husbands memory will i see again the father of my children this place shall be my grave and here while life remains i will bless my dear children and pray that the sins of their parents may never be visited upon them  vain wish said mrs marlow the stroke was already given judge for me my dear girls what i felt on reading such tender sentiments and remembering the characters were those of a mother  we were removed to separate apartments mr colville no longer my husband had strength of constitution but not strength of mind to support this calamity he fell into a deep melancholy and shut himself from all the world as to me heaven in mercy took away my senses by a violent fever i remained in a dangerous situation several weeks during which time he formed a resolution my resteration gave him opportunity to effect each wanting courage to see the other he informed me by letter he only waited my consent to return to his own country and dispose of his effects the produce of which might endow the monastery where he should receive the holy habit he conjured me to support a misfortune his letter convinced me he was unable to endure the sad choice he had made was already mine i wrote to inform him of it i conjured him never to betray to our mother the fatal event of her concealment but to persuade her we were both happy  what a vain request had not heaven deprived her of ever seeing him how could he have concealed so exquisite a distress  a wound in the heart will ever bleed on the flightest touch  i recovered my senses but that disgust with which every disappointment and how much more so deep a one overwhelms a young mind made every thing odious to me the hours when i was so pleasingly deceived were all i reckoned in my life before i left my room my lords marriage with the lady matilda howard was concluded his union with the first lady in england both in birth and beauty gave the greatest pleasure to all who loved him little able and less disposed to assist at festivities i retired on the plea of bad health to the abbey the death of the dowager lady scroope in the midst of the pleasures entirely damped them lord scroope conducted his new lady into the country to pass the time of mourning the amiable engaging bride conceived a friendship form which as is frequently the case in roble minds had perhaps its source in my misfortunes with all the graces that adorn grandeur lady scroope had the sweet simplicity of a village maid a heart full of the most exquisite delicacy and sensibility and features which did justice to her mind my lord perfectly adored her and her rank and charms soon made me find st vincents abbey no longer a retirement  a letter came in a short time from my brother which informed me on his arrival at jamaica he found my mother had died during his absence this was accompanied with bills for a large sum as my portion of her valuable legacy there is something so tender in the name the idea of a mother although unknown chat in spite of my other afflictions i found a very sensible one in her loss my heart had now no resting place before the remembrance that the blow came from her however unintentionally gave me a little courage which i was not sure i possessed till it was lost there is a pleasure to hearts capable of refinement in sacrificing something to the friends we love the silence we endured to save her from distress had lessened mine which now broke forth anew the amiable lady scroope neglected nothing to soften it she used every effort to prevent my retiring to the monastery as i had purposed her influence over her lord made her wishes too surely his for him to neglect adding his entreaties the obligations i owed his family the esteem i had for his lady and the very refinement i have mentioned made me unable to refuse i could never make too large amends for such kindness my sisterinlaw who rather boasted than disowned the title to gratify me neglected the amusements natural to her years and a mind at ease it seemed as if i had the authority vested in her and not her will but mine directed the family our guests departed by degrees and lady scroopes brother the young duke of norfolk with some other relations alone remained  to satisfy my brother anthony no levity had erased from my mind the tender ties which once united us and which neither time nor reason could ever entirely dissolve i laid before him the motives of my conduct and conjured him to believe since i could never be his i never would be anothers lady scroope not being able to prevail on me to return to london departed without me after extorting a promise that i would think no more of a nunnery she had left the abbey three months when she gave birth to the present lord to the inexpressible joy of her husband to show all the gratitude in my power for the favors i had received both from lord scroope and his mother i divided my fortune and insisted on their accepting half as a present to the young heir the generous matilda would have returned it but her lord more sensible of the value of money received the gift she reproached me for it with that kind raillery which friends know how to make so agreeable she told me she should cease to love me since the world would now call her attachment interested  in the time of her absence i spent many hours in reviewing the ruins with which this place abounded the gloomy magnificence of those great remains of art was more suited to my sadness of soul than the softer and more varied scenes of nature the liking i had conceived for these places doubtless first caused the housekeeper to show me the recess she had lived in the family a vast number of years and knew the secret how often had i walked through its ruined ailes without suspecting it could possibly contain one habitable spot i will now my dear children explain its situation and structure  it was once inhabited by nuns of the order of st winifred but deserted before the abolition of convents from its ruinous condition in this situation it remained many years shunned by the country people and devoutly visited by those travelers whom chance or curiosity brought this way when the reformation in the time of henry robbed the monks of their vast domains the ancestor of lord scroope obtained this land of the king he pulled down the monastery to erect a convenient mansion in the same taste and discovered a secret passage from thence to the convent it was blocked up without being generally known and the ruins left as an addition to the prospect nor till chance gave the communication a value was it remembered the nobleman who could obtain so vast a favor it is needless to mention professed the reformed religion but not able to forget that in which he had been brought up his house became the asylum of many of the unrevenued fathers this circumstance being noticed he found his views in the world depended on his expelling them when the secret passage occurred to his remembrance he had the stones removed cautiously by the holy fathers and found the place well arched and paved and free from damps it terminated in a room they supposed to have been the refectory and which still remained entire they removed by degrees such accommodations as were necessary into it and thither the refugees retired being supplied with food from the abbey but finding themselves shut up in too small a place and in total want of employment they began working under ground and by degrees formed two other passages from the recess one of which ends in the hermits cave where the eldest of them lived and the other in the midst of the ruins thus providing against discovery or rather securing their escape if that should happen in surveying the ruins they found several places enclosed and yet undemolished from among those they selected the few we have lived in choosing them always separated to prevent suspicion thus in a few years each father had his own cell and a monastery was hid among the ruins of the convent at length the severity of government abating several of the monks ventured again into the world and of the eight who made it their asylum two only ended their days here lord scroope sensible of the value of such a retirement carefully kept the secret when its inhabitants were gone two servants alone knew it and they were faithful nor till the housekeeper told me the story had i an idea of such a place  this account appeared almost fabulous to me  the ruin was at least half a mile from the mansion which then had a view of it rising plantations daily diminished till the wood became frequented or indeed passable only on the side near the hermits cave i impatiently desired to explore the whole romantic secret  the housekeeper did not delay a moment to gratify my curiosity she summoned an old servant who knew the way with torches to lead me through the windings the arched roof which was by some contrivance in the building kept astonishingly free from damps echoed to our very feet the gloominess of the scene accorded with my ideas and suggested a scheme which i have since thought a providential one to my mind the division of the rooms the bare walls and holes in the roof for air displeased me but since my affection for lord and lady scroope debarred me from devoting myself to a convent i resolved to fit this place up and retire to it whenever the owners with their guests made st vincents abbey too gay for me three times i visited it and each time found my desire greater i discoursed with the old man who from a considerable reward i offered him agreed with the assistance of his son who was a builder to render this a comfortable habitation i was unwilling to admit a third person into the secret but soon discovered his son james was already acquainted with it they directly began lodging their implements in the cave which was altered to give a face to the whole three months made it what it now is charmed with a device which i little foresaw would be useful to my friends the housekeeper and my maid alice brought by my direction every necessary to the dark room from whence the men fetched them the time of my lords return drew nigh the place was aired and my books and clothes already carried there no sooner had i resigned the care of the family into the hands of my amiable sister than i acquainted her with my intended retreat her surprise was extreme at seeing how commodious we had rendered so sequestered a spot but being fearful if she opposed my resolution of seeming to constrain me she suffered me to indulge my fancy hither then i retired attended by alice and james the latter of whom lived in the cave to secure us from discovery and furnish us every little convenience this solitude so suitable to the sadness of my soul was inexpressibly agreeable to me it had all the advantages of a nunnery without the tie to continue in it a restriction the most likely to make retirement odious my brother anthony with whom i constantly corresponded charmed with the description of a spot so well calculated for hearts wounded like his and mine assured me instead of shutting himself up in a convent for which he felt he had no vocation as soon as he thought he could bring himself to consider me only as a sister he would fix his residence in the cave  i had remained there two months when a messenger arrived to recall lord scroope to court the cause could not remain a secret mary of scotland that beautiful and unfortunate queen who had been imprisoned by her subjects as an accessory to the murder of her husband had found means to escape and implore the protection of elizabeth the jealousy and hatred that princess had long entertained for one so superior in those endowments most admired by herself made this step excusable in mary only from the cruelty of her situation but did not that very situation entitle her to royal treatment in elizabeth many noble qualities are mingled with impatience caprice pride and excessive vanity overjoyed at getting a rival into her hands doubly formidable instead of offering mary a princely asylum till on the proof of her innocence she should be restored to her crown elizabeth instantly made the queen of scots sensible of her power by dropping those ardent expressions of friendship and esteem with which all her letters had before been filled most probably to hide the very reverse and insisting on her consenting to be tried by laws with which she was unacquainted and never yet subject to it was to propose those harsh terms to mary the queen had sent for lord scroope she deputed him in concert with the duke of norfolk and several other lords commissioners to receive from mary her justification and examine into the authenticity of the proofs  the deserted nay almost betrayed queen of scotland too late found how little the professions of the great are to be relied on she was now in a worse condition than if she had still remained in her own country and submitted to laws by which she had governed compelled by the severity of her fate to bend to a woman but equal with herself to give herself up a prisoner to a government she had never offended and over which she was probably destined to reign as a criminal to attempt a justification before people too probably ordered to condemn her and even if they avoided that too politic to clear her innocence and restore her freedom for the queen of england had already placed a number of people around her who watched all her steps so cautiously that they wanted only the name to become a guard amid all these fears and mortifications submission was marys only measure she had learnt young as she was to submit with dignity and demand a degree of generosity by not seeming to doubt of finding it she therefore received the queens pleasure with composure delivered herself into lord scroopes hands and agreed to defer appearing before her sister elizabeth till she could appear with honor  this great event engrossed the attention of all europe various opinions were formed and elizabeth never found mary more formidable than when in her power all blamed her errors but they pitied her youth and imputed many of them to inexperience and faults in her education her uncommon beauty affability elegance of manners and expression were strongly commended by all who had seen her and those who had not listened to the tale with avidity and reported it with increase every word in her praise was a dagger to the heart of elizabeth and the unfortunate marys greatest crimes with her were the graces she received from nature  lady scroope had spent some of her early years in the french court mary was too affable and amiable not to attach every one for whom she had an inclination and the friendship she showed for the lady matilda would have made the separation the more afflicting but that mary by the death of francis the second found herself no longer attached to france and was obliged with infinite regret to quit the kingdom she had been educated in to govern one filled with domestic jars and almost ignorant of those softnesses which give charms to society and which in a peculiar degree adorned the court she had hitherto reigned over  the troubles in which she had been plunged from the hour she returned to scotland had scarce given her leisure to distinguish those she had formerly honored with her notice lady scroope had however always preserved an attachment to her less the fruit of gratitude than sympathy the queens present sad situation of which she heard amply from her lord touched her to the very soul she accused elizabeth of meanness and injustice and without doubting the innocence of mary she ardently desired to lighten her captivity and convince her that misfortune had not robbed her of every friend these sentiments were too fervently generous not to engage me i insensibly took part in what interested my sister so nearly and learnt to deplore a princess thus treated whom in a happier situation i should doubtless have censured  lord scroope to satisfy his wife who entreated him to the step represented to elizabeth the impropriety of leaving the queen of scots unaccompanied by any lady of distinction and without the attendance nothing could exempt the place she had chosen for an asylum from paying her whether guilty or innocent to give force to this he hinted the error of harsh measures which interested the common people and by engaging their pity might weaken their fidelity  the last reason weighed infinitely more with our queen than the first for her heart was more full of policy than feeling she however appointed lady scroope to attend upon mary and sent orders to treat her more suitably to her rank  overjoyed at carrying her point without appearing in it lady scroope did not delay her journey but unwilling to leave me she used all her interest and influence to persuade me to accompany her she represented she did not wish to engage me in any gay scenes the office she was allotted to being that most conformable to the melancholy turn of my mind the inclination i had to see mary joined with her and i consented  bolton castle whither mary had been conducted by the queens command was a strong fortress on the borders of yorkshire without furniture or accommodations for a royal guest it declared at once to that princess the melancholy captivity to which she was destined the humanity of lord scroope in vain attempted to conceal the fate that awaited her she gave herself up to an immoderate grief which was augmented by the news of bothwells death who had taken refuge in norway  we were met at derby by the duke of norfolk whose ardent desire to see the queen of scots had induced him to join us this nobleman was of an amiable presence in the prime of life full of a generous ardor a captivating vivacity without an equal in rank in england he had formed long since the design of espousing mary and both wells death had renewed hopes her marriage with him had frustrated i was amazed at the difference visible in the manners of the duke nor did i immediately perceive whence his impatience of any disappointment and deep reveries could proceed but the pleasure he took in hearing his sisters commendations of the queen the softness that sparkled in his eyes while he related the events her letters to bothwell had laid open showed me that ambition had raised a flame in his heart he mistook for love  we arrived at bolton and mary was not apprized till lady scroope was introduced to her presence that elizabeth had sent her a friend so anxiously desirous to lighten her captivity i would describe the queen of scotland to you my dear children had not nature drawn a truer picture of her than i can give  look in the glass matilda and you will see her perfect image  i could not contain my astonishment  oh heavens exclaimed i is it possible in lamenting the fate of that injured queen i have wept for a mother  a short time will explain all said mrs marlow the queen was in the bloom of youth and the sorrow which hung over her features gave them an irresistible attraction her air of resigned dignity and feminine sweetness was mingled with innocence and unconscious modesty if i was inclined to pity her before how greatly was that sentiment enlivened her faults seemed to vanish or to be atoned by her misfortunes nothing could be more interesting than her first interview with lady scroope whose tears alone could express her sorrow and affection  how must a scene which distressed me touch a heart prepared to love her the duke found there was a passion stronger than ambition her crown no longer engrossed his thoughts it was herself alone he desired he lamented the evils it had overwhelmed her with and from which even her resignation of it would not relieve her love communicated all its delicacies at once to his heart and the man who had dared aspire to her while in prosperity and peace in this sad moment of humiliation had not presumption to lift his eyes to her to speak of his affection or insult her by his compassion  lady scroope was too quicksighted to overlook this change in her brother but far from drawing any ill presage from it she flattered herself he was destined to restore the queen and to find in her gratitude and affection a reward proportioned to his merit  willing to relieve the tediousness of the hours that lady devised amusements of which no one partook though all from a just sense of the intention appeared satisfied with them the silence and melancholy of the duke of norfolk engaged the queen she found it a delicate compliment to her distress and regarded him with an attention too flattering to be overlooked  charmed with an esteem which he had rather wished than hoped the ardor of his soul found words and mary discovered in attempting to attach a friend she had gained a lover considering her interest only she must have encouraged him but remembering how fatal her partiality might one day prove she conjured him to subdue while yet in its infancy a passion it would be cruelty to encourage to remember her only as an unfortunate friend and in that light confessed herself obliged to him for his interest and power in her favor  in the first wildness of love nothing seems impossible an answer so mild only animated the hope it was meant to extinguish he formed a thousand projects he engaged his sister in his interest and every hour of his life was filled up by plans for the deliverance of the amiable queen but as it was impossible his residence should be a secret and he justly feared awakening the attention of elizabeth before his schemes were ripe for execution he engaged his sister to make a request he wanted courage to mention since she might with more propriety represent to the queen the policy of rendering her fate his  in this dangerous conjuncture the unfortunate mary listened once more to the partial advice of her heart which prompted her to yield to so noble so deserving a lover she had caught his frenzy and realized the fictions of his brain with the same facility his vast estates numerous vassals and still more his extended and noble connexions flattered her with the hope of amply rewarding him and she thought it but generous to let the recompense rather precede the service than follow it  fatal delusion of a prejudiced mind oh mary too tender princess why were not all the past misfortunes of thy life which had their source in love monitors to thee why did they not teach thee to avoid this error which heightened every affliction and gave new pangs to a long long captivity  the duke not daring to engage his brotherinlaw in an action contrary to his commission entrusted his intention only to his sister too ardent and too amiable an advocate to be denied the queen of scots was persuaded by that lady to unite herself with the duke they were married in the presence of the lady scroope and myself sir arthur forester and the dukes two secretaries  possessed in herself of all his wishes the prison of the queen became a palace to the duke and every hour seemed to add to a passion which appeared at first incapable of addition the authority mary had given him over her the tenderness with which she regarded him were powerful motives against the approaching separation but lady scroope saw with concern the extravagance of a passion she had encouraged she knew too well the temper of elizabeth not to anticipate her resentment if this step was discovered and knew likewise his own safety would be a poor motive for persuading her brother to leave bolton she therefore represented to him how ill he rewarded the lovely queen of scots by lengthening an imprisonment it was his duty to curtail and asked him what expectation mary might form from a husband who already preferred his own indulgence to her freedom happiness and glory  these reproaches were too true to offend the duke he lamented but yielded to the cruel necessity mary as if forewarned that these hours were all the easy ones remaining of her life used every means to detain him but the generosity of her affection awakening his more strongly he bade adieu to the charming wife he was never more to meet and set out for london to engage all his friends to favor a marriage no one now could prevent he flattered himself his interest was so great that the queen would be reduced to consent whether consonant to her inclination or not indeed this was the only rational mode of proceeding for to imagine elizabeth weak enough to unite her rival and heiress voluntarily to the first of her subjects would have been an unpardonable blindness  fortune however had destined otherwise and only smiled awhile to make her frown more terrible all the great lords of elizabeths court who had seen with regret the imprisonment of mary entered with pleasure into norfolks schemes his letters were filled with the most flattering hopes and the queen who was with child gave him notice of it this circumstance added to his joy he promised before the time of her delivery she should have her prison gates opened by all the nobility of england the earls of shrewsbury derby bedford northumberland westmoreland pembroke southampton arundel and suffex had warmly engaged in his cause and their names alone would influence many but the friend he most relied upon was the earl of leicester whose ascendancy over the queen was well known he had taken on himself the disclosure of the whole to elizabeth when that measure became necessary in the mean time norfolk used every means to prevent the regent of scotland from accusing mary to the queen nor was his artifice unsuccessful murray after having entered england for no other purpose suddenly returned without taking any step in the business a circumstance which defeated all the measures of the english court but elizabeth more strongly apprehending from this some plot to release mary removed her to tutbury and added the earl of shrewsbury to lord scroope as her keepers  my sister still followed her nor could i desert her in such a situation we had hoped from the information of the duke to find the earl of shrewsbury inclined to favor her but whether he foresaw the end of this unfortunate project or had deceived norfolk he kept a strict watch over the queens actions whose condition now confined her to her apartment  the duke flattered by murrays retreat commissioned some of his friends in scotland to sound that nobleman on the subject of his marriage they unwarily laid open more than he intended and murray enraged at having been his dupe sent notice of the plot to elizabeth she was on a visit to lord leicester who was ill when the letter arrived and confiding to that favorite the cause of her agitation he sent while the queen was consulting with cecil to warn norfolk to retreat as elizabeth seemed bent on committing him to the tower thunderstruck at this unexpected discovery the duke set out with precipitation for his seat of kenninghall but reflecting on the road that his flight was a stronger proof against him than the accusation of his enemies he returned directly he was however met by some officers sent in pursuit of him and conducted to burnham  his secretary posted off to tutbury with an account of all these proceedings they sunk the deeper into the heart of the queen as she hoped by this time to have been at liberty she was every hour in expectation of an event which must publish her marriage or load her with infamy in this hard trial lady scroope suggested to her the only safe way of proceeding which was to convey her child by the dukes secretary immediately after its birth out of the castle and concealing the cause of her indisposition wait a more favorable moment for avowing her marriage this was the only plan to avoid injuring the dukes safety or her own honor to prepare every thing against the time i took my leave of the queen as returning to st vincents abbey and retiring to a neighboring hut hired on purpose waited with my maid to receive the infant she should bring into the world which was to be carried to the recess and placed under my care till the fate of its parents could be ascertained  this sad moment was hastened by a sadder event  bothwell who was supposed to be dead found means to convey a letter to the queen assuring her the report was spread only to quiet the scots who otherwise would never have suffered him to rest and that he waited in denmark till the divisions of her kingdom should enable him to raise a powerful party and attempt her deliverance mary on the first sight of the well known hand felt all the horrors of her fate she fell into strong convulsions which were succeeded by the pains of labor she gave birth to two girls  for you my dear children are the fruit of this fatal marriage who scarce had been held to the bosom of a mother before you were divided from it i fear for ever  the faithful secretary conveyed you with the tenderest caution to me when he repeated this sad tale oh how my soul wept for the illfated queen i vowed ye should be mine for ye were the children of misfortune and never never have i broke that vow distress endeared me to you with a parental kindness and fortune gave you to me to console me for all her severity it is you only have kept alive in my heart the softest impulses of nature you were cherubs in your infancy and grew up to cheer my days and embellish my solitude full of the great charge vested in my hands i sought the earliest opportunity of quitting a dangerous place i brought you safe to this spot attended by alice after having you baptized matilda the elder which you was by a few minutes after lady scroope and ellinor after the dukes mother  to return to the queen of scots  she languished a long time between illhealth and despair but the duke found means to assure her that this misfortune should not long separate them he applied now to the pope to annul marys former marriage with bothwell the pope hoping to find some great advantage in the projected union seemed inclined to grant his request but the conditions he imposed were so hard that the duke had no hope  in the mean time elizabeth finding an effectual bar placed between mary and norfolk by bothwells being yer alive and having some hopes from the illhealth of the queen of scots of seeing an end of her fears after conveying her to coventry she released the duke at the intercession of his constant friend lord leicester sensible of the rashness of his former conduct he resolved to avoid that fault and made no attempt to see the queen of scots employing himself in hunting and diversions at kenninghall till the spies of elizabeth persuaded he had laid aside his projects gave up their employment the duke past from the seat of one friend to that of another to appearance in search of amusement but in reality to assure himself of their attachment and as if by accident to visit st vincents abbey and embrace the daughters of his love you were a twelvemonth old when i conducted the duke in the night to this recess the captivity and sad situation of his wife arose a thousand times more strongly to his mind when he beheld her children torn from her bosom as if the product of dishonor and hid in solitude from every human eye to see and know he could not prevent this pierced him to the very soul he spent the night in viewing you in recommending you to heaven in forming a thousand silent complaints against his destiny and resolutions which by shortening his life perpetuated on you the evils he sought to remedy but when the dawn of day compelled him to return to his apartment he again took you both into his arms and while the tears of paternal affection flowed gracefully down his cheeks poured on you a thousand blessings he then gave you to me and while i was stilling ellinor he sat in a deep reverie when suddenly starting from it he came and stood by me and taking my hand   i have yet hopes my dear mrs marlow said he of bringing these infants into life as the daughters of the loveliest the most amiable of sovereigns till when i commit them to you as the most sacred of all deposits teach them to enjoy an humble rank and they will adorn a high one keep them in total ignorance of their birth till able to know its inutility but if heaven never allows me to claim them  if the misfortunes of their parents end but with their lives act up to the sacred character with which i alike invest you and my sister never let them know the court of elizabeth but innocently and happily let them die in the desert where they bloomed  shades of the honored howard and the amiable mary i have fulfilled your injunctions exclaimed mrs marlow turning with an enthusiastic action to the pictures i have mentioned with so much respect your words have been ever present to my memory and my cares have not been useless  alas madam said we dropping with an emotion of awe on our knees are these lovely figures the portraits of our parents oh my father my tender unhappy father shall we never see you were we never to be held in you arms but while insensible of that blessing and you my dear mother who brought us forth in bitterness and pain shall we not spend our lives in softening yours and shed our sorrows upon your grave  you interrupt and distress me children said mrs marlow let me finish my melancholy tale you will alas have hours enough for complaint  the duke departed the next day and in a short time elizabeth having appointed the lords huntingdon and hereford in the room of lord scroope the queen of scots was deprived of her only comfort by the departure of his lady  the duke finding gentle attempts ineffectual resolved on a measure he deemed infallible and entered into a treaty with a trusty spaniard named ridolpho to engage the duke of alva to assist him with ten thousand men to be landed at harwich from whence they were to march to london to intimidate elizabeth the duke of alva consented and even the pope at length ashamed of neutrality took a share in marys deliverance every thing was prepared norfolks friends in england only waited the signal to join him when one of those trifling accidents which disconcert the wisest schemes rendered this in a moment abortive  to foment the divisions in scotland so much as to keep the regent employed and prevent him from interfering in the affair the duke sent many sums to be scattered among the queens friends in that kingdom at different times  but now when the crisis approached he had prepared a large bag of gold which with a letter he unfortunately trusted to a man quite ignorant of the plot the carrier in putting it up by some accident cut the bag and the contents filling him with astonishment he communicated this singular discovery to a servant of lord burleighs who was his brother this man through a hope of getting the gold between them and supposing some mystery was hid in the letter persuaded him to show it to his master the carrier consented and lord burleigh easily perceiving the plot though not its extent communicated it to the queen in consequence of which the duke was arrested in his bed and all his servants imprisoned  this fatal stroke overturned every remaining hope betrayed by his servants all the letters he had written and received on that subject most of which he had ordered to be burnt were produced against him his very benevolence was construed into a crime and some money he sent to the countess of northumberland who was in exile and distress with her lord became an article in his impeachment he was condemned and heard his sentence with a fortitude which melted lord shrewsbury who pronounced it into tears  lady scroope distracted at her brothers fate fell at the feet of the queen and left nothing unsaid to move her but all she could obtain was the deferring his execution for burleigh had so strongly prepossessed elizabeth with the idea that the duke sought her life that although no circumstance arose to confirm it on his trial nothing could banish it from her mind  but what was the situation of the queen of scotland at this completion of her misfortunes an exile from her own country a prisoner in another a wife without a right to that name and a mother while a stranger to her children her fate was wound up in the condemnation of her husband and she had the poignant affliction of knowing she had raised the axe against him which all her tears could not avert pierced with despair she conjured the lady scroope to assure the queen she would not only voluntarily consent to remain her prisoner for life but would give up her claim to the crown of england if her sister as she was compelled to style her would free the duke of norfolk and restore him to his honors this proposal elizabeth received as a finesse from which she only saw how deeply marys heart was linked with his even the allprevailing leicesters eloquence failed selfpreservation was an unconquerable principle in the soul of elizabeth  the duke was beheaded fourteen years ago when you my dear children who were bought with his life were not above two years and a half old he died as he had lived with dignity and honor  never was nobleman more lamented he had endeared himself to the body of the people by his courage generosity and affability and to his equals by an unconsciousness of superiority which prevented envy and an uniformity of conduct which gained admiration he was the first victim to the queens fears nor could she have chosen one whose merits were stronger proofs of the value she set on herself  lady scroope detesting too late the artifices of the court and sunk in affliction for the loss of a brother she adored retired hither with her lord who had thrown up his employments her body partook of the debility of her mind and soon gave symptoms of a decay which reduced her to the grave  her temper too was quite changed this recess which so lately appeared a horrible dungeon now seemed to her as to me a calm retirement from the odious forms and cares of life she spent many days and would every one had it not afflicted her lord in weeping over you in tracing in matilda the mildlybeautiful features of her friend and in ellinor the captivating graces of her brother it is to her you owe these valuable pictures  estranged from all society the queen of scots gave herself up to the blackest despair she had alas no hope to soften her captivity no bosom to receive her tears with norfolk died all prospect of release and at the same time all desire of it what was the universe to her without he embellished it would it not have augmented her affliction to have enjoyed a sovereignty she durst never hope to share with him  elizabeth whose fears were always awake from this moment cut her daily off from some comfort or convenience frequently changed her keepers and prison and by her severity taught the captive queen that hatred may be stronger even than love  lady scroope survived her brother but a twelvemonth and left no inheritor of her virtues she recommended you both in the most fervent manner to her lord who solemnly swore to make a provision for you suitable to his fortune though not your birth  some years past away when lord scroope whose grief was at an end finding himself tired of the inactivity of a country life accepted some overtures the queen made to recall him he left to me the charge of st vincents abbey which he has not inhabited since  hurried on by other events i have hitherto neglected to mention the return of my brother anthony in three years after i brought you here he fixed his residence in the hermits cell devoting his time to the study of physic and the care of exhorting the poor except at those hours you have seen him in for his life and mine have been uniform  i have only two circumstances more to mention one of which is more afflicting to me than i once believed aught respecting money could ever be lord scroope who has been abroad some years in a public character has become the object of the crafty burleighs hatred or suspicion and is now confined while his estates and wealth are seized by the queen who knows so well the value of money that it is too probable my lord will never be able to fulfill the promise made to his wife in your favor  the other is that during several past years i have not been able to hold any intelligence with the queen of scotland who sent me some letters during the first years of her imprisonment which with those she wrote to the duke i have preserved with various other testimonials of your birth time may enable her yet to give you the splendour to which you were born for elizabeth is now stricken in years and mary more worn by sorrow than age wait then my dear children with patience when i am in my grave the destination of providence and never claim your parent till she pleases to acknowledge you no virtue is more acceptable to god than patience to bestow happiness is only in his power to deserve it ever in our own oh if my prayers are heard if my wishes ascend to the throne of the most high he will lead you through this world in peace he will unite you again to my bosom in a better  here our generous protectress our more than mother ended clasping us to her heart with an ardor that evinced the sincerity of her words  but what new ideas what amazing feelings did her narration give birth to the impulses of nature taught us to treasure every word she uttered for what in the history of our parents could be indifferent never did our solitude appear so amiable  the court of elizabeth  oh my lamented father could the sole inflictor of all thy evils ever ever attach thy children could she who oppressed her equal and a queen innocent at least in all that respected her only because she was in her power be capable of alluring two hearts untainted by that courtly politeness which sanctifies the errors of a sovereign and terms her very vices noble weaknesses  but then to learn i had a mother yet alive to believe i might one day be received to her arms only endeared by misfortune full of this melting this heart expanding idea i would have sought her prison i would have been the companion of it happy if all my cares could make her forget for one moment the rigor of her fortune or call to her remembrance amidst all her complaints against the injustice of the world that it still contained two beings who were willing to return for her the life she gave  my duty to mrs marlow alone divided my heart should i desert her who had neglected every thing for us what are the ties of nature to cancel in one moment those of inclination gratitude and esteem oh no i owed it is true my being to another but she to whom i owed the best part of that being the formation of my mind the instilling those sentiments which alone make us valuable to ourselves and society had a claim beyond all others which nothing but death could dissolve that awful moment was drawing nigh every one that passed stole something from the mortal part of mrs marlow oh thou amiable saint thou woman after gods own heart can i remember the time when thou were called from us without floods of unavailing tears never  never  selfish as they are they will flow even though so often exhausted  she delivered us a casket which contained the papers she mentioned and diverse attestations signed by herself and the late lady scroope and filled with all the ornaments of her youth then after recommending us tenderly to father anthony she joined in prayer with him and all her little family and in the midst expired  oh madam how strange how terrible to me was that moment i saw death first seize on one dearer than myself the mansion in which we lived now became a solitude indeed  a silence  how solemn prevailed in the first flow of a rational grief how vast a vacuum is left in the heart to hear no longer the voice which led us through life to see the eyes whence ours drew fortitude close never more to open the whole frame assume that awful pallidness every moment increases and which brings so melancholy a memento to the breast these touching ideas cannot always arise some losses destroy the power of reflection and complaint carried away by the bitterness of despair we are only sensible of an agony beyond expression  to attempt interring the dust of mrs marlow in the chapel must have awakened the suspicions of the queens officers the secret of our retirement was in the breast of only three domestics and it was highly necessary to keep it concealed on this account a grave was made for her in father anthonys cell whither we conveyed her wrapped in white and crowned with the fading produce of this world in imitation of that everblooming wreath promised hereafter to all who persevere in virtue  grief makes the most violent impression in youth but happily it is the most transient a little time abated the sharpness of ours nevertheless our solitude being deprived of its ornament appeared uniform melancholy and disgusting we gradually lost our assiduity in our works when we no longer promised ourselves the great reward of her praise father anthony who was never a favorite with us became every day more unpleasant mrs marlow always preserved a sway over him which softened the severity of his manners that being now at an end and his temper still more hurt by his affliction for her loss he appeared a gloomy tyrant and the additional carefulness with which he observed us laid an odious restraint on all our expressions and made our meals wear an air of sullenness each party was unconscious of causing  obliged to hide in our own hearts all the little follies and wishes we had been used to reveal without fear we conversed with the father only upon moral and indifferent topics thus every day was the same and each of course more tedious when ellinor suggested a scheme which gave us some amusement this was to explore the passage leading to the ruins where we might at least breathe the fresh air and for one hour have the pleasure of a little novelty i readily came into the proposal having had a curiosity to emerge from the moment i heard that passage first mentioned it was the full height of summer and we pitched upon a long afternoon when we had no fear of being sought for  the passage was narrower closer and damper than the others but very short we took a torch that we might find the way of opening it when we drew near the mouth i observed some little holes made doubtless to give the concealed person an advantage i made ellinor keep back while i examined the place but saw nothing however to awaken any apprehension a long avenue of broken arches intermingled with brambles and wild wallflowers in the paths of which the grass grew very high was all i could discern  nothing could more fully prove the unfrequentedness of the spot we therefore examined the fastening immediately and found it a small square door with two hinges on the top and fastened across the bottom by a large bar of iron laid on strong hooks i was unable to open it alone ellinor therefore extinguished the light to assist me but with all our curiosity and courage the sight of the pile of ruins threw us into an universal trepidation on turning round to see how the entrance was hid we perceived a high raised tomb at each corner of which stood a gigantic statue of a man in armor as if to guard it two of whom were now headless some famous knight as appeared by his numerous ensigns lay on the tomb the meagre skeleton had struck an arrow through his shield into his heart his eyes were turned to the cross which st winifred held before him nothing could be better contrived than this entrance for however rude the sculpture the ornamental parts took the eye from the body of the tomb the little door which dropped after us was one stone made thin and lined with wood and so neatly fitted that even when unfastened it was not to be discerned for a long way beyond the prospect was wild and awful to excess sometimes vast heaps of stones were fallen from the building among which trees and bushes had sprung up and half involved the dropping pillars tall fragments of it sometimes remained which seemed to sway about with every blast and from whose mouldering top hung clusters and spires of ivy in other parts ruined cloisters yet lent a refuge from the weather and sullenly shut out the day while long echoes wandered through the whole at the touch of the lightest foot the intricacies of the wood beyond added to the magnificence of art the variety of nature we quitted with regret our new empire when the sun left his last rays on the tops of the trees  we resolved to conceal our ramble left father anthony should forbid us to repeat it those madam who would maintain a lasting sway over young people must by softening the distance of age steal into their confidence love and respect are united but if fear once closes the avenues to the heart no other sentiment ever overcomes it obedience is then never led by inclination and we rejoice to escape from haughtiness or austerity however venerable the sorm they assume  from what trifles spring the purest pleasures of life a prospect a flower a song can dilate the heart while the passions are yet hid in it nor have poisoned its simplicity and curtailed its enjoyments  concealed pleasures are allowed to be the greatest no remark can be more just to deceive the watchful reflects a compliment on our own sagacity which renders us insensible to the error  almost every day did we visit this darling spot always like young birds venturing one step further and so often had we ventured without seeing a human being that at last we ceased to fear on one side the wood shelved down for a considerable way beyond which the road was cut and mingled with hamlets that gave a promise of society which the rusticity of their inhabitants would not allow them to fulfill  but you reproach me with losing time in uninteresting descriptions  ah madam this wood was not always a desert chance or rather i should say providence led into its solitary windings the man of all elizabeths court the most distinguished and admired the man to whom nature had been prodigal of every advantage which art and application had polished to the highest perfection  one day in calling my sister i discovered in the hollow of the wood and building a very fine echo delighted with this i began singing the notes dying distinctly away formed a melancloly symphony when i was interrupted by ellinor who quitting some birds that flew tamely to be fed by her hand ran toward the recess with great speed waving to me to follow her we had so often alarmed each other without any cause that i hardly moved when a noise i heard among the trees which grew extremely thick on that spot alarmed me a voice that sunk at once from my ear to my heart conjured me in the most earnest manner to stop notwithstanding the necessity i found for flying my eyes longed to claim acquaintance with the features to which that voice belonged and my head by an involuntary motion was turned over my shoulder the gentleman had now made a way through the shrubs which impeded his passage and i found it impossible to retreat but by discovering a secret it was highly my interest to conceal perhaps i was not sorry to have an excuse to my own heart for a rashness it was too sensible of the irresolution of my attitude which was that of a person ready every moment to run made him approach with profound submission and respect but finding me attempt to fly though almost without knowing it he instantly stopped  by whatever chance said he nature has hid in this sequestered spot her fairest productions permit me ladies to derive an advantage from it believe me you see a man who needs too much your compassion and assistance to venture to insult you were such a thought capable of intruding into a heart never yet inhuman let me conjure you then to judge of my intentions by your own and allow me if you know of an asylum and are not like me driven here by some present distress to shelter myself from assassins too well prepared to take my life for courage to preserve it  the person of him who pronounced these words made their effect indelible he appeared something past the bloom of life but his beauty was rather fixed than faded of a noble height and perfect symmetry he would have had an air too majestic but that the sweetness of his eyes and voice tempered the dignity of his mien his complexion was of a clear and polished brown his eyes large dark and brilliant his hair gracefully marked the turn of all his features and his dress was of a dovecoloured velvet mingled with white satin and silver a crimson sash inwoven with gold hung from his shoulder with a picture and the order of the garter as well as a foreign one with which he was invested showed his rank not less distinguished than his person  astonishment  anxiety  a thousand rapid ideas melting into each other and defying language confused and silenced me when ellinor more mistress of her own judgment took upon her to answer by directing him to father anthonys cell assuring him at the same moment this was all we could do to serve him  ah ellen cried i passionately seizing her hand he then must return and be murdered struck with the vehemence of my own words my eyes sunk to the ground and changeable blushes covered my features which redoubled when the stranger took my hand with a grace all his own and bowing on it  to your generous intention madam i shall at least be a debtor  this is not a time or place for deliberation  fly i beseech you while you are yet able the villains who pursue me may not respect your youth your beauty or your innocence and nothing could so greatly add to my misfortune as the involving you in it if heaven lengthens my days i may perhaps be able to convince you him you wished to save is not unworthy your concern if on the contrary this proves my last i have only to request you will deliver this untying and giving me the picture to the queen who will not fail to distinguish the bearer  how how did every word penetrate my heart  ah how rapid is the progress of passion and how in one moment does it quicken nay double every sense and sensibility i could with the same ease have exposed my own bosom to the assassins as his fear surmounted every prudential consideration and i was only going to use the caution of enquiring who he was when the sound of voices not far distant put that out of my head retaining in mine the hand which had hitherto held it i led him through the most solitary arches to the foot of the tomb but our astonishment at sight of him bore no comparison with his when he found this to be our habitation the time not admitting any explanation he assisted us to enter and followed himself when leaving ellinor to watch the approach of those we had heard i conducted him into the large room of the recess with an impatient gratitude he fell at my feet to thank me for my anxiety but instantly starting back he threw me into such a trepidation that i sunk into a seat without power to look behind me imagining either that the murderers or at least father anthony must be at hand when looking around him and at me by turns he exclaimed  merciful heaven by what strange ordination of thine do i find in this desert two dead portraits of my unhappy friend and the queen of scots and two breathing ones more lovely than even themselves  imagine my distress at this speech i saw in one moment the whole of a secret preserved with such caution for so many years committed to a stranger by an indiscretion which still i could not condemn in myself fluctuating with all the irresolution of youth i now knew not whether i ought to deny the truth of what he had averred or repose in turn a confidence in his honor but the time i had spent in deliberating convinced him for my confusion was an affirmative nothing could overcome  you are silent madam cried he but your eloquent eyes imply a doubt it is my duty to clear oh if i was capable of wronging your confidence or betraying any secret you wish concealed heaven would have abandoned me to the fate from which its fairest daughters saved me look but at that picture and you will find an indubitable evidence of my sincerity  it was the picture of elizabeth given by herself to robert dudley as the inscription informed me  ah have i then returned i been the happy means of discharging the debt long owing to lord leicester  how how have i been so fortunate returned he as to distinguish myself to you  if i durst believe and yet it must be so  for how should a less lovely mother give being to such children and how otherwise should such matchless beauty and elegance be hid in a desert tell me i conjure you madam whether my past friendship with the duke of norfolk does entitle me to yours  it does indeed my lord cried i bursting into tears at the name of my father to my eterhal gratitude your frank avowal sets me above all dissimulation i dare own to you you have guessed my birth most truly  but why then were you buried in this solitude why not acknowledged in france   ah my lord might i not with much more reason demand how the favorite of elizabeth came unattended and alone to seek in this solitude an asylum from assassins  i will reply to you with candor madam added he and thus bespeak your confidence the favor of a sovereign may easily make us great but many circumstances must concur to make us happy and when you hear some events of my life i may promise myself your compassion  ellinor having executed her commission rejoined us at this moment i will frankly confess i wished her absence and had imposed a task on her i could never have executed the presence of lord leicester had awakened in my mind a thousand hopes and wishes unknown before not recollecting the improbability of his passing so many years without forming tender attachments almost unconsciously i aspired to his heart and my apprehension of ellinors superior charms had made me meanly cheat her of an opportunity of making a first impression by submitting to my injustice she rendered me sensible of it in the most generous manner and the care i then took to display her merit induced my lord to imagine i regarded him with indifference thus i reaped a double advantage from my return to rectitude  my sister informed us she had seen four men examining every part of the ruins certain lord leicester must be hid among them as one had picked up his hat which he doubtless dropped when he addressed me and swearing never to quit the wood till they had found him they separated to pursue the search  i turned pale at this terrible intelligence which made his departure impossible but as we every moment expected father anthony who might have a share in the alarm the assassins would occasion we agreed to hide my lord in mrs marlows chamber which had been hitherto deserted and a place where none but ourselves would seek him  it was now evening and as the age and infirmities of our maid rendered her rather an encumbrance than relief we set before lord leicester a repast perhaps more adapted to his health than his appetite but all that our retreat at that time afforded and withdrawing left him that we might be ready if our guardian should visit us  as i would not have you imagine however we were indebted to nature the surprise lord leicester expressed sprung only from our beauty i must observe to you we dressed to the taste of mrs marlow rather than that of any country and those habits which covered happy hearts preserve a long superiority in the fancy close jackets and coats of pale gray were trimmed round the skirts and sleeves with black bugle fringe the collars were thrown back from the throat and chest with point lace and tied at the bosom with black tassels our hair which was very thick covered our necks and foreheads falling in rings from under cambrick coifs small beaver hats with high crowns and waving black feathers completed our appearance at once too rustic and too elegant not to strike every person simplicity is the perfection of dress and ellinor presents herself in that i have described more beautiful than when adorned with all the gaudy trappings pride and luxury has invented she had an arch a smiling eye which while it indicated observation teemed with good nature a complexion perfectly fair and delicately heightened by a bloom which came from the heart as its changeableness implied a graceful stature and a manner which won almost every one to love her half as well as i did but i need not expatiate on my ellens character though dormant at present it will soon demand your compassion in the hardest trials of life  love madam is the parent of art when we left lord leicester without declaring my own sentiments concerning him i sought to penetrate into my sisters for that constant error of a first passion had infected me and i fancied the man who had subdued my heart might those of all my sex every glance increases a fear so exquisite i thought constantly i read in her eyes ideas afflictingly similar to my own yet the lively sense she expressed at our indiscretion which she easily conceived would put us in the power of elizabeths favorite made me very doubtful for although the same apprehension occurred to me the confidence i already had in his honor and the strong anxiety i felt for his life made it a faint and distant alarm  this night i first found my rest disturbed by the reflections of my mind i hoped one moment every thing i flattered myself the simplicity of my education and the purity of my heart would by a contrast with those of the court atone for the want of that polish a court alone can give the obscurity of my birth i found too sensibly a misfortune and withdrawing my compassion for the first time from my parents bestowed it on myself yet again would i say can he despise the daughter of his friend will he destine me to suffer for an indiscretion in which i had no share oh let me judge his heart by my own which already feels the sovereignty of the universe would be too little for happiness if he was not to partake it  the calm rest of my sister set my heart at ease respecting her i told every moment as it passed anxiously expecting that in which lord leicester was to begin his narration i had exhausted the few misfortunes my imagination had treasured without being able to find any which could in so well governed a country reduce a man of his distinction to flight but how untainted with the vices of the world could i guess at the real one  without acquainting lord leicester who had the conduct of our education we made him sensible we had reasons for concealing him from every person he had too much politeness to press for an explanation and we were compelled to leave him alone till the departure of father anthony should give us an opportunity to listen to his history  the father always slow and deliberate seemed this day to have gained an addition to those qualities instead of retiring after dinner as usual he began a long discourse from a momentary impatience i had discovered through some trifling occasion on the subduing our passions every word of which augmented mine and the less we seemed sensible of his argument the more he was inclined to prolixity till my impatience having arisen to the greatest height allayed of itself and i learnt nothing but acquiescing in all he advanced could put a period to the tedious conversation this finesse succeeded he departed and without staying a moment longer than was necessary to ascertain that circumstance we released the earl and conducted him to our great room as we called it  lord leicester did not delay to gratify our curiosity but began his story thus for to prevent the coldness a relater always gives to events and as almost the very words are familiar to my memory whenever a narration occurs i in justice to the person concerned shall give him the power of speaking for himself  sprung from a family too distinguished to be unknown to you ladies i might pass over the early part of my life in silence did not one circumstance in it account for the honors and favors my royal mistress has delighted to shower upon me the last of five sons i was too young to be sensible of the loss when my unhappy family were sacrificed to their own ambition and episcopal tyranny without any fortune and obnoxious to those who had trembled at the very name of northumberland no happier fate had awaited me from the persecutions of marys reign a time which will fill the latest with horror had not the earl of arundel generously screened me from her rage he had me conducted from a seat of my fathers bestowed on him by the queen to hubert hall a noble one of his own where i was educated with his children without being known to the world the kindness of this nobleman well deserves commemoration since to the compassion awakened by my youth and helpless state nothing was added but a grateful remembrance of a small favor the lord guildford had shown him at a time when his religion was more feared though less punished than ours then was sensible of all his generosity i neglected nothing to prove my gratitude and habit giving me the same advantage in his affection with his own children he seemed to take pleasure in numbering me among them and proposed to unite me to one of his daughters who had from her infancy entertained a partiality for me fate was against him for of the four lovely children he had when i was added to the number i saw him without one when i was but fifteen these losses far from souring his temper only softened it he bent himself more intently on establishing me in all his fortunes and was not without hopes of obtaining the reversion of his title for me miss lineric the daughter of his sister and the heiress of a large fortune besides what she might hope from him was the lady he made choice of for me and the agreement was formed with her father and guardians without my knowledge nor did i venture on being asked for it to refuse my consent although i had never seen the lady and found my heart utterly repugnant to a match in which it had no share  the princess elizabeth whose noble endurance of an unjust imprisonment will reflect eternal honor on her prudence was during the life of her sister kept in close captivity various lords as various fears obliged them to change had the charge of her the earl of arundel was for a short time entrusted with the important office and thus was i early introduced to the knowledge of that pious lady far from extending the prejudices she might justly have imbibed against my family to me she was pleased to honor me with her notice to take amusement in polishing my manners and accomplishing my mind brought up a catholic it was to her i owed the enlightening of my understanding and the discretion to conceal a difference of opinion from my benefactor which might have alienated and perhaps broken his heart  my attachment to her was as great as her own goodness i longed with the ardour of youth to signalize myself in her service nor was it long before an occasion offered the earl of devonshire actuated either by love or ambition flattered himself that the princesss captivity would make her gladly embrace a proposal of marriage he engaged many noblemen who favored the protestant religion in the scheme and he imagined nothing was necessary toward obtaining her consent but her knowledge of the design to effect this he disguised himself as a gardener and worked several days in the hope of seeing elizabeth but in vain for the queens orders were so strict that she was allowed for exercise only a long gallery with latticed windows which joined to her apartment the awkwardness of the earl in his new employment of which i was fond and consequently a competent judge caught my attention i spoke to him and the involuntary tremor caused by a fear of detection strengthened my suspicion he eluded my questions with too much exactness to be what he affected and this i mentioned casually to the princess while entertaining her in the gallery she listened to what i said attentively and then walking to the window desired me to point out the man he was sitting to rest himself with his eyes fixed intently on the house elizabeth remained at the window buried in thought at last turning toward me she demanded if i esteemed her enough to run some hazard for her sake i assured her with an eagerness proportioned to the desire i had to serve her that she could command nothing i would not execute with joy she replied had not she expected such an answer she had not ventured such a question  what i wish then continued the princess is that when you can find him alone you will tell that man i have seen and know him and since i cannot doubt his intention is to render me some service i request he will signify its nature by you but as he may doubt the sincerity of a gentleman whose interest seems so opposite to his own show him this jewel he will remember it and say i bid you tell him it was the gift of his father to me some years ago  the princess then took from her arm a remarkable diamond and gave it to my care i withdrew from her presence and never did night seem longer than that i spent before it was possible for me to execute her command but resolved not to lose a moment i arose very early and placed myself in a thicket through which i knew he must pass his reluctance to mix with the daily laborers whose happiness reaches not beyond a coarse meal and a coarse jest made him usually come alone and when the rest were past i saw him approach certain without knowing who he was that he must be a man of distinction i drew near him with respect and delivered my embassy the confusion and doubt my address occasioned vanished at fight of the diamond he fell into raptures at the goodness of the princess and no words seemed sufficient to testify his gratitude for my service  acquainted enough with the world to know the placing a confidence is the furest way of attaching a young mind he made no secret of his name and gave into my hands a letter as valuable to him as his life  elizabeth disgusted at the free hope he expressed or perhaps unwilling to remove herself still farther from the throne by offending her sister declined the proposal of the earl who neglected no instance to induce her to change her mind as he could never hope to find a time so favorable for her escape he fancied at last i had an interest in her rejecting him and when nothing could prevail with her lavished all his reproaches on me as the capital obstacle i know not to what extremities he might have carried his resentment had not lord arundel to whom the head gardener had declared his suspicion of this man from having found some jewels sewed in his garb caused him to be apprehended but his ill health and infirmities disabling him from an immediate examination notice was sent to the court and the earl confined with caution the princess alarmed at this accident which she foresaw her enemies would construe to her disadvantage without giving her a chance to justify herself forgot that calmness which constituted in her early years the meritorious part of her character i too sensibly felt her afflictions not to participate in this and to prove my sympathy formed a design which the romantic generosity incident to youth alone could justify  entrusted with the charge of the criminal it was very easy for me in the dead of night to set him free but to render my generosity complete and ensure his escape i ordered a horse to be in readiness in the thicket as for myself and furnishing him with some clothes of my own conducted him to the garden gate and returned more satisfied with my own conduct than i ever yet had been  the consequences of his escape suggested themselves immediately to lord arundel on his receiving the information he sent for me as my connivance was evident and angry at my refusing even a reason for it save the promise i had made he ordered me to be confined and dispatched a messenger to court with the full particulars of the prisoners enlargement a short time however abated his resentment he reproached himself for a rashness as culpable as my own and sent several of his servants to stay the first but not finding him return he was pleased at once to forget my obstinacy and by coming to visit me show he pardoned my fault  he then told me he had nothing to propose that would ensure my safety but immediate flight and not doubting that he could appease the queen recommended me to set out immediately for ireland to take refuge with his brotherinlaw sir patrick lineric overwhelmed with his goodness i had no way to atone for my error but obedience and prepared for my journey without hesitation  the reluctance with which the earl parted from me was a cutting reproach but heaven did not suffer me to escape unpunished i was met on the road by a party of guards conducted by the first messenger who ignorant of the change in lord arundels resolution imagined i was making my escape likewise and conjured the officer to seize me astonished at a stroke so unforeseen and unlucky i delivered up my arms without resistance and was conducted to the tower of london  some days elapsed without my seeing any but my guard when i was conducted before the privy council and interrogated concerning what i knew of the prisoner and his designs but refusing to answer i was remanded back to a closer dungeon and harder fare this was repeated several times insomuch that i was astonished at not being tried and sentenced by the law when one day i was agreeably surprised at seeing lord arundel enter my prison want of air and proper food had so altered me that the good man neglecting his commission wept like an infant on my neck but recovering and remembering he was not sent to console me  and had witnesses attending to report our discourse he began with conjuring me by every power he had over me as a father a guardian and a friend to provide for my own safety by a discovery of all i knew without which my life would be devoted in spite of his efforts and the affliction of losing the only prop of his age would infallibly shorten his days  the gentleness of this address the concern which wrung every venerable feature pierced my soul and although i could not betray the princess i will heartily confess i lamented my rash officiousness but as repentance was fruitless i had only to summon patience to endure an evil i had brought on myself nevertheless to afflict the benefactor to whose goodness i owed all was a trial indeed i threw myself at his feet i conjured him only to remember my obstinacy to cast me from his heart but never to employ a power i revered to make me odious and contemptible  assuring him an honorable death was in my eyes infinitely more to be desired than a life prolonged by treachery and ingratitude  he regarded me with attention and after seeming to deliberate for a moment he proceeded to offer me the most splendid rewards i stopped him oh my lord exclaimed i can you think so meanly of the man before you as to believe after resisting your entreaties he can poorly be bribed to do ill how truly unworthy then were i of the name of your son  what can i say said he turning to some men present and drawing his hands from mine to clasp them together in an agony of grief how seek to corrupt a constancy i admire adieu my dear son i am unequal to the task imposed on me may the god who taught you principles so just bless and protect you whatever your fate my days may still be fewer than yours and this is perhaps an eternal farewell  adieu again i will never forget you saying these words he caught hold of some persons present who rather carried than led him out  i had before this been supported by pride but the sense of doing wrong had never mingled with my feelings till now my own life had hitherto presented nothing to make it particularly valuable but that of lord arundell was a blessing to himself and his country and what right had i to shorten it i whose peculiar duty it was to watch over his decay and smooth his passage to the grave this remembrance gave me inexpressible grief  i found likewise that the court from my resolution imagined the plot of much more consequence than it really was yet after so many denials i could not declare the whole without bringing an imputation more terrible than death on my memory i therefore called together every reflection that could fortify my mind and waited my fate with composure  a very few days after this interview put an end to the life of a queen whose cruelty cast a blot alike on her sex and religion and elizabeth being placed on the throne by the voice of the people made the opening of my prison doors one of her first cares  she did me the honor of seeing me in the garments i had worn in my confinement and gave me her royal word that she could find no greater pleasure in her sovereignty than that of rewarding my fidelity  an allay was prepared to this satisfaction lord arundell expired the night before of the gout in his stomach but knowing i might claim my safety from the new queen he had left me joint heir with his niece of his estates with only one condition which was that of marrying her ordering the covenant should be fulfilled in two years and if either party refused to comply his or her share of the fortune should go to the other  all the advantages i could have reaped had he left me sole heir of his wealth would never have recompensed me for his loss this blow lessened the hopes of my life i had promised myself in the first moments of my freedom to convince this nobly disinterested friend that independence could never lessen my gratitude but would rather increase an attachment to which the malicious could then assign no motive but the just one  the queen in the first years of her reign loaded me with honors called me her knight nor entered into any amusement in which i was not a party the obsequious behavior of my equals flattered a vanity latent in my heart and persuaded me they saw deeper into her intentions than myself i was much younger than elizabeth and involved in another engagement yet the world thought she loved me but being little disposed to matrimony and by the queens bounty enabled to indulge myself i gave up to miss lineric the estates of her uncle without even seeing her because i would not offend the relation of lord arundell by giving the world reason to believe i did it from distaste this circumstance no sooner reached the ear of the queen than it filled her with gladness visible to the whole court which confirmed them in the belief i was destined one day to share her rank i had reason to be convinced from many circumstances of the queens conduct known but to myself that she really had an affection for me and only waited till some of the elder nobility who were my rivals had given up the pursuit and till my years allowed her to make me her choice without bringing a censure on her prudence  attached to elizabeth rather by gratitude than affection i had patience enough to wait her resolution and entertained myself rather with the gaieties than the politics of the kingdom it was at this time the beautiful mary of scotland shone forth fatally for herself the rival of elizabeth and destroyed that peace which prosperity and admiration had contributed to bestow on our queen in the adversity of her youth she flattered herself with supporting a superiority over her oppressor by a discreet submission but to meet with so powerful a rival in beauty talents and empire when at the summit of her glory was a stroke as mortifying as unexpected she ever sickened at the name of mary and by extravagant praises pointed the severe remarks she continually made on her conduct she maintained with a rigid exactness the advantages she possessed from the situation of her kingdom over her neighbor and continually affected to choose her a husband from the handsome and dissolute nobles of her court melvil the scotch ambassador among other presents to elizabeth brought with him a picture of the queen of scotland it was done by a french artist exquisitely skilled this little portrait elizabeth always wore hanging to her breast i never beheld it without admiring the finest imitation art could execute of the most finished production of nature one evening while the queen was conversing with me my eyes by a kind of habit were fixed on this ornament she suddenly rose and retired in great wrath to her apartment she shut herself up three days before the extravagance of her resentment permitted her to form any resolution at last the countess of somerset came to me with the picture and an assurance from the queen that as she perceived i could never be happy without the original she should alter her designs and had sent directions to the earl of bedford to propose me to mary  thunderstruck at so excessive and ridiculous a jealousy i neglected nothing to satisfy the queen i made a thousand protestations of my indifference to the queen of scots in vain elizabeths pride was offended and that was the hardest to appease of all her passions  she insisted on my keeping the picture and haughtily forbad me ever to remember her but as my sovereign  i retired from her presence piqued by her haughtiness which though a quality adapted to her rank is disgusting in her sex the picture of mary was yet in my hand  when i remembered the sweetness and affability she was famed for the infinite superiority of her charms and the softness of her character i was grateful to elizabeth for her anger since it broke the ties my gratitude had formed and left me in hope of a happier fate  i repented a message i had sent off to the earl of bedford to forbid his mentioning my name and only wished it might arrive too late  in my union with elizabeth i saw i must be a cipher for she was jealous to excess of her power with mary i might share a kingdom and by studying her humor render her and myself happy all our wishes are not however to be successful the queen of scots prepossessed that elizabeth intended to raise me to the throne of england believed the proposal a jest and treated it as such the earl of bedford gave into this from a conviction he should oblige me by it and thus i found myself after having aspired to two queens without hopes of either  from the moment of my being neglected by elizabeth i had found myself in the condition of those favorites who fall from the pinnacle of greatness to obscurity after seeing my presence make a circle and my apartment a court i appeared alone or continued in solitude vanity and not generosity had governed me and of those who followed no one really loved and all envied me they rejoiced in my disgrace and ridiculed my ambition what shall i say ladies shall i give false motives for my actions or confess faults my youth may cxcuse i must be sincere whether that sincerity interests you in my favor or otherwise  resolved at all events to have the pleasure of mortifying my enemies  i wrote to the queen assuring her the honors she had loaded me with were encumbrances since she had withdrawn her favor and if my offense unwitting as it was exceeded forgiveness i requested to resign my employments and retire to kenilworth this letter i took an opportunity of presenting to her in the gardens of sheen and far from pronouncing a severe sentence she was pleased to shed tears and tenderly reproached me on the lightness of my attachment on which i took the picture of the queen of scots and casting it into the thames entreated her to bury with it the remembrance of my fault  she gave me her hand to kiss and i had the pride of leading her to the court reinstated in her favor  this disgrace taught me a useful lesson which was to employ my power but to serve the worthy the only way to secure friends and avoid making enemies i learnt how to rate justly all who surrounded me to despise flattery and by never elevating myself put it out of the power of malice or envy in future to humiliate me the queen was pressed by the parliament to marry she had promised to deliberate on the proposal and my interest in her heart made me hope a favorable conclusion to my suit when an unfortunate chance overturned all my schemes and hopes and made me tremble whenever the queen opened her lips to me lest i should hear a resolution which was so lately my utmost wish  sir walter the head of the devereux family was lately created earl of essex he had been sent to ireland to subdue the rebels where he married he returned to court to present his bride whom i had scarce regarded a moment when my heart became sensible of a sentiment unknown to it before i was ambitious of her notice and envied the courtiers who surrounded her i yet trembled to approach her and the compliment of introduction was delivered by me with a low voice and timid air the cold dignity of her manner and her instantly turning from me to converse with lord sands affronted me highly i examined all i had said or done but not finding any thing exceptionable on my part i condemned her as a flattered girl vain of accidental advantages even to folly i retired with the queen without taking any farther notice of lady essex the queen gave a ball that evening i dressed several hours too soon and continually fancied the clock stood not doubting that i had the power of mortifying lady essex i determined to use it even her lord seemed united in her offense though i had no complaint to make against him but that he had married her in short pleased or angry i could think of nothing but her and though i staid at home till quite tired i found myself the first in the drawing room  the queen learning i was there and pleased with my attention which she placed to her own account sent for me to her closet among other questions she asked how i liked lady essex and the asperity with which i censured her was far from displeasing elizabeth who had a talent for satire and was fond of all who excelled in it  we entered the room at the same moment with the lovely bride more obviously so as more adorned the queen turned to me who was leaning on the back of her chair  i think said she my lord i must take the liberty of appointing you to dance with lady essex that the court may have an opportunity of admiring how well i have matched her i thought returned i your majesty had promised me the pleasure of entertaining you and surely lady essex has matched herself much more happily lord leicester madam said that lady in an ironical tone is uniform in his opinion respecting me and for once i agree with him saying this she gave her hand to her lord who honored the younger cecil with it amazed at a pique i could no way explain i remained in a sullen reverie till the queen interrupted it by asking if i did not think lady essexs wit inclined to the severe i replied when i knew whether she had any sense i should judge of her wit but that at present she was perfectly unintelligible to me why surely my lord cried the queen leaning on the arm of her chair and raising her eyes to mine you know she was miss lineric what a fund of intelligence was conveyed in these few words and what a revolution did they make in my mind  to find i had refused and in refusing insulted the woman on whom my happiness must depend or rather from whose resentment my misery was begun  pride anger and ambition vanished my heart overflowing with chagrin and love applauded her just disdain and owned she could never despise me for my stupidity half so much as i did myself insensible to all the discourse of the queen my eyes pursued with a vain and late regret the beauteous bride till the meanders of the dance eluding my sight i struck my head in a transport against the queens chair and being obliged to excuse myself complained of a vertigo and retired  i was interrupted in the midst of the disagreeable reflections arising from the past scene by elizabeths physician whom she had graciously ordered to attend me he easily invented a reason for a malady his art could neither cause or cure and having directed me to be bled left me to repose the queen sent several messengers to enquire after me and when i paid my duty next to her almost gave me a relapse by dismissing her attendants perplexed and uneasy i hardly dared to raise my eyes or anticipate her determination i met hers which seemed equally irresolute and a pause of a few moments was at last interrupted by elizabeth  she informed me that after the most mature deliberation she found that although she preferred me to all men existing she could not by marrying make me happy or be so herself that in yielding to this weakness of her heart she should for ever fully her reputation for wisdom which would always while single teach her how to manage other potentates either by hope or fear and that such a degradation in general opinion would too sensibly affect her  leicester said she thou see my ingenuous motives  i know thou love me and to make thee some amends for the grief this must give thee be assured by our royal word that we will never marry another man however glorious his rank consider therefore whatever matrimonial treaties are on foot as tubs thrown out to the whale and remember elizabeths friendship shall distinguish thee almost as much as her choice could  i kissed the hand she held out to me with apparent chagrin but in reality she had relieved my heart from a heavy load i ventured to admire a fortitude which reduced me to despair and thus amply gratified that vanity which in her takes the lead of sensibility nevertheless i was struck with her demand of a solemn promise on my part never to marry without her consent and considered it as a selfish and arbitrary exaction unknown to a tender heart  the whole court learnt i had lost my hopes without losing my influence the queen just to her promise gave me a palpable superiority on every occasion and i only desired it to make my homage more gratifying to the fair lady essex who showed too much anger to rob me of hope had she appeared equally indifferent and polite she would totally have discouraged me but a man may reasonably flatter himself with the prospect of a pardon as long as a lady deigns to appear offended i made every possible concession to her pride and the pleasure she found in humbling me interwove me insensibly with her happiness  i should spare to your virgin delicacy ladies the acknowledgment of a disgraceful and guilty love was it not absolutely essential to mark the remainder of my story there was a levity and inconsistency in the manners of lady essex which soon awakened her lords jealousy and as she had always been indulged to folly she could so ill brook any restraint that it threw her the more readily into my power the belief that i was loved alone by her and had myself reduced her to make another choice enabled her to preserve a merit with me even in her fall the few hours we could steal were lavished in the most ardent affection i grew almost as jealous of her as her lord and blessed the caution with which he shut her up more and more even from me since it totally excluded all other lovers the oftener i saw her however the more ardently i desired it and when at last her lord was appointed to the command of the forces in ireland whither he despotically resolved to carry her my passion and grief kept pace with hers the court presented nothing to me worthy to supply the loss of one so amiable and had not the queen given me a command in the low countries i know not how i should long have concealed the emptiness of my bosom now its tenant was flown  several years past away in a variety of scenes without my seeing lady essex when the early death of her lord left her at liberty to fix her residence in england i returned home on the first intelligence the sober widowhood in which she lived made it difficult for me to gain admission to her presence which i at last effected by a disguise her beauty shone through her sables with new and more touching graces while my heart betrayed me into involuntary exclamations and caresses she wept and retreating from my arms assured me the only action of her life she repented was that attachment which had sullied her innocence and which she was resolved to expiate by eternal seclusion and repentance all my entreaties were fruitless she burst from me into an apartment where she told me her brother mr lineric was who instantly rushed into the room and demanded by what right i had presumed to detain her i answered truly by that of a lover alone and flattered myself with gaining the interest of this young irishman in favor of my pretensions by obtaining a considerable post for him the next day i easily discerned her aim was a marriage with me which from every reason and more especially the promise i had made to the queen i wished to avoid endless negociations were carried on and these fermented the weakness of my heart to such a degree that i forgot her error vanity but too easily persuades a generous man to pardon a srailty of which he is the cause and the object lady essex listened very readily to an honorable proposal and gave me at greenwich an exclusive claim to that hand so long so passionately beloved  anxious to conceal this event from the queen who rigidly maintained over me the rights of a jealous lover while she disclaimed the title i visited my bride very rarely and my affection rather increased than diminished in fact i was the more completely happy when with because i hourly experienced in every absence the impossibility of being happy without her  to return one moment to the poor matilda from the moment lord leicester named this lady my heart presaged her his wife the closing evening had luckily prevented the various changes of my countenance from being visible but the suppressed swellings of my heart at last conquered my spirits and i sunk back at this part of his recital if not fainting at least senseless  lord leicester alarmed united with the terrified ellinor to recover me when fearing my full eyes would betray my heart i urged indisposition and besought his excuse for retiring to my chamber he made many apologies for having fatigued me to which ellinor alone could answer as soon as he left us giving way to an irresistible impression of sadness i threw my arms round ellinor and wept bitterly her generous tears streamed with mine and we seemed fully to mingle souls without exchanging one word  i understand you my beloved sister said she and will spare your delicacy but you wanted courage to hear the whole and this lady is not immortal think better of yourself and your hopes my dear matilda for ellinor becomes a prophet in your cause and says lord leicester and you were born for each other  this little sally could not call the smile she wished for into my cheek i was the more hurt at this event because i had though i know not for what reason except that we all too readily believe what we wish overlooked it in my arrangement of suppositions i past the whole night in walking about my room and lamenting he is married i would exclaim that invaluable heart and hand are then another oh just heaven have i then inherited my mothers fate with her features is a guilty passion ordained to be the crime and scourge of all my race let me at least bury it in my bosom yes cried i with conscious dignity i may be unfortunate but not censurable the daughter of mary shall be worthy the stuart line when this admired leicester returns into the world he shall remember with reverence this innocent asylum and the family of howard shall be still dear to him oh may he return in safety to that most happy of wives while i waste my youth in a solitude only pleasing by its having once been his shelter self would then predominate and floods of impassioned tears wash away every just resolution alas i forget to whom i am writing the language and thoughts of lovers must be uniformly the same and i can only excuse these rhapsodies by observing a tender heart traces its own emotions under the name of another with a melancholy pleasure  lord leicester at the usual hour the next day resumed his narrative  the wars in the low countries carried me abroad half the year and the remainder i divided between the court and my lady security perhaps produced carelessness and the french ambassador whose court was interested in depriving me of the queens favor as the chief obstacle to her appointed marriage with the duke of anjou by some unexpected vigilance traced out the secret of my marriage of which he immediately apprized elizabeth i had the vexation one morning to receive the most marked tokens of her displeasure for she is but too well known to give an unbounded license to her tongue whenever her passions are awakened she ended her virulent reproaches with ordering me immediately to join the army in the netherlands and never to return without her permission thunderstruck both with the discovery and her conduct i bowed and retired without attempting to offer a single word in my own defense the queen made me however some atonement for her violence by refusing the duke when every preliminary was settled which cruelly disappointed the french ambassador  no longer condemned to silence my retinue escorted lady leicester to kenilworth castle as the safest residence while the queens anger continued and i obeyed her in departing for holland i soon learnt that elizabeths chief reason for not recalling me was the being obliged to pardon my wife to whom by a most unaccountable whim she had transferred all her resentment and whom she hoped to punish by continuing to separate us the times and a variety of reasons made our correspondence uncertain months sometimes elapsed and without i sent an express i obtained no news of one so dear to me i was unjust enough to impute the difficulties by turns to the queen and my enemies and piqued at elizabeths ungenerous motive for exiling me resolved to pass over incognito into england and conduct lady leicester into the netherlands or if she was averse to that measure endeavor to appease the queen  i executed my design so happily that my arrival at my own castle was the first news of my intention to lady leicester whom i found confined to the house by indisposition it struck me her joy was nearly allied to sorrow but the thought was momentary and i imputed it to her malady her beauty appeared much impaired but placing the alteration merely to grief for my absence it became a new call upon my tenderness she told me the terror she was under of elizabeth had made her almost a prisoner in her own house where she had passed fifteen months without any company except her brother who had kindly followed her into this solitude to fix her influence over an ungovernable train of servants to whom she was a stranger i returned lineric every acknowledgment and complimented him with a fine diamond given me by the states on a former occasion  a long absence from this mansion where art and nature unite to produce almost the effect of novelty made it appear a most heavenly retreat from the noise and bustle of a camp i passed the afternoon in surveying the gardens and directing many necessary alterations  insensibly fatigued beyond bearing i consented at the persuasion of my lady to retire and endeavor to rest an hour early in the evening i had slept several when my valet le val threw open the curtains and with a countenance full of horror and intelligence deprecated the wrath such a rude salutation must necessarily occasion  amazed beyond expression i bad him recollect himself since while thus confused i could not rely on his accounts however kind his intention  pardon me my lord said he the liberty your safety reduces me to take of sounding the truth of the grievous intelligence i am obliged in duty to reveal by first questioning your lordship have you remarked that almost all your domestics are changed  i was struck with conviction by the question though i had not made the observation  no no said he warmly there was a devilish reason for that  beware le val returned i of what you would insinuate for if without proof you dare asperse    i have but too sufficient reasons my lord added he shaking his head but they shall never pass this bosom if you give an affirmative to my next demand  are you convinced my lord that man is brother to my lady who is called so  i hesitated  let us hope not said he with vehemence lest we shock humanity for as sure as one god made than both they are but too well agreed  horrorstruck with the idea my heart sickened and involuntarily admitted a doubt but too many circumstances corroborated  her love of retirement might proceed more from such an attachment than regard for me  nay even her marriage be but an honorable veil to the loosest connection i had neither power nor will to silence the poor fellow who went on with an honest eagerness   of all the servants long retained by your lordship two only remain and the rest are a set of ungoverned irish attached by country to both brother and sister the sewer owns he kept his place by silence and submission and dame margery the housekeeper most probably by managing all my ladys secrets but the sewer will make oath of my ladys intercourse with lineric and that far from wishing for your return they are alarmed at it beyond measure as my lady expects every hour to be delivered  nor is this all  give me time to breathe le val cried i for this horrible intelligence unmans me  i could not be silent and know you wronged my lord though your sword were to rip out my heart but i fear the worst  i fear lest something is now hatching against your life for my lady is in margerys room directing some carp in the manner you used to like so well and i saw linerics servant set out for coventry from whence he is this moment returned with a horse his speed has half killed  well well said i be assured i shall consider over all you have said and will avoid tasting the dish you mention  ah my lord that will only convince them you suspect their diabolical intention and the servants of their own placing form a little army in the house if my lord will hear the advice of his servant i have a way to propose which will have no ill consequence if no ill is meant if otherwise it will fall only on the contrivers another dish composed of the same ingredients the sewer can place at the bottom of the table when the supper is served i will pretend to be drunk and making a scuffle in the adjoining hall my lady and her brother will naturally take the alarm and interfere the sewer can in the interim change the two dishes by which means my lady will taste the dish of her own preparing and must abide the event  this plan was of itself so innocent and well contrived that i resolved to authorize it and le val satisfied with his discovery retired he had indeed relieved his mind but what a weight had he left on mine the bare idea had filled me with a thousand horrors every thing confirms us in either love or hatred  the silence of my friends when my marriage was discovered her tears her altered person that remissness in writing for which i had in my own heart censured the queen  all in short i so lately thought inestimable proofs of her love now rose as terrible presumptions of her guilt and yet when i saw her enter my chamber presently after and tenderly accuse me for so long an absence i could have received a mortal draught from her hand with less pain than it cost me to suspect her  the day was closing and the table covered when i entered the hall occasioned by my long sleep le val began the premeditated uproar and lady leicester with her brother flew toward the door whence the attendants had before departed eager to increase the bustle the faithful sewer on whom i kept an eye exchanged the dishes in the manner agreed and we returned to the table i observed to my lady that she trembled violently which she naturally enough attributed to the alarm assuring me she had hearse prepared the carp she insisted on my doing honor to it and urging her to bea me company i accepted her invitation an involuntary emotion made me every moment ready to prevent her tasting the exchanged dish but the pleasure with which the infamous lineric seemed to see me swallow the supposed death kept me from speaking scarce was the table cleared when lady leicester sunk back in strong convulsions conscience made lineric exclaim poison poison every common antidote was administered in vain she was borne to her chamber in an hopeless state and i retired to mine to meditate alone this terrible conviction of the unhappy fate prepared for me on my return from an exile she alone had occasioned converted my love into horror and aversion she raved dreadfully at intervals and persisting to the last i had poisoned her expired early in the morning the blackness of the soul diffused itself over the body and the proof of her infidelity was too obvious in her person  whether linerics constitution was less liable to infection or that he had tasted the carp more sparingly it was not till she expired that he found himself affected but the dose was too deadly for him to escape convinced by his sisters example that there was no effectual antidote he summoned all his irish domestics into his chamber the faithful le val chose that moment to enter mine and inform me of the consultation which he insisted would produce some fatal event if i did not consent that moment to mount horses which were ready and attended by him and williams set out for london this step would give me the advantage of first representing the fact while it secured my person from any savage revenge the sewer in the interim by the intervention of the tenants might secure the castle the moment the ruffians abandoned it in pursuit of me  this advice had its due weight with me and quitting the castle by stealth i rode off with le val and williams from my own servants as the worst of assassins and from my home as my grave it was now daybreak and we had not proceeded many miles when from the top of a hill we perceived a party apparently pursuing having the fleeter horses we kept the advantage for near twenty miles when by taking some shorter road unknown to us we saw them very near st vincents abbey appeared at the same moment in sight which le val conjured me to seek giving him my cloak to mislead the assassins we had no time for deliberation i struck into the wood where finding my horse an encumbrance i left him to his fate and was endeavoring to make my way through the bushes without any certainty of being right when i had the happiness to meet so fair a deliverer  lord leicester thus concluded his story but oh how much of my life had evaporated during the relation the unconquerable anxiety with which i followed him united my heart for ever with his and convinced me no disparity of either situation or years can restrain the eager sentiments of youth seeking for merit as the only acknowledgment for his noble frankness i in turn related the little tale already repeated of our melancholy birth and undecided fate tears composed of every melting sensation seemed to fall from my eyes on his heart those fine eyes were teeming with some generous consolation when a sudden noise obliged us to separate hardly could he regain the chamber hallowed as mrs marlows ere father anthony joined us the natural austerity of his air heightened by some present chagrin he threw himself into a chair and preserved a long silence which fear of his having penetrated into our mystery prevented my breaking confused beyond description a thousand colors chased each other from my cheek nor had i power to raise my eyes to my sister who accustomed equally to love and honor me seemed in holding my hand to have gained a sufficient protection  unfortunate children cried he with a deep sigh heaven has at last completed the calamitous circumstances under which you were born destined to an imprisonment as lasting as your royal mothers you have but the melancholy advantage of choosing it lord scroope is dead in the confinement and disgrace with which elizabeth rewarded him his lands his honors the very spot on which you stand all are the property of a distant relation and you now see before you your only friend  a feeble helpless friend bending daily toward that grave you alone render displeasing to him the moment may yet come when the rights of your mother will ascertain yours and all i can do for you in the interim is to convey you secretly into france and place you under the protection of the family of guise their prudence or their pride may equally induce them to secure you an asylum in a monastery  the terrible alternative implied in these words froze up my blood and the beatings of my heart died away  to become an exile from england  to forget lord leicester  or to be forgot by him  to be delivered up a martyr to the family of guise perhaps by them tyrannically buried in a eloister a perjured selfcondemned wretch whose soul was full of an earthly image while devoting itself to its maker all the arguments and entreaties father anthony made use of in a long harangue were lost upon me i knew him to be speaking but by the motion of his lips and offered up to god in my tears a confutation of all he could advance he left us not till too late for another interview with lord leicester and i past the night in an anguish time can never erase from my memory  pale unrefreshed either by sleep or dress i met my lord next morning more like a spectre than myself he took my hand and expressing his surprise but by a glance kissed it in tender silence i did not dare raise my eyes to his and tears stealing from under their lids fell on the united hands oh how much was expressed in the silence of that moment i seemed to understand all i wished and at length respired freely ellinor unrestrained by the tender delicacy which actuated me declared to lord leicester at once the fate allotted us and her utter detestation of it the eagerness with which he entered into our interests bespoke something stronger than friendship a thousand times he assured ellinor of his esteem and affection to me he said nothing but pressing the hand he still held its trembling confessed it knew all the distinction a ray of pleasure once more enlightened my soul methought at that moment i could have borne every evil fortune can inflict no he will never forget me sighed i to myself in whatever remote solitude i am again lost to him this dreary recess the daughters of mary in their rustic garb and lowly manner will eclipse all the glories of a court all the gifts of elizabeth for the remainder of his stay a serene delight which neither arose from nor can be conveyed by language animated us alike the intercourse of the eyes and heart took place of that of the tongue and perhaps nothing was more remote from our thoughts than what we conversed about till my lord fixed my attention by declaring he would no longer intrude on our goodness than till the next morning a sigh accompanied these words and a sigh was my only reply ellinor who ever treated him with a freedom inseparable from a disinterested regard insisted he ought not to quit so safe an asylum rashly he replied he should bury himself with us did he not hope to revisit it in a more acceptable manner breaking off at these words with an irresolution and timidity which showed he had not said all he intended after pausing a few moments he resumed can you pardon ladies a friendship perhaps too officious but since your natural support and just hopes have failed may i flatter myself you will have the goodness to suspend your resolutions respecting the future till i can appear with honor again before you a short time is due to clearing my own fame for ill would it become me to claim the guardianship of the royal marys beauteous children while loaded with opprobrium he was proceeding when the cough of father anthony startled us scarce had ellinor time to lead my lord out at one door ere he entered at another to visit alice who had sunk under the fatigue and grief attending the loss of her mistress with an art i had newly learnt i snatched up a book in which i affected to be so absorbed as not to hear him till at my shoulder with real perturbation i arose on his speaking and as usual was preceding him to alices chamber when he called me back in haste and pointing to the ground bade me give him what lay there but what words can express the various emotions which ran through my frame when i perceived it was the picture of elizabeth which the earl had in retiring somehow or other dropped instead of obeying i snatched it up and attempted to hide it in my bosom when with a strong arm the father wrested it from me and read in my features half the mystery the name engraved on it the date all put him out of doubt as to the owner and nothing remained but to learn how i had come by it without the finesses of my sex on the occasion as soon as my terrors and tears permitted i related the whose adventure incoherently with his customary sternness he overwhelmed me with reproaches rash girl cried he could no human prudence save thee did not the lost saint whom i must ever lament entomb herself merely to preserve a secret the folly of a babys curiosity betrayed ere her ashes were cold what confidence can be placed in the favorite of elizabeth whose interest it undoubtedly must be to flatter those in whose hands his life now is and then deliver them up to exalt himself by the total silent ruin of the stuarts prudence directs us rather to secure ourselves by retaining him for ever here  first may i perish on the block where my father ended his days cried i in a transport of love and grief let me oh god rather be a martyr to the sins of mankind than submit to partake them what be more cruel than the assassins from whom we saved him pardon me father cried i reccovering myself but you know not the story or the heart of lord leicester who far from betraying us is anxious to become our guardian and protector  such a guardian as the wolf is to the lamb retorted he acrimoniously  who oh who would willingly have the management of youth unhappy child added he will thou inherit the faults with the features of thy mother an idle weakness like thine sapped all her morals and left a stain on her life time never can erase but if not more virtuous be at least more prudent  hold father anthony cried i with a dignity which awed even him into silence nor cancel all the merit of your actions by a surmise my foul disdains far be it from me to censure a parent but still farther be it to deserve the censure of an indifferent person i may have erred but only in innocence and the life that beats within this bosom can never issue to a nobler purpose than to save that of lord leicester  nothing is more dangerous than to judge a generous and youthful mind harshly it then is too easily acquitted to itself and rises against suspicions it is unconscious of deserving the shock the fathers doubts had given me brought to light without one idea of shame that partiality i durst hardly before acknowledge to myself  convinced by my manner he had lost his influence over me he commanded ellinor to reconduct my lord into his presence and requested to be left alone with him i departed most reluctantly but i would not entirely exasperate him the injustice of mankind gave me too much reason to dread lest he should affront lord leicester who might unite the innocent with the guilty and abandon us entirely aversions extend but too frequently through families nay even descend from generation to generation  their conference continued two whole hours while i counted the moments in painful expectation at last father anthony entered our room and bidding ellinor entertain lord leicester desired me to collect my spirits and listen to him  however my suspicions may offend you young lady said he i will suppose it possible i mayknow as much of the world who have passed my youth in it as you who have yet been confined almost to these walls well had it been if you had never gone beyond them when i tell you this lord you have saved demands your hand you will indulge a thousand romantic sallies and see in his request a love as blind as your own perhaps there may be something in that perhaps too he recollects that your mother is the next in succession to the crown of england  that she may die in prison and that the aversion the english ever entertain to a foreign sway may prevail over the prior claim of your brother james and his ambition may be gratified by a preference given to you the cruel necessity imposed by your unlimited confidence of attaching lord leicester to your interest makes it needless to enumerate the objections i could reasonably urge against your union the recent loss of his wife i find puts it in his power to marry you you have left yourself no choice but to marry him and never will i consent to his departing from this recess till the contracts i shall dictate are solemnly signed and the marriage completed in all its forms  imagine madam my situation during this speech   oh anthony thy dictatorial manner then was happipiness in one moment to emerge from the abyss of despair and soar into the regions of bliss to find the generous leicester was willing once more to sacrifice his safety for love once more to risque a displeasure from which he was not yet relieved to raise me from obscurity  ah to raise me to himself a height in my estimation beyond the throne of my ancestors the fond hope suggested by the fathers speeeh of one day rewarding my lords tenderness was all i remembered of it crowns and sceptres those playthings in the hands of love surrounded me in imagination and impassioned tears rolled down my glowing cheeks while i said to myself in the language of miranda i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of  reflection and circumstances a little foftened father anthony who saw himself on the point of being relieved from a heavy charge to which his impoverished fortune and decaying years rendered him unequal the amiable leicester joined us and every heart being lightened of its load an evening of such refined pleasure succeeded that could i wish to live over one of my whole life i would select that as the happiest  the interest the honor of my lord demanded his return to court and father anthony having prepared due contracts insisted on my compliance his commands and the wishes of lord leicester added to these weighty reasons overruled my sense of decorum and our hands were united  the peculiarity of the situation can alone excuse such a marriage but i was born for obedience formed wholly of the mild elements i wept the disappointment of my wishes ever in silence scarce had the transport of finding myself happy given place to reason when my mother recurred to my mind unblest by her matron presence my nuptials were but half hallowed nay unblest with her consent i compared with grief her fate and mine a long captivity had impaired her health and no hope of a release to her spirits i although pent in a still narrower prison beheld it enclose almost every human good and could have consented to end my days in it  but the honor the welfare of my lord ordained otherwise every passing hour gave his enemies an advantage our servant james had been sent immediately on our marriage to kenilworth castle which he informed us on his return was in the possession of the faithful tenants who had been able of all the servants to secure only dame margery this detestable instrument of a superiors barbarity more terrified at the idea of an infamous death than any due sense of her crime attempted to end her days with a remnant of the poison prepared for her lord but being detected it only supplied a new proof of her guilt tormented by fear and despair she at last sound means to strangle herself in the night in her my lord lost one evidence of his innocence which made his presence at court doubly necessary the family of lineric having received information of the melancholy catastrophe of both brother and sister from the irish servants who had been their abettors had carried away the bodies as if to inter them but kept them in the hands of surgeons still undetermined how to proceed  involved in one fate with my love i knew no peace even in his arms but with incessant admonitions drove him from me refusing resolutely to accompany him and although his fondness induced him to urge my departure his reason must suggest to him all its danger would elizabeth who thus resented his marrying an equal ever pardon his afpiring to her blood and how could we sufficiently guard from others a secret my very features betrayed to him actuated but by the single wish of passing my life near lord leicester i neither asked to be known or honored by any one but himself nor to be greeted by a title only endeared to me because he bore it  the strong aversion with which i had been taught to regard the reigning queen might perhaps influence me in this case before i gave my hand to lord leicester i had made him promise never to carry me to court a promise readily given since it perfectly accorded with his wishes nay in this happy union every wish i could form seemed to be completed i gained to that dear mother who never left my thoughts although i could neither ask her advice or consent in deciding my fate a powerful friend in the favorite of her unjust rival i hoped he might yet be prevailed on to attempt her freedom and i already placed myself at her feet overcome with the dear idea of having been the instrument of her deliverance alas madam were it not for such vague imaginary joys how could we exist all our real pleasures fall infinitely short of these tor the preceding and following afflictions oblige our reason too often to correct them but fancy powerful fancy gains vigor from disappointment and an infant hope ever arises like the phoenix from the ashes of the dying one  a week after my marriage lord leicester departed for court promising soon to return and conduct me to kenilworth where he had previously resolved i should reside with ellinor he depended less on elizabeths partiality than the justice of his cause and was far from declining a trial in which he was satisfied his innocence would become conspicuous he was sorry nevertheless to convince the queen he had wronged her confidence only to obtain the most unworthy of her sex  from his departure i date my entrance into the world i had rather till this period looked on than lived in it now i began to feel its anxieties the painful consequences of its tenderest ties shall i tell you all madam that passed in my heart in spite of the proof i had received of a matchless affection i could not persuade my self lord leicester would ever return if the queen rinding him once more free and taught his value by his loss should at last resolve to espouse him how could a poor girl already possessed and left in a solitude where even the news of his infidelity could not reach her till too late how would she weigh against a crown where could she hope for justice when the sovereign who swears to protect must find it her interest tocondemn her overcome with this formidable phantom i gave myself up for some days to a despair as violent as my love this imagination was only interrupted by another not less afflicting how if his interest in the queens heart had expired in his absence if equally offended at his disobedienee and its motive she should join with his enemies his proofs appearing less satisfactory to me than himself i feared it was possible he might be condemned as a criminal when he was in reality the devoted victim  one of these suppositions was as unjust to the queen as the other to my dear lord and father anthony dispelled them all by some letters he brought me i had the happiness to find lord leicester was received by the queen with kindness and that the family of lineric persuaded of his innocence would not provoke him to make public the infamous design of his late wife by calling him to a trial he had therefore but one caution to observe which was ta conceal this new union with more care than the last to effect this he must delay our meeting for some little time left his immediately retiring from court should lead the curious to search into the cause  my doubts vanished with these proofs of his attention i had only now to contend with the involuntary hatred i had conceived for the recess i wandered through every apartment without finding rest in any my impassioned fancy followed my love into the court and the silence and consinement i lived in became more and more odious i beheld with astonishment the composure of my sister and envied her a tranquillity i would not have regained by being unmarried if   could  at last the happy hour arrived when i was to quit my retirement lord leicester had projected the mode of my departure ere he left me le val and his valet were the only persons in the secret to all others we passed for young women educated in a convent who not finding a call to the monastic life came with the consent of our friends to embellish the retirement of lord leicester by our musical talents this tale we were well able to support for my voice was a very fine one and the skill and taste of mrs marlow added to the tuition of a master had taught me to manage it properly ellinor had not the same advantage but touched the lute with a delicacy so exquisite that we became necessary to each other and as i never sung so well without her accompaniment she had been so accustomed to adapt it to my voice that something seemed wanting to either when the other was silent the passion lord leicester had for music in which he was a proficient gave the strongest probability to the whole he had paid a handsome sum to accomplish the two daughters of his steward in that science and the young women were taught to expect an addition to their number the time le val remained in the recess preparing every thing for our departure was long enough for him to seem employed in fetching us from abroad lord leicester came several times to direct all and to support and cheer us with accounts of the care he had taken to render the apartments destined to us commodious and agreeable  the recess till now so calm so tiresomely tranquil became at once full of confusion and hurry the family pictures were taken from their frames and conveyed through father anthonys cell gradually to kenilworth  by what strange caprice is it everything seems dear to us the moment we know we must lose it involuntary tears filled my eyes when the hour of my departure arrived as much a stranger to the world as if just born into it how could i promise to myself years as peaceful as i had experienced in the recess long habit has the art of giving charms to places or rather it is the people who inhabit them it seemed to me as if in quitting the spot where the dust of mrs marlow was interred i quitted likewise her idea every spot i looked on was marked by some noble sentiment or tender emotion of that dear lady but i was unjust to myself for i have carried in my heart through every scene of life her respectable image and nothing but death can efface it  to part with those we love is the most painful stretch of humanity but what can make it painful to part with those we do not love separation like death seems to erase all the individual ever did to displease us and leaves no remembrance but of his obliging actions we lost but little in father anthony but could he forget what he must lose in us his declining years and ill health required the tenderest attention and surely the care he had shown in educating us gave him a just claim to ours my feelings in this were superior to my sisters for he had been the means of my happiness i joined my entreaties to those of the generous lord leicester to prevail on him to reside in a retirement at kenilworth but although he seemed deeply affected at parting with us he was inflexibly bent on ending his days where those of his sister ended james still remained to attend on him and alice was carried very ill to the carriage which conveyed us away  we took nothing but the ornaments from the recess leaving the furniture ready to accommodate any future unfortunates whom the father should think worthy such a relief  it was in the dusk of the evening we arrived at kenilworth castle the stewards wife received us with her daughters unconscious of our superiority they treated us as young people who sought from the generosity of their master a comfortable subsistence although i had agreed to confirm this story i felt myself shocked at the freedom they used from it i could have fallen to them but was affronted at their rising to me a little time however reconciled me it is lord leicesters interest and shall be my pleasure was always my argument with myself mrs heart for that was the name of this domestic expatiated on her lords person character and magnificence she officiously pointed out the rich ornaments of the gallery and apartments and looked round to us every moment with the impertinent expectation of seeing us filled with the low awe and surprise of people unaccustomed to grandeur the indifference with which we regarded every thing was not a less affront to her consequence she shrunk before it and passed the remainder of the evening in a cold and haughty silence her daughters not more amiable than herself gloomily regarded our dresses and by whispering excluded us from joining in the conversation  such was my introduction into the family it was my right to govern my heart sunk within me i believed myself already fallen to a servant and neglected by lord leicester unused to the circumspection necessary where secrecy is desired i demanded to be welcomed in his arms i surveyed the eyes of my ellinor fearful they might reproach me for having innocently degraded the daughter of the queen of scots but that dear girl too delicate to add to my uneasiness preserved apparently her gaiety and sweetly accommodated herself to the people with whom fortune had mingled her  the alleging fatigue and indisposition obliged them to conduct us to the apartment allotted us i should perhaps have wondered at its richness but that i saw scarce any inferior i was no sooner left in it with ellinor than i gave free scope to the tears i had scarce been able before to suppress my face was hid in her bosom when the voice of lord leicester recalled me to myself i dried my eyes unwilling to reproach him even by a tear he entered through a private door to change the cause of my grief to joy for in his presence i hardly ever knewn any other emotion and the generous anxiety with which he entreated our pardon for the reception discretion had obliged him to order us had something in it so graceful so ardent and tender that all the pride of my heart subsided at once and left it full of gratitude and affection  we wished my sister a good night and then passing through a dark passage the whole length of the grand gallery came into lord leicesters apartments to which every place i ever saw was mean he had a noble spirit a splendid fortune and an exquisite taste he had greatly improved this ancient seat the gift of elizabeth its finely chosen situation elegant architecture and superb furniture made it the model of a thousand others the beauties divided through the rest of the house in this apartment were united and he gave a proof of the attention inseparable from real love by omitting nothing to embellish it he had ever heard me commend ah madam these are the mighty trifles that so exquisitely flatter a tender heart and form its most perfect enjoyments  the recess etc part ii the communication between our apartments was a profound secret to all the servants but le val and williams my lords valet in whose fidelity after the late trial he had the most perfect confidence we were to keep up the farce presented to lord leicester the next day who soon by his growing distinction taught mrs heart and her daughters to observe a kind of deference in their behavior to us he ordered them to attend us round the gardens and park and not to fail showing us whatever was worth observation and through what a beautiful variety did they lead us a world in miniature a magnificent lake presented itself in whose clear bosom the trees were reflected and round which the sheep and deer grazed on rich pasture swans and waterfowls innumerable played on its surface and an aight in the center was made highly picturesque by several halfseen cottages and emblems of agriculture the late lady leicester needed not to have made a merit of residing within these walls since nature and art could furnish nothing lovely that was not enclosed here several gilded boats and little vessels danced on the bosom of the lake and added by the various streamers which played upon the surface to the gaiety and richness of the prospect when we turned the other way the gothic towers swelling bastions gigantic statues and majestic sweep of the building made that an object scarce less worthy of admiration  all our allotted employment was to sing to lord leicester while at dinner but as he frequently entertained the neighboring nobles and gentlemen a curtain of muslin was drawn over the balcony to screen us from observation in the evening we sometimes fished on the lake or lord leicester to indulge in our company joined in the concert we formed every day brought with it some amusement and the restraint we lived under kept up even in matrimony all that delicacy and spirit of affection which is by case of mind too apt to decay at last painful necessity obliged lord leicester to return to court he however would not leave me with more than one equal in the family therefore directed that i should preside one month and my sister the next by this method rendering it hard for them to fix on his favorite we likewise with the stewards daughters wore one kind of habit and busied ourselves in the working rich tapestry  but my own happiness could not erase from my mind the opposite fate of the unhappy queen who gave us birth she was then confined at a place not far distant from kenilworth i had already tried all my interest with lord leicester in her favor without success and so just was his noble inflexibility that at the moment my heart was pierced by it my reason admired it another man would he say in attempting the release of the illfated mary would only forfeit his obedience and endanger his life and were those all perhaps i should not be able to refuse my matilda but remember my love to these i must add the blackest treachery and ingratitude it would be viper like stinging to death the generous heart that warmed me never employ the voice of virtue to charm me to vice for what seems a duty in you would be the worst of crimes in me and what confidence could my wife have in my honor if i was capable of betraying a partial sovereign  i then would urge my only wish was to restore my mothers liberty which nothing but an unparalleled breach of confidence could have taken from her for eighteen years observing her crown had been lined with thorns too keen for her to desire to wear it again  ah my dear matilda he would cry how ignorant are you of these terrible emotions jealousy and revenge permit me to know your mothers character better than yourself she had too much pride and pleasure in reigning to submit tamely to this imprisonment or even supposing tired of the evils always inseparable from a crown she could master her just resentment and seeking an asylum with her children ask only to die in peace her relations would not suffer it the ambition of the guises is become a proverb they would make use of her name and wrongs to shake the throne of elizabeth and instead of guarding the queen to whom i owed a perfect duty i should have have the misery of seeing a terrible war devour my country of which i was the cause who knows my dear matilda if amidst these calamities my temper might preserve its equality i might remember with regret the fatal advice which had misled me and you might lament too late the sacrificing your own happiness to a fallacious hope of restoring your mothers  remember elizabeth is now declining the chances of life may bring about all you wish  the compassion of the people has been kept alive for mary these seventeen years should we lose elizabeth her very imprisonment would turn to her advantage by keeping her in the midst of a kingdom to which she is the lawful heir my supposition is not vague for the example of elizabeth herself proves it very possible  what could i oppose to reasoning so just i could only recommend the cause of my dear parent to him who can pull down the mighty and exalt the weak  every letter from my lord was filled with complaints of the tediousness of the court and breathed the very soul of love  he often entreated me to tell him i was happy and when i complied reproached me through a tender caprice for being so without him  he required me to enumerate my hourly employments and although half my time was spent in writing pacquets to him always complained of the shortness of my letters he indeed gave me no cause to retort for it appeared as if he withdrew from the court half of his hours to amuse me with all the little humorous incidents it continually furnished but even these had not always the power to effect what he wished  my fate never allowed me one hour of perfect happiness and an evil arose in his absence which filled me with the most terrible apprehensions  my lovely sister who was ever my pride and delight possessed in a peculiar degree that amiable gaiety which lessens the distance of rank from her first introduction at kenilworth she had given way to an increase of spirits natural from such a change in our prospects little foreseeing how great a danger might arise from it  williams had been raised by lord leicester to the superintendancy of the family on his returning to court he preferred this man believing he would from knowing me his lady take care i was treated with due respect williams had been a soldier and had contracted the authoritative air annexed to petty officers which made him in appearance peculiarly suited to the post assigned him  imust confess he was never a savorite with me nature had been unkind to him and he had been more unkind to himself in not softening her severity he was beyond the meridian of life his person coarsely made his complexion swarthy and his face much scarred he had besides a fierceness of mien which scarce bent to lord leicester who of all men eminently possessed the art of inspiring as much respect as affection  this man then madam marked out thus by nature ventured to raise his eyes to the royal the beautiful ellinor  the sprightliness of her manner abated his respect and he had the insolence to declare his passion call it honorable and solicit her return my sister had too much understanding not to feel her own fault and too much pride to support his insolent freedom she left him with ineffable disdain as not worthy of a reply and came directly to me  a presentiment of some evil consequence arose in my mind at the moment she related the insult i resolved to give lord leicester immediate notice of it that he might take his measures accordingly and in the mean while appeared constantly with my sister but we had to manage a man equally artful and fearless he had the consummate impudence to open my letter and finding its subject detain it in the mean time no advice arriving from lord leicester in answer to mine i remained on the rack of uncertainty tormented by the confidence of a wretch from whom there was no possible escape and uncertain even of the nature or extent of our danger at last unable as the wife of lord leicester to endure his insults and tired of waiting my lords resolution i took an opportunity of representing to him the daring boldness of his conduct in speaking of love to the sister of his lord  without any emotion or confusion he pleaded guilty to the charge but artfully endeavored to exculpate himself from presumption by alleging the rank in which we appeared and the supposition that we were raised from obscurity by his lord who of course could only ennoble me  at this insinuation all the pride of norfolk and mary animated my features yet fortunately recollecting myself i replied with moderation for the villain doubtless aimed at discovering from whom we really sprung since our habitation had too probably struck him as containing a consequential secret  i forbad him mildly ever to address my sister in that light again without the approbation of my lord and attempted to retire when stopping me he bad me recollect that i talked to one possessed of more authority in the house than myself that i likewise knew a secret of the utmost importance was in his power and he was determined to make every use of it in case i did not persuade my sister to accept him that i must imagine him a fool by referring him to lord leicester in short instead of asking him he was resolved to prevent his arriving at the knowledge of the affair for which reason he had kept back all my last letters  how cruel madam was my situation alone without any means of gaining protection from the remainder of my servants except by declaring a secret he knew too well i would never reveal to be thus braved as well as insulted was dreadful i had yet no way of eluding him since the whole family were under his governance and had i offered to write to lord leicester through any other channel i had the greatest reason to fear it would fall into his hands  by this terrible dilemma were the days of the wife of lord leicester embittered in the midst of affluence in a spot which might be called the palace of pleasure  thus situated i could only counteract treachery and art by the same i appeared after some reflection alarmed at his threats and more willing to forward his views i exacted from him an oath not to betray my secret and on my side solemnly vowed never to mention his but to employ my interest with my sister in his favor  we parted with mutual distrust and an apparent reliance on each others sincerity i performed one part of my promise by conjuring ellinor to deceive him with false hopes till lord leicesters return gave me an opportunity of consulting him on the safest way of disposing the traitor it was with much reluctance she consented but it would have been a cruelty unlike her character to refuse to lighten an evil she was the innocent cause of i had then only to find some means of letting my lord know it without breaking my word for once in my life i was guilty of duplicity and like philoctetes found my equivocation furnished a terrible punishment i wrote a letter declaring the whole to lord leicester which i kept in my bosom to give to him whenever he should return in the mean time i wrote as usual and delivered my letters to williams the profound silence i observed on this subject probably inspired him with confidence and although ellinor refused to marry him directly the point he aimed at the complaisance with which we both treated him lulled him at last into a perfect security  worn out with hourly complaints of this wretchs impertinence to my sister and my fears of the event i counted with more than a lovers impatience the days which must elapse before i could see lord leicester at length the happy one arrived which brought him and gave me at once joy and sorrow for who could tell me all its consequences  fostered in a court where he knew but one superior lord leicester had added a personal pride to that which naturally sprung from the nobility of his birth the partiality of his sovereign who dispensed through love with his obedience had prevented his learning to disguise his foibles it was the business of every one to seem blind to them by which means he was a favorite without being a hypocrite those who loved him well enough to allow for this error and a vanity i can scarce term so when i remember the various and numerous advantages he possessed might do any thing with him impassioned generous goodnatured and noble where once he was attached his fortune honor nay life would be risked for his friend but the few who are worthy that name too often confined his affections lord leicester was too exalted perhaps to be loved but i digress pardon me madam when you consider the cause this openness of heart gave me just reason to apprehend a guilty mind would read the indignant eye of my love and induced me to suppress for some days the intended disclosure my precaution succeeded williams knew the character of his lord and finding by the freedom and confidence he still testified that i was true began to rely on my word a journey on which he was accidentally sent assisted me highly in leaving time for my lord to cool i laid the letter on his table one evening before i went to bed lord leicester who was in another room came in after me but had not half read it when he frightened me by his rage and indignation had the man been in the house i know not how the matter would have ended but at length my tears and distress softened him he passed two days after in a thoughtful manner i knew not nor ventured to ask him his resolutions at the end of that time he regained his temper and composure he saw the apprehensions lurking still in my heart and bade me take courage for he had found a way to quiet them for ever i conjured my lord at least to conceal with caution his consciousness of the affair which he promised and in a great degree performed but whether it was that knowing he was apprized of it made me fancy his manner would reveal it i cannot say certain it is i never saw him look at or speak to this man afterward without feeling my heart sink within me  sir francis drake at this time formed all the conversation of england he had fitted out a large fleet against the spaniards with which he was ready to sail from plymouth many noblemen and others engaged as volunteers and an infinite number of people assembled from all parts to view the fleet lord leicester who had always been a strong friend to sir francis set out to take leave of him and enlarged the train of domestics he usually traveled with for the sake of appearing honorably among numbers who did not know him so ardent was the desire of all ranks of people to partake the sight that not a single male servant willingly staid behind  williams had so great a relish for these expeditions that he asked my lord to take him le vals sickness keeping him at kenilworth lord leicester complied a fortnight elapsed before they returned during which poor old alice expired with her died one of the witnesses of my marriage father anthony was still in good health as james who regularly came once a month brought word  lord leicester returned and returned without williams  struck to the heart i had scarce strength to enquire what was become of him my lord asked me if i suspected him of having murdered the rogue i have only sent him added he with a gay air a long voyage to teach him to keep a fecret i knew no other way of getting rid of the rascal sir francis has undertaken to provide for him too effectually for my dear matilda to know any further anxiety on his account in short he is shut up in a distant part of the vessel the sailors are taught to consider him as a madman and have neither time to listen to his tales nor sense to understand them  thus my dear love our fears are entirely over  rather begun i might have replied for no rhetoric ever after charmed mine to rest  a thousand accidents ruin our tranquillity but it is better to endure their worst consequences than return evil for evil  however necessary the step the assuming a right to punish this man was too culpable in my eyes not to make me uneasy yet since it certainly was to relieve me lord leicester executed the scheme and because nothing could now recall it i seemed satisfied ellinor too persuaded me to be so from thinking the traitor justly punished  before lord leicester returned to court i gained his consent to a project i had long revolved this was to visit my mother  to have the joy of being held in her arms and to be acknowledged by her blessing  he was too anxious to indulge all my wishes to refuse me in this instance but not being able to further it openly he only gave me a sufficient sum of money to bribe her keepers and directed le val to attend us  this man was as faithful as williams was the reverse  if at first he respected me but as the wife of his master i afterward gained an ascendant with him from my own conduct which attached him to me as much as to his lord and made the most essential services seem trifles in his eyes eager to oblige and obey he seemed always ready to fly before he knew whither and a word of commendation was a sufficient recompense he was now in the post of williams who was supposed to have voluntarily embarked with sir francis and the secret of his fate was confined to lord leicester my sister and myself  attended by le val we set out for coventry with beating hearts we were to visit not merely a mother but an only parent the sole person in whose arms we could claim a refuge though now alas far more able vainly to offer her one we were to see that queen whose matchless beauty was her least ornament to behold her graces withered by eighteen years confinement to share in her afflictions and prove how dearly the children who had never known her could love their mother  but alas madam we were not permitted to realize these visions  le val found her keepers too honest or too fearful to suffer any stranger to converse with her and the only privilege money could purchase was that of seeing the queen through a grated window take her morning walk in a small garden overwhelmed with despair at this news we yet embraced the only indulgence we could gain  but what did we not think that faithless woman deserved who thus treated her equal her relation her friend we were conducted to the window where we were permitted to remain without attendants we saw her come down the walk  but oh how changed and yet how lovely damp rooms had weakened her limbs  her charming arms were thrown round the necks of two maids without whose assistance she could not move  a pale resignation sat on her still beautiful features her regal mien could not be eclipsed by a habit of pale purple nor her fine hair by the veil which touched her forehead  her beads and cross were her only ornaments but her unaffected piety and patient sufferance mingled the saint with the queen and gave her charms beyond humanity our emotions were too rapid and strong for description we wept  we incoherently exclaimed  and striking ourselves eagerly against the bars seemed to hope some supernatural strength would break them more afflicted at seeing her thus than not seeing her at all i neither could behold her for my tears or resolve to lose a look by indulging in them  she drew near the spot where we stood when our hands which we had thrust in supplication through the bars caught her attention  she raised her fine eyes with their usual divine composure to the window  i would have spoke but my lips denied all utterance alas that blessed  that benignant glance was the first the last the only one we ever received from a mother  when she withdrew her eyes she carried my very soul with her all my strength failed at once and i sunk in a swoon in my sisters arms  suspicions of this nature made it dangerous for my lord were we frequently to appear there yet this momentary view had awakened sensations which though less strong than love were equally lasting and which empoisoned my hours in the bosom of happiness bitter tears upon the cheeks of my leicester when with fond endearment he would strain me to his bosom alone spoke my thoughts and i sacrificed the less to the greater duty  ellinor my dear ellinor was on this theme my only counselor and we spent days in forming a thousand projects weeping every evening at discovering their impracticability the frequent absences of my lord left me too much leisure for this melancholy employment yet the ardor of his passion made him choose every opportunity however short to be with me and   trembled lest these incessant journeys should attract the notice of elizabeth who had been for some time indisposed and was of course more sensible to any inattention of her favorite but lord leicester had not been used to control and sometimes imputed hints to indifference which arose from the most generous motives for my life was without any enjoyment in his absence but the hope of seeing him again when he was away i wandered wearily through every room and saw only a magnificent solitude but whenever he appeared joy and music animated the whole family every apartment seemed to have found its guest and every servant the happy subject of his duty  to excuse his frequent absences to the queen my lord avowed a passion for hunting with which his conduct so little agreed that he shut himself up in kenilworth castle and seldom passed beyond his own walls conscious this must in time be observed i learnt to ride expertly and often obliged him to accompany us in mere prudence to prevent our being too much fatigued my lord generally ordered a tent to be pitched with refreshments in the forest and one morning finding myself ill i quitted the chase almost directly and went in search of our resting place guided by a huntsman as ignorant of it as ourselves among the closest and most intricate paths we encountered a gentleman on horseback attended by many servants to make way for us he ordered his servants to return and dismounting bowed and remained uncovered while we passed  addressing the man who attended us he eagerly enquired for my lord  the question i knew not why alarmed me i turned instantly to examine his features and my horse continuing his pace struck my head against an arm of a tree with so much violence that the reins dropped from my hand and the stranger was just quick enough to catch me i fainted one of his train opened a vein in my arm which instantly revived me and i found myself in the strangers arms who pressed with more than common concern the hand he held confused and perplexed with this accident i endeavored in vain to withdraw it and seeing my hair had fallen in its usual curls over my neck looked about for my hat which yet hung on the bough that struck me regardless of every entreaty i persisted in mounting my horse and returning instantly after i had rendered him every acknowledgment his active politeness merited he replied with such peculiar grace and gallantry as gave me a great desire to know who he was but his pursuing me with his eyes rendered it impossible for some time after which the huntsman informed me he was the nephew of lord leicester sir philip sidney his appearance confirmed the agreeable impression made by his character and i only regretted being introduced to him by a vexatious accident which seemed too much to possess his mind engrossed by these reflections although i lay down it was impossible to close my eyes when the abrupt entrance of my lord roused me completely extreme vexation and disorder marked his air and without the least enquiry into my hurts he threw himself into a chair by me and lamented the malice of his fortune alarmed beyond measure i started from the bed and kneeling at his feet conjured him to tell me in what new instance he had reason to complain  matilda said he fixing his eyes on me with a sad intentness the queen approaches  my heart died within me at the words his supporting arms alone saved me from falling to the ground and his caresses from fainting  i know her well continued he and have every reason to fear we are betrayed the subtilty of approaching without an express convinces me that she suspects at least some charm in kenilworth i dare not avow i had always purposed in compliance alike with my promise and my safety to convey you to the recess in case this event happened but now i fear the appearance it will have alike to my own servants and sidneys companions who are all of the queens train and but too much struck with your beauty  one expedient alone remains  tell me my love may your leicester hope to triumph over your becoming pride your just resentment  will you condescend to appear before elizabeth in the same humble light in which you have hitherto appeared and forgetting awhile she has been the persecutor of your family will you consider her only as the patroness of your husband  i will forget every thing cried i in a transport of tenderness which interferes with your safety and satisfaction too happy in having something to sacrifice in proof of my love i will be whatever you wish  as the daughter of mary my soul rises against elizabeth but as the wife of leicester i ought to know no pleasure except his nor have i had till this alarming moment a merit in submission  what are the ties of marriage said my lord the tears mingling on our cheeks to these invisible ligaments of the soul i can so little bear to be surpassed in generosity that i can hardly refrain from leading you to the queen as her hostess and charming the court with the sight of a wife who is my sole pride and everlasting pleasure  precious inestimable moment of my life when the warmth of my heart was so fully displayed so gloriously answered  ah madam lord leicester had the rare secret of governing a generous mind  the same considerations prevailed on ellinor to give the same consent and the short hour previous to the queens arrival was spent by us in schooling our eyes and hearts lest the spirit of the injured and pride of the noble should betray all  apprehensive too lest the similitude my features bore to those of my unfortunate mother might strike some idle observer i departed from her mode of dress and letting my hair curl more over my face and neck enwreathed it fancifully with flowers then mixing with the villagers in habits resembling theirs we waited to usher the queen into the great hall by strewing that and the inner court with aromatic herbs  the amazing hurry produced by this unexpected visit had not subsided when the cannon proclaimed the approach of elizabeth a faint sickness came over me my limbs were scarce able to support my weight and my eyes hardly served to guide my steps my nature shuddered at her and the spirit of norfolk trembled proudly within me most fortunately confounded with the gay cavalcade i soon had performed my task and retired without once fixing my eyes on her face i struggled much with myself and regained a tolerable share of composure ere her dinner was served at which we were as usual to sing concealed from the public gaze i had now an opportunity of examining the queen she was talking to my lord who waited behind her chair though the features of elizabeth retained nothing of her mothers sweetness they were regular her eyes were remarkably small but so clear and quick they seemed to comprehend every thing with a single glance the defect in her shape taking off all real majesty she supplied that deficiency by an extreme haughtiness a severe satirical smile marked her countenance and an absurd gaiety her dress i could not but suppose foreigners would imagine that queen owed much of her reputation to her counselors who could disgrace her venerable years by a bare neck and a false head of hair made in the most youthful fashion yet under other circumstances the scene would have been charming the hall enriched and adorned with sine statues tapestry and purple fringed with gold the high arched gothic windows which being thrown open gave a beautiful view of the lake covered with newly ornamented boats struck the queen with admiration while the immense crowd of royal attendants and above all the profound respect of many of the nobles were sights no less new to me i turned my eyes round to discover if among them i could find any to compare with lord leicester where ah where could they select his equal suppressed anxiety gave a redoubled glow to his cheek and his expressive eyes pierced through the veil which hid us from all others dinner removed the music began the usual pieces played a silence ensued only interrupted by my voice and the lute of my sister amazement seemed to transfix every beholder and all eyes pursued the bent of lord leicesters  the queen dropped a peach she was paring and speaking with warmth to sidney he replied with an air so enlivened as showed his heart was in the subject scarce had i reached the conclusion of the air when the curtain was drawn aside by the officious sidney and we stood exposed to the view of the whole court overwhelmed with a thousand sensations i dropped the book i sung from and ellinor bent over her lute with a beautiful modesty the various exclamations of the noblemen might have flattered our vanity had we not been continually told any thing can make to courtiers the wonder of an hour that fatal moment was sure the critical one of my life it awakened dangerous suspicions in the soul of elizabeth endless anxiety in the man in whom my life was bound up and a passion in the heart of another the cold hand of death alone could extinguish i mean the amiable sidney charmed at finding in the person who charmed the whole court those features indelibly impressed on his memory he delivered himself entirely up to his predilection with a generous warmth  the moment i could recollect myself i considered the queen attentively she sat in the pensive position into which our appearance had thrown her sometimes surveying us with deep observation then with a keener glance lord leicester i labored to support the painful examination with composure but the care defeated itself and involuntary blushes covered my face as often as i became the object of her attention the indifference the queen expressed toward the music obliged every one else to be silent on the subject and we soon obtained permission to retire sydney who was the messenger overwhelmed us with apologies for the share he had in our confusion although by the command of his sovereign i had perpetual reason for resenting his officiousness but sidney was not born to be hated to exalted generosity and the most manly courage he joined elegance refinement and a temper superior to events yes gallant sidney this noble justice matilda owes thy virtues  of all her misfortunes that of becoming thine touched her most deeply  our apparent state of dependence never once induced sir philip to forfeit that respect a man of merit owes to himself  it only united to the politeness universally due to the sex an affecting deference which dignified its object a husband less adored than lord leicester might with reason have dreaded such a rival  midnight alone gave us the freedom of comparing opinions and i saw with unspeakable regret the peace of my lord destroyed during this visit a depression he could hardly account for filled up the intervals we passed together and instead of employing them in forming any reasonable plan nothing remained of all our mutual tenderness but silence sighs and tears  elizabeth in defiance of time and understanding indulged a romantic taste inconsistent with either and not satisfied with real preeminence affected to be deified by the flattery of verse the lady of the lake was the title she chose to be known by here and nothing art could invent or wealth procure was wanting to render the various pageants complete a boat scooped like a shell and enclosing a throne conveyed her to the aight where i and many more habited like nereids waited to receive her and ushering her to a grotto inlaid with shells and lookingglass we presented her in baskets made of seaweed pearl coral amber and every jewel of the water while the place resounded with panegyrics so labored and misapplied that it was with difficulty we forebore smiling at the gravity with which she listened to them  i found with surprise lord leicester feared the eyes of every indifferent spectator would penetrate through a mystery elizabeth only had an interest in developing it is the common weakness of humanity to bend the attention solely to minute objects while the leading ones come upon us totally unawares  i on the contrary fancied myself every moment surveyed with a harsh air by an inflexible imperial rival  every lady of the court under the pretext of seeking our intimacy continually sounded ellinor and myself on our real condition and the timid incoherent manner in which we answered gave me the most mortal fears of their enployer  abject slaves to the queens amusement she kept us continually in her sight and without deigning to open her own lips seemed to tempt us to complain by eternal whims  in those moments love shame and apprehension spoke a language intelligible in all countries in the features of lord leicester and elizabeth having doubtless assured herself by these artifices that there must be something to reveal left her train at one end of the gallery and retiring to the other with my lord interrogated him as i instantly conjectured  the fate of my mother now arose more strongly to my mind ah why thought i did i leave the happy solitude in which she placed me only to ruin the object of my affections and deliver myself up to an inexorable tyrant who can now wreak her malice without even being suspected insensible to the gay crowd who addressed me i observed my lord reply to her eager questions with hesitation and anxiety as he talked he fixed his eyes on me with the uneasy air of a person who wishes to convey through them what he is hopeless of making you comprehend any other way i resolved to prevent an error on my part by a timely retreat when suddenly speaking aloud lord leicester advanced towardsus  mark well all i say said he in a whisper leading me and my sister to the seat of the queen  i shall more surprise these children said he with the knowledge of their origin than your majesty  it is needless to give them the reasons i have laid before you for this secrecy it must be sufficient honor and pleasure for them to find themselves daughters of the house of dudley and objects of their sovereigns gracious patronage seeing him bend his knee ours stubborn and reluctant as they were gave way and we kissed the fatal hand she majestically tendered she informed us she added us to her train of maids of honor and should carry us with her on the morrow toward london  lord leicester charmed with having eluded all her suspicions dreamt not of the snare he had wound round his own heart in yielding us up to elizabeth whose consummate art induced her to give credit to a most improbable fiction on purpose to place us beyond his reach which she could no other way have effected  the hour of rest enabled him to open all his heart  i understood that elizabeth had addressed him in so decisive a manner on the conviction of our being born above our present rank that he could not hope to save us from the most menial degradations but by a false confidence heaven inspired him with the idea of a possibility that his brother the lord guildford might have married lady jane gray a twelvemonth ere the two politic dukes of suffolk and northumberland thought it prudent to appear leagued during which he declared the unfortunate lady jane gave birth to us both the same policy induced them to conceal this event till the suffolk family should be established on the throne and that hope being for ever defeated prudence still buried us in oblivion  finally that the secret rested now only in his own bosom from whence his attachment to elizabeth would never suffer it to transpire and that if the queen still wished to patronise us he thought it would be prudent to let us imagine ourselves his own illegitimate daughters  to all this elizabeth replied little but suffering him to settle it his own way persisted only in taking us from him  her mode of conduct convinced me at once that she utterly discredited the whole of this fiction which allied us by another branch almost as near to the throne as we really stood would not a jealous selfish soul like hers have demanded dates facts testimonials and witnesses would she not have made us undergo the fate of lady catherine the legal heir of the house of suffolk whom by a barbarous unfeminine use of power she tore from the most near and sacred of human ties and condemned even in the bloom of youth to a solitary life of imprisonment only for having dared to become a wife and mother  would not in a word all the fury of her temper have blazed forth but that she meditated a more safe and silent ruin  unwilling to add to the anguish of this moment by one surmise i threw myself into his arms and silent speechless strained him to my heart  supplicating mentally that god who alone could protect us no language could have affected lord leicester like this conduct  he accused himself of having meanly considered his own safety and we were obliged repeatedly to assure him we thought he had acted with the most consummate judgment ere we could reconcile him to himself surely matilda thinks me a sufficient sufferer cried he in losing the charm of her society  can i have forgotten that i dare no longer indulge even my eyes with her beauty  can i have forgotten that all other men may freely adore her and that her happiness is not more in the power of elizabeth than mine is in hers  did i not know the queen would willingly punish her whole race with the celibacy she imposes on herself i should doubt her protecting the pretensions of sydney but she dreads too much multiplying claims to the crown and i alone shall be persecuted with his passion  pity my situation added he and with a uniform coldness dash his presumptuous hopes  how do i lament the fate which involves the fair ellinor in calamities the same motives cannot reconcile her to but since her choice and affections led her into the world i rely upon her generous soul to support its evils with prudence and patience  this will be our last conversation for some time  one only caution let me recommend to you both  make no confidants cultivate the friendship of lady pembroke and never forget that you constantly act under the eye of a haughty jealous and revengeful sovereign  needless admonition could a daughter of the stuart line cease to dread and hate elizabeth  could a wife too who saw the life of the man she loved depended on her prudence for one moment dare to show she did so  condemned to mingle with the world i entered it with presages so melancholy as showed my future fortune  without daring to testify my grief even by a look i departed from that hospitable mansion in which i had vainly promised myself long years of unspeakable happiness  i departed without my lord and in so doing experienced every misery of love and dependence  ah how weak are those wretches who look up to us with wonder cried i mentally as we passed through every town did ye know the breaking heart this splendid garb covers  did ye feel the galling chain which writhes round it and deepens my cheek with destructive beauty how would you bless the gracious god who gives you peace and ignorance  received acknowledged and admired we soon became familiar appendages to elizabeth nor had we any hopes of seeing our bondage end but with her life it was not the least of my evils that i involved my ellinor in this calamity which love of me could alone render supportable by a caprice for which there is no accounting elizabeth whose eyes were ever watchful and heart suspicious bent both for ever on ellinor who endured from her with silent indignation a thousand passionate extravagancies contrary to lord leicesters idea i plainly perceived she encouraged every pretender to either obviously to develope the mystery she easily discerned through his false confidence  tortured with the passion of sir philip i found all my rigor could not extinguish hopes the queen patronized while lord leicesters confidence seemed to contract in proportion as it became difficult for me to partake it  the fair pembroke attached herself particularly to ellinor and rose cecil lord burleighs second daughter professed an unbounded friendship for me i had so great a deference to the command of my lord as to withhold mine till time convinced me too feelingly she was incapable of abusing it she was almost a stranger at court as well as ourselves and brought up under a mother who abhorred it the death of that mother leaving her to the care of an ambitious father he flattered himself her beauty would win her a husband of merit ere she had gained courage to assert her own choice he was not mistaken in the first opinion the tender bloom both of her mind and person attached to her a thousand hearts but though in all other instances compliance itself in the article of marriage she refused to obey even the queen who consequently hated her this sad conformity of situation both were at liberty alike to lament and with the candor incident to youth i found it difficult to limit my lamentations our situations and tempers made us alike cultivate an attachment with lady arundell sir philips eldest sister who had long since retired to a seat of his on the banks of the thames upon the imprisonment of her lord with less shining qualifications than her more fair and fortunate sister lady arundel possessed a roman strength of soul beloved from childhood by elizabeth she might have remained a favorite even while her husband was a victim but she inexorably insisted on sharing his prison and when it soon after became his grave retired in an honorable poverty and owed her little income to her brothers bounty  thus in innocence and hallowed widowhood passed the days of this amiable woman who now enjoyed that first and last of human pleasures the seeing herself surrounded with friends although she had only merit to attach them  the resentment of philip the second of spain broke forth at this period and employed every ones thoughts more especially the queens with whom love was ever so subordinate a consideration that i flattered myself lord leicester would choose this opportunity to plan our future meetings and a little relieve me from the insupportable tortures of perpetual hypocrisy when now to complete my evils he for whom i renounced every distinction due to my sex and birth he in whom my soul was treasured regarded me with coldness and disdain i examined my own heart it did not make me a single reproach but the knowing i was wronged could not restore my peace i began to dread that satisfied love had given place to ambition that considering me as the only bar between himself and elizabeth who became more and more gracious to him he vainly regretted he had made me so  my hatred to the queen redoubled although she treated me much better than my sister as she always conceived ellinor his favorite because the vehicle of his sentiments to me yet though his displeasure was strongly marked it did not spring from indifference for at the same time he carefully avoided my conversation he incessantly watched my actions and was always in my view without ever being in my reach  it was impossible not to discern he must be jealous but alas suspicion soon makes the causes it seeks my blushes and the disorder of my air when any supposed lover addressed me confirmed his fatal prejudice and the impossibility of finding an opportunity to acquit myself almost distracted me fortune shortly after added the only aggravation my fate admitted  the fair rose cecil whose attachment i have mentioned had insensibly engaged my affections by the warmth of her own the pleasure i took in discoursing about my lord made me overlook for a time that she was equally unwearied of the topic but the eager manner in which she revived it while increasing sorrow buried his name in my heart at last opened my eyes i observed her more closely i saw the strong affection which impelled her to be near to him while her heightened color and universal agitation whenever he addressed her made the secret inclination of her heart but too obvious there are wives who would have seized this occasion to retort but she was so innocent i could not distrust her and was above appearing to do so some imaginary slight overcame a mind so delicate and one evening she indulged in her tears and unbosomed her whole heart in vain she said did years and circumstances divide her from lord leicester since she took more pleasure in silently admiring him than in being admired by the whole world  ah madam cried she how barbarous are hereditary hatreds exert yourself for me dearest matilda divest my lords mind of so narrow a prejudice assured that this obligation will double an attachment equally produced by your own merit and the family you spring from  what a proposal was this to a wife  to a wife did i say alas to a lover  a wild and extravagant lover  she embraced me and hid her tears and agitations on my bosom  a bosom which struggled with agonies yet more trying affected alike with her innocence and her fate i returned her caresses and wept like a mother over her child  she left me sufficient leisure to consider my answer i told her in pitying i showed her all the kindness in my power since the little influence i had with my lord was obvious enough i hinted that hers must ever be a hopeless attachment as the visible distinction of the queen made it very improbable lord leicester should marry any other woman not to mention the vast disparity between her years and his  she replied that she had considered this over so often that she had reconciled herself to every article  the queen thought more of war than marriage and surely if lord leicester could be brought to do justice to her heart her youth would never be considered as a fault  in short i easily understood that what she wished she was resolved to hope i dropped the subject but it was with infinite chagrin i beheld this lovely girl encourage a passion so many causes concurred to render hopeless in fact it did not long escape the queens notice and the unfortunate rose saw every body appear to be acquainted with her weakness but its object who showed a coldness toward her almost amounting to dislike to me she always flew for consolation and i frequently administered that i could not find  on so important an event as the expected invasion the english were all prepared to take arms lord leicester as their leader was already encamped and i parted with him in common with the other courtiers without the privilege of uttering a syllable that might give peace to his heart or my own the misery of my situation became intolerable when fear of my lords safety was added to every other fear and i resolved on an explanation whatever the consequence the natural ascendancy love and superior years gave him over me when present vanished with him i entreated him to suffer me by knowing to repair an involuntary fault and before it was too late recover an affection i could not long survive i conjured him to remember he was my all in this life and that if he continued to withhold his confidence i could only conclude he repented the having ever bestowed it and should finally give up all care of a being which was no longer dear to me when it ceased to be so to him  the equivocal turn of these expressions i thought would secure this letter even if intercepted from producing any evil consequence and while dubious how to convey it sir philip sidney demanded permission to take leave of me  not all the pangs i suffered through his love could rob him of my regard  the disguising it was all in my power to his care i committed this letter assured he might be trusted even with the truth and transported with the least mark of my confidence he promised all that lovers usually promise  no sooner was he gone than i remembered the illchosen messenger might render lord leicester insensible to the contents of a letter blistered with my tears  alas when once we enter the labyrinth of possibilities to which jealousy is the fatal sentinel hardly ever can we extricate ourselves the gentle consolations of ellinor were all my fate had left me but for her sickness must have been the consequence of sorrow but during the hours of retirement for one apartment held us she omitted nothing to sooth or strengthen my mind  incomparable sister what a soul was thine oh why were tears my only tribute to thy boundless generosity  at length lord brook arrived express from the camp and took the first opportunity to deliver me a letter from my lord he said i had found means to convert the accuser into the criminal and conjured me to pardon a mean jealousy which punished itself my too ready obedience to the queens command he added and the obvious pleasure i had found in his nephews conversation had poisoned every moment of his life since i came to court sydney talents his equal years his generous disposition all conspired to make him a formidable rival i am not meanly jealous of your person continued he  no matilda it is your heart of which i am a miser nor do i wish you mine whatever your loss may cost me longer than you wish yourself so under the cruel circumstances imposed on us less might excusably alarm a heart which has so severely suffered for its candor yet too just in my nature to consider that as your fault which must have proved our mutual misfortune i resolved to bury in my bosom its killing suggestions and cease to persecute you with a passion which you dared not repel however reluctant your heart but that which would have made a common mind jealous has eradicated the weakness from mine for nothing but spotless innocence could have made you choose out my imaginary rival as the vehicle of your sentiments truth and conviction flash upon my bewildered senses and love breathes through every invaluable line of your dear letter  how how shall i ever recompense you for my injustice  i can no longer live without humbling myself at your feet and receiving a pardon i fear i shall never deserve i have at length resolved to confide our secret to lady arundell  sorrow and experience have surely taught her discretion her house is the only retired one i know of to which you can come with safety appear indisposed and the queen will not suspect more in the request of passing some time with my niece than the obvious one of being unable to support the hurry and fatigue of the times i will prepare lady arundell for your reception and snatch the first moment consistent with my duty to fly and enliven your solitude the embrace that confirmed you mine was less dear to me than that which will seal your forgiveness  oh my love ended he who could endure the tortures of doubt were not the moment of reconciliation so exquisite a transport  ah true indeed for all the pleafures of my life faded before that moment i seemed to tread in air and had hardly command enough of myself to affect languor and sickness elizabeth who always found herself fatigued with indisposition because not subject to it herself readily consented to my spending a month with lady arundell who received me with infinite pleasure i found she had been only apprised of my marriage and that my lord still withheld the secret of my birth she allotted me a magnificent apartment which concluded with a saloon opening to the thames this noble room was embellished with valuable paintings some of which were not yet finished and a painter of eminence frequently attended to complete them this man was employed by her to take a picture of me which might fill up the interval of my lords absence as well as agreeably surprise him i was one day dressed gaily for this purpose and waiting in the saloon i perceived the man enter but how was i surprised to see him a moment after at my feet i turned indignantly toward him ah heavens it was my lord my leicester himself who safe in that disguise which he and lady arundell had agreed on was to forbid the painter whenever he could visit us with safety we learnt from him news of the utmost importance that heaven itself had fought for elizabeth and defeated an armada her power could ill have coped with this intelligence by securing lord leicester joyed even my heart and the pride of forgiving being added to the pleasure of loving life could bestow no more on me  i had now learnt to be beforehand with suspicion and as sir philip charmed with the opportunity of seeing me out of the chilling circle of a court was almost a daily visitor i resolved to end his hopes even at the risque of an implied confidence i could hardly sometimes forbear weeping to see him thus pursuing a shadow and wasting a glorious youth  oh sidney you was worthy of a better fate and could i accuse myself of embittering yours i should be a wretch indeed  but no i honored revered admired you nay had i not already exchanged my heart it must have been yours  you whom so many women have loved and none no none were ever known to hate  having formed my resolution i permitted him one day to lead me to the terrace overjoyed with the distinction he entertained me with a thousand pleasant sallies  ah is there a more pungent sensation in nature than the necessity fortune sometimes imposes on generous minds to afflict each other i opened my lips  the truth hovered on them  but it was not till he himself tenderly pressed me to add language to my expressive looks and confide to him the sentiments i had endeavored to suppress that i could speak alas sir philip cried i why am i reduced to tell you your merit and your attachment are by a combination of eventsmy only misfortunes  what do you utter madam cried he  is this possible   a painful truth returned i which the highest esteem for you could alone extort  i am sensible of the influence of elizabeth but believe me i am among those who cannot obey her   obey her returned he does the fair matilda know so little of me as to imagine i would owe her hand to regal authority  no madam sidney would not on such terms he may proudly say deign to accept even yourself while my passion was only my own misfortune i thought myself at liberty to indulge it but the moment it becomes yours pride honor sensibility all ordain eternal silence  yet surely added he in an affecting tone a heart like mine might hope to know the fatality which thus wounds it  by the love you have professed for me cried i seizing his hand in turn withenergy by the honor which actuates you toward every human being i conjure you press no farther into a secret i have no right to reveal  if i had   if you had  ah lovely generous candid matilda  no i will not invade any mystery you think it necessary to conceal since my hard fate deprives my youth of its sole charm and hope  yet surely time  ah may i hope nothing from time  age would steal upon me unobserved were you but to allow me expectation  why why cried i weeping am i compelled to a half confidence in a heart so noble  but be assured sir philip time can never unite us by any other bonds than those of esteem and surely every day must strengthen those  i think i understand you replied he fixing his eyes on mine with a melancholy firmness  and shall i expose you to the ungoverned passions of the queen  no since i am never  since esteem is to be the only bond between us  he paused and kneeling kissed both hands as if taking an everlasting leave  when next you see me  though i wring every fiber of this heart  when next you see me i will feel entitled to all your esteem  rising he quitted me and walked toward his barge with sad and irresolute steps frequently looking back as if he was ready to return and recant his declaration but the barge swiftly conveying him toward london i gave free vent to the tears i had with infinite difficulty suppressed  the following evening lord leicester had promised to pass with us he arrived with an air of satisfaction it was impossible i could avoid sharing even while ignorant of its cause who would rely on the constancy of a lover said he with a happy smile since even my matildas charms could not retain my nephews attachment he has solicited the queens consent to marry miss walsingham you know her love for him but his sudden return of it amazes all acquainted with both elizabeth calls him a whimsical fool but does not care to offend sir francis by refusing her consent however displeased at his thus matching himself  the marriage will be celebrated in a few days and my matilda is invited to her rivals triumph  ah no i should have returned had his jealousy not taught me caution thy matilda has a triumph of her own to enjoy alas i now understood sidneys parting words and my heart floated in tears tinctured so strongly with every settiment but love that i could hardly distinguish whether that had not a share in the sublimity of the moment  my lord pressed me to return to court previous to the ceremony he even gave o it i meant to do so and this i only understood by a line which accompanied the formal invitations sent to me and lady arundel ah madam added sir philip in the postcript is it true that you return ere my sacrifice is completed  no i will not return sighed i a husbands claims extend no farther and humanity resumes its rights  the dread that malicious observers might once more pry into lord leicesters moments of retirement at last conquered the reluctance i felt at returning to court i saw in defiance of danger selfindulgence continually increased upon him at first a few hours of the evening were all he devoted to me and lady arundel shortly after he came later and passed the night he then pleaded fear of disgracing one or the other and lost whole days  ah could thou wonder thy former marriage was discoverd said i often to myself after exhausting all my rhetoric in vain to drive him from me  oh leicester what was the wrath of elizabeth then to that she would feel could she explore the whole of this secret i entreated ellinor to write me word my absence was much remaeked and at last returned once more a voluntary victim  a sad and silent admiration was the only expression of my features at sight of sir philip he sighed at the compliment indispensable due which his bride received with a cold contempt to a countenance naturally harsh and inquisitive however beautiful miss walsingham had always united a temper proud passionate and peevish her strong attachment to sir philip had in all instances where he was concerned subdued for a time or veiled those failings he could not be ignorant of a passion he had so often been rallied upon and the moment he found it was not possible for him to make his own choice he generously resolved to indulge hers his motives could not be doubted as all the court knew she had no fortune and every body saw it was in her power to become the happiest of women  but alas it was not in her nature  far from seeking to win upon his heart by a silent indulgence of all his little foibles she wearied him with importunate fondness and whenever business or weariness drove him from home employed the interval in fomenting violent passions with which she seldom failed to overwhelm him on his return incapable of bending so noble a mind to the little triumph of conquering a low one and as incapable of regulating his life bythe narrow rules she would have laid down for him he saw no alternative but the pursuit of glory and solicited to be sent to his government of flushing  oh pardon me beloved leicester the bitter tears i so often shed for the gallant sidney  ah why had he not chosen my sister she was free she had a hand a heart a person worthy his she would have crowned his days with happiness and his grave with honor alas in the weak pride of humanity we seek to new model the distinctions of nature and insolently oppose our limited faculties to omniscience  new disturbances in the netherlands now obliged lord leicester as commander in chief to accompany his nephew i saw them both depart with a reluctance so extreme as foreboded some calamity the generous sidney understood my silence my conflicts my wishes rely on my cares  rely on my honor said he at parting and be assured my breast must be cold as the earth which then will cover it ere that feels one wound which lodges the fair matildas heart  oh let me worship the wife ordination of providence if amidst all the evils fate and imprudence have overwhelmed me with i still weakly feel a regret at pronouncing a last adieu what must i have endured had i been the chosen but why by such remembrance disturb her i love  yet dear is the sensibility adored matilda  oh let the tears which now enrich your cheeks be wholly sydneys  and they were wholly sidneys a sad presentiment heightened the anguish of his parting by telling me we never more should meet it remains not for my weak pen to paint the heroic death of sir philip sidney it has employed the noblest even envy and malice dropped involuntary tears while friendship was exhausted in vain lamentations as to me i set no bounds to me sorrow and every reason which once confined my esteem for him to my own bosom dying with him i mourned as for a darling brother and thus perpetuated the secret hatred of his window who weak woman envied me even the melancholy privilege of bewailing him  anxiety for the fate of lord leicester which this event must necessarily excite too soon gave way to a still nearer care in vain i imputed my continual indispositions to grief time confirmed an apprehension which had frequently alarmed me immediately after my lords departure i found but too plainly that imprudent love had produce a new misfortune and that i bore about a living testimony of my marriage from which the worst consequences might arise  ah unhappy babe thy mothers anguish foreran thy birth deprived by a sad combination of circumstances of a welcome from thy mother throbs of terror were thy first symptoms of existence this accumulation of misfortune seemed to benumb me reason i knew not what to resolve on i saw myself almost in my royal mothers melancholy predicament when i was born alas perhaps i may tomorrow be entirely so i would cry to myself let me fly then while yet my prison gates are open  the eye of elizabeth became yet more dreadful to me i fancied every moment it dived into my heart and death for ever seemed to surround me in forms yet dearer to me than my own  my sisters better sense easily discerned how dangerous and how vain a project flight must prove you she would say whose timid heart shrinks even from those it loves who have hitherto trod the most safe and confined circle who hardly know what loneliness means how in this situation can you encounter the perils of the road the insolence of strangers the dangers of the sea and the terrors of a camp even admitting all these happily past in following lord leicester you only change the object of elizabeths resentment from which distance may not shield either you or your lord  oh by how many ways may she revenge herself  leicester it is true loves you but in you at present are centered future distinction pomp and a variety of pleasures never yet indifferent to him  these will be the least of his losses and believe me if the secret transpires that it is his own way will one day prove your dearest consolation  and surely my dear matilda will not entirely forget a sister whose only joy or sorrow she yet has been  the last tender consideration entirely subdued a spark of displeasure excited by the former i submitted my wavering resolutions to her direction and wrote an anonymous letter descriptive of my situation which with innumerable charges lady arundel delivered to lord brook the distinguished friend of sir philip sidney to convey into lord leicesters own hands that amiable woman became the confident of my present fear and with unwearied kindness conjured me to rely upon her conduct  in her house she assured me of an asylum and in herself of another mother for the unfortunate infant i felt all the indulgence of heaven in providing me such an unexpected resource and almost wished i had not made my lord a partaker in cares he was so little able to relieve by her advice i summoned courage to appear again in the court we seldom said the prudent lady arundel criticize those we see every day novelty alone attracts curiosity and if you are absent any time some eye of the many your return will attract may pierce through every veil into the cause i will carefully watch and when necessary warn you to retreat  i found on my return the fair rose cecil had quitted london by the command of her father who was highly incensed alike at her refusal of a very advantageous match and the passion which caused it the loss of her society which at another time i should have lamented became an advantage in the present delicate conjuncture i no longer durst wish for companions i could not keep at a distance and i hoped ere we met again i should be more at liberty to cultivate the attachment she professed to me while time would have conquered that unfortunate one which alone could interfere with it  i counted the moments ere a letter could arrive from my lord  in vain ellinor assured me the time was insufficient had lord brooks journey met with no delay we were talking this over one morning when a loud knocking at the door much earlier than usual startled us both how was i amazed a moment after to see my lord rush in booted and with that disordered dress and air which showed him just arrived pale and speechless i threw myself into his arms and made no other return to his embraces than by sighs and tears while ellinor struck with the singularity of his conduct repeatedly demanded how he came there  to see to save my love cried he fixing his eyes on mine with unutterable fondness will not my matilda bless me with another self and could i be such a savage to leave her to face the pain the grief the danger alone dry your tears my most beloved am not i with you i whom you have made the happiest of mankind i who was born but to worship you  imprudent cried i striking my own bosom  alas my love how is it i see you here it seemed as if reason like light pierced at once through the chaos of his mind absorbed in the single consideration of my situation he had posted to england without resting a moment on the receipt of my letter nor could find a cause might satisfy even indifferent observers much more the jealous soul of elizabeth  ah heavens we are now indeed ruined cried i wringing my hands the implacable enemy of my peace will become so of yours and every malicious eye will now be fixed on her who sinks under the most casual observation  oh that the silent mansion in which i so long vegetated had been my grave since i quitted it but to become a misfortune to the man i love  why will my matilda returned lord leicester with a noble mildness monopolize love and generosity perhaps i have yet sufficient influence over elizabeth to persuade her fears for her welfare alone brought me home but even if not shall i refuse to bear a single mortification for her sake who has borne so many for mine  the worst she can discover is our marriage your birth is beyond the power of malice summon all your fortitude my love and let us concert every measure necessary to our mutual safety for i will take every care of myself you would wish me never more i solemnly swear will your husband leave you dreams of fortune and favor fade away before the realities of life let us with our darling sister seek a shelter in france i want not the means of affluence independent of the queen let us then avow our union and thus convert my dear matildas tenderness always her first charm alike into her virtue and her happiness there safe from the vengeance of elizabeth we may without fear or dishaonor quietly await her dissolution imagine my love the exquisite transport of encircling the throne of your mother with lovely pledges of our union so while empire fills every power of her imagination nature may throb through every pulse to her heart  the fond fond vision floated alike through my brain lord leicester indifferent to the opinion of the queen resolved to wait on her without entering into the reasons of his return which was already known through the court elizabeth had for some time kept her chamber nevertheless she permitted him an audience ere she left her bed i knew her capricious temper and while meditating what line she meant to pursue several of her ladies then in waiting came out of her chamber the last of whom told me it was her pleasure i alone should witness her conversation with lord leicester conscience shivered my whole frame and i entered the apartment as a condemned wretch would that where the rack was preparing lord leicester equally surprised pointed out by an expressive glance a place where the closed curtain would prevent her remarking the changes of my countenance and thither more dead than alive i took my station leicester said she in a languishing voice thy unexpected return upon the news of my indisposition is a fresh mark of thy watchful duty and unwearied passion i have long resisted that tender inclination which distinguished thee in earliest youth but now when i have no potent enemy to fear i may crown thy passion and indulge my own without endangering myself or the state  a new plot i have discovered to release mary renders it absolutely necessary i should by marrying cut off her hopes and those of her party i shall now in turn surprise them long have i weighed the business in my mind and frequently determined to recall thee but thy return by evincing the strength of thy tenderness demands an immediate recompense  take then at last the solongwithheld hand of elizabeth who thus resigns all authority over thee except that thy heart gives her she paused extending a withered hand lord leicester confused beyond all expression and expecting me to drop senseless every moment hesitated a few broken sentences of faint gratitude and kissed the fatal hand she no longer drew from him fixing a moment after his eyes on me and oh how comprehensive was the look  i perceive by thy trembling my lord continued she how much i have surprised thee recover thyself  my election of thee is expected by every one and shall be immediate to mortify mary i find myself well enough to quit my chamber it is my intention thou should lead me hence this evening and by taking a regal seat under the same canopy prepare the kingdom for the declaration i purpose making tomorrow the ceremony of espousal will demand time and splendour but never more shall thou quit her who finds after trying every effort it is impossible to live without thee  there are instances in nature of timid beings whom darkness merely would deprive of their senses who yet on desperate emergencies encounter the jarring elements without shrinking  i who had till that moment been composed of tears and trembling now found i must no longer hang a helpless weight on the heart of my husband and blessing the caprice which made her select me as the only witness of her dotage i leant against the tapestry and endeavored by a selfcollected air to arm him for the occasion i had the misery to see his fortitude diminish in proportion as mine increased and that after struggling with his feelings till almost convulsed he was obliged to quit the presence of the queen precipitately and scarcely could his failing limbs convey him thence the ladies before dismissed now entering the queen called the lady latimer to her bedside and i followed the footsteps of my lord  heavens and earth cried i on looking round in vain for him what is now to become of me even ellinor my only comfort fate had cruelly robbed me of nor was she to be found throughout the whole palace ere the tumults of my mind could subside into recollection i was informed lady arundels barge waited to convey me to chelsea where she was greatly indisposed easily imagining this was a feint of lord leicesters to unfold his sentiments to me in safety i hastened into it and was conveyed to the fatal saloon on the banks of the thames once consecrated to love and pleasure only i found lord leicester alone with his niece measuring the apartment with unequal steps and a distracted air he took my hand and softening with pity for my situation led me to a seat and threw himself by me his tears bedewed the hand he kissed  support yourself still my soul said he the crisis is come unawares and fate is beforehand with our intentions elizabeth indeed has surprised me but as her passion however weak and absurd is generous it now stabs me to the heart  to suffer her to publish it to the world to stamp with ridicule my sovereign my benefactress would no doubt awaken her most mortal hatred and rob me of my own esteem  matilda my love can you support the truth and all the truth  did i not tell you that one day or another your anxious wish of seeing your mother free might interfere with your own happiness it has indeed for even at the moment the queen in tender confidence imparted to me a plot to release mary she meant to obviate by her own marriage my secret soul upbraided me as an abettor if not a principal in that plot  happy in the idea of surprising you with its event and far from expecting so extraordinary a one on the part of the queen i find by papers lord burleigh gave me ere i entered her apartment that the enthusiastic assistants of mary premeditated the martyrdom of elizabeth and have reason to imagine she by this time knows the man whom she was willing to level with herself has been capable of so infamous a concealment nay how do i know how far i may be included in the barbarity she may be led to believe the hand to which she gave her own an hour ago was armed with a dagger and ready every moment to use it  my life is at stake and oh what is infinitely dearer every virtue which once i hoped would long survive me cancelled by ingratitude  the agitations of his mind almost deprived him of his senses  i threw myself at his feet  oh if ever the unfortunate matilda was dear to you cried i now show it  now struggle to endure for her  has she ever feared to do so for you it is in vain to hope any thing from elizabeth as circumstances appear she must condemn you  already i see you in the tower  i see those gates open to receive you that have entombed so many alike noble and innocent if you would have the babe its mothers anguish almost urges into a premature existence  oh if you would have it see the light of heaven plunge her no farther in despair  fly now now this very moment while we have yet the power while you live your innocence may yet be vindicated and while you live i may perhaps be able to do so  lord leicester shaking his head gave a deep sigh  a sigh more soulpiercing than the most violent agitation  you know not what you say my love returned he  even now in all probability my house is surrounded and expresses dispatched to close every port in the kingdom should i attempt to leave it and hardly is there a rustic in england to whom my features are unknown one expedient alone remains and greatly would that soften the stroke you are neither exposed to my danger nor like me the marked of every eye  flight is still in your power and in you i shall still think myself safe  put yourself under the protection  never cried i starting up with vehemence i am your wife that holy title i will maintain before men and angels and nothing  nothing i in turn solemnly swear shall part us i will with watchful duty share the prison to which i shall always remember i have condemned you and oh if your fate is accelerated by my means be assured i alike will share your grave  one hope of safety is yet yours cried lady arundel how could it escape you that the recess may still supply a sad and dear asylum till we can judge of circumstances  the thought had indeed occurred to me but i dared not name the memorial of the present misfortune i examined his eyes in silence my gentle love my sweet matilda can i resolve to grieve thee sighed he speak would you wish me to conduct you thither my tears only allowed me to pronounce yes yet how resumed he is it possible  how can you support the inevitable fatigues of the journey with the addition of its fears in your present situation i can support any thing every thing sobbed i inarticulately but the idea of your danger yes my love added he kissing away my tears i will if possible live to reward your unexampled tenderness lady arundel think for us suggest the mode of our departure it should be sudden cried our generous friend and how can either be sufficiently disguised or how shall we find proper attendants we will have none with us returned lord leicester i rely on your care to summon le val from kenilworth castle he is master of the secret of the recess whither he can follow us and convey with care at different times the treasure hoarded in the castle while with the venerable fosterfather of my love we wait your farther informations  ah how happy was it added i your fondness obliged me to ride now can i follow you fearless of any thing but elizabeth supply me dear lady arundell with the homely garb of a servant my lord must have recourse to the disguise of a painter invented and worn on a happier occasion yet if even i hardly knew him in it who else shall discover him oh haste my darling friend secure us the fleetest horses  i seem every moment environed with the guards of elizabeth  when shall we be any thing but a trouble to you  the amiable lady arundell provided all in the manner required and we set off immediately ere sunset we reached a peasants cot near st albans where my lord insisted we might with safety take a little rest which indeed i greatly required accustomed to pass and repass that road for ever he fancied he remembered every face he saw and i too surely thought all remembered him our rustic host and his wife seemed just to have understanding enough to connect the idea of mystery with us and i roused my lord ere break of day secretly resolving no more to enter a house till we reached our asylum even the profuse recompense my lord bestowed on the peasants rather according with his soul than his appearance excited their suspicions they pressed us to stay in a manner which pointed mine and we departed with a precipitation which i dare say confirmed theirs pursuing our journey by roads little frequented lord leicester being perfectly acquainted with the ground i went through incredible fatigues without complaint riding the whole day with no other refreshment than a draught of new milk supplied by a girl as we passed along till as the sun was declining we reached a brow which commanded st vincents abbey at the well known prospect my heart dilated  my eyes wandered over the whole with sensations our first home only can excite  nature seemed to tinge the woods with deeper verdure  the translucent stream meandered in majestic silence undisturbed by noisy bargemen  innocence seemed to rest under the shade of the willows which every where fringed its margin and the empurpled sun diffused the repose he seemed hastening to partake  an invincible charm took possession of my heart and even the sense of misfortune was for the moment suspended  here cried i checking my horse here we shall be safe  ah more than safe here we may be happy  why why cannot those hours return when first we met those hours of undescribable felicity  this landscape then bounded our wishes in its narrow circle is contained all necessary to existence in ourselves all essential to happiness but society that first of blessings brings with it evils death only can cure and the venerable father anthony with what joy  ah with what sorrow will he receive us  forewarned even by our presence of affliction he will hardly dare to indulge the rapture of a moment  every sentiment and sensation mingling thus in my mind filled the interval ere we arrived at the spot where my heart recognized the minutest object alighting at some distance lord leicester fastened the horses in an obscure part of the wood and we proceeded on foot to the hermits cave evening began now to gloom over the hemisphere  i had before agreed not to open my lips till my lord had by degrees revealed himself to father anthony whose enfeebled senses might not be able to resist the surprise but how did that return upon ourselves when a voice with which we were unacquainted replied to us without opening the door heartstruck i caught the arm of lord leicester who eagerly enquired after the hermit he has been dead these ten days returned the man and is interred among the scroope family in the vault of st vincents abbey i am placed here to protect the few effects he left behind till his relations shall direct what is to be done with them  and thus vanish our hopes of safety peace and pleasure sighed i turning disconsolately from the cave oh fainted anthony i have now no tears for thee and that loss i lately should have shed floods for is now heard with indifference where wretched wanderers as we are where now can we betake ourselves had we staid in london friendship nay interest might have sheltered us here i am as well known as you are there and the possessors of st vincents abbey will infallibly discover both nay we know not who those are and whether we might not throw ourselves into the power of our worst enemies  alas my love what do you suffer for my sake it is in vain to affect strength nature fails and i must rest if only on the damp earth  gracious god exclaimed lord leicester supporting me in his arms how have we deserved this accumulation of evils let us wind through the wood who knows my matilda but providence has left the gate of the tomb open to shelter us it is plain the peasant who inhabits the cave is not acquainted with the secrets of father anthony and in all probability that of the recess died with him oh struggle a little but a little my love something bids me believe heaven will yet protect us  though faint between want of nourishment and excessive fatigue i yet strove to follow my lord but did it so slowly that night entirely involved us ere we reached the tomb long custom however enabled me to lead him aright  it is open cried he in a transport of joy come my love and let me assist you to enter  he did so but hardly was i within it ere i found myself violently seized by several persons who instantly deprived me of the power of utterance had heaven allowed it but agony and horror so entirely overcame me that i sunk senseless in their arms  end of the first volume
