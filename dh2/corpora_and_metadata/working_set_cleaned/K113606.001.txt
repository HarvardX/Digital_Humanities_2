an history of the earth and animated nature  by oliver goldsmith  in eight volumes  vol i  london printed for j nourse in the strand bookseller to his majesty mdcclxxiv  preface natural history considered in its utmost extent comprehends two objects first that of discovering ascertaining and naming all the various productions of nature secondly that of describing the properties manners and relations which they bear to us and to each other the first which is the most difficult part of this science is systematical dry mechanical and incomplete the second is more amusing exhibits new pictures to the imagination and improves our relish for existence by widening the prospect of nature around us  both however are necessary to those who would understand this pleasing science in its utmost extent the first care of every enquirer no doubt should be to see to visit and examine every object before he pretends to inspect its habitudes or its history from seeing and observing the thing itself he is most naturally led to speculate upon its uses its delights or its inconveniences  numberless obstructions however are found in this part of his pursuit that frustrate his diligence and retard his curiosity the objects in nature are so many and even those of the same kind are exhibited in such a variety of forms that the enquirer finds himself lost in the exuberance before him and like a man who attempts to count the stars unassisted by art his powers are all distracted in the barren superfluity  to remedy this embarrasment artificial systems have been devised which grouping into masses those parts of nature more nearly resembling each other refer the enquirer for the name of the single object he desires to know to some one of those general distributions where it is to be found by further examination  if for instance a man should in his walks meet with an animal the name and consequently the history of which he desires to know he is taught by systematic writers of natural history to examine its most obvious qualities whether a quadrupede a bird a fish or an insect having determined it for explanation sake to be an insect he examines whether it has wings if he finds it possessed of these he is taught to examine whether it has two or four if possessed of four he is taught to observe whether the two upper wings are of a shelly hardness and serve as cases to those under them if he finds the wings composed in this manner he is then taught to pronounce that this insect is one of the beetle kind of the beetle kind there are three different classes distinguished from each other by their feelers he examines the insect before him and finds that the feelers are clavated or knobbed at the ends of beetles with feelers thus formed there are ten kinds and among those he is taught to look for the precise name of that which is before him if for instance the knob be divided at the ends and the belly be streaked with white it is no other than the dor or the maybug an animal the noxious qualities of which give it a very distinguished rank in the history of the insect creation in this manner a system of natural history may in some measure be compared to a dictionary of words both are solely intended to explain the names of things but with this difference that in the dictionary of words we are led from the name of the thing to its definition whereas in the system of natural history we are led from the definition to find out the name  such are the efforts of writers who have composed their works with great labor and ingenuity to direct the learner in his progress through nature and to inform him of the name of every animal plant or fossil substance that he happens to meet with but it would be only deceiving the reader to conceal the truth which is that books alone can never teach him this art in perfection and the solitary student can never succeed without a master and a previous knowledge of many of the objects in nature his book will only serve to confound and disgust him few of the individual plants or animals that he may happen to meet with are in that precise state of health or that exact period of vegetation from whence their descriptions were taken perhaps he meets the plant only with leaves but the systematic writer has described it in flower perhaps he meets the bird before it has moulted its first feathers while the systematic description was made in its state of full perfection he thus ranges without an instructor confused and with sickening curiosity from subject to subject till at last he gives up the pursuit in the multiplicity of his disappointments  some practice therefore much instruction and diligent reading are requisite to make a ready and expert naturalist who shall be able even by the help of a system to find out the name of every object he meets with but when this tedious though requisite part of study is attained nothing but delight and variety attend the rest of his journey wherever he travels like a man in a country where he has many friends he meets with nothing but acquaintances and allurements in all the stages of his way the mere uninformed spectator passes on in gloomy solitude but the naturalist in every plant in every insect and every pebble finds something to entertain his curiosity and excite his speculation  from hence it appears that a system may be considered as a dictionary in the study of nature the ancients however who have all written most delightfully on this subject seem entirely to have rejected those humble and mechanical helps to science they contented themselves with seizing upon the great outlines of history and passing over what was common as not worth the detail they only dwelt upon what was new great and surprising and sometimes even warmed the imagination at the expense of truth such of the moderns as revived this science in europe undertook the task more methodically though not in a manner so pleasing aldrovandus gesner and johnson seemed desirous of uniting the entertaining and rich descriptions of the ancients with the dry and systematic arrangement of which they were the first projectors this attempt however was extremely imperfect as the great variety of nature was as yet but very inadequately known nevertheless by attempting to carry on both objects at once first of directing us to the name of the thing and then giving the detail of its history they drew out their works into a tedious and unreasonable length and thus mixing incompatible aims they have left their labors rather to be occasionally consulted than read with delight by posterity  the later moderns with that good sense which they have carried into every other part of science have taken a different method in cultivating natural history they have been content to give not only the brevity but also the dry and disgusting air of a dictionary to their systems ray klin brisson and linnaeus have had only one aim that of pointing out the object in nature of discovering its name and where it was to be found in those authors that treated of it in a more prolix and satisfactory manner thus natural history at present is carried on in two distinct and separate channels the one serving to lead us to the thing the other conveying the history of the thing as supposing it already known  the following natural history is written with only such an attention to system as serves to remove the readers embarrassments and allure him to proceed it can make no pretensions in directing him to the name of every object he meets with that belongs to works of a very different kind and written with very different aims it will fully answer my design if the reader being already possessed of the name of any animal shall find here a short though satisfactory history of its habitudes its subsistence its manners its friendships and hostilities my aim has been to carry on just as much method as was sufficient to shorten my descriptions by generalizing them and never to follow order where the art of writing which is but another name for good sense informed me that it would only contribute to the readers embarrassment  still however the reader will perceive that i have formed a kind of system in the history of every part of animated nature directing myself by the great obvious distinctions that she herself seems to have made which though too few to point exactly to the name are yet sufficient to illuminate the subject and remove the readers perplexity mr buffon indeed who has brought greater talents to this part of learning than any other man has almost entirely rejected method in classing quadrupedes this with great deference to such a character appears to me running into the opposite extreme and as some moderns have of late spent much time great pains and some learning all to very little purpose in systematic arrangement he seems so much disgusted by their trifling but ostentatious efforts that he describes his animals almost in the order they happen to come before him this want of method seems to be a fault but he can lose little by a criticism which every dull man can make or by an error in arrangement from which the dullest are the most usually free  in other respects as far as this able philosopher has gone i have taken him for my guide the warmth of his style and the brilliancy of his imagination are inimitable leaving him therefore without a rival in these and only availing myself of his information i have been content to describe things in my own way and though many of the materials are taken from him yet i have added retrenched and altered as i thought proper it was my intention at one time whenever i differed from him to have mentioned it at the bottom of the page but this occured so often that i soon found it would look like envy and might perhaps convict me of those very errors which i was wanting to lay upon him i have therefore as being every way his debtor concealed my dissent where my opinion was different but wherever i borrow from him i take care at the bottom of the page to express my obligations but though my obligations to this writer are many they extend but to the smallest part of the work as he has hitherto completed only the history of quadrupedes i was therefore left to my own reading alone to make out the history of birds fishes and insects of which the arrangement was so difficult and the necessary information so widely diffused and so obscurely related when found that it proved by much the most laborious part of the undertaking thus having made use of mr buffons lights in the first part of the work i may with some share of confidence recommend it to the public but what shall i say to that part where i have been entirely left without his assistance as i would affect neither modesty nor confidence it will be sufficient to say that my reading upon this part of the subject has been very extensive and that i have taxed my scanty circumstances in procuring books which are on this subject of all others the most expensive in consequence of this industry i here offer a work to the public of a kind which has never been attempted in ours or any other modern language that i know of the ancients indeed and pliny in particular have anticipated me in the present manner of treating natural history like those historians who describe the events of a campaign they have not condescended to give the private particulars of every individual that formed the army they were content with characterizing the generals and describing their operations while they left it to meaner hands to carry the musterroll i have followed their manner rejecting the numerous fables which they adopted and adding the improvements of the moderns which are so numerous that they actually make up the bulk of natural history  the delight which i found in reading pliny first inspired me with the idea of a work of this nature having a taste rather classical than scientific and having but little employed myself in turning over the dry labors of modern systemmakers my earliest intention was to translate this agreeable writer and by the help of a commentary to make my work as amusing as i could let us dignify natural history never so much with the grave appellation of a useful science yet still we must confess that it is the occupation of the idle and the speculative more than of the busy and the ambitious part of mankind my intention therefore was to treat what i then conceived to be an idle subject in an idle manner and not to hedge round plain and simple narratives with hard words accumulated distinctions ostentatious learning and disquisitions that produced no conviction upon the appearance however of mr buffons work i dropped my former plan and adopted the present being convinced by his manner that the best imitation of the ancients was to write from our own feelings and to imitate nature  it will be my chief pride therefore if this work may be found an innocent amusement for those who have nothing else to employ them or who require a relaxation from labor professed naturalists will no doubt find it superficial and yet i should hope that even these will discover hints and remarks gleaned from various reading not wholly trite or elementary i would wish for their approbation but my chief ambition is to drag up the obscure and gloomy learning of the cell to open inspection to strip it from its garb of austerity and to show the beauties of that form which only

nature are merely to gratify the importunities of sensual appetite and to neglect the contemplation of things barely satisfied with their enjoyment the beauties of nature and all the wonders of creation have but little charms for a being taken up in obviating the wants of the day and anxious for precarious subsistence  our philosophers therefore who have testified such surprise at the want of curiosity in the ignorant seem not to consider that they are usually employed in making provisions of a more important nature in providing rather for the necessities than the amusements of life it is not till our more pressing wants are sufficiently supplied that we can attend to the calls of curiosity so that in every age scientific refinement has been the latest effort of human industry  but human curiosity though at first slowly excited being at last possessed of leisure for indulging its propensity becomes one of the greatest amusements of life and gives higher satisfactions than what even the senses can afford a man of this disposition turns all nature into a magnificent theater replete with objects of wonder and surprise and fitted up chiefly for his happiness and entertainment he industriously examines all things from the minutest insect to the most finished animal and when his limited organs can no longer make the disquisition he sends out his imagination upon new enquiries  nothing therefore can be more august and striking than the idea which his reason aided by his imagination furnishes of the universe around him astronomers tell us that this earth which we inhabit forms but a very minute part in that great assemblage of bodies of which the world is composed it is a million of times less than the sun by which it is enlightened the planets also which like it are subordinate to the suns influence exceed the earth one thousand times in magnitude these which were at first supposed to wander in the heavens without any fixed path and that took their name from their apparent deviations have long been found to perform their circuits with great exactness and strict regularity they have been discovered as forming with our earth a system of bodies circulating round the sun all obedient to one law and impelled by one common influence  modern philosophy has taught us to believe that when the great author of nature began the work of creation he chose to operate by second causes and that suspending the constant exertion of his power he endued matter with a quality by which the universal economy of nature might be continued without his immediate assistance this quality is called attraction a sort of approximating influence which all bodies whether terrestrial or celestial are found to possess and which in all increases as the quantity of matter in each increases the sun by far the greatest body in our system is of consequence possessed of much the greatest share of this attracting power and all the planets of which our earth is one are of course entirely subject to its superior influence were this power therefore left uncontrolled by any other the sun must quickly have attracted all the bodies of our celestial system to itself but it is equably counteracted by another power of equal efficacy namely a progressive force which each planet received when it was impelled forward by the divine architect upon its first formation the heavenly bodies of our system being thus acted upon by two opposing powers namely by that of attraction which draws them toward the sun and that of impulsion which drives them strait forward into the great void of space they pursue a track between these contrary directions and each like a stone whirled about in a sling obeying two opposite forces circulates round its great center of heat and motion  in this manner therefore is the harmony of our planetary system preserved the sun in the midst gives heat and light and circular motion to the planets which surround it mercury venus the earth mars jupiter and saturn perform their constant circuits at different distances each taking up a time to complete its revolutions proportioned to the greatness of the circle which it is to describe the lesser planets also which are attendants upon some of the greater are subject to the same laws they circulate with the same exactness and are in the same manner influenced by their respective centres of motion  besides those bodies which make a part of our peculiar system and which may be said to reside within its great circumference there are others that frequently come among us from the most distant tracts of space and that seem like dangerous intruders upon the beautiful simplicity of nature these are comets whose appearance was once so terrible to mankind and the theory of which is so little understood at present all we know is that their number is much greater than that of the planets and that like these they roll in orbits in some measure obedient to solar influence astronomers have endeavored to calculate the returning periods of many of them but experience has not as yet confirmed the veracity of their investigations indeed who can tell when those wanderers have made their excursions into other worlds and distant systems what obstacles may be found to oppose their progress to accelerate their motions or retard their return  but what we have hitherto attempted to sketch is but a small part of that great fabric in which the deity has thought proper to manifest his wisdom and omnipotence there are multitudes of other bodies dispersed over the face of the heavens that lie too remote for examination these have no motion such as the planets are found to possess and are therefore called fixed stars and from their extreme brilliancy and their immense distance philosophers have been induced to suppose them to be suns resembling that which enlivens our system as the imagination also once exited is seldom content to stop it has furnished each with an attendant system of planets belonging to itself and has even induced some to deplore the fate of those systems whose imagined suns which sometimes happens have become no longer visible  but conjectures of this kind which no reasoning can ascertain nor experiment reach are rather amusing than useful though we see the greatness and wisdom of the deity in all the seeming worlds that surround us it is our chief concern to trace him in that which we inhabit the examination of the earth the wonders of its contrivance the history of its advantages or of the seeming defects in its formation are the proper business of the natural historian a description of this earth its animals vegetables and minerals is the most delightful entertainment the mind can be furnished with as it is the most interesting and useful i would beg leave therefore to conclude these commonplace speculations with an observation which i hope is not entirely so  an use hitherto not much insisted upon that may result from the contemplation of celestial magnificence is that it will teach us to make an allowance for the apparent irregularities we find below whenever we can examine the works of the deity at a proper point of distance so as to take in the whole of his design we see nothing but uniformity beauty and precision the heavens present us with a plan which though inexpressibly magnificent is yet regular beyond the power of invention whenever therefore we find any apparent defects in the earth which we are about to consider instead of attempting to reason ourselves into an opinion that they are beautiful it will be wiser to say that we do not behold them at the proper point of distance and that our eye is laid too close to the objects to take in the regularity of their connection in short we may conclude that god who is regular in his great productions acts with equal uniformity in the little  chap ii a short survey of the globe from the light of astronomy and geography all the sciences are in some measure linked with each other and before the one is ended the other begins in a natural history therefore of the earth we must begin with a short account of its situation and form as given us by astronomers and geographers it will be sufficient however upon this occasion just to hint to the imagination what they by the most abstract reasonings have forced upon the understanding the earth which we inhabit is as has been said before one of those bodies which circulate in our solar system it is placed at an happy middle distance from the center and even seems in this respect privileged beyond all other planets that depend upon our great luminary for their support less distant from the sun than saturn jupiter and mars and yet less parched up than venus and mercury that are situate too near the violence of its power the earth seems in a peculiar manner to share the bounty of the creator it is not therefore without reason that mankind consider themselves as the peculiar objects of his providence and regard  besides that motion which the earth has round the sun the circuit of which is performed in a year it has another upon its own axle which it performs in twentyfour hours thus like a chariotwheel it has a compound motion for while it goes forward on its journey it is all the while turning upon itself from the first of these two arise the grateful vicissitude of the seasons from the second that of day and night  it may be also readily conceived that a body thus wheeling in circles will most probably be itself a sphere the earth beyond all possibility of doubt is found to be so whenever its shadow happens to fall upon the moon in an eclipse it appears to be always circular in whatever position it is projected and it is easy to prove that a body which in every position makes a circular shadow must itself be round the rotundity of the earth may be also proved from the meeting of two ships at sea the top masts of each are the first parts that are discovered by both the under parts being hidden by the convexity of the globe which rises between them the ships in this instance may be resembled to two men who approach each other on the opposite sides of an hill their heads will first be seen and gradually as they come nearer they will come entirely into view  however though the earths figure is said to be spherical we ought only to conceive it as being nearly so it has been found in the last age to be rather flatted at both poles so that its form is commonly resembled to that of a turnep the cause of this swelling of the equator is ascribed to the greater rapidity of the motion with which the parts of the earth are there carried round and which consequently endeavoring to fly off act in opposition to central attraction the twirling of a mop may serve as an homely illustration which as every one has seen spreads and grows broader in the middle as it continues to be turned round  as the earth receives light and motion from the sun so it derives much of its warmth and power of vegetation from the same beneficent source however the different parts of the globe participate of these advantages in very different proportions and accordingly put on very different appearances a polar prospect and a landscape at the equator are as opposite in their appearances as in their situation  the polar regions that receive the solar beams in a very oblique direction and that continue for one half of the year in night receive but few of the genial comforts that other parts of the world enjoy nothing can be more mournful or hideous than the picture which travelers present of those wretched regions the ground crantzs history of greenland p    which is rocky and barren rears itself in every place in lofty mountains and inaccessible cliffs and meets the mariners eye at even forty leagues from shore these precipices frightful in themselves receive an additional horror from being constantly covered with ice and snow which daily seem to accumulate and to fill all the valleys with increasing desolation the few rocks and cliffs that are bare of snow look at a distance of a dark brown color and quite naked upon a nearer approach however they are found replete with many different veins of colored stone and here and there spread over with a little earth and a scanty portion of grass and heath the internal parts of the country are still more desolate and deterring in wandering this solitude some plains appear covered with ice that at first glance seem to promise the traveller an easy journey crantzs history of greenland p     but these are even more formidable and more unpassable than the mountains themselves being cleft with dreadful chasms and every where abounding with pits that threaten certain destruction the seas that surround these inhospitable coasts are still more astonishing being covered with flakes of floating ice that spread like extensive fields or that rise out of the water like enormous mountains these which are composed of materials as clear and transparent as glass ibid     assume many strange and phantastic appearances some of them look like churches or castles with pointed turrets some like ships in full sail and people have often given themselves the fruitless toil to attempt piloting the imaginary vessels into harbor there are still others that appear like large islands with plains valleys and hills which often rear their heads two hundred yards above the level of the sea and although the height of these be amazing yet their depth beneath is still more so some of them being found to sink three hundred fathom under water  the earth presents a very different appearance at the equator where the sunbeams darting directly downwards burn up the lighter soils into extensive sandy deserts or quicken all the moister tracts with incredible vegetation in these regions almost all the same inconveniences are felt from the proximity of the sun that in the former were endured from its absence the deserts are entirely barren except where they are found to produce serpents and that in such quantities that some extensive plains seem almost entirely covered with them adansons description of senegal   it not unfrequently happens also that this dry soil which is so parched and comminuted by the force of the sun rises with the smallest breeze of wind and the sands being composed of parts almost as small as those of water they assume a similar appearance rolling onward in waves like those of a troubled sea and overwhelming all they meet with inevitable destruction on the other hand those tracts which are fertile teem with vegetation even to a noxious degree the grass rises to such an height as often to require burning the forests are impassable from underwoods and so matted above that even the sun fierce as it is can seldom penetrate linnaei amaenit vol vi p     these are so thick as scarce to be extirpated for the tops being so bound together by the climbing plants that grow round them though an hundred should be cut at the bottom yet not one would fall as they mutually support each other in these dark and tangled forests beasts of various kinds insects in astonishing abundance and serpents of surprising magnitude find a quiet retreat from man and are seldom disturbed except by each other  in this manner the extremes of our globe seem equally unfitted for the comforts and conveniences of life and although the imagination may find an awful pleasure in contemplating the frightful precipices of greenland or the luxurious verdure of africa yet true happiness can only be found in the more moderate climates where the gifts of nature may be enjoyed without incurring danger in obtaining them  it is in the temperate zone therefore that all the arts of improving nature and refining upon happiness have been invented and this part of the earth is more properly speaking the theater of natural history although there be millions of animals and vegetables in the unexplored forests under the line yet most of these may for ever continue unknown as curiosity is there repressed by surrounding danger but it is otherwise in these delightful regions which we inhabit and where this art has had its beginning among us there is scarce a shrub a flower or an insect without its particular history scarce a plant that could be useful that has not been propagated nor a weed that could be noxious which has not been pointed out  chap iii a view of the surface of the earth when we take a slight survey of the surface of our globe a thousand objects offer themselves which though long known yet still demand our curiosity the most obvious beauty that every where strikes the eye is the verdant covering of the earth which is formed by an happy mixture of herbs and trees of various magnitudes and uses it has been often remarked that no color refreshes the sight so well as green and it may be added as a further proof of the assertion that the inhabitants of those places where the fields are continually white with snow generally become blind long before the usual course of nature  this advantage which arises from the verdure of the fields is not a little improved by their agreeable inequalities there is scarce two natural landscapes that offer prospects entirely resembling each other their risings and depressions their hills and valleys are never entirely the same but always offer something new to entertain and refresh the imagination  but to increase the beauties of the face of nature the landscape is enlivened by springs and lakes and intersected by rivulets these lend a brightness to the prospect give motion and coolness to the air and what is much more important furnish health and subsistence to animated nature  such are the most obvious and tranquil objects that every where offer but there are others of a more awful and magnificent kind the mountain rising above the clouds and topt with snow the river pouring down its sides increasing as it runs and losing itself at last in the ocean the ocean spreading its immense sheet of waters over one half of the globe swelling and subsiding at wellknown intervals and forming a communication between the most distant parts of the earth  if we leave those objects that seem to be natural to our earth and keep the same constant tenor we are presented with the great irregularities of nature the burning mountain the abrupt precipice the unfathomable cavern the headlong cataract and the rapid whirlpool  if we carry our curiosity a little further and descend to the objects immediately below the surface of the globe we shall there find wonders still as amazing we first perceive the earth for the most part lying in regular beds or layers every bed growing thicker in proportion as it lies deeper and its contents more compact and heavy we shall find almost wherever we make our subterranean enquiry an amazing number of shells that once belonged to aquatic animals here and there at a distance from the sea beds of oystershells several yards thick and many miles over sometimes testaceous substances of various kinds on the tops of mountains and often in the heart of the hardest marble these which are dug up by the peasants in every country are regarded with little curiosity for being so very common they are considered as substances entirely terrene but it is otherwise with the enquirer after nature who finds them not only in shape but in substance every way resembling those that are bred in the sea and he therefore is at a loss to account for their removal  yet not one part of nature alone but all her productions and varieties become the object of the speculative mans enquiry he takes different views of nature from the inattentive spectator and scarce an appearance how common soever but affords matter for his contemplation he enquires how and why the surface of the earth has come to have those risings and depressions which most men call natural he demands in what manner the mountains were formed and in what consist their uses he asks from whence springs arise and how rivers flow round the convexity of the globe he enters into an examination of the ebbings and flowings and the other wonders of the deep he acquaints himself with the irregularities of nature and he will endeavor to investigate their causes by which at least he will become better versed in their history the internal structure of the globe becomes an object of his curiosity and although his enquiries can fathom but a very little way yet if possessed with a spirit of theory his imagination will supply the rest he will endeavor to account for the situation of the marine fossils that are found in the earth and for the appearance of the different beds of which it is composed these have been the enquiries that have splendidly employed many of the philosophers of the last and present age buffon woodward burnet whiston kircher bourquat leibnitz steno ray etc  and to a certain degree they must be serviceable but the worst of it is that as speculations amuse the writer more than facts they may be often carried to an extravagant length and that time may be spent in reasoning upon nature which might be more usefully employed in writing her history  too much speculation in natural history is certainly wrong but there is a defect of an opposite nature that does much more prejudice namely that of silencing all enquiry by alleging the benefits we receive from a thing instead of investigating the cause of its production if i enquire how a mountain came to be made such a reasoner enumerating its benefits answers because god knew it would be useful if i demand the cause of an earthquake he finds some good produced by it and alleges that as the cause of its explosion thus such an enquirer has constantly some ready reason for every appearance in nature which serves to swell his periods and give splendor to his declamation every thing about him is on some account or other declared to be good and he thinks it presumption to scrutinize into its defects or to endeavor to imagine how it might be better such writers and there are many such add very little to the advancement of knowledge and it is finely remarked by bacon that the investigation of final causes investigatio causarum finalium sterilis est et veluti virgo deo dedicata nil parit is a barren study and like a virgin dedicated to the deity brings forth nothing in fact those men who want to compel every appearance and every irregularity in nature into our service and expatiate on their benefits combat that very morality which they would seem to promote god has permitted thousands of natural evils to exist in the world because it is by their intervention that man is capable of moral evil and he has permitted that we should be subject to moral evil that we might do something to deserve eternal happiness by showing that we had rectitude to avoid it  chap iv a review of the different theories of the earth human invention has been exercised for several ages to account for the various irregularities of the earth while those philosophers mentioned in the last chapter see nothing but beauty symmetry and order there are others who look upon the gloomy side of nature enlarge on its defects and seem to consider the earth on which they tread as one scene of extensive desolation buffons second discourse  beneath its surface they observe minerals and waters confusedly jumbled together its different beds of earth irregularly lying upon each other mountains rising from places that once were level senec quaest lib vi cap     and hills sinking into valleys whole regions swallowed by the sea and others again rising out of its bosom all these they suppose to be but a few of the changes that have been wrought in our globe and they send out immagination to describe it in its primaeval state of beauty  of those who have written theories describing the manner of the original formation of the earth or accounting for its present appearances the most celebrated are burnet whiston woodward and buffon as speculation is endless so it is not to be wondered that all these differ from each other and give opposite accounts of the several changes which they suppose our earth to have undergone as the systems of each have had their admirers it is in some measure incumbent upon the natural historian to be acquainted at least with their outlines and indeed to know what others have even dreamed in matters of science is very useful as it may often prevent us from indulging similar delusions ourselves which we should never have adopted but because we take them to be wholly our own however as entering into a detail of these theories is rather furnishing an history of opinions than things i will endeavor to be as concise as i can  the first who formed this amusement of earthmaking into system was the celebrated thomas burnet a man of polite learning and rapid immagination his sacred theory as he calls it describing the changes which the earth has undergone or shall hereafter undergo is well known for the warmth with which it is immagined and the weakness with which it is reasoned for the elegance of its style and the meanness of its philosophy the earth says he before the deluge was very differently formed from what it is at present it was at first a fluid mass a chaos composed of various substances differing both in density and figure those which were most heavy sunk to the center and formed in the middle of our globe an hard solid body those of a lighter nature remained next and the waters which were lighter still swam upon its surface and covered the earth on every side the air and all those fluids which were lighter than water floated upon this also and in the same manner encompassed the globe so that between the surrounding body of waters and the circumambient air there was formed a coat of oil and other unctuous substances lighter than water however as the air was still extremely impure and must have carried up with it many of those earthly particles with which it once was intimately blended it soon began to defecate and to depose these particles upon the only surface already mentioned which soon uniting together the earth and oil formed that crust which soon became an habitable surface giving life to vegetation and dwelling to animals  this immaginary antideluvian abode was very different from what we see it at present the earth was light and rich and formed of a substance entirely adapted to the feeble state of incipient vegetation it was an uniform plain every where covered with verdure without mountains without seas or the smallest inequalities it had no difference of seasons for its equator was in the plain of the ecliptic or in other words it turned directly opposite to the sun so that it enjoyed one perpetual and luxuriant spring however this delightful face of nature did not long continue the same for after a time it began to crack and open in fissures a circumstance which always succeeds when the sun dries away the moisture from rich or marshy situations the crimes of mankind had been for some time preparing to draw down the wrath of heaven and they at length induced the deity to defer repairing these breaches in nature thus the chasms of the earth every day became wider and at length they penetrated to the great abyss of waters and the whole earth in a manner fell in then ensued a total disorder in the uniform beauty of the first creation the terrene surface of the globe being broken down as it sunk the waters gushed out into its place the deluge became universal all mankind except eight persons were punished with destruction and their posterity condemned to toil upon the ruins of desolated nature  it only remains to mention the manner in which he relieves the earth from this universal wreck which would seem to be as difficult as even its first formation these great masses of earth falling into the abyss drew down with them vast quantities also of air and by dashing against each other and breaking into small parts by the repeated violence of the shock they at length left between them large cavities filled with nothing but air these cavities naturally offered a bed to receive the influent waters and in proportion as they filled the face of the earth became once more visible the higher parts of its broken surface now become the tops of mountains were the first that appeared the plains soon after came forward and at length the whole globe was delivered from the waters except the places in the lowest situations so that the ocean and the seas are still a part of the ancient abyss that have not had a place to return islands and rocks are fragments of the earths former crust kingdoms and continents are larger masses of its broken substance and all the inequalities that are to be found on the surface of the present earth are owing to the accidental confusion into which both earth and waters were then thrown  the next theorist was woodward who in his essay toward a natural history of the earth which was only designed to precede a greater work has endeavored to give a more rational account of its appearances and was in fact much better furnished for such an undertaking than any of his predecessors being one of the most assiduous naturalists of his time his little book therefore contains many important facts relative to natural history although his system may be weak and groundless  he begins by asserting that all terrene substances are disposed in beds of various natures lying horizontally one over the other somewhat like the coats of an onion that they are replete with shells and other productions of the sea these shells being found in the deepest cavities and on the tops of the highest mountains from these observations which are warranted by experience he proceeds to observe that these shells and extraneous fossils are not productions of the earth but are all actual remains of those animals which they are known to resemble that all the beds of the earth lie under each other in the order of their specific gravity and that they are disposed as if they had been left there by subsiding waters all these assertions he affirms with much earnestness although daily experience contradicts him in some of them particularly we find layers of stone often over the lightest soils and the softest earth under the hardest bodies however having taken it for granted that all the layers of the earth are found in the order of their specific gravity the lightest at the top and the heaviest next the center he consecquently asserts and it will not improbably follow that all the substances of which the earth is composed were once in an actual state of dissolution this universal dissolution he takes to have happened at the time of the flood he supposes that at that time a body of water which was then in the center of the earth uniting with that which was found on the surface so far separated the terrene parts as to mix all together in one fluid mass the contents of which afterward sinking according to their respective gravities produced the present appearances of the earth being aware however of an objection that fossile substances are not found dissolved he exempts them from this universal dissolution and for that purpose endeavors to show that the parts of animals have a stronger cohesion than those of minerals and that while even the hardest rocks may be dissolved bones and shells may still continue entire  so much for wooodward but of all the systems which were published respecting the earths formation that of whiston was most applauded and most opposed nor need we wonder for being supported with all the parade of deep calculation it awed the ignorant and produced the approbation of such as would be thought otherwise as it implied a knowledge of abstruse learning to be even thought capable of comprehending what the writer aimed at in fact it is not easy to divest it of its mathematical garb but those who have had leisure have found the result of our philosophers reasoning to be thus he supposes the earth to have been originally a comet and he considers the history of the creation as given us in scripture to have its commencement just when it was taken by the hand of the creator to be more regularly placed as a planet in our solar system before that time he supposes it to have been a globe without beauty or proportion a world in disosder subject to all the vicissitudes which comets endure some of which have been found at different times a thousand times hotter than melted iron at others a thousand times colder than ice these alternations of heat and cold continually melting and freezing the surface of the earth he supposes to have produced to a certain depth a chaos entirely resembling that described by the poets surrounding the solid contents of the earth which still continued unchanged in the midst making a great burning globe of more than two thousand leagues in diameter this surrounding chaos however was far from being solid he resembles it to a dense though fluid atmosphere composed of substances mingled agitated and shocked against each other and in this disorder he describes the earth to have been just at the eve of creation  but upon its orbits being then changed when it was more regularly wheeled round the sun every thing took its proper places every part of the surrounding fluid then fell into a situation in proportion as it was light or heavy the middle or central part which always remained unchanged still continued so retaining a part of that heat which it received in its primaeval approaches toward the sun which heat he calculates may continue for about six thousand years next to this fell the heavier parts of the chaotic atmosphere which serve to sustain the lighter but as in descending they could not entirely be separated from many watery parts with which they were intimately mixed they drew down a part of these also with them and these could not mount again after the surface of the earth was consolidated they therefore surrounded the heavy first descending parts in the same manner as these surround the central globe thus the entire body of the earth is composed most internally of a great burning globe next which is placed an heavy terrene substance that encompasses it round which also is circumfused a body of water upon this body of waters the crust of earth on which we inhabit is placed so that according to him the globe is composed of a number of coats or shells one within the other all of different densities the body of the earth being thus formed the air which is the lightest substance of all surrounded its surface and the beams of the sun darting through produced that light which we are told first obeyed the creators command  the whole economy of the creation being thus adjusted it only remained to account for the risings and depressions on the surface of the earth with the other seeming irregularities of its present appearance the hills and valleys are considered by him as formed by their pressing upon the internal fluid which sustains the outward shell of earth with greater or less weight those parts of the earth which are heaviest sink into the subjacent fluid more deeply and become valleys those that are lightest rise higher upon the earths surface and are called mountains  such was the face of nature before the deluge the earth was then more fertile and populous than it is at present the life of man and animals was extended to ten times its present duration and all these advantages arose from the superior heat of the central globe which ever since has been cooling as its heat was then in its full power the genial principle was also much greater than at present vegetation and animal increase were carried on with more vigor and all nature seemed teeming with the seeds of life but these physical advantages were only productive of moral evil the warmth which invigorated the body increased the passions and appetites of the mind and as man became more powerful he grew less innocent it was found necessary to punish his depravity and all living creatures except the fishes who living in a cold element were not subject to a similitude of guilt were overwhelmed by the deluge in universal destruction  this deluge which simple believers are willing to ascribe to a miracle philosophers have long been desirous to account for by natural causes they have proved that the earth could never supply from any reservoir toward its center nor the atmosphere by any discharge from above such a quantity of water as would cover the surface of the globe to a certain depth over the tops of our highest mountains where therefore was all this water to be found whiston has found enough and more than a sufficiency in the tail of a comet for he seems to alot comets a very active part in the great operations of nature  he calculates with great seeming precision the year the month and the day of the week on which this comet which has paid the earth some visits since though at a kinder distance involved our globe in its tail the tail he supposed to be a vaporous fluid substance exhaled from the body of the comet by the extreme heat of the sun and increasing in proportion as it approached that great luminary it was in this that our globe was involved at the time of the deluge and as the earth still acted by its natural attraction it drew to itself all the watery vapors which were in the comets tail and the internal waters being also at the same time let loose in a very short space the tops of the highest mountains were laid under the deep  the punishment of the deluge being thus completed and all the guilty destroyed the earth which had been broken by the eruption of the internal waters was also enlarged by the same so that upon the comets recess there was found room sufficient in the internal abyss for the recess of the superfluous waters whither they all retired and left the earth uncovered but in some respects changed particularly in its figure which from being round was now become oblate in this universal wreck of nature noah survived by a variety of happy causes to repeople the earth and to give birth to a race of men slow in believing illimagined theories of the earth  after so many theories of the earth which had been published applauded answered and forgotten mr buffon ventured to add one more to the number this philosopher was in every respect better qualified than any of his predecessors for such an attempt being furnished with more materials having a brighter imagination to find new proofs and a better style to cloth them in however if one so ill qualified as i am may judge this seems the weakest part of his admirable work and i could wish that he had been content with giving us facts instead of systems that instead of being a reasoner he had contented himself with being merely an historian  he begins his system by making a distinction between the first part of it and the last the one being founded only on conjecture the other depending entirely upon actual observation the latter part of his theory may therefore be true though the former should be found erroneous  the planets says he and the earth among the number might have been formerly he only offers this as conjecture a part of the body of the sun and adherent to its substance in this situation a comet falling in upon that great body might have given it such a shock and so shaken its whole frame that some of its particles might have been driven off like streaming sparkles from red hot iron and each of these streams of fire small as they were in comparison of the sun might have been large enough to have made an earth as great nay many times greater than ours so that in this manner the planets together with the globe which we inhabit might have been driven off from the body of the sun by an impulsive force in this manner also they would continue to recede from it for ever were they not drawn back by its superior power of attraction and thus by the combination of the two motions they are wheeled round in circles  being in this manner detached at a distance from the body of the sun the planets from having been at first globes of liquid fire gradually became cool the earth also having been dashed obliquely forward received a rotatory motion upon its axis at the very instant of its formation and this motion being greatest at the equator the parts there acting against the force of gravity they must have swollen out and given the earth an oblate or flatted figure  as to its internal substance our globe having once belonged to the sun it continues to be an uniform mass of melted matter very probably vitrified in its primaeval fusion but its surface is very differently composed having been in the beginning heated to a degree equal to if not greater than what comets are found to sustain like them it had an atmosphere of vapors floating round it and which cooling by degrees condensed and subsided upon its surface these vapors formed according to their different densities the earth the water and the air the heavier parts falling first and the lighter remaining still suspended  thus far our philosopher is at least as much a system maker as whiston or burnet and indeed he fights his way with great perseverance and ingenuity through a thousand objections that naturally arise having at last got upon the earth he supposes himself on firmer ground and goes forward with greater security turning his attention to the present appearance of things upon this globe he pronounces from the view that the whole earth was at first under water this water he supposes to have been the lighter parts of its former evaporation which while the earthy particles sunk downwards by their natural gravity floated on the surface and covered it for a considerable space of time  the surface of the earth says he theorie de la terre vol   p      must have been in the beginning much less solid than it is at present and consequently the same causes which at this day produce but very slight changes must then upon so complying a substance have had very considerable effects we have no reason to doubt but that it was then covered with the waters of the sea and that those waters were above the tops of our highest mountains since even in such elevated situations we find shells and other marine productions in very great abundance it appears also that the sea continued for a considerable time upon the face of the earth for as these layers of shells are found so very frequent at such great depths and in such prodigious quantities it seems impossible for these to have supported their numbers all alive at one time so that they must have been brought there by successive depositions these shells also are found in the bodies of the hardest rocks where they could not have been deposited all at once at the time of deluge or at any such instant revolution since that would be to suppose that all the rocks in which they are found were at that instant in a state of dissolution which would be absurd to assert the sea therefore deposited them wheresoever they are now to be found and that by slow and successive degrees it will appear also that the sea covered the whole earth from the appearance of its layers which lying regularly one above the other seem all to resemble the sediment formed at different times by the ocean hence by the irregular force of its waves and its currents driving the bottom into sandbanks mountains must have been gradually formed within this universal covering of waters and these successively raising their heads above its surface must in time have formed the highest ridges of mountains upon land together with continents islands and low grounds all in their turns this opinion will receive additional weight by considering that in those parts of the earth where the power of the ocean is greatest the inequalities on the surface of the earth are highest the oceans power is greatest at the equator where its winds and tides are most constant and in fact the mountains at the equator are found to be higher than in any other part of the world the sea therefore has produced the principal changes in our earth rivers volcanoes earthquakes storms and rain having made but slight alterations and only such as have affected the globe to very inconsiderable depths    this is but a very slight sketch of mr buffons theory of the earth a theory which he has much more powerfully supported than happily invented and it would be needless to take up the readers time from the pursuit of truth in the discussion of plausibilities in fact a thousand questions might be asked this most ingenious philosopher which he would not find it easy to answer but such is the lot of humanity that a single goth can in one day destroy the fabric which caesars were employed an age in erecting in fact we might ask how mountains which are composed of the most compact and ponderous substances should be the first whose parts the sea began to remove we might ask how fossilwood is found deeper even than shells which argues that trees grew upon the places he supposes once to have been covered with the ocean but we hope this excellent man is better employed than to think of gratifying the petulance of incredulity by answering endless objections  chap v of fossilshells and other extraneous fossils we may affirm of mr buffon that which has been said of the chemists of old though he may have failed in attaining his principal aim of establishing a theory yet he has brought together such a multitude of facts relative to the history of the earth and the nature of its fossil productions that curiosity finds ample compensation even while it feels the want of conviction  before therefore i enter upon the description of those parts of the earth which seem more naturally to fall within the subject it will not be improper to give a short history of those animal productions that are found in such quantities either upon its surface or at different depths below it they demand our curiosity and indeed there is nothing in natural history that has afforded more scope for doubt conjecture and speculation whatever depths of the earth we examine or at whatever distance within land we seek we most commonly find a number of fossilshells which being compared with others from the sea of known kinds are found to be exactly of a similar shape and nature woodwards essay toward a natural history p     they are found at the very bottom of quarries and mines in the most retired and inward parts of the most firm and solid rocks upon the tops of even the highest hills and mountains as well as in the valleys and plains and this not in one country alone but in all places where there is any digging for marble chalk or any other terrestrial matters that are so compact as to fence off the external injuries of the air and thus preserve these shells from decay  these marine substances so commonly diffused and so generally to be met with were for a long time considered by philosophers as productions not of the sea but of the earth as we find that spars said they always shoot into peculiar shapes so these seeming snails cockles and muscleshells are only sportive forms that nature assumes amongst others of its mineral varieties they have the shape of fish indeed but they have always been terrestrial substances lowth abridgement phil trans vol ii p       with this plausible solution mankind were for a long time content but upon closer enquiry they were obliged to alter their opinion it was found that these shells had in every respect the properties of animal and not of mineral nature they were found exactly of the same weight with their fellow shells upon shore they answered all the chemical trials in the same manner as sea shells do their parts when dissolved had the same appearance to view the same smell and taste they had the same effects in medicine when inwardly administered and in a word were so exactly conformable to marine bodies that they had all the accidental concretions growing to them such as pearls corals and smaller shells which are found in shells just gathered on the shore they were therefore from these considerations again given back to the sea but the wonder was how to account for their coming so far from their own natural element upon land woodward p      as this naturally gave rise to many conjectures it is not to be wondered that some among them have been very extraordinary an italian quoted by mr buffon supposes them to have been deposited in the earth at the time of the crusades by the pilgrims who returned from jerusalem who gathering them upon the seashore in their return carried them to their different places of habitation but this conjecturer seems to have but a very inadequate idea of their numbers at touraine in france more than an hundred miles from the sea there is a plain of about nine leagues long and as many broad from whence the peasants of the country supply themselves with marle for manuring their lands they seldom dig deeper than twenty feet and the whole plain is composed of the same materials which are shells of various kinds without the smallest portion of earth between them here then is a large space in which are deposited millions of tons of shells which pilgrims could not have collected though their whole employment had been nothing else england is furnished with its beds which though not quite so extensive yet are equally wonderful phil trans vol ii p     near reading in berkshire for many succeeding generations a continued body of oystershells has been found through the whole circumference of five or six acres of ground the foundation of these shells is an hard rocky chalk and above this chalk the oystershells lie in a bed of green sand upon a level as nigh as can possibly be judged and about two feet thickness these shells are in their natural state but they are found also petrified and almost in equal abundance buffon vol i p  0  in all the alpine rocks in the pyrenees on the hills of france england and flanders even in all quarries from whence marble is dug if the rocks be split perpendicularly downwards petrified shells and other marine substances will be plainly discerned  about a quarter of a mile from the river medway phil trans p      in the county of kent after the taking off the coping of a piece of ground there the workmen came to a blue marble which continued for three feet and an half deep or more and then beneath appeared an hard floor or pavement composed of petrified shells crowded closely together this layer was about an inch deep and several yards over and it could be walked upon as upon a beach these stones of which it was composed the describer supposes them to have always been stones were either wreathed as snails or bivalvular like cockles the wreathed kinds were about the size of an hazlenut and were filled with a stony substance of the color of marle and they themselves also till they were washed were of the same color but when cleaned they appeared of the color of bezoar and of the same polish after boiling in water they became whitish and left a chalkiness upon the fingers  in several parts of asia and africa travelers have observed these shells in great abundance in the mountains of castravan which lie above the city barut they quarry out a white stone every part of which contains petrified fishes in great numbers and of surprising diversity they also seem to continue in such preservation that their fins scales and all the minutest distinctions of their make can be perfectly discerned buffon vol i p  0    from all these instances we may conclude that these fossils are very numerous and indeed independent of their situation they afford no small entertainment to observe them as preserved in the cabinets of the curious the variety of their kinds is astonishing most of the sea shells which are known and many others to which we are entirely strangers are to be seen either in their natural state or in various degrees of petrefaction hill p      in the place of some we have mere spar or stone exactly expressing all the lineaments of animals as having been wholly formed from them for it has happened that the shells dissolving by very slow degrees and the matter having nicely and exactly filled all the cavities within this matter after the shells have perished has preserved exactly and regularly the whole print of their internal surface of these there are various kinds found in our pits many of them resembling those of our own shores and many others that are only to be found on the coasts of other countries there are some shells resembling those that are never stranded upon our coasts littorales  but that always remain in the deep pelagii  and many more there are which we can assimilate with no shells that are known amongst us but we find not only shells in our pits but also fishes and corals in great abundance together with almost every sort of marine production  it is extraordinary enough however that the common red coral though so very frequent at sea is scarce seen in the fossil world nor is there any account of its having ever been met with but to recompense for this there are all the kinds of the white coral now known and many other kinds of that substance with which we are unacquainted of animals there are various parts the vertebrae of whales and the mouths of lesser fishes these with teeth also of various kinds are found in the cabinets of the curious where they receive long greek names which it is neither the intention nor the province of this work to enumerate indeed few readers would think themselves much improved should i proceed with enumerating the various classes of the conicthyodontes polyleptoginglimi or the orthoceratites these names which mean no great matter when they are explained may serve to guide in the furnishing a cabinet but they are of very little service in furnishing the page of instructive history  from all these instances we see in what abundance these petrefactions are to be found and indeed mr buffon to whose accounts we have added some has not been sparing in the variety of his quotations concerning the places where they are mostly to be found however i am surprised that he should have omitted the mention of one which in some measure more than any of the rest would have served to strengthen his theory we are informed by almost every traveller hasselquist sandys  that has described the pyramids of egypt that one of them is entirely built of a kind of freestone in which these petrified shells are found in great abundance this being the case it may be conjectured as we have accounts of these pyramids among the earliest records of mankind and of their being built so long before the age of herodotus who lived but fifteen hundred years after the flood that even the egyptian priests could tell neither the time nor the cause of their erection i say it may be conjectured that they were erected but a short time after the flood it is not very likely therefore that the marine substances found in one of them had time to be formed into a part of the solid stone either during the deluge or immediately after it and consequently their petrefaction must have been before that period and this is the opinion mr buffon has all along so strenuously endeavored to maintain having given specious reasons to prove that such shells were laid in the beds where they are now found not only before the deluge but even antecedent to the formation of man at the time when the whole earth as he supposes was buried beneath a covering of waters  but while there are many reasons to persuade us that these extraneous fossils have been deposited by the sea there is one fact that will abundantly serve to convince us that the earth was habitable if not inhabited before these marine substances came to be thus deposited for we find fossil trees which no doubt once grew upon the earth as deep and as much in the body of solid rocks as these shells are found to be some of these fallen trees also have lain at least as long if not longer in the earth than the shells as they have been found sunk deep in a marly substance composed of decayed shells and other marine productions mr buffon has proved that fossil shells could not have been deposited in such quantities all at once by the flood and i think from the above instance it is pretty plain that howsoever they were deposited the earth was covered with trees before their deposition and consequently that the sea could not have made a very permanent stay how then shall we account for these extraordinary appearances in nature a suspension of all assent is certainly the first although the most mortifying conduct for my own part were i to offer a conjecture and all that has been said upon this subject is but conjecture instead of supposing them to be the remains of animals belonging to the sea i would consider them rather as bred in the numerous fresh water lakes that in primaeval times covered the face of uncultivated nature some of these shells we know to belong to fresh waters some can be assimilated to none of the marine shells now known hills fossils p      why therefore may we not as well ascribe the production of all to fresh waters where we do not find them as we do that of the latter to the sea only where we never find them we know that lakes and lands also have produced animals that are now no longer existing why therefore might not these fossil productions be among the number i grant that this is making a very harsh supposition but i cannot avoid thinking that it is not attended with so many embarrassments as some of the former and that it is much easier to believe that these shells were bred in fresh water than that the sea had for a long time covered the tops of the highest mountains  chap vii of the internal structure of the earth having in some measure got free from the regions of conjecture let us now proceed to a description of the earth as we find it by examination and observe its internal composition as far as it has been the subject of experience or exposed to human enquiry these enquiries indeed have been carried but to a very little depth below its surface and even in that disquisition men have been conducted more by motives of avarice than of curiosity the deepest mine which is that at cotteberg in hungary boil vol iii p   0  reaches not more than three thousand feet deep but what proportion does that bear to the depth of the terrestrial globe down to the center which is above four thousand miles all therefore that has been said of the earth to a deeper degree is merely fabulous or conjectural we may suppose with one that it is a globe of glass buffon  with another a sphere of heated iron whiston  with a third a great mass of waters burnet  and with a fourth one dreadful volcano kircher  but let us at the same time show our consciousness that all these are but suppositions  upon examining the earth where it has been opened to any depth the first thing that occurs is the different layers or beds of which it is composed these all lying horizontally one over the other like the leaves of a book and each of them composed of materials that increase in weight in proportion as they lie deeper this is in general the disposition of the different materials where the earth seems to have remained unmolested but this order is frequently inverted and we cannot tell whether from its original formation or from accidental causes of different substances thus disposed the far greatest part of our globe consists from its surface downwards to the greatest depths we ever dig or mine woodward p     the first layer that is most commonly found at the surface is that light coat of blackish mold which is called by some garden earth with this the earth is every where invested unless it be washed off by rains or removed by some other external violence this seems to have been formed from animal and vegetable bodies decaying and thus turning into its substance it also serves again as a storehouse from whence animal and vegetable nature are renewed and thus are all vital blessings continued with unceasing circulation this earth however is not to be supposed entirely pure but is mixed up with much stony and gravelly matter from the layers lying immediately beneath it it generally happens that the soil is fertile in proportion to the quantity that this putrified mold bears to the gravelly mixture and as the former predominates so far is the vegetation upon it more luxuriant it is this external covering that supplies man with all the true riches he enjoys he may bring up gold and jewels from greater depths but they are merely the toys of a capricious being things upon which he has placed an imaginary value and for which fools alone part with the more substantial blessings of life it is this earth says pliny plinii naturalis historia lib   cap     that like a kind mother receives us at our birth and sustains us when born it is this alone of all the elements around us that is never found an enemy to man the body of waters deluge him with rains oppress him with hail and drown him with inundations the air rushes in storms prepares the tempest or lights up the volcano but the earth gentle and indulgent ever subservient to the wants of man spreads his walks with flowers and his table with plenty returns with interest every good committed to her care and though she produces the poison she still supplies the antidote though constantly teized more to furnish the luxuries of man than his necessities yet even to the last she continues her kind indulgence and when life is over she piously covers his remains in her bosom  this external and fruitful layer which covers the earth is as was said in a state of continual change vegetables which are naturally fixed and rooted to the same place receive their adventitious nourishment from the surrounding earth and water animals which change from place to place are supported by these or by each other both however having for a time enjoyed a life adapted to their nature give back to the earth those spoils which they had borrowed for a very short space yet still to be quickened again into fresh existence but the deposits they make are of very dissimilar kinds and the earth is very differently enriched by their continuance those countries that have for a long time supported men and other animals having been observed to become every day more barren while on the contrary those desolate places in which vegetables only are abundantly produced are known to be possessed of amazing fertility buffon vol i     in regions which are uninhabited says mr buffon where the forests are not cut down and where animals do not feed upon the plants the bed of vegetable earth is constantly increasing in all woods and even in those which are often cut there is a layer of earth of six or eight inches thick which has been formed by the leaves branches and bark which fall and rot upon the ground i have frequently observed on a roman way that crosses burgundy for a long extent that there is a bed of black earth of more than a foot thick gathered over the stony pavement on which several trees of a very considerable size are supported this i have found to be nothing else than an earth formed by decayed leaves and branches which have been converted by time into a black soil now as vegetables draw much more of their nourishment from the air and water than they do from the earth it must follow that in rotting upon the ground they must give more to the soil than they have taken from it hence therefore in woods kept a long time without cutting the soil below increases to a considerable depth and such we actually find the soil in those american wilds where the forests have been undisturbed for ages but it is otherwise where men and animals have long subsisted for as they make a considerable consumption of wood and plants both for firing and other uses they take more from the earth than they return to it it follows therefore that the bed of vegetable earth in an inhabited country must be always diminishing and must at length resemble the soil of arabia petrea and other provinces of the east which having been long inhabited are now become plains of salt and sand the fixed salt always remaining while the other volatile parts have flown away  if from this external surface we descend deeper and view the earth cut perpendicularly downwards either in the banks of great rivers or steepy seashores or going still deeper if we observe it in quarries or mines we shall find its layers regularly disposed in their proper order we must not expect however to find them of the same kind or thickness in every place as they differ in different soils and situations sometimes marle is seen to be over sand and sometimes under it the most common disposition is that under the first earth is found gravel or sand then clay or marle then chalk or coal marbles oars sands gravels and thus an alternation of these substances each growing more dense as it sinks deeper the clay for instance found at the depth of an hundred feet is usually more heavy than that found not far from the surface in a well which was dug at amsterdam to the depth of two hundred and thirty feet the following substances were found in succession varenius as quoted by mr buffon p      seven feet of vegetable earth nine of turf nine of soft clay eight of sand four of earth ten of clay four of earth ten of sand two of clay four of white sand one of soft earth fourteen of sand eight of clay mixed with sand four of seasand mixed with shells then an hundred and two feet of soft clay and then thirtyone feet of sand  in a well dug at marly to the depth of an hundred feet mr buffon gives us a still more exact enumeration of its layers of earth thirteen of a reddish gravel two of gravel mingled with a vitrifiable sand three of limon two of marle four of marly stone five of marle in dust mixed with vitrifiable sand six of very fine vitrifiable sand three of earthy marle three of hard marle one of gravel one of eglantine a stone of the hardness and grain of marble one of gravelly marle one of stony marle one of a coarser kind of stony marle two of a coarser kind still one of vitrifiable sand mixed with fossil shells two of fine gravel three of stony marle one of coarse powdered marle one of stone calcinable like marble three of gray sand two of white sand one of red sand streaked with white eight of gray sand with shells three of very fine sand three of gres four of red sand streaked with white three of white sand and fifteen of reddish vitrifiable sand  in this manner the earth is every where found in beds over beds and what is still remarkable each of them as far as it extends always maintains exactly the same thickness it is found also that as we proceed to considerable depths every layer grows thicker thus in the adduced instances we might have observed that the last layer was fifteen feet thick while most of the others were not above eight and this might have gone much deeper for aught we can tell as before they got through it the workmen ceased digging  these layers are sometimes very extensive and often are found to obtain over a space of some leagues in circumference but it must not be supposed that they are uniformly continued over the whole globe without any interruption on the contrary they are ever at small intervals cracked through as it were by perpendicular fissures the earth resembling in this respect the muddy bottom of a pond from whence the water has been dried off by the sun and thus gaping in several chinks which descend in a direction perpendicular to its surface these fissures are many times found empty but oftener closed up with adventitious substances that the rain or some other accidental causes have conveyed to fill their cavities their openings are not less different than their contents some being not above half an inch wide some a foot and some several hundred yards asunder these last form those dreadful chasms that are to be found in the alps at the edge of which the traveller stands dreading to look down at the immeasurable gulf below these amazing clefts are well known to such as have past these mountains where a chasm frequently presents itself several hundred feet deep and as many over at the edge of which the way lies it often happens also that the road leads along the bottom and then the spectator observes on each side frightful precipices several hundred yards above him the sides of which tally so exactly with each other that they evidently seem torn asunder  but these chasms to be found in the alps are nothing to what ovalle tells us are to be seen in the andes these amazing mountains in comparison of which the former are but little hills have their fissures in proportion to their greatness in some places they are a mile wide and deep in proportion and there are some others that running underground in extent resemble a province  of this kind also is that cavern called eldenhole in derbyshire which dr plot tells us was sounded by a line of eight and twenty hundred feet without finding the bottom or meeting with water and yet the mouth at the top is not above forty yards over phil trans vol ii p   0  this immeasurable cavern runs perpendicularly downward and the sides of it seem totally so plainly as to show that they once were united those who come to visit the place generally procure stones to be thrown into its mouth and these are heard for several minutes falling and striking against the sides of the cavern producing a sound that resembles distant thunder dying away as the stone goes deeper  of this kind also is that dreadful cavern described by aelian his account of which the reader may not have met with aeliani var hist lib    cap     in the country of the arrian indians is to be seen an amazing chasm which is called the gulf of pluto the depth and the recesses of this horrid place are as extensive as they are unknown neither the natives nor the curious who visit it are able to tell how it first was made or to what depths it descends the indians continually drive thither great multitudes of animals more than three thousand at a time of different kinds sheep horses and goats and with an absurd superstition force them into the cavity from whence they never return their several sounds however are heard as they descend the bleating of sheep the lowing of oxen and the neighing of horses issuing up to the mouth of the cavern nor do these sounds cease as the place is continually furnished with a fresh supply  there are many more of these dreadful perpendicular fissures in different parts of the earth with accounts of which kircher gaffarellus and others who have given histories of the wonders of the subterranean world abundantly supply us the generality of readers however will consider them with less astonishment when they are informed of their being common all over the earth that in every field in every quarry these perpendicular fissures are to be found either still gaping or filled with matter that has accidentally closed their interstices the inattentive spectator neglects the enquiry but their being common is partly the cause that excites the philosophers attention to them the irregularities of nature he is often content to let pass unexamined but when a constant and a common appearance presents itself every return of the object is a fresh call to his curiosity and the chink in the next quarry becomes as great a matter of wonder as the chasm in eldenhole philosophers have long therefore endeavored to find out the cause of these perpendicular fissures which our own countrymen woodward and ray were the first that found to be so common and universal mr buffon supposes them to be cracks made by the sun in drying up the earth immediately after its emersion from the deep the heat of the sun is very probably a principal cause but it is not right to ascribe to one only what we find may be the result of many earthquakes severe frosts bursting waters and storms tearing up the roots of trees have in our own times produced them and to this variety of causes we must at present be content to assign those that have happened before we had opportunities for observation  chap viii of caves and subterraneous passages that sink but not perpendicularly into the earth in surveying the subterranean wonders of the globe besides those fissures that descend perpendicularly downwards we frequently find others that descend but a little way and then spread themselves often to a great extent below the surface many of these caverns it must be confessed may be the production of art and human industry retreats made to protect the oppressed or shelter the spoiler the famous labyrinth of candia for instance is supposed to be entirely the work of art mr tournefort assures us that it bears the impression of human industry and that great pains have been bestowed upon its formation the stonequarry of maestricht is evidently made by labor carts enter at its mouth and load within then return and discharge their freight into boats that lie on the brink of the river maese this quarry is so large that forty thousand people may take shelter in it and it in general serves for this purpose when armies march that way becoming then an impregnable retreat to the people that live thereabout nothing can be more beautiful than this cavern when lighted up with torches for there are thousands of square pillars in large level walks about twenty feet high and all wrought with much neatness and regularity in this vast grotto there is very little rubbish which shows both the goodness of the stone and the carefulness of the workmen to add to its beauty there also are in various parts of it little pools of water for the convenience of the men and cattle it is remarkable also that no droppings are seen to fall from the roof nor are the walks any way wet under foot except in cases of great rains where the water gets in by the air shafts the salt mines in poland are still more spacious than these some of the catacombs both in egypt and italy are said to be very extensive but no part of the world has a greater number of artificial caverns than spain which were made to serve as retreats to the christians against the fury of the moors when the latter conquered that country however an account of the works of art does not properly belong to a natural history it will be enough to observe that though caverns be found in every country far the greatest part of them have been fashioned only by the hand of nature their size is found beyond the power of man to have effected and their forms but ill adapted to the conveniences of an human habitation in some places indeed we find mankind still make use of them as houses particularly in those countries where the climate is very severe phil trans vol ii p      but in general they are deserted by every race of meaner animals except the bat these nocturnal solitary creatures are usually the only inhabitants and these only in such whose descent is sloping or at least not directly perpendicular  there is scarce a country in the world without its natural caverns and many new cries are discovered every day of those in england oakeyhole the devilshole and penparkhole have been often described the former which lies on the south side of mendiphills ibid  within a mile of the town of wells is much resorted to by travelers to conceive a just idea of this we must imagine a precipice of more than an hundred yards high on the side of a mountain which shelves away a mile above it in this is an opening not very large into which you enter going along upon a rocky uneven pavement sometimes ascending and sometimes descending the roof of it as you advance grows higher and in some places is fifty feet from the floor in some places however it is so low that a man must stoop to pass it extends itself in length about two hundred yards and from every part of the roof and the floor there are formed sparry concretions of various figures that by strong imaginations have been likened to men lion and organs at the farthest part of this cavern rises a stream of water well stored with fish large enough to turn a mill and which discharges itself near the entrance  penparkhole in gloucestershire is almost as remarkable as the former captain sturmey descended into this by a rope twentyfive fathoms perpendicular and at the bottom found a very large vault in the shape of an horseshoe the floors consisted of a kind of white stone enamelled with lead ore and the pendent rocks were glazed with spar walking forward on this stony pavement for some time he came to a great river twenty fathoms broad and eight fathoms deep and having been informed that it ebbed and flowed with the sea he remained in this gloomy abode for five hours to make an exact observation he did not find however any alteration whatsoever in its appearance but his curiosity was ill requited for it cost this unfortunate gentleman his life immediately after his return he was seized with an unusual and violent headache which threw him into a fever of which he died soon after  but of all the subterraneous caverns now known the grotto of antiparos is the most remarkable as well for its extent as for the beauty of its sparry incrustations this celebrated cavern was first discovered by one magni an italian traveller about an hundred years ago at antiparos an inconsiderable island of the archipelago kircher mund sub     i have translated a part of kirchers description rather than tourneforts as the latter was written to support an hypothesis  the account he gives of it is long and inflated but upon the whole amusing having been informed says he by the natives of paros that in the little island of antiparos which lies about two miles from the former of a gigantic statue that was to be seen at the mouth of a cavern in that place it was resolved that we the french consul and himself should pay it a visit in pursuance of this resolution after we had landed on the island and walked about four miles through the midst of beautiful plains and sloping woodlands we at length came to a little hill on the side of which yawned a most horrid cavern that with its gloom at first struck us with terror and almost represt curiosity recovering the first surprise however we entered boldly and had not proceeded above twenty paces when the supposed statue of the giant presented itself to our view we quickly perceived that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant was nothing more than a sparry concretion formed by the water dropping from the roof of the cave and by degrees hardening into a figure that their fears had formed into a monster incited by this extraordinary appearance we were induced to proceed still farther in quest of new adventures in this subterranean abode as we proceeded new wonders offered themselves the spars formed into trees and shrubs presented a kind of petrified grove some white some green and all receding in due perspective they struck us with the more amazement as we knew them to be mere productions of nature who hitherto in solitude had in her playful moments dressed the scene as if for her own amusement but we had as yet seen but a few of the wonders of the place and we were introduced as yet only into the portico of this amazing temple in one corner of this half illuminated recess there appeared an opening of about three feet wide which seemed to lead to a place totally dark and that one of the natives assured us contained nothing more than a reservoir of water upon this we tried by throwing down some stones which rumbling along the sides of the descent for some time the sound seemed at last quashed in a bed of water in order however to be more certain we sent in a levantine mariner who by the promise of a good reward with a flambeaux in his hand ventured into this narrow aperture after continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour he returned carrying some beautiful pieces of white spar in his hand which art could neither imitate nor equal upon being informed by him that the place was full of these beautiful incrustations i ventured in once more with him for about fifty paces anxiously and cautiously descending by a steep and dangerous way finding however that we came to a precipice which led into a spacious amphitheatre if i may so call it still deeper than any other part we returned and being provided with a ladder flambeaux and other things to expedite our descent our whole company man by man ventured into the same opening and descending one after another we at last saw ourselves all together in the most magnificent part of the cavern  our candles being now all lighted up and the whole place completely illuminated never could the eye be presented with a more glittering or a more magnificent scene the roof all hung with solid isicles transparent as glass yet solid as marble the eye could scarce reach the lofty and noble cieling the sides were regularly formed with spars and the whole presented the idea of a magnificent theater illuminated with an immense profusion of lights the floor consisted of solid marble and in several places magnificent columns thrones altars and other objects appeared as if nature had designed to mock the curiosities of art our voices upon speaking or singing were redoubled to an astonishing loudness and upon the firing of a gun the noise and reverberations were almost deafening in the midst of this grand amphitheatre rose a concretion of about fifteen feet high that in some measure resembled an altar from which taking the hint we caused mass to be celebrated there the beautiful columns that shot up round the altar appeared like candlesticks and many other natural objects represented the customary ornaments of this sacrament  below even this spacious grotto there seemed another cavern down which i ventured with my former mariner and descended about fifty paces by means of a rope i at last arrived at a small spot of level ground where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre being composed of soft clay yielding to the pressure and in which i thrust a stick to about six feet deep in this however as above numbers of the most beautiful chrystals were formed one of which particularly resembled a table upon our egress from this amazing cavern we perceived a greek inscription upon a rock at the mouth but so obliterated by time that we could not read it it seemed to import that one antipater in the time of alexander had come thither but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern he does not think fit to inform us    such is the account of this beautiful scene as communicated in a letter to kircher we have another and a more copious description of it by tournefort which is in every bodys hands but i have given the above both because it was communicated by the first discoverer and because it is a simple narrative of facts without any reasoning upon them according to tourneforts account indeed we might conclude from the rapid growth of the spars in this grotto that it must every year be growing narrower and that it must in time be choked up with them entirely but no such thing has happened hitherto and the grotto at this day continues as spacious as we ever knew it  this is not the place for an enquiry into the seeming vegetation of those stony substances with which this and almost every cavern are incrusted it is enough to observe in general that they are formed by an accumulation of that little gritty matter which is carried thither by the waters and which in time acquires the hardness of marble what in this place more imports us to know is how these amazing hollows in the earth came to be formed and i think in the three instances abovementioned it is pretty evident that their excavation has been owing to waters these finding subterraneous passages under the earth and by long degrees hollowing the beds in which they flowed the ground above them has slipped down closer to their surface leaving the upper layers of the earth or stone still suspended the ground that sinks upon the face of the waters forming the floor of the cavern the ground or rock that keeps suspended forming the roof and indeed there are but few of these caverns found without water either within them or near enough to point out their formation  chap viii of mines damps and mineral vapors the caverns which we have been describing generally carry us but a very little way below the surface of the earth two hundred feet at the utmost is as much as the lowest of them is found to sink the perpendicular fissures run much deeper but few persons have been bold enough to venture down to their deepest recesses and some few who have tried have been able to bring back no tidings of the place for unfortunately they left their lives below the excavations of art have conduced us much further into the bowels of the globe some mines in hungary are known to be a thousand yards perpendicularly downwards and i have been informed by good authority of a coal mine in the north of england an hundred yards deeper still  it is beside our present purpose to enquire into the peculiar construction and contrivance of these which more properly belongs to the history of fossils it will be sufficient to observe in this place that as we descend into the mines the various layers of earth are seen as we have already described them and in some of these are always found the metals or minerals for which the mine has been dug thus frequently gold is found dispersed and mixed with clay and gravel ulloa vol ii p   0  sometimes it is mingled with other metallic bodies stones or bitumens and ulloa ibid sometimes united with that most obstinate of all substances platina from which scarce any art can separate it silver is sometimes found quite pure macquers chemistry vol i p      sometimes mixed with other substances and minerals copper is found in beds mixed with various substances marbles sulphurs and pyrites tin the ore of which is heavier than that of any other metal is generally found mixed with every kind of matter hills fossils p     lead is also equally common and iron we well know can be extracted from all the substances upon earth  the variety of substances which are thus found in the bowels of the earth in their native state have a very different appearance from what they are afterward taught to assume by human induftry the richest metals are very often less glittering and splendid than the most useless marcasites and the basest ores are in general the most beautiful to the eye  this variety of substances which compose the internal parts of our globe is productive of equal varieties both above and below its surface the combination of the different minerals with each other the heats which arise from their mixture the vapors they diffuse the fires which they generate or the colds which they sometimes produce are all either noxious or salutary to man so that in this great elabratory of nature a thousand benefits and calamities are forging of which we are wholly unconscious and it is happy for us that we are so  boil vol iii p     upon our descent into mines of considerable depth the cold seems to increase from the mouth as we descend but after passing very low down we begin by degrees to come into a warmer air which sensibly grows hotter as we go deeper till at last the laborers can scarce bear any covering as they continue working  this difference in the air was supposed by boil to proceed from magazines of fire that lay nearer the center and that diffused their heat to the adjacent regions but we now know that it may be ascribed to more obvious causes in some mines the composition of the earth all around is of such a nature that upon the admission of water or air it frequently becomes hot and often bursts out into eruptions beside this as the external air cannot readily reach the bottom or be renewed there an observable heat is perceived below without the necessity of recurring to the central heat for an explanation  hence therefore there are two principal causes of the warmth at the bottom of mine the heat of the substances of which the sides are composed and the want of renovation in the air below any sulphurous substance mixed with iron produces a very great heat by the admission of water if for instance a quantity of sulphur be mixed with a proportionable share of iron filings and both kneaded together into a soft paste with water they will soon grow hot and at last produce a flame this experiment produced by art is very commonly effected within the bowels of the earth by nature sulphurs and irons are intimately blended together and want only the mixture of water of air to excite their heat and this when once raised is communicated to all bodies that lie within the sphere of their operation those beautiful minerals called marcasites and pyrites are often of this composition and wherever they are found either by imbibing the moisture of the air or having been by any means combined with water they render the mine considerably hot kircher mund subt vol ii p       the want of fresh air also at these depths is as we have said another reason for their being found much hotter indeed without the assistance of art the bottom of most mines would from this cause be insupportable to remedy this inconvenience the miners are often obliged to sink at some convenient distance from the mouth of the pit where they are at work another pit which joins the former below and which in derbyshire is called an airshaft through this the air circulates and thus the workmen are enabled to breathe freely at the bottom of the place which becomes as mr boil affirms very commodious for respiration and also very temperate as to heat and cold boil vol iii p      mr lock however who has left us an account of the mendip mines seems to present a different picture the descent into these is exceeding difficult and dangerous for they are not sunk like wells perpendicularly but as the crannies of the rocks happen to run the constant method is to swing down by a rope placed under the arms and clamber along by applying both feet and hands to the sides of the narrow passage the air is conveyed into them through a little passage that runs along the sides from the top where they set up some turfs on the leeside of the hole to catch and force it down these turfs being removed to the windy side or laid over the mouth of the hole the miners below presently want breath and faint and if sweet smelling flowers chance to be placed there they immediately lose their fragrancy and stink like carrion an air so very putrefying can never be very commodious for respiration  indeed if we examine the complexion of most miners we shall be very well able to form a judgment of the unwholsomness of the place where they are confined their pale and sallow looks show how much the air is damaged by passing through those deep and winding ways that are rendered humid by damps or warmed with noxious exhalations but although every mine is unwholesome all are not equally so coalmines are generally less noxious than those of tin tin than those of copper but of all none are so dreadfully destructive as those of quicksilver at the mines near the village of idra nothing can adequately describe the deplorable infirmities of such as fill the hospital there emaciated and crippled every limb contracted or convulsed and some in a manner transpiring quicksilver at every pore there was one man says dr pope phil trans vol ii p      who was not in the mines above half a year and yet whose body was so impregnated with this mineral that putting a piece of brass money in his mouth or rubbing it between his fingers it immediately became as white as if it had been washed over with quicksilver in this manner all the workmen are killed sooner or later first becoming paralytic and then dying consumptive and all this they sustain for the trifling reward of sevenpence a day  but these metalic mines are not so noxious from their own vapors as from those of the substances with which the ores are usually united such as arsenic cinnabar bitumen or vitriol from the fumes of these variously combined and kept enclosed are produced those various damps that put on so many dreadful forms and are usually so fatal sometimes those noxious vapors are perceived by the delightful fragrance of their smell ibid p      somewhat resembling the peablossom in bloom from whence one kind of damp has its name the miners are not deceived however by its flattering appearances but as they thus have timely notice of its coming they avoid it while it continues which is generally during the whole summer season another shows its approach by the burning of the candles which seem to collect their flame into a globe of light and thus gradually lessen till they are quite extinguished from this also the miners frequently escape however such as have the misfortune to be caught in it either swoon away and are suffocated or slowly recover in excessive agonies here is also a third called the fulminating damp much more dangerous than either of the former as it strikes down all before it like a flash of gunpowder without giving any warning of its approach but there is still another more deadly than all the rest which is found in those places where the vapor has been long confined and has been by some accident set free the air rushing out from thence always goes upon deadly errands and scarce any escape to describe the symptoms of its operations  some colliers in scotland working near an old mine that had been long closed up happened inadvertently to open an hole into it from the pit where they were then employed by great good fortune they at that time perceived their error and instantly fled for their lives the next day however they were resolved to renew their work in the same pit and eight of them ventured down without any great apprehensions but they had scarce got to the bottom of the stairs that led to the pit but coming within the vapor they all instantly dropped down dead as if they had been shot amongst these unfortunate poor men there was one whose wife was informed that he was stifled in the mine and as he happened to be next the entrance she so far ventured down as to see where he lay as she approached the place the sight of her husband inspired her with a desire to rescue him if possible from that dreadful situation though a little reflection might have shown her it was then too late but nothing could deter her she ventured forward and had scarce touched him with her hand when the damp prevailed and the misguided but faithful creature fell dead by his side  thus the vapors found beneath the surface of the earth are very various in their effects upon the constitution and they are not less in their appearances there are many kinds that seemingly are no way prejudicial to health but in which the workmen breathe freely and yet in these if a lighted candle be introduced they immediately take fire and the whole cavern at once becomes one furnace of flame in mines therefore subject to damps of this kind they are obliged to have recourse to a very peculiar contrivance to supply sufficient light for their operations this is by a great wheel the circumference of which is beset with flints which striking against steels placed for that purpose at the extremity a stream of fire is produced which affords light enough and yet which does not set fire to the mineral vapor  of this kind are the vapors of the mines about bristol on the contrary in other mines a single spark struck out from the collision of flint and steel would set the whole shaft in a flame in such therefore every precaution is used to avoid a collision the workmen making use only of wooden instruments in digging and being cautious before they enter the mine to take out even the nails from their shoes whence this strange difference should arise that the vapors of some mines catch fire with a spark and others only with a flame is a question that we must be content to leave in obscurity till we know more of the nature both of mineral vapor and of fire this only we may observe that gunpowder will readily fire with a spark but not with the flame of a candle on the other hand spirits of wine will flame with a candle but not with a spark but even here the cause of this difference as yet remains a secret  as from this account of mines it appears that the internal parts of the globe are filled with vapors of various kinds it is not suprizing that they should at different times reach the surface and there put on various appearances in fact much of the salubrity and much of the unwholsomeness of climates and soils is to be ascribed to these vapors which make their way from the bowels of the earth upwards and refresh or taint the air with their exhalations salt mines being naturally cold phil trans vol ii p      send forth a degree of coldness to the external air to comfort and refresh it on the contrary metallic mines are known not only to warm it with their exhalations but often to destroy all kinds of vegetation by their volatile corrosive fumes in some mines dense vapors are plainly perceived issuing from their mouths and sensibly warm to the touch in some places neither snow nor ice will continue on the ground that covers a mine and over others the fields are found destitute of verdure boil vol iii p      the inhabitants also are rendered dreadfully sensible of these subterraneous exhalations being affected with such a variety of evils proceeding entirely from this cause that books have been professedly written upon this class of disorders  nor are these vapors which thus escape to the surface of the earth entirely unconfined for they are frequently in a manner circumscribed to a spot the grotto del cane near naples is an instance of this the noxious effects of which have made that cavern so very famous this grotto which has so much employed the attention of travelers lies within four miles of naples and is situated near a large lake of clear and wholesome water kircher mund subt vol i p      nothing can exceed the beauty of the landscape which this lake affords being surrounded with hills covered with forests of the most beautiful verdure and the whole bearing a kind of amphitheatrical appearance however this region beautiful as it appears is almost entirely uninhabited the few peasants that necessity compels to reside there looking quite consumptive and ghastly from the poisonous exhalations that rise from the earth the famous grotto lies on the side of an hill near which place a peasant resides who keeps a number of dogs for the purpose of showing the experiment to the curious these poor animals always seem perfectly sensible of the approach of a stranger and endeavor to get out of the way however their attempts being perceived they are taken and brought to the grotto the noxious effects of which they have so frequently experienced upon entering this place which is a little cave or hole rather dug into the hill about eight feet high and twelve feet long the observer can see no visible marks of its pestilential vapor only to about a foot from the bottom the wall seems to be tinged with a color resembling that which is given by stagnant waters when the dog this poor philosophical martyr as some have called him is held above this mark he does not seem to feel the smallest inconvenience but when his head is thrust down lower he struggles to get free for a little but in the space of four or five minutes he seems to lose all sensation and is taken out seemingly without life being plunged in the neighboring lake he quickly recovers and is permitted to run home seemingly without the smallest injury  this vapor which thus for a time suffocates is of the humid kind as it extinguishes a torch and sullies a lookingglass but there are other vapors perfectly inflamable and that only require the approach of a candle to set them blazing of this kind was the burning well at brosely which is now stopped up the vapor of which when a candle was brought within about a foot of the surface of the water caught flame like spirits of wine and continued blazing for several hours after of this kind also are the perpetual fires in the kingdom of persia in that province where the worshippers of fire hold their chief mysteries the whole surface of the earth for some extent seems impregnated with inflamable vapors a reed stuck into the ground continues to burn like a flambeaux an hole made beneath the surface of the earth instantly becomes a furnace answering all the purposes of a culinary fire there they make lime by merely burying the stones in the earth and watch with veneration the appearances of a flame that has not been extinguished for times immemorial how different are men in various climates this deluded people worship these vapors as a deity which in other parts of the world are considered as one of the greatest evils  chap ix of volcanoes and earthquakes depiction of a volcano a volcano e martin sculp   mines and caverns as we have said reach but a very little way under the surface of the earth and we have hitherto had no opportunities of exploring further without all doubt the wonders that are still unknown surpass those that have been represented as there are depths of thousands of miles which are hidden from our enquiry the only tidings we have from those unfathomable regions are by means of volcanoes those burning mountains that seem to discharge their materials from the lowest abysses of the earth busson vol i p      a volcano may be considered as a cannon of immense size the mouth of which is often near two miles in circumference from this dreadful apperture are discharged torrents of flame and sulphur and rivers of melted metal whole clouds of smoke and ashes with rocks of enormous size are discharged to many miles distance so that the force of the most powerful artillery is but as a breeze agitating a feather in comparison in the deluge of fire and melted matter which runs down the sides of the mountain whole cities are sometimes swallowed up and consumed those rivers of liquid fire are sometimes two hundred feet deep and when they harden frequently form considerable hills nor is the danger of these confined to the eruption only but the force of the internal fire struggling for vent frequently produces earthquakes through the whole region where the volcano is situated so dreadful have been these appearances that mens terrors have added new horrors to the scene and they have regarded as prodigies what we know to be the result of natural causes some philosophers have considered them as vents communicating with the fires of the center and the ignorant as the mouths of hell itself astonishment produces fear and fear superstition the inhabitants of iceland believe the bellowings of hecla are nothing else but the cries of the damned and that its eruptions are contrived to increase their tortures  but if we regard this astonishing scene of terror with a more tranquil and inquisitive eye we shall find that these conflagrations are produced by very obvious and natural causes we have already been apprized of the various mineral substances in the bosom of the earth and their aptness to burst out into flames marcasites and pyrites in particular by being humefied with water or air contract this heat and often endeavor to expand with irresistible explosion these therefore being lodged in the depths of the earth or in the bosom of mountains and being either washed by the accidental influx of waters below or fanned by air insinuating itself through perpendicular fissures from above take fire at first by only heaving in earthquakes but at length by bursting through every obstacle and making their dreadful discharge in a volcano  these volcanoes are found in all parts of the earth in europe there are three that are very remarkable aetna in sicily vesuvius in italy and hecla in iceland aetna has been a volcano for ages immemorial its eruptions are very violent and its discharge has been known to cover the earth sixtyeight feet deep in the year      an eruption of this mountain produced an earthquake through the whole island for twelve days overturned many houses and at last formed a new aperture which overwhelmed all within five leagues round the cinders thrown up were driven even into italy and its burnings were seen at malta at the distance of sixty leagues there is nothing more awful says kircher than the eruptions of this mountain nor nothing more dangerous than attempting to examine its appearances even long after the eruption has ceased as we attempt to clamber up its steepy sides every step we take upward the feet sink back half way upon arriving near the summit ashes and snow with an ill assorted conjunction present nothing but objects of desolation nor is this the worst for as all places are covered over many caverns are entirely hidden from the sight into which if the enquirer happens to fall he sinks to the bottom and meets inevitable destruction upon coming to the edge of the great crater nothing can sufficiently represent the tremendous magnificence of the scene a gulf two miles over and so deep that no bottom can be seen on the sides pyramidical rocks starting out between apertures that emit smoke and flame all this accompanied with a sound that never ceases louder than thunder strikes the bold with horror and the religious with veneration for him that has power to control its burnings  in the descriptions of vesuvius or hecla we shall find scarce any thing but a repetition of the same terrible objects but rather lessened as these mountains are not so large as the former the crater of vesuvius is but a mile across according to the same author whereas that of aetna is two on this particular however we must place no dependence as these caverns every day alter being lessened by the mountains sinking in at one eruption and enlarged by the fury of another it is not one of the least remarkable particulars respecting vesuvius that pliny the naturalist was suffocated in one of its eruptions for his curiosity impelling him too near he found himself involved in smoke and cinders when it was too late to retire and his companions hardly escaped to give an account of the misfortune it was in that dreadful eruption that the city of herculaneum was overwhelmed the ruins of which have been lately discovered at sixty feet distance below the surface and what is still more remarkable forty feet below the bed of the sea one of the most remarkable eruptions of this mountain was in the year   0  which is finely described by valetta a part of whose description i shall beg leave to translate  toward the latter end of summer in the year   0  the mount vesuvius that had for a long time been silent now began to give some signs of commotion little more than internal murmurs at first were heard that seemed to contend within the lowest depths of the mountain no flame nor even any smoke was as yet seen soon after some smoke appeared by day and a flame by night which seemed to brighten all the campania at intervals also it shot off substances with a sound very like that of artillery but which even at so great a distance as we were at infinitely exceeded them in greatness soon after it began to throw up ashes which becoming the sport of the winds fell at great distances and some many miles to this succeeded showers of stones which killed many of the inhabitants of the valley but made a dreadful ravage among the cattle soon after a torrent of burning matter began to roll down the sides of the mountain at first with a slow and gentle motion but soon with increased celerity the matter thus poured out when cold seemed upon inspection to be of vitrified earth the whole united into a mass of more than stony hardness but what was particularly observable was that upon the whole surface of these melted materials a light spongy stone seemed to float while the lower body was of the hardest substance of which our roads are usually made hitherto there were no appearances but what had been often remarked before but on the third or fourth day seeming flashes of lightening were shot forth from the mouth of the mountain with a noise far exceeding the loudest thunder these flashes in color and brightness resembled what we usually see in tempests but they assumed a more twisted and serpentine form after this followed such clouds of smoke and ashes that the whole city of naples in the midst of the day was involved in nocturnal darkness and the nearest friends were unable to distinguish each other in this frightful gloom if any person attempted to stir out without torchlight he was obliged to return and every part of the city was filled with supplications and terror at length after a continuance of some hours about one oclock at midnight the wind blowing from the north the stars began to be seen the heavens though it was night began to grow brighter and the eruptions after a continuance of fifteen days to lessen the torrent of melted matter was seen to extend from the mountain down to the shore the people began to return to their former dwellings and the whole face of nature to resume its former appearance  the famous bishop berkley gives an account of one of these eruptions in a manner something different from the former phil trans vol ii p  0  in the year      and the middle of april with much difficulty i reached the top of mount vesuvius in which i saw a vast apperture full of smoke which hindered me from seeing its depth and figure i heard within that horrid gulf certain extraordinary sounds which seemed to proceed from the bowels of the mountain a sort of murmuring sighing dashing sound and between whiles a noise like that of thunder or cannon with a clattering like that of tiles falling from the tops of houses into the streets sometimes as the wind changed the smoke grew thinner discovering a very ruddy flame and the circumference of the crater streaked with red and several shades of yellow after an hours stay the smoke being moved by the wind gave us short and partial prospects of the great hollow in the flat bottom of which i could discern two furnaces almost contiguous that on the left seeming about three yards over glowing with ruddy flame and throwing up red hot stones with an hideous noise which as they fell back caused the clattering already taken notice of may   in the morning i ascended the top of vesuvius a second time and found a different face of things the smoke ascending upright gave a full prospect of the crater which as i could judge was about a mile in circumference and an hundred yards deep a conical mount had been formed since my last visit in the middle of the bottom which i could see was made by the stones thrown up and fallen back again into the crater in this new hill remained the two furnaces already mentioned the one was seen to throw up every three or four minutes with a dreadful sound a vast number of red hot stones at least three hundred feet higher than my head as i stood upon the brink but as there was no wind they fell perpendicularly back from whence they had been discharged the other was filled with red hot liquid matter like that in the furnace of a glasshouse raging and working like the waves of the sea with a short abrupt noise this matter would sometimes boil over and run down the side of the conical hill appearing at first red hot but changing color as it hardened and cooled had the wind driven in our faces we had been in no small danger of stifling by the sulphurous smoke or being killed by the masses of melted minerals that were shot from the bottom but as the wind was favorable i had an opportunity of surveying this amazing scene for above an hour and an half together on the fifth of june after an horrid noise the mountain was seen at naples to work over and about three days after its thunders were renewed so that not only the windows in the city but all the houses shook from that time it continued to overflow and sometimes at night were seen columns of fire shooting upward from its summit on the tenth when all was thought to be over the mountain again renewed its terrors roaring and raging most violently one cannot form a juster idea of the noise in the most violent fits of it than by imagining a mixed sound made up of the raging of a tempest the murmur of a troubled sea and the roaring of thunder and arillery confused all together though we heard this at the distance of twelve miles yet it was very terrible i therefore resolved to approach nearer to the mountain and accordingly three or four of us got into a boat and were set ashore at a little town situated at the foot of the mountain from thence we rode about four or five miles before we came to the torrent of fire that was descending from the side of the volcano and here the roaring grew exceeding loud and terrible as we approached i observed a mixture of colors in the cloud above the crater green yellow red blue there was likewise a ruddy dismal light in the air over that tract where the burning river flowed these circumstances set off and augmented by the horror of the night made a scene the most uncommon and astonishing i ever saw which still increased as we approached the burning river imagine a vast torrent of liquid fire rolling from the top down the side of the mountain and with irresistible fury bearing down and consuming vines olives and houses and divided into different channels according to the inequalities of the mountain the largest stream seemed half a mile broad at least and five miles long i walked so far before my companions up the mountain along the side of the river of fire that i was obliged to retire in great haste the sulphurous steam having surprised me and almost taken away my breath during our return which was about three oclock in the morning the roaring of the mountain was heard all the way while we observed it throwing up huge spouts of fire and burning stones which falling resembled the stars in a rocket sometimes i observed two or three distinct columns of flame and sometimes one only that was large enough to fill the whole crater these burning columns and fiery stones seemed to be shot a thousand feet perpendicular above the summit of the volcano and in this manner the mountain continued raging for six or eight days after on the eighteenth of the same month the whole appearance ended and the mountain remained perfectly quiet without any visible smoke or flame  the matter which is found to roll down from the mouth of all volcanoes in general resembles the dross that is thrown from a smiths forge but it is different perhaps in various parts of the globe for as we have already said there is not a quarter of the world that has not its volcanoes in asia particularly in the islands of the indian ocean there are many one of the most famous is that of albouras near mount taurus the summit of which is continually on fire and covers the whole adjacent country with ashes in the island of ternate there is a volcano which some travelers assert burns most furiously in the times of the equinoxes because of the winds which then contribute to increase the flames in the molucca islands there are many burning mountains they are also seen in japan and the islands adjacent and in java and sumatra as well as in other of the philippine islands in africa there is a cavern near fez which continually sends forth either smoke or flames in the cape de verde islands one of them called the island del fuogo continually burns and the portuguese who frequently attempted a settlement there have as often been obliged to desist the peak of teneriffe is as every body knows a volcano that seldom desists from eruptions but of all parts of the earth america is the place where those dreadful irregularities of nature are the most conspicuous vesuvius and aetna itself are but mere fireworks in comparison to the burning mountains of the andes which as they are the highest mountains of the world so also are they the most formidable for their eruptions the mountain of arequipa in peru is one of the most celebrated carassa and malahallo are very considerable but that of cotopaxi in the province of quito exceeds any thing we have hitherto read or heard of the mountain of cotopaxi as described by ulloa ulloa vol i p      is more than three miles perpendicular from the sea and it became a volcano at the time of the spaniards first arrival in that country a new eruption of it happened in the year      having been some days preceded by a continual roaring in its bowels the sound of one of these mountains is not like that of the volcanoes in europe confined to a province but is heard at an hundred and fifty miles distance ulloa vol i p      an aperture was made in the summit of this immense mountain and three more about equal heights near the middle of its declivity which was at that time buried under prodigious masses of snow the ignited substances ejected on that occasion mixed with a prodigious quantity of ice and snow melting amidst the flames were carried down with such astonishing rapidity that in an instant the valley from callo to latacunga was overflowed and besides its ravages in bearing down the houses of the indians and other poor inhabitants great numbers of people lost their lives the river of latacunga was the channel of this terrible flood till being too small for receiving such a prodigious current it overflowed the adjacent country like a vast lake near the town and carried away all the buildings within its reach the inhabitants retired into a spot of higher ground behind the town of which those parts which stood within the limits of the current were totally destroyed the dread of still greater devastations did not subside for three days during which the volcano ejected cinders while torrents of melte ice and snow poured down its sides the eruption lasted several days and was accompanied with terrible roarings of the wind rushing through the volcano still louder than the former rumblings in its bowels at last all was quiet neither fire nor smoke to be seen nor noise to be heard till in the ensuing year the flames again appeared with recruited violence forcing their passage through several other parts of the mountain so that in clear nights the flames being reflected by the transparent ice formed an awfully magnificent illumination  such is the appearance and the effect of those fires which proceed from the more inward recesses of the earth for that they generally come from deeper regions than man has hitherto explored i cannot avoid thinking contrary to the opinion of mr buffon who supposes them rooted but a very little way below the bed of the mountain we can never suppose says this great naturalist that these substances are ejected from any great distance below if we only consider the great force already required to fling them up to such vast heights above the mouth of the mountain if we consider the substances thrown up which we shall find upon inspection to be the same with those of the mountain below if we take into our consideration that air is always necessary to keep up the flame but most of all if we attend to one circumstance which is that if these substances were exploded from a vast depth below the same force required to shoot them up so high would act against the sides of the volcano and tear the whole mountain in pieces to all this specious reasoning particular answers might easily be given as that the length of the funnel increases the force of the explosion that the sides of the funnel are actually often burst with the great violence of the flame that air may be supposed at depths at least as far as the perpendicular fissures descend but the best answer is a wellknown fact namely that the quantity of matter discharged from aetna alone is supposed upon a moderate computation to exceed twenty times the original bulk of the mountain kircher mund subt vol   p  0   the greatest part of sicily seems covered with its eruptions the inhabitants of catanea have found at the distance of several miles streets and houses sixty feet deep overwhelmed by the lava or matter it has discharged but what is still more remarkable the walls of these very houses have been built of materials evidently thrown up by the mountain the inference from all this is very obvious that the matter thus exploded cannot belong to the mountain itself otherwise it would have been quickly consumed it cannot be derived from moderate depths since its amazing quantity evinces that all the places near the bottom must have long since been exhausted nor can it have an extensive and if i may so call it a superficial spread for then the country round would be quickly undermined it must therefore be supplied from the deeper regions of the earth those undiscovered tracts where the deity performs his wonders in solitude satisfied with selfapprobation  chap x of earthquakes having given the theory of volcanoes we have in some measure given also that of earthquakes they both seem to proceed from the same cause only with this difference that the fury of the volcano is spent in the eruption that of an earthquake spreads wider and acts more fatally by being confined the volcano only affrights a province earthquakes have laid whole kingdoms in ruin  philosophers aristotle agricola buffon have taken some pains to distinguish between the various kinds of earthquakes such as the tremulous the pulsative the perpendicular and the inclined but these are rather the distinctions of art than of nature mere accidental differences arising from the situation of the country or of the cause if for instance the confined fire acts directly under a province or a town it will heave the earth perpendicularly upward and produce a perpendicular earthquake if it acts at a distance it will raise that tract obliquely and thus the inhabitants will perceive an inclined one  nor does it seem to me that there is much greater reason for mr buffons distinction of earthquakes one kind of which he supposes buffon vol ii     to be produced by fire in the manner of volcanoes and confined to but a very narrow circumference the other kind he ascribes to the struggles of confined air expanded by heat in the bowels of the earth and endeavoring to get free for how do these two causes differ fire is an agent of no power whatsoever without air it is the air which being at first comprest and then dilated in a cannon that drives the ball with such force it is the air struggling for vent in a volcano that throws up its contents to such vast heights in short it is the air confined in the bowels of the earth and acquiring elasticity by heat that produces all those appearances which are generally ascribed to the operation of fire when therefore we are told that there are two causes of earthquakes we only learn that a greater or smaller quantity of heat produces those terrible effects for air is the only active operator in either  some philosophers however have been willing to give the air as great a share in producing these terrible efforts as they could and magnifying its powers have called in but a very moderate degree of heat to put it in action although experience tells us that the earth is full of inflamable materials and that fires are produced wherever we descend although it tells us that those countries where there are volcanoes are most subject to earthquakes yet they step out of the way and so find a new solution these only allow but just heat enough to produce the most dreadful phoenomena and backing their assertions with long calculations give theory an air of demonstration mr amontons memoires de l accademie de sciences an   0  has been particularly sparing of the internal heat in this respect and has shown perhaps accurately enough that a very moderate degree of heat may suffice to give the air amazing powers of expansion  it is amazing enough however to trace the progress of a philosophical fancy let loose in immaginary speculations they run thus a very moderate degree of heat may bring the air into a condition capable of producing earthquakes for the air at the depth of fortythree thousand five hundred and twentyeight fathom below the surface of the earth becomes almost as heavy as quicksilver this however is but a very slight depth in comparison of the distance to the center and is scarce a seventieth part of the way the air therefore at the center must be infinitely heavier than mercury or any body that we know of this granted we shall take something more and say that it is very probable there is nothing but air at the center now let us suppose this air heated by some means even to the degree of boiling water as we have proved that the density of the air is here very great its elasticity must be in proportion an heat therefore which at the surface of the earth would have produced but a slight expansive force must at the center produce one very extraordinary and in short be perfectly irresistible hence this force may with great ease produce earthquakes and if increased it may convulse the globe it may by only adding figures enough to the calculation destroy the solar system and even the fixed stars themselves these reveries generally produce nothing for as i have ever observed increased calculations while they seem to tire the memory give the reasoning faculty perfect repose  however as earthquakes are the most formidable ministers of nature it is not to be wondered that a multitude of writers have been curiously employed in their consideration woodward has ascribed the cause to a stoppage of the waters below the earths surface by some accident these being thus accumulated and yet acted upon by fires which he supposes still deeper both contribute to heave up the earth upon their bosom this he thinks accounts for the lakes of water produced in an earthquake as well as for the fires that sometimes burst from the earths surface upon those dreadful occasions there are others still who have supposed that the earth may be itself the cause of its own convulsions when say they the roots or basis of some large tract is worn away by a fluid underneath the earth sinking therein its weight occasions a tremor of the adjacent parts sometimes producing a noise and sometimes an inundation of water not to tire the reader with an history of opinions instead of facts some have ascribed them to electricity and some to the same causes that produce thunder  it would be tedious therefore to give all the various opinions that have employed the speculative upon this subject the activity of the internal heat seems alone sufficient to account for every appearance that attends these tremendous irregularities of nature to conceive this distinctly let us suppose at some vast distance under the earth large quantities of inflamable matter pyrites bitumens and marcasites disposed and only waiting for the aspersion of water or the humidity of the air to put their fires in motion at last this dreadful mixture arrives waters find their way into those depths through the perpendicular fissures or air insinuates itself through the same minute apertures strait new appearances ensue those substances which for ages before lay dormant now conceive new apparent qualities they grow hot produce new air and only want room for expansion however the narrow apertures by which the air or water had at first admission are now closed up yet as new air is continually generated and as the heat every moment gives this air new elasticity it at length bursts and dilates all round and in its struggles to get free throws all above it into similar convulsions thus an earthquake is produced more or less extensive according to the depth or the greatness of the cause  but before we proceed with the causes let us take a short view of the appearances which have attended the most remarkable earthquakes by these we shall see how far the theorist corresponds with the historian the greatest we find in antiquity is that mentioned by pliny plin lib ii cap     in which twelve cities in asia minor were swallowed up in one night he tells us also of another near the lake thrasymene which was not perceived by the armies of the carthaginians and romans that were then engaged near that lake although it shook the greatest part of italy in another place ibid lib iii cap    he gives the following account of an earthquake of an extraordinary kind when lucius marcus and sextus julius were consuls there appeared a very strange prodigy of the earth as i have read in the books of aetruscan discipline which happened in the province of mutina two mountains shocked against each other approaching and retiring with the most dreadful noise they at the same time and in the midst of the day appeared to cast forth fire and smoke while a vast number of roman knights and travelers from the aemilian way stood and continued amazed spectators several towns were destroyed by this shock and all the animals that were near them were killed in the times of trajan the city of antioch and a great part of the adjacent country was buried by an earthquake about three hundred years after in the times of justinian it was once more destroyed together with forty thousand inhabitants and after an interval of sixty years the same illfated city was a third time overturned with the loss of not less than sixty thousand souls in the year      most of the cities of syria and the kingdom of jerusalem were destroyed by the same accident in the year      the italian historians describe an earthquake at puteoli which caused the sea to retire two hundred yards from its former bed  but one of those most particularly described in history is that of the year      the damages of which were chiefly felt in sicily but its motion perceived in germany france and england it extended to a circumference of two thousand six hundred leagues chiefly affecting the seacoasts and great rivers more perceivable also upon the mountains than in the valleys its motions were so rapid that those who lay at their length were tossed from side to side as upon a rolling billow phil trans  the walls were dashed from their foundations and no less than fiftyfour cities with an incredible number of villages were either destroyed or greatly damaged the city of catanea in particular was utterly overthrown a traveller who was on his way thither at the distance of some miles perceived a black cloud like night hanging over the place the sea all of a sudden began to roar mount aetna to send forth great spires of flame and soon after a shock ensued with a noise as if all the artillery in the world had been at once discharged our traveller being obliged to alight instantly felt himself raised a foot from the ground and turning his eyes to the city he with amazement saw nothing but a thick cloud of dust in the air the birds flew about astonished the sun was darkened the beasts ran howling from the hills and although the shock did not continue above three minutes yet near nineteen thousand of the inhabitants of sicily perished in the ruins catanea to which city the describer was traveling seemed the principal scene of ruin its place only was to be found and not a footstep of its former magnificence was to be seen remaining  the earthquake which happened in jamaica in      was very terrible and its description sufficiently minute in two minutes time it destroyed the town of portugal and sunk the houses in a gulf forty fathoms deep it was attended with an hollow rumbling noise like that of thunder and in less than a minute three parts of the houses and their inhabitants were all sunk quite under water while they were thus swallowed up on one side of the street on the other the houses were thrown into heaps the sand of the street rising like the waves of the sea lifting up those that stood upon it and immediately overwhelming them in pits all the wells discharged their waters with the most vehement agitation the sea felt an equal share of turbulence and bursting over its mounds deluged all that came in its way the fissures of the earth were in some places so great that one of the streets appeared twice as broad as formerly in many places however it opened and closed again and continued this agitation for some time of these openings two or three hundred might be seen at a time in some whereof the people were swallowed up in others the earth closing caught them by the middle and thus crushed them instantly to death other openings still more dreadful than the rest swallowed up whole streets and others more formidable still spouted up whole cataracts of water drowning such as the earthquake had spared the whole was attended with the most noisome stench while the thundering of the distant falling mountains the whole sky overcast with a dusky gloom and the crush of falling habitations gave unspeakable horror to the scene after this dreadful calamity was over the whole island seemed converted into a scene of desolation scarce a planters house was left standing almost all were swallowed up houses people trees shared one universal ruin and in their places appeared great pools of water which when dried up by the sun left only a plain of barren sand without any vestige of former inhabitants most of the rivers during the earthquake were stopped up by the falling in of the mountains and it was not till after some time that they made themselves new channels the mountains seemed particularly attacked by the force of the shock and it was supposed that the principal seat of the concussion was among them those who were saved got on board ships in the harbor where many remained above two months the shocks continuing during that interval with more or less violence every day  as this description seems to exhibit all the appearances that usually make up the catalogue of terrors belonging to an earthquake i will suppress the detail of that which happened at lisbon in our own times and which is too recent to require a description in fact there are few particulars in the accounts of those who were present at that scene of desolation that we have not more minutely and accurately transmitted to us by former writers whose narratives i have for that reason preferred i will therefore close this description of human calamities with the account of the dreadful earthquake at calabria in      it is related by the celebrated father kircher as it happened while he was on his journey to visit mount aetna and the rest of the wonders that lie toward the south of italy i need scarce inform the reader that kircher is considered by scholars as one of the greatest prodigies of learning  having hired a boat in company with four more two friars of the order of st francis and two seculars we launched on the twentyfourth of march from the harbor of messina in sicily and arrived the same day at the promontory of pelorus our destination was for the city of euphaemia in calabria where we had some business to transact and where we designed to tarry for some time however providence seemed willing to cross our design for we were obliged to continue for three days at pelorus upon account of the weather and though we often put out to sea yet we were as often driven back at length however wearied with the delay we resolved to prosecute our voyage and although the sea seemed more than usually agitated yet we ventured forward the gulf of charybdis which we approached seemed whirled round in such a manner as to form a vast hollow verging to a point in the center proceeding onward and turning my eyes to aetna i saw it cast forth large volumes of smoke of mountainous sizes which entirely covered the whole island and blotted out the very shores from my view this together with the dreadful noise and the sulphurous stench which was strongly perceived filled me with apprehensions that some more dreadful calamity was impending the sea itself seemed to wear a very unusual appearance those who have seen a lake in a violent shower of rain covered all over with bubbles will conceive some idea of its agitations my surprise was still increased by the calmness and serenity of the weather not a breeze not a cloud which might be supposed to put all nature thus into motion i therefore warned my companions that an earthquake was approaching and after some time making for the shore with all possible diligence we landed at tropaea happy and thankful for having escaped the threatening dangers of the sea but our triumphs at land were of short duration for we had scarce arrived at the jesuits college in that city when our ears were stunned with an horrid sound resembling that of an infinite number of chariots driven fiercely forward the wheels rattling and the thongs cracking soon after this a most dreadful earthquake ensued so that the whole tract upon which we stood seemed to vibrate as if we were in the scale of a balance that continued wavering this motion however soon grew more violent and being no longer able to keep my legs i was thrown prostrate upon the ground in the mean time the universal ruin round me redoubled my amazement the crash of falling houses the tottering of towers and the groans of the dying all contributed to raise my terror and despair on every side of me i saw nothing but a scene of ruin and danger threatening wherever i should fly i commended myself to god as my last great refuge at that hour o how vain was every sublunary happiness wealth honor empire wisdom all mere useless sounds and as empty as the bubbles in the deep just standing on the threshold of eternity nothing but god was my pleasure and the nearer i approached i only loved him the more after some time however finding that i remained unhurt amidst the general concussion i resolved to venture for safety and running as fast as i could reached the shore but almost terrified out of my reason i did not search long here till i found the boat in which i had landed and my companions also whose terrors were even greater than mine our meeting was not of that kind where every one is desirous of telling his own happy escape it was all silence and a gloomy dread of impending terrors  leaving this seat of desolation we prosecuted our voyage along the coasts and the next day came to rochetta where we landed although the earth still continued in violent agitations but we were scarce arrived at our inn when we were once more obliged to return to the boat and in about half an hour we saw the greatest part of the town and the inn at which we had set up dashed to the ground and burying all its inhabitants beneath its ruins  in this manner proceeding onward in our little vessel finding no safety at land and yet from the smallness of our boat having but a very dangerous continuance at sea we at length landed at lopizium a castle midway between tropaea and euphemia the city to which as i said before we were bound here wherever i turned my eyes nothing but scenes of ruin and horror appeared towns and castles levelled to the ground strombalo though at sixty miles distance belching forth flames in an unusual manner and with a noise which i could distinctly hear but my attention was quickly turned from more remote to contiguous danger the rumbling sound of an approaching earthquake which we by this time were grown acquainted with alarmed us for the consequences it every moment seemed to grow louder and to approach more near the place on which we stood now began to shake most dreadfully so that being unable to stand my companions and i caught hold of whatever shrub grew next us and supported ourselves in that manner  after some time this violent paroxysm ceasing we again stood up in order to prosecute our voyage to euphaemia that lay within sight in the mean time while we were preparing for this purpose i turned my eyes toward the city but could see only a frightful dark cloud that seemed to rest upon the place this the more surprised us as the weather was so very serene we waited therefore till the cloud was past away then turning to look for the city it was totally sunk wonderful to tell nothing but a dismal and putrid lake was seen where it stood we looked about to find some one that could tell us of its sad catastrophe but could see none all was become a melancholy solitude a scene of hideous desolation thus proceeding pensively along in quest of some human being that could give us some little information we at length saw a boy sitting by the shore and appearing stupefied with terror of him therefore we enquired concerning the fate of the city but he could be got to give us no answer we entreated him with every expression of tenderness and pity to tell us but his senses were quite wrapped up in the contemplation of the danger he had escaped we offered him some victuals but he seemed to loath the sight we still persisted in our offices of kindness but he only pointed to the place of the city like one out of his senses and then running up into the woods was never heard of after such was the fate of the city of euphaemia and as we continued our melancholy course along the shore the whole coast for the space of two hundred miles presented nothing but the remains of cities and men scattered without an habitation over the fields proceeding thus along we at length ended our distressful voyage by arriving at naples after having escaped a thousand dangers both at sea and land    the reader i hope will excuse me for this long translation from a favorite writer and that the sooner as it contains some particulars relative to earthquakes not to be found elsewhere from the whole of these accounts we may gather that the most concomitant circumstances are these  a rumbling sound before the earthquake this proceeds from the air or fire or both forcing their way through the chasms of the earth and endeavoring to get free which is also heard in volcanoes  a violent agitation or heaving of the sea sometimes before and sometimes after that at land this agitation is only a similar effect produced on the waters with that at land and may be called for the sake of perspicuity a seaquake and this also is produced by volcanoes  a spouting up of waters to great heights it is not easy to describe the manner in which this is performed but volcanoes also perform the same vesuvius being known frequently to eject a vast body of waters  a rocking of the earth to and fro and sometimes a perpendicular bouncing if it may be so called of the same this difference chiefly arises from the situation of the place with respect to the subterranean fire directly under it lifts at a farther distance it rocks  some earthquakes seem to travel onward and are felt in different countries at different hours the same day this arises from the great shock being given to the earth at one place and that being communicated onward by an undulatory motion successively affects different regions in its progress as the blow given by a stone falling in a lake is not perceived at the shores till some time after the first concussion  the shock is sometimes instantaneous like the explosion of gunpowder and sometimes tremulous and continuing for several minutes the nearer the place where the shock is first given the more instantaneous and simple it appears at a greater distance the earth redoubles the first blow with a sort of vibratory continuation  as waters have generally so great a share in producing earthquakes it is not to be wondered that they should generally follow those breaches made by the force of fire and appear in the great chasms which the earthquake has opened  these are some of the most remarkable phoenomena of earthquakes presenting a frightful assemblage of the most terrible effects of air earth fire and water  the valley of solfatara near naples seems to exhibit in a minuter degree whatever is seen of this horrible kind on the great theater of nature this plain which is about twelve hundred feet long and a thousand broad is embosomed in mountains and has in the middle of it a lake of noisome blackish water covered with a bitumen that floats upon its surface in every part of this plain caverns appear smoking with sulphur and often emitting flames the earth wherever we walk over it trembles beneath the feet noises of flames and the hissing of waters are heard at the bottom the water sometimes spouts up eight or ten feet high the most noisome fumes foetid water and sulphurous vapors offend the smell a stone thrown into any of the caverns is ejected again with considerable violence these appearances generally prevail when the sea is any way disturbed and the whole seems to exhibit the appearance of an earthquake in miniature however in this smaller scene of wonders as well as in the greater there are many appearances for which perhaps we shall never account and many questions may be asked which no conjectures can thoroughly resolve it was the fault of the philosophers of the last age to be more inquisitive after the causes of things than after the things themselves they seemed to think that a confession of ignorance cancelled their claims to wisdom they therefore had a solution for every demand but the present age has grown if not more inquisitive at least more modest and none are now ashamed of that ignorance which labor can neither remedy nor remove  chap xi of the appearance of new islands and tracts and of the disappearing of others hitherto we have taken a survey only of the evils which are produced by subterranean fires but we have mentioned nothing of the benefits they may possibly produce they may be of use in warming and cherishing the ground in promoting vegetation and giving a more exquisite flavor to the productions of the earth the imagination of a person who has never been out of our own mild region can scarcely reach to that luxuriant beauty with which all nature appears clothed in those very countries that we have but just now described as desolated by earthquakes and undermined by subterranean fires it must be granted therefore that though in those regions they have a greater share in the dangers they have also a larger proportion in the benefits of nature  but there is another advantage arising from subterranean fires which though hitherto disregarded by man yet may one day become serviceable to him i mean that while they are found to swallow up cities and plains in one place they are also known to produce promontaries and islands in another we have many instances of islands being thus formed in the midst of the sea which though for a long time barrren have afterward become fruitful seats of happiness and industry  new islands are formed in two ways either suddenly by the action of subterraneous fires or more slowly by the deposition of mud carried down by rivers and stopped by some accident buffon vol ii p      with respect particularly to the first ancient historians and modern travelers give us such accounts as we can have no room to doubt of seneca assures us that in his time the island of therasia appeared unexpectedly to some mariners as they were employed in another pursuit pliny assures us that thirteen islands in the mediterranean appeared at once emerging from the water the cause of which he ascribes rather to the retiring of the sea in those parts than to any subterraneous elevation however he mentions the island of hiera near that of therasia as formed by subterraneous explosions and adds to his list several others formed in the same manner in one of which he relates that fish in great abundance were found and that all those who eat of them died shortly after  on the twentyfourth of may hist del accad an   0  p     in the year   0  a slight earthquake was perceived at santorin and the day following at sunrising an object was seen by the inhabitants of that island at two or three miles distance at sea which appeared like a floating rock some persons desirous either of gain or incited by curiosity went there and found even while they stood upon this rock that it seemed to rise beneath their feet they perceived also that its surface was covered with pumice stones and oysters which it had raised from the bottom every day after until the fourteenth of june this rock seemed considerably to increase and then was found to be half a mile round and about thirty feet above the sea the earth of which it was composed seemed whitish with a small portion of clay soon after this the sea again appeared troubled and steams arose which were very offensive to the inhabitants of santorin but on the sixteenth of the succeeding month seventeen or eighteen rocks more were seen to rise out of the sea and at length to join together all this was accompanied with the most terrible noise and fires that proceeded from the island that was newly formed the whole mass however of all this newformed earth uniting increased every day both in height and breadth and by the force of its explosions cast forth rocks to seven miles distance this continued to bear the same dreadful appearances till the month of november in the same year and it is at present a volcano which sometimes renews its explosions it is about three miles in circumference and more than from thirtyfive to forty feet high  it seems extraordinary that about this place in particular islands have appeared at different times particularly that of hiera mentioned above which has received considerable additions in succeeding ages justin justin l  0 cap   tells us that at the time the macedonians were at war with the romans a new island appeared between those of theramenes and therasia by means of an earthquake we are told that this became half as big again about a thousand years after another island rising up by its side and joining to it so as scarce at present to be distinguished from the former  a new island was formed in the year    0 near that of tercera near the continent of africa by the same causes in the beginning of december at night there was a terrible earthquake at that place and the top of a new island appeared which cast forth smoke in vast quantities the pilot of a ship who approached it sounded on one side of this island and could not find ground at sixty fathom at the other side the sea was totally tinged of a different color exhibiting a mixture of white blue and green and was very shallow this island on its first appearance was larger than it is at present for it has since that time sunk in such a manner as to be scarce above water  a traveller whom these appearances could not avoid affecting speaks of them in this manner phil trans vol v p     what can be more surprising than to see fire not only break out of the bowels of the earth but also to make itself a passage through the waters of the sea what can be more extraordinary or foreign to our common notions of things than to see the bottom of the sea rise up into a mountain above the water and become so firm an island as to be able to resist the violence of the greatest storms i know that subterraneous fires when pent in a narrow passage are able to raise up a mass of earth as large as an island but that this should be done in so regular and exact a manner that the water of the sea should not be able to penetrate and extinguish those fires that after having made so many passages they should retain force enough to raise the earth and in fine after having been extinguished that the mass of earth should not fall down or sink again with its own weight but still remain in a manner suspended over the great arch below this is what to me seems more surprising than any thing that has been related of mount aetna vesuvius or any other volcano  such are his sentiments however there are few of these appearances any way more extraordinary than those attending volcanoes and earthquakes in general we are not more to be surprised that inflammable substances should be found beneath the bottom of the sea than at similar depths at land these have all the force of fire giving expansion to air and tending to raise the earth at the bottom of the sea till it at length heaves above water these marine volcanoes are not so frequent for if we may judge of the usual procedure of nature it must very often happen that before the bottom of the sea is elevated above the surface a chasm is opened in it and then the water pressing in extinguishes the volcano before it has time to produce its effects this extinction however is not effected without very great resistance from the fire beneath the water upon dashing into the cavern is very probably at first ejected back with great violence and thus some of those amazing waterspouts are seen which have so often astonished the mariner and excited curiosity  but of these in their place  besides the production of those islands by the action of fire there are others as was said produced by rivers or seas carrying mud earth and such like substances along with their currents and at last depositing them in some particular place at the mouths of most great rivers there are to be seen banks thus formed by the sand and mud carried down with the stream which have rested at that place where the force of the current is diminished by its junction with the sea these banks by slow degrees increase at the bottom of the deep the water in those places is at first found by mariners to grow more shallow the bank soon heaves up above the surface it is considered for a while as a tract of useless and barren sand but the seeds of some of the more hardy vegetables are driven thither by the wind they take root and thus binding the sandy surface the whole spot is clothed in time with a beautiful verdure in this manner there are delightful and inhabited islands at the mouths of many rivers particularly the nile the po the missisippi the ganges and the senegal there has been in the memory of man a beautiful and large island formed in this manner at the mouth of the river nanquin in china made from depositions of mud at its opening it is not less than sixty miles long and about twenty broad la loubere informs us lettres curieuses et edificantes sec xi p      in his voyage to siam that these sandbanks increase every day at the mouths of all the great rivers in asia and hence he asserts that the navigation up these rivers becomes every day more difficult and will at one time or another be totally obstructed the same may be remarked with regard to the wolga which has at present seventy openings into the caspian sea and of the danube which has seven into the euxine we have had an instance of the formation of a new island not very long since at the mouth of the humber in england it is yet within the memory of man says the relator phil trans vol iv p      since it began to raise its head above the ocean it began its appearance at low water for the space of a few hours and was buried again till the next tides retreat thus successively it lived and died until the year      when it began to maintain its ground against the insult of the waves and then first invited the aid of human industry a bank was thrown about its rising grounds and being thus defended from the incursions of the sea it became firm and solid and in a short time afforded good pasturage for cattle it is about nine miles in circumference and is worth to the proprietor about eight hundred pounds a year it would be endless to mention all the islands that have been thus formed and the advantages that have been derived from them however it is frequently found that new islands thus formed may often be considered as only turning the rivers from their former beds so that in proportion as land is gained at one part it is lost by the overflowing of some other  little therefore is gained by such accessions nor is there much more by the new islands which are sometimes formed from the spoils of the continent mariners assure us that there are sometimes whole plains unrooted from the main lands by floods and tempests these being carried out to sea with all their trees and animals upon them are frequently seen floating in the ocean and exhibiting a surprising appearance of rural tranquillity in the midst of danger the greatest part however having the earth at their roots at length washed away are dispersed and their animals drowned but now and then some are found to brave the fury of the ocean till being stuck either among rocks or sands they again take firm footing and become permanent islands  as different causes have thus concurred to produce new islands so we have accounts of others that the same causes have contributed to destroy we have already seen the power of earthquakes exerted in sinking whole cities and leaving lakes in their room there have been islands and regions also that have shared the same fate and have sunk with their inhabitants never more to be heard of thus pausanias pausanias i  in arcad p  0  tells us of an island called chryses that was sunk near lemnos pliny mentions several among others the island cea for thirty miles having been washed away with several thousands of its inhabitants but of all the noted devastations of this kind the total submersion of the island of atalantis as mentioned by plato has been most the subject of speculation mankind in general now consider the whole of his account as an ingenious fable but when fables are grown famous by time and authority they become an agreeable if not a necessary part of literary information  about nine thousand years are passed says plato plato in critia  since the island of atalantis was in being the priests of egypt were well acquainted with it and the first heroes of athens gained much glory in their wars with the inhabitants this island was as large as asia minor and syria united and was situated beyond the pillars of hercules in the atlantic ocean the beauty of the buildings and the fertility of the soil were far beyond any thing a modern imagination can conceive gold and ivory were every where common and the fruits of the earth offered themselves without cultivation the arts and the courage of the inhabitants were not inferior to the happiness of their situation and they were frequently known to make conquests and overrun the continent of europe and asia the imagination of the poetical philosopher riots in the description of the natural and acquired advantages which they long enjoyed in this charming region if says he we compare that country to our own ours will appear a mere wasted skeleton when opposed to it their mountains to the very tops were clothed with fertility and poured down rivers to enrich the plains below  however all these beauties and benefits were destroyed in one day by an earthquake sinking the earth and the sea overwhelming it at present not the smallest vestiges of such an island are to be found plato remains as the only authority for its existence and philosophers dispute about its situation it is not for me to enter into the controversy when there appears but little probability to support the fact and indeed it would be useless to run back nine thousand years in search of difficulties as we are surrounded with objects that more closely affect us and that demand admiration at our very doors when i consider as lactantius suggests the various vicissitudes of nature lands swallowed by yawning earthquakes or overwhelmed in the deep rivers and lakes disappearing or dried away mountains levelled into plains and plains swelling up into mountains i cannot help regarding this earth as a place of very little stability as a transient abode of still more transitory beings  chap xii of mountains having at last in some measure emerged from the deeps of the earth we come to a scene of greater splendor the contemplation of its external appearance in this survey its mountains are the first objects that strike the imagination and excite our curiosity there is not perhaps any thing in all nature that impresses an unaccustomed spectator with such ideas of awful solemnity as these immense piles of natures erecting that seem to mock the minuteness of human magnificence  in countries where there are nothing but plains the smallest elevations are apt to excite wonder in holland which is all a flat they show a little ridge of hills near the seaside which boerhaave generally marked out to his pupils as being mountains of no small consideration what would be the sensations of such an auditory could they at once be presented with a view of the heights and precipices of the alps or the andes even among us in england we have no adequate ideas of a mountainprospect our hills are generally sloping from the plain and clothed to the very top with verdure we can scarce therefore lift our imaginations to those immense piles whose tops peep up behind intervening clouds sharp and precipitate and reach to heights that human avarice or curiosity have never been able to ascend  we in this part of the world are not for that reason so immediately interested in the question which has so long been agitated among philosophers concerning what gave rise to these inequalities on the surface of the globe in our own happy region we generally see no inequalities but such as contribute to use and beauty and we therefore are amazed at a question enquiring how such necessary inequalities came to be formed and seeming to express a wonder how the globe comes to be so beautiful as we find it but though with us there may be no great cause for such a demand yet in those places where mountains deform the face of nature where they pour down cataracts or give fury to tempests there seems to be good reason for enquiry either into their causes or their uses it has been therefore asked by many in what manner mountains have come to be formed or for what uses they are designed  to satisfy curiosity in these respects much reasoning has been employed and very little knowledge propagated with regard to the first part of the demand the manner in which mountains were formed we have already seen the conjectures of different philosophers on that head one supposing that they were formed from the earths broken shell at the time of the deluge another that they existed from the creation and only acquired their deformities in process of time a third that they owed their original to earthquakes and still a fourth with much more plausibility than the rest ascribing them entirely to the fluctuations of the deep which he supposes in the beginning to have covered the whole earth such as are pleased with disquisitions of this kind may consult burnet whiston woodward or buffon nor would i be thought to decry any mental amusements that at worst keep us innocently employed but for my own part i cannot help wondering how the opposite demand has never come to be made and why philosophers have never asked how we come to have plains plains are sometimes more prejudicial to man than mountains upon plains an inundation has greater power the beams of the sun are often collected there with suffocating fierceness they are sometimes found desert for several hundred miles together as in the country east of the caspian sea although otherwise fruitful merely because there are no risings nor depressions to form reservoirs or collect the smallest rivulet of water the most rational answer therefore why either mountains or plains were formed seems to be that they were thus fashioned by the hand of wisdom in order that pain and pleasure should be so contiguous as that morality might be exercised either in bearing the one or communicating the other  indeed the more i consider this dispute respecting the formation of mountains the more i am struck with the futility of the question there is neither a strait line nor an exact superficies in all nature if we consider a circle even with mathematical precision we shall find it formed of a number of small right lines joining at angles together these angles therefore may be considered in a circle as mountains are upon our globe and to demand the reason for the one being mountainous or the other angular is only to ask why a circle is a circle or a globe is a globe in short if there be no surface without inequality in nature why should we be surprised that the earth has such it has often been said that the inequalities of its surface are scarce distinguishable if compared to its magnitude and i think we have every reason to be content with the answer  some however have avoided the difficulty by urging the final cause they allege that mountains have been formed merely because they are useful to man this carries the enquirer but a part of the way for no one can affirm that in all places they are useful the contrary is known by horrid experience in those valleys that are subject to their influence however as the utility of any part of our earthly habitation is a very pleasing and flattering speculation to every philosopher it is not to be wondered that much has been said to prove the usefulness of these for this purpose many conjectures have been made that have received a degree of assent even beyond their evidence for men were unwilling to become more miserably wise  it has been alleged as one principal advantage that we derive from them that they serve like hoops or ribs to strengthen our earth and to bind it together in consequence of this theory kircher has given us a map of the earth in this manner hooped with its mountains which might have a much more solid foundation did it entirely correspond with truth  others have found a different use for them especially when they run surrounding our globe which is that they stop the vapors that are continually traveling from the equator to the poles for these being urged by the heat of the sun from the warm regions of the line must all be accumulated at the poles if they were not stopped in their way by those high ridges of mountains which cross their direction but an answer to this may be that all the great mountains in america lie lengthwise and therefore do not cross their direction  but to leave these remote advantages others assert that not only the animal but vegetable part of the creation would perish for want of convenient humidity were it not for their friendly assistance their summits are by these supposed to arrest as it were the vapors which float in the regions of the air their large inflexions and channels are considered as so many basins prepared for the reception of those thick vapors and impetuous rains which descend into them the huge caverns beneath are so many magazines or conservatories of water for the peculiar service of man and those orifices by which the water is discharged upon the plain are so situated as to enrich and render them fruitful instead of returning through subterraneous channels to the sea after the performance of a tedious and fruitless circulation nature displayed vol iii p      however this be certain it is that almost all our great rivers find their source among mountains and in general the more extensive the mountain the greater the river thus the river amazons the greatest in the world has its source among the andes which are the highest mountains on the globe the river niger travels a long course of several hundred miles from the mountains of the moon the highest in all africa and the danube and the rhine proceed from the alps which are probably the highest mountains of europe  it need scarce be said that with respect to height there are many sizes of mountains from the gently rising upland to the tall craggy precipice the appearance is in general different in those of different magnitudes the first are clothed with verdure to the very tops and only seem to ascend to improve our prospects or supply us with a purer air but the lofty mountains of the other class have a very different aspect at a distance their tops are seen in wavy ridges of the very color of the clouds and only to be distinguished from them by their figure which as i have said resembles the billows of the sea lettres philosophiques sur la formation etc p      as we approach the mountain assumes a deeper color it gathers upon the sky and seems to hide half the horizon behind it its summits also are become more distinct and appear with a broken and perpendicular line what at first seemed a single hill is now found to be a chain of continued mountains whose tops running along in ridges are embosomed in each other so that the curvatures of one are fitted to the prominences of the opposite side and form a winding valley between often of several miles in extent and all the way continuing nearly of the same breadth nothing can be finer or more exact than mr popes description of a traveller straining up the alps every mountain he comes to he thinks will be the last he finds however an unexpected hill rise before him and that being scaled he finds the highest summit almost at as great a distance as before upon quitting the plain he might have left a green and a fertile soil and a climate warm and pleasing as he ascends the ground assumes a more russet color the grass becomes more mossy and the weather more moderate still as he ascends the weather becomes more cold and the earth more barren in this dreary passage he is often entertained with a little valley of surprising verdure caused by the reflected heat of the sun collected into a narrow spot on the surrounding heights but it much more frequently happens that he sees only frightful precipices beneath and lakes of amazing depths from whence rivers are formed and fountains derive their original on those places next the highest summits vegetation is scarcely carried on here and there a few plants of the most hardy kind appear the air is intolerably cold either continually refrigerated with frosts or disturbed with tempests all the ground here wears an eternal covering of ice and snows that seem constantly accumulating upon emerging from this war of the elements he ascends into a purer and a serener region where vegetation is entirely ceased where the precipices composed entirely of rocks rise perpendicularly above him while he views beneath him all the combat of the elements clouds at his feet and thunders darting upward from their bosoms below ulloa vol i  a thousand meteors which are never seen on the plain present themselves circular rainbows ibid  mock suns the shadow of the mountain projected upon the body of the air phil trans vol v p      and the travellers own image reflected as in a lookingglass upon the opposite cloud ulloa vol i   such are in general the wonders that present themselves to a traveller in his journey either over the alps or the andes but we must not suppose that this picture exhibits either a constant or an invariable likeness of those stupendous heights indeed nothing can be more capricious or irregular than the forms of many of them the tops of some run in ridges for a considerable length without interruption in others the line seems notched by great valleys to an amazing depth sometimes a solitary and a single mountain rises from the bosom of the plain and sometimes extensive plains and even provinces as those of savoy and quito are found embosomed near the tops of mountains in general however those countries that are most mountainous are the most barren and uninhabitable  if we compare the heights of mountains with each other we shall find that the greatest and highest are found under the line buffon passim  it is thought by some that the rapidity of the earths motion in these parts together with the greatness of the tides there may have thrown up those stupendous masses of earth but be the cause as it may it is a remarkable fact that the inequalities of the earths surface are greatest there near the poles the earth indeed is craggy and uneven enough but the heights of the mountains there are very inconsiderable on the contrary at the equator where nature seems to sport in the amazing size of all her productions the plains are extensive and the mountains remarkably lofty some of them are known to rise three miles perpendicular above the bed of the ocean  to enumerate the most remarkable of these according to their size we shall begin with the andes of which we have an excellent description by ulloa who went thither by command of the king of spain in company with the french academicians to measure a degree of the meridian his journey up these mountains is too curious not to give an extract from it  after many incommodious days sailing up the river guayaquil he arrived at caracol a town situated at the foot of the andes nothing could exceed the inconveniences which he experienced in this voyage from the flies and moschitoes an animal resembling our gnat we were the whole day says he in continual motion to keep them off but at night our torments were excessive our gloves indeed were some defense to our hands but our faces were entirely exposed nor were our clothes a sufficient defense for the rest of our bodies for their stings penetrating through the cloth caused a very painful and fiery itching one night in coming to an anchor near a large and handsome house that was uninhabited we had no sooner seated ourselves in it than we were attacked on all sides by swarms of moschitoes so that it was impossible to have one moments quiet those who had covered themselves with clothes made for this purpose found not the smallest defense wherefore hoping to find some relief in the open fields they ventured out though in danger of suffering in a more terrible manner from the serpents but both places were equally obnoxious on quitting this inhospitable retreat we the next night took up our quarters in an house that was inhabited the host of which being informed of the terrible manner we had past the night before he gravely told us that the house we so greatly complained of had been forsaken on account of its being the purgatory of a soul but we had more reason to believe that it was quitted on account of its being the purgatory of the body after having journeyed for upwards of three days through boggy roads in which the mules at every step sunk up to their bellies we began at length to perceive an alteration in the climate and having been long accustomed to heat we now began to feel it grown sensibly colder it is remarkable that at tariguagua we often see instances of the effects of two opposite temperatures in two persons happening to meet one of them leaving the plains below and the other descending from the mountain the former thinks the cold so severe that he wraps himself up in all the garments he can procure while the latter finds the heat so great that he is scarce able to bear any clothes whatsoever the one thinks the water so cold that he avoids being sprinkled by it the other is so delighted with its warmth that he uses it as a bath nor is the case very different in the same person who experiences the same diversity of sensation upon his journey up and upon his return this difference only proceeds from the change naturally felt at leaving a climate to which one has been accustomed and coming into another of an opposite temperature  the ruggedness of the road from tariguagua leading up the mountain is not easily described in some parts the declivity is so great that the mules can scarce keep their footing and in others the acclivity is equally difficult the trouble of having people going before to mend the road the pains arising from the many falls and bruises and the being constantly wet to the skin might be supported were not these inconveniences augmented by the sight of such frightful precipices and deep abysses as must fill the mind with ceaseless terror there are some places where the road is so steep and yet so narrow that the mules are obliged to slide down without making any use of their feet whatsoever on one side of the rider in this situation rises an eminence of several hundred yards and on the other an abyss of equal depth so that if he in the least checks his mule so as to destroy the equilibrium they both must unavoidably perish  after having traveled about nine days in this manner slowly winding along the side of the mountain we began to find the whole country covered with an hoar frost and an hut in which we lay had ice on it having escaped many perils we at length after a journey of fifteen days arrived upon the plain on the extremity of which stands the city of quito the capital of one of the most charming regions upon earth here in the center of the torrid zone the heat is not only very tolerable but in some places the cold also is painful here they enjoy all the temperature and advantages of perpetual spring their fields being always covered with verdure and enamelled with flowers of the most lively colors however although this beautiful region be higher than any other country in the world and although it took up so many days of painful journey in the ascent it is still overlooked by tremendous mountains their sides covered with snow and yet flaming with volcanoes at the top these seem piled one upon the other and rise to a most astonishing height with great coldness however at a determined point above the surface of the sea the congelation is found at the same height in all the mountains those parts which are not subject to a continual frost have here and there growing upon them a rush resembling the genista but much more soft and flexible toward the extremity of the part where the rush grows and the cold begins to increase is found a vegetable with a round bulbous head which when dried becomes of amazing elasticity higher up the earth is entirely bare of vegetation and seems covered with eternal snow the most remarkable mountains are that of cotopaxi already described as a volcano chimborazo and pichincha cotopaxi is more than three geographical miles above the surface of the sea the rest are not much inferior on the top of the latter was my station for measuring a degree of the meridian where i suffered particular hardships from the intenseness of the cold and the violence of the storms the sky around was in general involved in thick fogs which when they cleared away and the clouds by their gravity moved nearer to the surface of the earth they appeared surrounding the foot of the mountain at a vast distance below like a sea encompassing an island in the midst of it when this happened the horrid noises of tempests were heard from beneath then discharging themselves on quito and the neighboring country i saw the lightenings issue from the clouds and heard the thunders roll far beneath me all this time while the tempest was raging below the mountain top where i was placed enjoyed a delightful serenity the wind was abated the sky clear and the enlivening rays of the sun moderated the severity of the cold however this was of no very long duration for the wind returned with all its violence and with such velocity as to dazzle the sight whilst my fears were increased by the dreadful concussions of the precipice and the fall of enormous rocks the only sounds that were heard in this frightful situation    such is the animated picture of these mountains as given us by this ingenious spaniard and i believe the reader will wish that i had made the quotation still longer a passage over the alps or a journey across the pyrenees appear petty trips or excursions in the comparison and yet these are the most lofty mountains we know of in europe  if we compare the alps with the mountains already described we shall find them but little more than one half of the height of the former the andes upon being measured by the barometer are found above three thousand one hundred and thirtysix toises or fathoms above the surface of the sea ulloa vol i p      whereas the highest point of the alps is not above sixteen hundred the one in other words is above three miles high the other about a mile and a half the highest mountains of asia are mount taurus mount immaus mount caucasus and the mountains of japan  of these none equals the andes in height although mount caucasus which is the highest of them makes very near approaches father verbiest tells of a mountain in china which he measured and found a mile and a half high verbiest alla chine  in africa the mountains of the moon famous for giving source to the niger and the nile are rather more noted than known of the pike of teneriffe one of the canary islands that lie off this coast we have more certain information in the year      it was visited by a company of english merchants who traveled up to the top where they observed its height and the volcano on its very summit phil trans vol v  they found it an heap of mountains the highest of which rises over the rest like a sugar loaf and gives a name to the whole mass it is computed to be a mile and an half perpendicular from the surface of the sea kircher gives us an estimate of the heights of most of the other great mountains in the world but as he has taken his calculations in general from the ancients or from modern travelers who had not the art of measuring them they are quite incredible the art of taking the heights of places by the barometer is a new and an ingenious invention as the air grows lighter as we ascend the fluid in the tube rises in due proportion thus the instrument being properly marked gives the height with a tolerable degree of exactness at least enough to satisfy curiosity  few of our great mountains have been estimated in this manner travelers having perhaps been deterred by a supposed impossibility of breathing at the top however it has been invariably found that the air in the highest that our modern travelers have ascended is not at all too fine for respiration at the top of the pike of teneriff there was found no other inconvenience from the air except its coldness at the top of the andes there was no difficulty of breathing perceived the accounts therefore of those who have asserted that they were unable to breathe although at much less heights are greatly to be suspected in fact it is very natural for mankind to paint those obstacles as insurmountable which they themselves have not had the fortitude or perseverance to surmount  the difficulty and danger of ascending to the tops of mountains proceeds from other causes not the thinness of the air for instance some of the summits of the alps have never yet been visited by man but the reason is that they rise with such a rugged and precipitate ascent that they are utterly inaccessible in some places they appear like a great wall of six or seven hundred feet high in others there stick out enormous rocks that hang upon the brow of the steep and every moment threaten destruction to the traveller below  in this manner almost all the tops of the highest mountains are bare and pointed and this naturally proceeds from their being so continually assaulted by thunders and tempests all the earthy substances with which they might have been once covered have for ages been washed away from their summits and nothing is left remaining but immense rocks which no tempest has hitherto been able to destroy  nevertheless time is every day and every hour making depredations and huge fragments are seen tumbling down the precipice either loosened from the summit by frost or rains or struck down by lightening nothing can exhibit a more terrible picture than one of these enormous rocks commonly larger than an house falling from its height with a noise louder than thunder and rolling down the side of the mountain doctor plot tells us of one in particular which being loosened from its bed tumbled down the precipice and was partly shattered into a thousand pieces notwithstanding one of the largest fragments of the same still preserving its motion traveled over the plain below crossed a rivulet in the midst and at last stopped on the other side of the bank these fragments as was said are often struck off by lightening and sometimes undermined by rains but the most usual manner in which they are disunited from the mountain is by frost the rains insinuating between the interstices of the mountain continue there until there comes a frost and then when converted into ice the water swells with an irresistible force and produces the same effect as gunpowder splitting the most solid rocks and thus shattering the summits of the mountain  but not rocks alone but whole mountains are by various causes disunited from each other we see in many parts of the alps amazing clefts the sides of which so exactly correspond with the opposite that no doubt can be made of their having been once joined together at cajeta buffon vol ii p      in italy a mountain was split in this manner by an earthquake and there is a passage opened through it that appears as if elaborately done by the industry of man in the andes these breaches are frequently seen that at thermopyle in greece has been long famous the mountain of the troglodytes in arabia has thus a passage through it and that in savoy which nature began and which victor amadeus completed is an instance of the same kind  we have accounts of some of these disruptions immediately after their happening in the month of june hist de l accademie des sciences p   an       in the year      a part of the mountain of diableret in the district of valais in france suddenly fell down between two and three oclock in the afternoon the weather being very calm and serene it was of a conical figure and destroyed fiftyfive cottages in the fall fifteen persons together with about an hundred beasts were also crushed beneath its ruins which covered an extent of a good league square the dust it occasioned instantly covered all the neighborhood in darkness the heaps of rubbish were more than three hundred feet high they stopped the current of a river that ran along the plain which now is formed into several new and deep lakes there appeared through the whole of this rubbish none of those substances that seemed to indicate that this disruption had been made by means of subterraneous fires most probably the base of this rocky mountain was rotted and decayed and thus fell without any extraneous violence in the same manner in the year      the town of pleurs in france was buried beneath a rocky mountain at the foot of which it was situated  these accidents and many more that might be enumerated of the same kind have been produced by various causes by earthquakes as in the mountain at cajeta or by being decayed at the bottom as at diableret but the most general way is by the foundation of one part of the mountain being hollowed by waters and thus wanting a support breaking from the other thus it generally has been found in the great chasms in the alps and thus it almost always is known in those disruptions of hills which are known by the name of landslips these are nothing more than the sliding down of an higher piece of ground disrooted from its situation by subterraneous inundations and settling itself upon the plain below  there is not an appearance in all nature that so much astonished our ancestors as these landslips in fact to behold a large upland with its houses its corn and cattle at once loosened from its place and floating as it were upon the subjacent water to behold it quitting its ancient situation and traveling forward like a ship in quest of new adventures this is certainly one of the most extraordinary appearances that can be imagined and to a people ignorant of the powers of nature might well be considered as a prodigy accordingly we find all our old historians mentioning it as an omen of approaching calamities in this more enlightened age however its cause is very well known and instead of exciting ominous apprehensions in the populace it only gives rise to some very ridiculous lawsuits among them about whose the property shall be whether the land which has thus slipped shall belong to the original possessor or to him upon whose grounds it has encroached and settled what has been the determination of the judges is not so well known but the circumstances of the slips themselves have been minutely enough and exactly described  in the lands of slatberg phil trans vol iv p   0  in the kingdom of ireland there stood a declivity gradually ascending for near half a mile in the year      and on the  0th of march the inhabitants perceived a crack on its side somewhat like a furrow made with a plough which they imputed to the effects of lightening as there had been thunder the night before however on the evening of the same day they were surprised to hear an hideous confused noise issuing all round from the side of the hill and their curiosity being raised they resorted to the place there to their amazement they found the earth for near five acres all in gentle motion and sliding down the hill upon the subjacent plain this motion continued the remaining part of the day and the whole night nor did the noise cease during the whole time proceeding probably from the attrition of the ground beneath the day following however this strange journey down the hill ceased entirely and above an acre of the meadow below was found covered with what before composed a part of the declivity  however these slips when a whole mountains side seems to descend happen but very rarely there are some of another kind ever much more common and as they are always sudden much more dangerous these are snowslips well known and greatly dreaded by travelers it often happens that when snow has long been accumulated on the tops and on the sides of mountains it is borne down the precipice either by means of tempests or its own melting at first when loosened the volume in motion is but small but it gathers as it continues to roll and by the time it has reached the habitable parts of the mountain it is generally grown of enormous bulk wherever it rolls it levels all things in its way or buries them in unavoidable destruction instead of rolling it sometimes is found to slide along from the top yet even thus it is generally as fatal as before nevertheless we have had an instance a few years ago of a small family in germany that lived for above a fortnight beneath one of these snowslips although they were buried during that whole time in utter darkness and under a bed of some hundred feet deep yet they were luckily taken out alive the weight of the snow being supported by a beam that kept up the roof and nourishment being supplied them by the milk of an ass if i remember right that was buried under the same ruin  but it is not the parts alone that are thus found to subside whole mountains have been known totally to disappear pliny plin i   cap    tells us that in his own time the lofty mountain of cybotus together with the city of eurites were swallowed by an earthquake the same fate he says attended phlegium one of the highest mountains in aethiopia which after one nights concussion was never seen more in more modern times a very noted mountain in the molucca islands known by the name of the peak and remarkable for being seen at a very great distance from sea was swallowed by an earthquake and nothing but a lake was left in the place where it stood thus while storms and tempests are levelled against mountains above earthquakes and waters are undermining them below all our histories talk of their destruction and very few new ones if we except mount cenere and one or two such heaps of cinders are produced if mountains therefore were of such great utility as some philosophers make them to mankind it would be a very melancholy consideration that such benefits were diminishing every day but the truth is the valleys are fertilized by that earth which is washed from their sides and the plains become richer in proportion as the mountains decay  chap xiii of water in contemplating nature we shall often find the same substances possessed of contrary qualities and producing opposite effects air which liquifies one substance dries up another that fire which is seen to burn up the desert is often found in other places to assist the luxuriance of vegetation and water which next to fire is the most fluid substance upon earth nevertheless gives all other bodies their firmness and durability so that every element seems to be a powerful servant capable either of good or ill and only awaiting external direction to become the friend or the enemy of mankind these opposite qualities in this substance in particular have not failed to excite the admiration and enquiry of the curious  that water is the most fluid penetrating body next to fire and the most difficult to confine is incontestibly proved by a variety of experiments a vessel through which water cannot pass may be said to retain any thing it may be objected indeed that syrups oils and honey leak through some vessels that water cannot pass through but this is far from being the result of the greater tenuity and fineness of their parts it is owing to the rosin wherewith the wood of such vessels abounds which oils and syrups have a power of dissolving so that these fluids instead of finding their way may more properly be said to eat their way through the vessels that contain them however water will at last find its way even through these for it is known to escape through vessels of every substance glass only excepted other bodies may be found to make their way out more readily indeed as air when it finds a vent will escape at once and quicksilver because of its weight quickly penetrates through whatever chinky vessel confines it but water though it operates more slowly yet always finds a more certain issue as for instance it is well known that air will not pass through leather which water will very readily penetrate air also may be retained in a bladder but water will quickly ooze through and those who drive this to the greatest degree of precision pretend to say that it will pass through pores ten times smaller than air can do be this as it may we are very certain that its parts are so small that they have been actually driven through the pores of gold this has been proved by the famous florentine experiment in which a quantity of water was shut up in an hollow ball of gold and then pressed with an huge force by screws during which the fluid was seen to ooze out through the pores of the metal and to stand like a dew upon its surface  as water is thus penetrating and its parts thus minute it may easily be supposed that they enter into the composition of all bodies both vegetable animal and fossil this every chemists experience convinces him of and the mixture is the more obvious as it can always be separated by a gentle heat from those substances with which it had been united fire as was said will penetrate where water cannot pass but then it is not so easily to be separated but there is scarce any substance from which its water cannot be divorced the parings or filings of lead tin and antimony by distillation yield water plentifully the hardest stones sea salt nitre vitriol and sulphur are found to consist chiefly of water into which they resolve by force of fire all birds beasts and fishes says newton insects trees and vegetables with their parts grow from water and by putrefaction return to water again in short almost every substance that we see owes its texture and firmness to the parts of water that mix with its earth and deprived of this fluid it falls away into a mass of shapeless dust and ashes  from hence we see as was above hinted that this most fluid body when mixed with others gives them consistence and form water by being mixed with earth or ashes and formed into a vessel when baked before the fire becomes a copel remarkable for this that it will bear the utmost force of the hottest furnace that art can contrive so the chinese earth of which porcelane is made is nothing more than an artificial composition of earth and water united by heat and which a greater degree of heat could easily separate thus we see a body extremely fluid of itself in some measure assuming a new nature by being united with others we see a body whose fluid and dissolving qualities are so obvious giving consistence and hardness to all the substances of the earth  from considerations of this kind thales and many of the ancient philosophers held that all things were made of water in order to confirm this opinion helmont made an experiment by divesting a quantity of earth of all its oils and salts and then putting this earth so prepared into an earthen pot which nothing but rainwater could enter and planting a willow therein this vegetable so planted grew up to a considerable height and bulk merely from the accidental aspersion of rainwater while the earth in which it was planted received no sensible dimunition from this experiment he concluded that water was the only nourishment of the vegetable tribe and that vegetables being the nourishment of animals all organized substances therefore owed their support and being only to water but this has been said by woodward to be all a mistake for he shows that water being impregnated with earthy particles is only the conveyer of such substances into the pores of vegetables rather than an encreaser of them by its own bulk he shows that water is ever found to afford so much less nourishment in proportion as it is purified by distillation a plant in distilled water will not grow so fast as in water not distilled and if the same be distilled three or four times over the plant will scarce grow at all or receive any nourishment from it so that water as such does not seem the proper and only nourishment of vegetables but only the vehicle thereof which contains the nutritious particles and carries them through all parts of the plant water in its pure state may suffice to extend or swell the parts of a plant but affords vegetable matter in a moderate proportion  however this be it is agreed on all sides that water such as we find it is far from being a pure simple substance the most genuine we know is mixed with exhalations and dissolutions of various kinds and no expedient that has been hitherto discovered is capable of purifying it entirely if we filter and distill it a thousand times according to boerhaave it will still depose a sediment and by repeating the process we may evaporate it entirely away but can never totally remove its impurities some however assert that water properly distilled will have no sediment hills history of fossils  and that the little white speck which is found at the bottom of the still is a substance that enters from without kircher used to show in his musaeum a phial of water that had been kept for fifty years hermetically sealed hermetically sealing a glassvessel means no more than heating the mouth of the phial red hot and thus when the glass is become pliant squeezing the mouth together with a pair of pincers and then twisting it six or seven times round which effectually closes it up  during which time it deposed no sediment but continued as transparent as when first it was put in how far therefore it may be brought to a state of purity by distillation is unknown but we very well know that all such water as we every where see is a bed in which plants minerals and animals are all found confusedly floating together  rainwater which is a fluid of natures own distilling and which has been raised so high by evaporation is nevertheless a very mixed and impure substance exhalations of all kinds whether salts sulphurs or metals make a part of its substance and tend to increase its weight if we gather the water that falls after a thunderclap in a sultry summers day and let it settle we shall find a real salt sticking at the bottom in winter however its impure mixtures are fewer but still may be separated by distillation but as to that which is generally caught pouring from the tops of houses it is particularly foul being impregnated with the smoke of the chimnies the vapor of the slates or tiles and with other impurities that birds and animals may have deposited there besides though it should be supposed free from all these it is mixed with a quantity of air which after being kept for some time will be seen to separate  spring water is next in point of purity this according to doctor halley is collected from the air itself which being sated with water and coming to be condensed by the evenings cold is driven against the tops of the mountains where being condensed and collected it trickles down by the sides into the cavities of the earth and running for a while underground bubbles up in fountains upon the plain this having made but a short circulation has generally had no long time to dissolve or imbibe any foreign substances by the way  riverwater is generally more foul than the former wherever the stream flows it receives a tincture from its channel plants minerals and animals all contribute their share to add to its impurities so that such as live at the mouths of great rivers generally are subject to all those disorders which contaminated and unwholesome waters are known to produce of all the riverwater in the world that of the indus and the thames are said to be most light and wholesome  the impurest fresh water that we know is that of stagnating pools and lakes which in summer may be more properly considered as a jelly of floating insects than a collection of water in this millions of little reptiles undisturbed by any current which might crush their frames to pieces breed and engender the whole teems with shapeless life and only grows more fruitful by increasing putrefaction  of the purity of all these waters the lightness and not the transparency ought to be the test water may be extremely clear and beautiful to the eye and yet very much impregnated with mineral principles in fact seawater is the most transparent of any and yet is well known to contain a large mixture of salt and bitumen on the contrary those waters which are lightest have the fewest dissolutions floating in them and may therefore be the most useful for all the purposes of life but after all though much has been said upon this subject and although waters have been weighed with great assiduity to determine their degree of salubrity yet neither this nor their curdling with soap nor any other philosophical standard whatsoever will answer the purposes of true information experience alone ought to determine the useful or noxious qualities of every spring and experience assures us that different kinds of water are adapted to different constitutions an incontestible proof of this are the many medicinal springs throughout the world whose peculiar benefits are known to the natives of their respective countries these are of various kinds according to the different minerals with which they are impregnated hot saline sulphurous bituminous and oily but the account of these will come most properly under that of the several minerals by which they are produced  after all therefore we must be contented with but an impure mixture for our daily beverage and yet perhaps this very mixture may often be more serviceable to our health than that of a purer kind we know that it is so with regard to vegetables and why not also in general to man be this as it will if we are desirous of having water in its greatest purity we are ordered by the curious in this particular to distill it from snow gathered upon the tops of the highest mountains and to take none but the outer and superficial part thereof this we must be satisfied to call pure water but even this is far short of the pure unmixed philosophical element which in reality is no where to be found  as water is thus mixed with foreign matter and often the repository of minute animals or vegetable seeds we need not be surprised that when carried to sea it is always found to putrefy but we must not suppose that it is the element itself which thus grows putrid and offensive but the substances with which it is impregnated it is true the utmost precautions are taken to destroy all vegetable and animal substances that may have previously been lodged in it by boiling but notwithstanding this there are some that will still survive the operation and others that find their way during the time of its stowage seamen therefore assure us that their water is generally found to putrefy twice at least and sometimes three times in a long voyage in about a month after it has been at sea when the bung is taken out of the cask it sends up a noisome and dangerous vapor which would take fire upon the application of a candle phil trans vol v part ii p     the whole body of the water then is found replete with little wormlike insects that float with great briskness through all its parts these generally live for about a couple of days and then dying by depositing their spoils for a while increase the putrefaction after a time the heavier parts of these sinking to the bottom the lighter float in a scum at the top and this is what the mariners call the waters purging itself there are still however another race of insects which are bred very probably from the spoils of the former and produce after some time similar appearances these dying the water is then thought to change no more however it very often happens especially in hot climates that nothing can drive these nauseous insects from the ships store of water they often increase to a very disagreeable and frightful size so as to deter the mariner though parching with thirst from tasting that cup which they have contaminated  this water as thus described therefore is a very different fluid from that simple elementary substance upon which philosophical theories have been founded and concerning the nature of which there have been so many disputes elementary water is no way compounded but is without taste smell or color and incapable of being discerned by any of the senses except the touch this is the famous dissolvent of the chemists into which as they have boasted they can reduce all bodies and which makes up all other substances only by putting on a different disguise in some forms it is fluid transparent and evasive of the touch in others hard firm and elastic in some it is stiffened by cold in others dissolved by fire accordto them it only assumes external shapes from accidental causes but the mountain is as much a body of water as the cake of ice that melts on its brow and even the philosopher himself is composed of the same materials with the cloud or meteor which he contemplates  speculation seldom rests when it begins others disallowing the universality of this substance will not allow that in a state of nature there is any such thing as water at all what assumes the appearance say they is nothing more than melted ice ice is the real element of natures making and when found in a state of fluidity it is then in a state of violence all substances are naturally hard but some more readily melt with heat than others it requires a great heat to melt iron a smaller heat will melt copper silver gold tin and lead melt with smaller still ice which is a body like the rest melts with a very moderate warmth and quicksilver melts with the smallest warmth of all water therefore is but ice kept in continual fusion and still returning to its former state when the heat is taken away between these opposite opinions the controversy has been carried on with great ardour and much has been written on both sides and yet when we come to examine the debate it will probably terminate in this question whether cold or heat first began their operations upon water this is a fact of very little importance if known and what is more it is a fact we can never know  indeed if we examine into the operations of cold and heat upon water we shall find that they produce somewhat similar effects water dilates in its bulk by heat to a very considerable degree and what is more extraordinary it is likewise dilated by cold in the same manner  if water be placed over a fire it grows gradually larger in bulk as it becomes hot until it begins to boil after which no art can either increase its bulk or its heat by increasing the fire indeed it may be more quickly evaporated away but its heat and its bulk still continue the same by the expanding of this fluid by heat philosophers have found a way to determine the warmth or the coldness of other bodies for if put into a glass tube by its swelling and rising therein it shows the quantity of heat in the body to which it is applied by its contracting and sinking it shows the absence of the same instead of using water in this instrument which is called a thermometer they now make use of spirit of wine which is not apt to freeze and which is endued even with a greater expansion by heat than water the instrument consists of nothing more than a hollow ball of glass with a long tube growing out of it this being partly filled with spirits of wine tinctured red so as to be seen when it rises the ball is plunged into boiling water which making the spirit within expand and rise in the tube the water marks the greatest height to which it ascends at this point the tube is to be broken off and then hermetically sealed by melting the glass with a blowpipe a scale being placed by the side completes the thermometer now as the fluid expands or condenses with heat or cold it will rise and fall in the tube in proportion and the degree or quantity of ascent or descent will be seen in the scale  no fire as was said can make water hotter after it begins to boil we can therefore at any time be sure of an equable certain heat which is that of boiling water which is invariably the same the certainty of such an heat is not less useful than the instrument that measures it it affords a standard fixed degree of heat over the whole world boiling water being as hot in greenland as upon the coasts of guinea one fire is more intense than another of heat there are various degrees but boiling water is an heat every where the same and easily procurable  as heat thus expands water so cold when it is violent enough to freeze the same produces exactly the same effect and expands it likewise thus water is acted upon in the same manner by two opposite qualities being dilated by both as a proof that it is dilated by cold we have only to observe the ice which floats on the surface of a pond which it would not do were it not dilated and grown more bulky by freezing than the water which remains unfroze mr boil however put the matter past a doubt by a variety of experiments boil vol i p   0  having poured a proper quantity of water into a strong earthen vessel he exposed it uncovered to the open air in frosty nights and observed that continually the ice reached higher than the water before it was frozen he filled also a tube with water and stopped both ends with wax the water when froze was found to push out the stopples from both ends and a rod of ice appeared at each end of the tube which showed how much it was swollen by the cold within  from hence therefore we may be very certain of the colds dilating of the water and experience also shows that the force of this expansion has been found as great as any which heat has been found to produce the touchhole of a strong gunbarrel being stopped and a plug of iron forcibly driven into the muzzle after the barrel had been filled with water it was placed in a mixture of ice and salt the plug though soldered to the barrel at first gave way but being fixed in more firmly within a quarter of an hour the gunbarrel burst with a loud noise and blew up the cover of the box wherein it lay such is its force in an ordinary experiment but it has been known to burst cannons filled with water and then left to freeze for the cold congealing the water and the ice swelling it became irresistible the bursting of rocks by frost which is frequent enough in the northern climates and is sometimes seen in our own is an equal proof of the expansion of congealed water for having by some means insinuated itself into the body of the rock it has remained there till the cold was sufficient to affect it by congelation but when once frozen no obstacle is able to confine it from dilating and if it cannot otherwise find room the rock must burst asunder  this alteration in the bulk of water might have served as a proof that it was capable of being compressed into a narrower space than it occupied before but till of late water was held to be incompressible the general opinion was that no art whatsoever could squeeze it into a narrower compass that no power on earth for instance could crush a pint of water into a vessel that held an hairs breadth less than a pint and this said they appears from the famous florentine experiment where the water rather than suffer compressure was seen to ooze out through the pores of the solid metal and at length making a cleft in the side spun out with great vehemence but later trials have proved that water is very compressible and partakes of that elasticity which every other body possesses in some degree indeed had not mankind been dazzled by the brilliancy of one inconclusive experiment there were numerous reasons to convince them of its having the same properties with other substances ice which is water in another state is very elastic a stone flung slantingly along the surface of a pond bounds from the water several times which shows it to be elastic also but the trials of mr canton have put this past all doubt which being somewhat similar to those of the great boil who pressed it with weights properly applied carry sufficient conviction  what has been hitherto related is chiefly applicable to the element of water alone but its sluidity is a property that it possesses in common with several other substances in other respects greatly differing from it that quality which gives rise to the definition of a fluid namely that its parts are in a continual intestine motion seems extremely applicable to water what the shapes of those parts are it would be vain to attempt to discover every trial only shows the futility of the attempt all we find is that they are extremely minute and that they roll over each other with the greatest ease some indeed from this property alone have not hesitated to pronounce them globular and we have in all our hydrostatical books pictures of these little globes in a state of sliding and rolling over each other but all this is merely the work of imagination we know that substances of any kind reduced very small assume a fluid appearance somewhat resembling that of water mr boil after finely powdering and sifting a little dry powder of plaster of paris put it in a vessel over the fire where it soon began to boil like water exhibiting all the motions and appearances of a boiling liquor although but a powder the parts of which we know are very different from each other and just as accident has formed them yet it heaved in great waves like water upon agitation an heavy body will sink to the bottom and a light one emerge to the top there is no reason therefore to suppose the figure of the parts of water round since we see their fluidity very well imitated by a composition the parts of which are of various forms and sizes the shape of the parts of water therefore we must be content to continue ignorant of all we know is that earth air and fire all conduce to separate the parts from each other  earthy substances divide the parts from each other and keep them asunder this division may be so great that the water will entirely lose its fluidity thereby mud potters clay and dried bricks are but so many different combinations of earth and water each substance in which the parts of water are most separated from each other appearing to be the most dry in some substances indeed where the parts of water are greatly divided as in porcelane for instance it is no easy matter to recover and bring them together again but they continue in a manner fixed and united to the manufactured clay this circumstance it was which led doctor cheney into a very peculiar strain of thinking he suspected that the quantity of water on the surface of the earth was daily decreasing for says he some parts of it are continually joined to vegetable animal and mineral substances which no art can again recover united with these the water loses its fluidity for if continues he we separate a few particles of any fluid and fasten them to a solid body or keep them asunder one from another they will be fluid no longer to produce fluidity a considerable number of such particles are required but here they are close and destitute of their natural properties thus according to him the world is growing every day harder and harder and the earth firmer and firmer and there may come a time when every object around us may be stiffened in universal frigidity however we have causes enough of anxiety in this world already not to add this preposterous concern to the number  that air also contributes to divide the parts of water we can have no manner of doubt of some have even disputed whether water be not capable of being turned into air however though this must not be allowed it must be granted that it may be turned into a substance which greatly resembles air as we have seen in the experiment of the oeolpile with all its properties except that by cold this new made air may be condensed again into water  but of all the substances which tend to divide the parts of water fire is the most powerful water when heated into steam acquires such force and the parts of it tend to fly off from each other with such violence that no earthly substance we know of is strong enough to confine them a single drop of water converted into steam has been found capable of raising a weight of twenty tons and would have raised twenty thousand were the vessel confining it sufficiently strong and the fire below increased in proportion  from this easy yielding of its parts to external pressure arises the art of determining the bulk of bodies by plunging them in water with all the other useful discoveries in that part of natural philosophy called hydrostatics the laws of this science which archimedes first began and pascal with some other of the moderns brought to perfection rather belongs to experimental than to natural history however i will take leave to mention some of the most striking paradoxes in this branch of science which are as well confirmed by experiment as rendered universal by theory it would indeed be unpardonable while discoursing on the properties of water to omit giving some account of the manner in which it sustains such immense bulks as we see floating upon its soft and yielding surface how some bodies that are known to sink at one time swim with ease if their surface be enlarged how the heaviest body even gold itself may be made to swim upon water and how the lightest such as cork shall remain sunk at the bottom how the pouring in of a single quart of water will burst an hogshead hooped with iron and how it ascends in pipes from the valley to travel over the mountain these are circumstances that are at first surprising but upon a slight consideration lose their wonder  in the above sketch the manner of demonstrating used by monsieur dalambert is made use of as the most obvious and the most satisfactory vide essai sur etc in order to conceive the manner in which all these wonders are effected we must begin by observing that water is possessed of an invariable property which has not hitherto been mentioned that of always keeping its surface level and even winds indeed may raise it into waves or art spurt it up in fountains but ever when left to itself it sinks into a smooth even surface of which no one part is higher than another if i should pour water for instance into the arm of a pipe of the shape of the letter u the fluid would rise in the other arm just to the same height because otherwise it would not find its level which it invariably maintains a pipe bending from one hill down into the valley and rising by another may be considered as a tube of this kind in which the water sinking in one arm rises to maintain its level in the other and upon this principle all waterpipes depend which can never raise the water higher than the fountain from which they proceed  again let us suppose for a moment that the arms of the pipe already mentioned may be made long or short at pleasure and let us still further suppose that there is some obstacle at the bottom of it which prevents the water poured into one arm from rising in the other now it is evident that this obstacle at the bottom will sustain a pressure from the water in one arm equal to what would make it rise in the other and this pressure will be great in proportion as the arm filled with water is tall we may therefore generally conclude that the bottom of every vessel is pressed by a force in proportion to the height of the water in that vessel for instance if the vessel filled with water be forty feet high the bottom of that vessel will sustain such a pressure as would raise the same water forty feet high which is very great from hence we see how extremely apt to burst our pipes that convey water to the city are for descending from an hill of more than forty feet high they are pressed by the water contained in them with a force equal to what would raise it more than forty feet high and that this is sometimes able to burst a wooden pipe we can have no room to doubt of  still recurring to our pipe let us suppose one of its arms ten times as thick as the other this will produce no effect whatsoever upon the obstacle below which we supposed hindering its rise in the other arm because how thick soever the pipe may be its contents would only rise to its own level and it will therefore press the obstacle with a force equal thereto we may therefore universally conclude that the bottom of any vessel is pressed by its water not as it is broad or narrow but in proportion as it is high thus the water contained in a vessel not thicker than my finger presses its bottom as forcibly as the water contained in an hogshead of an equal height and if we made holes in the bottoms of both the water would burst out as forceful from the one as the other hence we may with great ease burst an hogshead with a single quart of water and it has been often done we have only nollets lectures  for this to place an hogshead on one end filled with water we then bore an hole in its top into which we plant a narrow tin pipe of about thirty feet high by pouring a quart of water into this at the top as it continues to rise higher in the pipe it will press more forcibly on the bottom and sides of the hogshead below and at last burst it  still returning to our simple instrument of demonstration if we suppose the obstacle at the bottom of the pipe to be moveable so as that the force of the water can push it up into the other arm such a body is quicksilver for instance now it is evident that the weight of water weighing down upon this quicksilver in one arm will at last press it up in the other arm and will continue to press it upwards until the fluid in both arms be upon a par so that here we actually see quicksilver the heaviest substance in the world except gold floating upon water which is but a very light substance  when we see water thus capable of sustaining quicksilver we need not be surprised that it is capable of floating much lighter substances ships animals or timber when any thing floats upon water we always see that a part of it sinks in the same a cork a ship a buoy each buries itself a bed on the surface of the water this bed may be considered as so much water displaced the water will therefore lose so much of its own weight as is equal to the weight of that bed of water which it displaces if the body be heavier than a similar bulk of water it will sink if lighter it will swim universally therefore every body that is plunged in water loses as much of its weight as is equal to the weight of a body of water of its own bulk some light bodies therefore such as cork lose all their weight and therefore swim because their bulk of water is heavier than they other more ponderous bodies sink because they are heavier than their bulk of water  upon this simple theorem entirely depends the art of weighing metals hydrostatically i have a guinea for instance and desire to know whether it be pure gold i have weighed it in the usual way with another guinea and find it exactly of the same weight but still i have some suspicion from its greater bulk that it is not pure in order to determine this i have nothing more to do than to weigh it in water with that same guinea that i know to be good and of the same weight and this will instantly show the difference for the true ponderous metal will sink and the false bulky one will be sustained in proportion to the greatness of its surface those whose business it is to examine the purity of metals have a balance made for this purpose by which they can precisely determine which is most ponderous or as it is expressed which has the greatest specific gravity seventyone pound and an half of quicksilver is found to be equal in bulk to an hundred pound weight of gold in the same proportion sixty of lead fiftyfour of silver fortyseven of copper fortyfive of brass fortytwo of iron and thirtynine of tin are each equal to an hundred pound of the same most ponderous of all metals  this method of precisely determining the purity of gold by weighing in water was first discovered by archimedes to whom mankind have been indebted for many of the most useful discoveries hiero king of sicily having sent a certain quantity of gold to be made into a crown the workman it seems kept a part for his own use and supplied the deficiency with a baser metal his fraud was suspected by the king but could not be proved till applying to archimedes he weighed the crown in water and by this method directly informed the king of the quantity of gold which was taken away  it has been said that all fluids endeavor to preserve their level and likewise that a body pressing on the surface tended to destroy that level from hence therefore it will easily be inferred that the deeper any body sinks the greater will be the resistance of the depressed fluid beneath it will be asked therefore as the resistance increases in proportion as the body descends how comes the body after it is got a certain way to sink at all the answer is obvious from the fluid above it pressing it down with almost as great a force as the fluid beneath presses it up take away by any art the pressure of the fluid from above and let only the resistance of the fluid from below be suffered to act and after the body is got down very deep the resistance will be insuperable to give an instance a small hole opens in the bottom of a ship at sea forty feet we will suppose below the surface of the water through this the water bursts up with great violence i attempt to stop it with my hand but it pushes the hand violently away here the hand is in fact a body attempting to sink upon water at a depth of forty feet with the pressure from above taken away the water therefore will overcome my strength and will continue to burst in till it has got to its level if i should then dive into the hold and clap my hand upon the opening as before i should perceive no force acting against my hand at all for the water above presses the hand as much down against the hole as the water without presses it upward for this reason also when we dive to the bottom of the water we sustain a very great pressure from above it is true but it is counteracted by the pressure from below and the whole acting uniformly on the surface of the body wraps us close round without injury  as i have deviated thus far i will just mention one or two properties more which water and all such like fluids is found to possess and first their ascending in vessels which are emptied of air as in our common pumps for instance the air however being the agent in this case we must previously examine the properties of that before we undertake the explanation the other property to be mentioned is that of their ascending in small capillary tubes this is one of the most extraordinary and inscrutable appearances in nature glass tubes may be drawn by means of a lamp as fine as an hair still preserving their hollow within if one of these be planted in a vessel of water or spirit of wine the liquor will immediately be seen to ascend and it will rise higher in proportion as the tube is smaller a foot two feet and more how does this come to pass is the air the cause no the liquor rises although the air be taken away is attraction the cause no for quicksilver does not ascend which it otherwise would many have been the theories of experimental philosophers to explain this property such as are fond of traveling in the regions of conjecture may consult hawksbee morgan jurin or watson who have examined the subject with great minuteness hitherto however nothing but doubts instead of knowledge have been the result of their enquiries it will not therefore become us to enter into the minuteness of the enquiry when we have so many greater wonders to call our attention away  chap xiv of the origin of rivers the sun arises and the sun goes down and pants for the place from whence he arose all things are filled with labor and man cannot utter it all rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place whence the rivers come thither they return again the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear with hearing ecclesiastes chap i v        thus speaks the wisest of the jews and at so early a period was the curiosity of man employed in observing these great circulations of nature every eye attempted to explain those appearances and every philosopher who has long thought upon the subject seems to give a peculiar solution the enquiry whence rivers are produced whence they derive those unceasing stores of water which continually enrich the world with fertility and verdure has been variously considered and divided the opinions of mankind more than any other topic in natural history  in this contest the various champions may be classed under two leaders mr de la hire who contends that rivers must be supplied from the sea strained through the pores of the earth and doctor halley who has endeavored to demonstrate that the clouds alone are sufficient for the supply both sides have brought in mathematics to their aid and have shown that long and laborious calculations can at any time be made to obscure both sides of a question  de la hire hist de laccad      p    begins his proofs that rainwater evaporated from the sea is insufficient for the production of rivers by showing that rain never penetrates the surface of the earth above sixteen inches from thence he infers that it is impossible for it in many cases to sink so as to be found at such considerable depths below rainwater he grants is often seen to mix with rivers and to swell their currents but a much greater part of it evaporates away in fact continues he if we suppose the earth every where covered with water evaporation alone would be sufficient to carry off two feet nine inches of it in a year and yet we very well know that scarce nineteen inches of rainwater falls in that time so that evaporation would carry off a much greater quantity than is ever known to descend the small quantity of rainwater that falls is therefore but barely sufficient for the purposes of vegetation two leaves of a fig tree have been found by experiment to imbibe from the earth in five hours and an half two ounces of water this implies the great quantity of fluid that must be exhausted in the maintenance of one single plant add to this that the waters of the river rungis will by calculation rise to fifty inches and the whole country from whence they are supplied never receives fifty inches in the year by rain besides this there are many salt springs which are known to proceed immediately from the sea and are subject to its flux and reflux in short wherever we dig beneath the surface of the earth except in a very few instances water is to be found and it is by this subterraneous water that springs and rivers nay a great part of vegetation itself is supported it is this subterraneous water which is raised into steam by the internal heat of the earth that feeds plants it is this subterraneous water that distills through its interstices and there cooling forms fountains it is this that by the addition of rains is increased into rivers and pours plenty over the whole earth  on the other side of the question phil trans vol ii p      it is asserted that the vapors which are exhaled from the sea and driven by the winds upon land are more than sufficient to supply not only plants with moisture but also to furnish a sufficiency of water to the greatest rivers for this purpose an estimate has been made of the quantity of water emptied at the mouths of the greatest rivers and of the quantity also raised from the sea by evaporation and it has been found that the latter by far exceeds the former this calculation was made by mr mariotte by him it was found upon receiving such rain as fell in a year in a proper vessel fitted for that purpose that one year with another there might fall about twenty inches of water upon the surface of the earth throughout europe it was also computed that the river seine from its source to the city of paris might cover an extent of ground that would supply it annually with above seven billions of cubic feet of this water formed by evaporation but upon computing the quantity which passed through the arches of one of its bridges in a year it was found to amount only to two hundred and eighty millions of cubic feet which is not above the sixth part of the former number hence therefore it appears that this river may receive a supply brought to it by the evaporated waters of the sea six times greater than what it gives back to the sea by its current and therefore evaporation is more than sufficient for maintaining the greatest rivers and supplying the purposes also of vegetation  in this manner the sea supplies sufficient humidity to the air for furnishing the earth with all necessary moisture one part of its vapors fall upon its own bosom before they arrive upon land another part is arrested by the sides of mountains and is compelled by the rising stream of air to mount upward toward the summits here it is presently precipitated dripping down by the crannies of the stone in some places entering into the caverns of the mountain it gathers in those receptacles which being once filled all the rest overflows and breaking out by the sides of the hills forms single springs many of these run down by the valleys or guts between the ridges of the mountain and coming to unite form little rivulets or brooks many of these meeting in one common valley and gaining the plain ground being grown less rapid become a river and many of these uniting make such vast bodies of water as the rhine the rhone and the danube  there is still a third part which falls upon the lower grounds and furnishes plants with their wonted supply but the circulation does not rest even here for it is again exhaled into vapor by the action of the sun and again returned to that great mass of waters whence it first arose this adds doctor halley seems the most reasonable hypothesis and much more likely to be true than that of those who derive all springs from the filtering of the sea waters through certain imaginary tubes or passages within the earth since it is well known that the greatest rivers have their most copious fountains the most remote from the sea phil trans vol ii p       this seems the most adopted opinion and yet after all it is still pressed with great difficulties and there is still room to look out for a better theory the perpetuity of many springs which always yield the same quantity when the least rain or vapor is afforded as well as when the greatest is a strong objection derham derham physico theol mentions a spring at upminster which he could never perceive by his eye to be diminished in the greatest droughts even when all the ponds in the country as well as an adjoining brook have been dry for several months together in the rainy seasons also it was never overflowed except sometimes perhaps for an hour or so upon the immission of the external rains he therefore justly enough concludes that had this spring its origin from rain or vapor there would be found an increase or decrease of its water corresponding to the causes of its production  thus the reader after having been tossed from one hypothesis to another must at last be contented to settle in conscious ignorance all that has been written upon this subject affords him rather something to say than something to think something rather for others than for himself varenius indeed although he is at a loss for the origin of rivers is by no means so as to their formation he is pretty positive that all rivers are artificial he boldly asserts that their channels have been originally formed by the industry of man his reasons are that when a new spring breaks forth the water does not make itself a new channel but spreads over the adjacent land thus says he men are obliged to direct its course or otherwise nature would never have found one he enumerates many rivers that are certainly known from history to have been dug by men he alleges that no salt water rivers are found because men did not want salt water and as for salt that was procurable at a less expense than digging a river for it however it costs a speculative man but a small expense of thinking to form such an hypothesis it may perhaps engross the readers patience to detain him longer upon it  nevertheless though philosophy be thus ignorant as to the production of rivers yet the laws of their motion and the nature of their currents have been very well explained the italians have particularly distinguished themselves in this respect and it is chiefly to them that we are indebted for the improvement s guglielmini della natura de fiumi passim   all rivers have their source either in mountains or elevated lakes and it is in their descent from these that they acquire that velocity which maintains their future current at first their course is generally rapid and headlong but it is retarded in its journey both by the continual friction against its banks by the many obstacles it meets to divert its stream and by the plains generally becoming more level as it approaches toward the sea  if this acquired velocity be quite spent and the plain through which the river passes is entirely level it will notwithstanding still continue to run from the perpendicular pressure of the water which is always in exact proportion to the depth this perpendicular pressure is nothing more than the weight of the upper waters pressing the lower out of their places and consequently driving them forward as they cannot recede against the stream as this pressure is greatest in the deepest parts of the river so we generally find the middle of the stream most rapid both because it has the greatest motion thus communicated by the pressure and the fewest obstructions from the banks on either side  rivers thus set into motion are almost always found to make their own beds where they find the bed elevated they wear its substance away and deposit the sediment in the next hollow so as in time to make the bottom of their channels even on the other hand the water is continually gnawing and eating away the banks on each side and this with more force as the current happens to strike more directly against them by these means it always has a tendency to render them more strait and parallel to its own course thus it continues to rectify its banks and enlarge its bed and consequently to diminish the force of its stream till there becomes an equilibrium between the force of the water and the resistance of its banks upon which both will remain without any further mutation and it is happy for man that bounds are thus put to the erosion of the earth by water and that we find all rivers only dig and widen themselves but to a certain degree guglielmini della natura de fiumi passim   in those plains buffon de fleuves passim vol ii and large valleys where great rivers flow the bed of the river is usually lower than any part of the valley but it often happens that the surface of the water is higher than many of the grounds that are adjacent to the banks of the stream if after inundations we take a view of some rivers we shall find their banks appear above water at a time that all the adjacent valley is overflown this proceeds from the frequent deposition of mud and such like substances upon the banks by the rivers frequently overflowing and thus by degrees they become elevated above the plain and the water is often seen higher also  rivers as every body has seen are always broadest at the mouth and grow narrower toward their source but what is less known and probably more deserving curiosity is that they run in a more direct channel as they immediately leave their sources and that their sinuosities and turnings become more numerous as they proceed it is a certain sign among the savages of north america that they are near the sea when they find the rivers winding and every now and then changing their direction and this is even now become an indication to the europeans themselves in their journies through those trackless forests as those sinuosities therefore increase as the river approaches the sea it is not to be wondered at that they sometimes divide and thus disembogue by different channels the danube disembogues into the euxine by seven mouths the nile by the same number and the wolga by seventy  the currents buffon de fleuves passim vol ii of rivers are to be estimated very differently from the manner in which those writers who have given us mathematical theories on this subject represent them they found their calculations upon the surface being a perfect plain from one bank to the other but this is not the actual state of nature for rivers in general rise in the middle and this convexity is greatest in proportion as the rapidity of the stream is greater any person to be convinced of this need only lay his eye as nearly as he can on a level with the stream and looking across to the opposite bank he will perceive the river in the midst to be elevated considerably above what it is at the edges this rising in some rivers is often found to be three feet high and is ever increased in proportion to the rapidity of the stream in this case the water in the midst of the current loses a part of its weight from the velocity of its motion while that at the sides for the contrary reason sinks lower it sometimes however happens that this appearance is reversed for when tides are found to flow up with violence against the natural current of the water the greatest rapidity is then found at the sides of the river as the water there least resists the influx from the sea on those occasions therefore the river presents a concave rather than a unequal surface and as in the former case the middle waters rose in a ridge in this case they sink in a furrow  the stream in all rivers is more rapid in proportion as its channel is diminished for instance it will be much swifter where it is ten yards broad than where it is twenty for the force behind still pushing the water forward when it comes to the narrow part it must make up by velocity what it wants in room  it often happens that the stream of a river is opposed by one of its jutting banks by an island in the midst the arches of a bridge or some such obstacle this produces not unfrequently a back current and the water having past the arch with great velocity pushes the water on each side of its direct current this produces a side current tending to the bank and not unfrequently a whirlpool in which a large body of waters are circulated in a kind of cavity sinking down in the middle the central point of the whirlpool is always lowest because it has the least motion the other parts are supported in some measure by the violence of theirs and consequently rise higher as their motion is greater so that toward the extremity of the whirlpool must be higher than toward the center  if the stream of a river be stopped at the surface and yet be free below as for instance if it be laid over by a bridge of boats there will then be a double current the water at the surface will flow back while that at the bottom will proceed with increased velocity it often happens that the current at the bottom is swifter than at the top when upon violent landfloods the weight of waters toward the source presses the waters at the bottom before it has had time to communicate its motion to the surface however in all other cases the surface of the stream is swifter than the bottom as it is not retarded by rubbing over the bed of the river  it might be supposed that bridges dams and other obstacles in the current of a river would retard its total velocity but the difference they make is very inconsiderable the water by these stoppages gets an elevation above the object which when it has surmounted it gives a velocity that recompenses the former delay islands and turnings also retard the course of the stream but very inconsiderably any cause which diminishes the quantity of the water most sensibly diminishes the force and the velocity of the stream  an increase buffon vol ii p    of water in the bed of the river always increases its rapidity except in cases of inundation the instant the river has overflowed its banks the velocity of its current is always turned that way and the inundation is perceived to continue for some days which it would not otherwise do if as soon as the cause was discontinued it acquired its former rapidity  a violent storm that sets directly up against the course of the stream will always retard and sometimes entirely stop its course i have seen an instance of this when the bed of a large river was left entirely dry for some hours and fish were caught among the stones at the bottom  inundations are generally greater toward the source of rivers than farther down because the current is generally swifter below than above and that for the reasons already assigned  a little river guglielmini ibid may be received into a large one without augmenting either its width or depth this which at first view seems a paradox is yet very easily accounted for the little river in this case only goes toward increasing the swiftness of the larger and putting its dormant waters into motion in this manner the venetian branch of the po was pushed on by the ferarese branch and that of panaro without any enlargement of its breadth or depth from these accessions  a river tending to enter another either perpendicularly or in an opposite direction will be diverted by degrees from that direction and be obliged to make itself a more favorable entrance downward and more conspiring with the stream of the former  the union of two rivers into one makes it flow the swifter since the same quantity of water instead of rubbing against four shores now only rubs against two and besides the current being deeper becomes of consequence more fitted for motion  with respect to the places from whence rivers proceed it may be taken for a general rule that the largest doctor halley and highest mountains supply the greatest and most extensive rivers it may also be remarked in whatever direction the ridge of the mountain runs the river takes an opposite course if the mountain for instance stretches from north to south the river runs from east to west and so contrariwise these are some of the most generally received opinions with regard to the course of rivers however they are liable to many exceptions and nothing but an actual knowledge of each particular river can furnish us with an exact theory of its current  the largest rivers of europe are first the wolga which is about six hundred and fifty leagues in length extending from reschow to astrachan it is remarkable of this river that it abounds with water during the summer months of may and june but all the rest of the year is so shallow as scarce to cover its bottom or allow a passage for loaded vessels that trade up its stream it was up this river that the english attempted a trade into persia in which they were so unhappily disappointed in the year      the next in order is the danube the course of this is about four hundred and fifty leagues from the mountains of switzerland to the black sea it is so deep between buda and belgrade that the turks and christians have fleets of men of war upon it which frequently engaged during the last war between the ottomans and the austrians however it is unnavigable further down by reason of its cataracts which prevent its commerce into the black sea the don or tanais which is four hundred leagues from the source of that branch of it called the sosna to its mouth in the euxine sea in one part of its course it approaches near the wolga and peter the great had actually begun a canal by which he intended joining those two rivers which he did not live to finish the nieper or boristhenes which rises in the middle of muscovy and runs a course of three hundred and fifty leagues to empty itself into the black sea the old cossacks inhabit the banks and islands of this river and frequently cross the black sea to plunder the maritime places on the coasts of turkey the dwina which takes its rise in a province of the same name in russia then runs a course of three hundred leagues and disembogues into the white sea a little below archangel  the largest rivers of asia are the hoanho in china which is eight hundred and fifty leagues in length computing from its source at raja ribron to its mouth in the gulf of changi the jenisca of tartary about eight hundred leagues in length from the lake selinga to the icy sea this river is by some supposed to supply most of that great quantity of drift wood which is seen floating in the seas near the artic circle the oby of five hundred leagues running from the lake of kila into the northern sea the amor in eastern tartary whose course is about five hundred and seventyfive leagues from its source to its entrance into the sea of kamtskatka the kiam in china five hundred and fifty leagues in length the ganges one of the most noted rivers in the world and about as long as the former it rises in the mountains which separate india from tartary and running through the dominions of the great mogul discharges itself by several mouths into the bay of bengal it is not only esteemed by the indians for the depth and pureness of its stream but for a supposed sanctity which they believe to be in its waters it is visited annually by several hundred thousand pilgrims who pay their devotions to the river as to a god for savage simplicity is always known to mistake the blessings of the deity for the deity himself they carry their dying friends from distant countries to expire on its banks and to be buried in its stream the water is lowest in april or may but the rains beginning to fall soon after the flat country is overflowed for several miles till about the end of september the waters then begin to retire leaving a prolific sediment behind that enriches the soil and in a few days time gives a luxuriance to vegetation beyond what can be conceived by an european next to this may be reckoned the still more celebrated river euphrates this rises from two sources northward of the city erzerum in turcomania and unites about three days journey below the same from whence after performing a course of five hundred leagues it falls into the gulf of persia fifty miles below the city of bassora in arabia the river indus is extended from its source to its discharge into the arabian sea four hundred leagues  the largest rivers of africa are the senegal which runs a course of not less than eleven hundred leagues comprehending the niger which some have supposed to fall into it however later accounts seem to affirm that the niger is lost in the sands about three hundred miles up from the western coasts of africa be this as it may the senegal is well known to be navigable for more than three hundred leagues up the country and how much higher it may reach is not yet discovered as the dreadful fatality of the inland parts of africa not only deter curiosity but even avarice which is a much stronger passion at the end of last war of fifty english men that were sent to the factory at galam a place taken from the french and nine hundred miles up the river only one returned to tell the fate of his companions who were killed by the climate the celebrated river nile is said to be nine hundred and seventy leagues from its source among the mountains of the moon in upper aethiopia to its opening into the mediterranean sea the sources of this river were considered as inscrutable by the ancients and the causes of its periodical inundation were equally unknown they have both been ascertained by the missionaries who have traveled into the interior parts of aethiopia the nile takes its rise in the kingdom of gojam kircher mund subt vol ii p     from a small aperture on the top of a mountain which though not above a foot and an half over yet was unfathomable this fountain when arrived at the foot of the mountain expands into a river and being joined by others forms a lake thirty leagues long and as many broad from this its channel in some measure winds back to the country where it first began from thence precipitating by frightful cataracts it travels through a variety of desert regions equally formidable such as amhara olaca damot and xaoa upon its arrival in the kingdom of upper egypt it runs through a rocky channel which some late travelers have mistaken for its cataracts in the beginning of its course it receives many lesser rivers into it and pliny was mistaken in saying that it received none in the beginning also of its course it has many windings but for above three hundred leagues from the sea it runs in a direct line its annual overflowings arise from a very obvious cause which is almost universal with all the great rivers that take their source near the line the rainy season which is periodical in those climates flood the rivers and as this always happens in our summer so the nile is at that time overflown from these inundations the inhabitants of egypt derive happiness and plenty and when the river does not arise to its accustomed heights they prepare for an indifferent harvest it begins to overflow about the seventeenth of june it generally continues to augment for forty days and decreases in about as many more this time of increase and decrease however is much more inconsiderable now than it was among the ancients herodotus informs us that it was an hundred days rising and as many falling which shows that the inundation was much greater at that time than at present mr buffon buffon vol ii p    has ascribed the present diminution as well to the lessening of the mountains of the moon by their substance having so long been washed down with the stream as to the rising of the earth in egypt that has for so many ages received this extraneous supply but we do not find by the buildings that have remained since the times of the ancients that the earth is much raised since then besides the nile in africa we may reckon the zara and the coanza from the greatness of whose openings into the sea and the rapidity of whose streams we form an estimate of the great distance from whence they come their courses however are spent in watering deserts and savage countries whose poverty or fierceness have kept strangers away  but of all parts of the world america as it exhibits the most lofty mountains so also it supplies the largest rivers the foremost of these is the great river amazons which from its source in the lake of lauricocha to its discharge into the western ocean performs a course of more than twelve hundred leagues ulloa vol i p      the breadth and depth of this river is answerable to its vast length and where its width is most contracted its depth is augmented in proportion so great is the body of its waters that other rivers though before the objects of admiration themselves are lost in its bosom it proceeds after their junction with its usual appearance without any visible change in its breadth or rapidity and if we may so express it remains great without ostentation in some places it displays its whole magnificence dividing into several large branches and encompassing a multitude of islands and at length discharging itself into the ocean by a channel of an hundred and fifty miles broad another river that may almost rival the former is the st lawrence in canada which rising in the lake assiniboils passes from one lake to another from cristinaux to alempigo from thence to lake superior thence to the lake hurons to lake erie to lake ontario and at last after a course of nine hundred leagues pours their collected waters into the atlantic ocean the river missisippi is of more than seven hundred leagues in length beginning at its source near the lake assiniboils and ending at its opening into the gulf of mexico the river plate runs a length of more than eight hundred leagues from its source in the river parana to its mouth the river oroonoko is seven hundred and fiftyfive leagues in length from its source near pasto to its discharge into the atlantic ocean  such is the amazing length of our greatest rivers and even in some of these the most remote sources very probably yet continue unknown in fact if we consider the number of rivers which they receive and the little acquaintance we have with the regions through which they run it is not to be wondered at that geographers are divided concerning the sources of most of them as among a number of roots by which nourishment is conveyed to a stately tree it is difficult to determine precisely that by which the tree is chiefly supplied so among the many branches of a great river it is equally difficult to tell which is the original hence it may easily happen that a smaller branch is taken for the capital stream and its runnings are pursued and delineated in prejudice of some other branch that better deserved the name and the description in this manner buffon vol ii p    in europe the danube is known to receive thirty lesser rivers the wolga thirtytwo or thirtythree in asia the hohanno receives thirtyfive the jenisca above sixty the oby as many the amor about forty the nanquin receives thirty rivers the ganges twenty and the euphrates about eleven in africa the senegal receives more than twenty rivers the nile receives not one for five hundred leagues upwards and then only twelve or thirteen in america the river amazons receives above sixty and those very considerable the river st lawrence about forty counting those which fall into its lakes the missisippi receives forty and the river plate above fifty  i mentioned the inundations of the ganges and the nile but almost every other great river whose source lies within the tropics have their stated inundations also the river pegu has been called by travelers the indian nile because of the similar overflowings of its stream this it does to an extent of thirty leagues on each side and so fertilizes the soil that the inhabitants send great quantities of rice into other countries and have still abundance for their own consumption the river senegal has likewise its inundations which cover the whole flat country of negroland beginning and ending much about the same time with those of the nile as in fact both rivers rise from the same mountains but the difference between the effects of the inundations in each river is remarkable in the one it distributes health and plenty but in the other diseases famine and death the inhabitants along the torrid coasts of the senegal can receive no benefit from any additional manure the river may carry down to their soil which is by nature more than sufficiently luxuriant or even if they could they have not industry to turn it to any advantage the banks therefore of the rivers lie uncultivated overgrown with rank and noxious herbage and infested with thousands of animals of various malignity every new flood only tends to increase the rankness of the soil and to provide fresh shelter for the creatures that infest it if the flood continues but a few days longer than usual the improvident inhabitants who are driven up into the higher grounds begin to want provisions and a famine ensues when the river begins to return into its channel the humidity and heat of the air are equally fatal and the carcases of infinite numbers of animals swept away by the inundation putrefying in the sun produce a stench that is almost insupportable but even the luxuriance of the vegetation itself becomes a nuisance i have been assured by persons of veracity that have been up the river senegal that there are some plants that grow along the coast the smell of which is so powerful that it is hardly to be endured it is certain that all the sailors and soldiers who have been at any of our factories there ascribe the unwholsomeness of the voyage up the stream to the vegetable vapor however this be the inundations of the rivers in this wretched part of the globe contribute scarce any advantage if we except to the beauty of the prospects which they afford these indeed are finished up beyond the utmost reach of art a spacious glassy river with its banks here and there fringed to the very surface by the mangrovetree that grows down into the water presents itself to view lofty forests of various colors with openings between carpeted with green plants and the most gaudy flowers beasts and animals of various kinds that stand upon the banks of the river and with a sort of wild curiosity survey the mariners as they pass contribute to heighten the scene this is the sketch of an african prospect which delights the eye even while it destroys the constitution  beside these annually periodical inundations there are many rivers that overflow at much shorter intervals thus most of those in peru and chili have scarce any motion by night but upon the appearance of the morning sun they resume their former rapidity this proceeds from the mountain snows which melting with the heat increase the stream and continue to drive on the current while the sun continues to dissolve them some rivers also flow with an even steady current from their source to the sea others flow with greater rapidity their stream being poured down in a cataract or swallowed by the sands before they reach the sea  the rivers of those countries that have been least inhabited are usually more rocky uneven and broken into waterfalls or cataracts than those where the industry of man has been more prevalent wherever man comes nature puts on a milder appearance the terrible and the sublime are exchanged for the gentle and the useful the cataract is sloped away into a placid stream and the banks become more smooth and even buffon vol ii p  0  it must have required ages to render the rhone or the loire navigable their beds must have been cleaned and directed their inequalities removed and by a long course of industry nature must have been taught to conspire with the desires of her controller every ones experience must have supplied instances of rivers thus being made to flow more evenly and more beneficially to mankind but there are some whose currents are so rapid and falls so precipitate that no art can obviate and that must for ever remain as amazing instances of incorrigible nature  of this kind are the cataracts of the rhine one of which i have seen exhibit a very strange appearance it was that at schathausen which was frozen quite across and the water stood in columns where the cataract had formerly fallen the nile as was said has its cataracts the river vologda in russia has two the river zara in africa has one near its source the river velino in italy has a cataract of above an hundred and fifty feet perpendicular near the city gottenburgh phil trans vol ii p      in sweden the river there rushes down from a prodigious high precipice into a deep pit with a terrible noise and such dreadful force that those trees designed for the masts of ships which are floated down the river usually are turned upside down in their fall and often are shattered to pieces by being dashed against the surface of the water in the pit this occurs if the masts fall sideways upon the water but if they fall end ways they dive so far under water that they disappear for a quarter of an hour or more the pit into which they are thus plunged has been often sounded with a line of some hundred fathoms long but no ground has been found hitherto there is also a cataract at powerscourt in ireland in which if i am rightly informed the water falls three hundred feet perpendicular which is a greater descent than that of any other cataract in any part of the world there is a cataract at albany in the province of new york which pours its stream fifty feet perpendicular but of all the cataracts in the world that of niagara in canada if we consider the great body of water that falls must be allowed to be the greatest and the most astonishing  this amazing fall of water is made by the river st lawrence in its passage from the lake erie into the lake ontario we have already said that st lawrence was one of the largest rivers in the world and yet the whole of its waters are here poured down by a fall of an hundred and fifty feet perpendicular it is not easy to bring the imagination to correspond with the greatness of the scene a river extremely deep and rapid and that serves to drain the waters of almost all north america into the atlantic ocean is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks that rise like a wall across the whole bed of its stream the width of the river a little above is near three quarters of a mile broad and the rocks where it grows narrower are four hundred yards over their direction is not straight across but hollowing inwards like an horseshoe so that the cataract which bends to the shape of the obstacle rounding inwards presents a kind of theater the most tremendous in nature just in the middle of this circular wall of waters a little island that has braved the fury of the current presents one of its points and divides the stream at top into two but it unites again long before it has got to the bottom the noise of the fall is heard at several leagues distance and the fury of the waters at the bottom of their fall is inconceivable the dashing produces a mist that rises to the very clouds and that produces a most beautiful rainbow when the sun shines it may easily be conceived that such a cataract quite destroys the navigation of the stream and yet some indian canoes as it is said have been known to venture down it with safety  of those rivers that lose themselves in the sands or are swallowed up by chasms in the earth we have various information what we are told by the ancients of the river alpheus in arcadia that sinks into the ground and rises again near syracuse in sicily where it takes the name of arethusa is rather more known than credited but we have better information with respect to the river tigris being lost in this manner under mount taurus of the guadalquiver in spain being buried in the sands of the river greatah in yorkshire running underground and rising again and even of the great rhine itself a part of which is no doubt lost in the sands a little above leyden but it ought to be observed of this river that by much the greatest part arrives at the ocean for although the ancient channel which fell into the sea a little to the west of that city be now entirely choked up yet there are still a number of small canals that carry a great body of waters to the sea and besides it has also two very large openings the lech and the wall below rotterdam by which it empties itself abundantly  be this as it will nothing is more common in sultry and sandy deserts than rivers being thus either lost in the sands or entirely dried up by the sun and hence we see that under the line the small rivers are but few for such little streams as are common in europe and which with us receive the name of rivers would quickly evaporate in those parching and extensive deserts it is even confidently asserted that the great river niger itself is thus lost before it reaches the ocean and that its supposed mouths the gambia and the senegal are distinct rivers that come a vast way from the interior parts of the country it appears therefore that the rivers under the line are large but it is otherwise at the poles krantzs history of greenland vol i p     where they must necessarily be small in that desolate region as the mountains are covered with perpetual ice which melts but little or not at all the springs and rivulets are furnished with a very small supply here therefore men and beasts would perish and die for thirst if providence had not ordered that in the hardest winter thaws should intervene which deposit a small quantity of snowwater in pools under the ice and from this source the wretched inhabitants drain a scanty beverage  thus whatever quarter of the globe we turn to we shall find new reasons to be satisfied with that part of it in which we ourselves reside our rivers furnish all the plenty of the african stream without its inundation they have all the coolness of the polar rivulet with a more constant supply they may want the terrible magnificence of huge cataracts or extensive lakes but they are more navigable and more transparent though less deep and rapid than the rivers of the torrid zone they are more manageable and only wait the will of man to take their direction the rivers of the torrid zone like the monarchs of the country rule with despotic tyranny profuse in their bounties and ungovernable in their rage the rivers of europe like their kings are the friends and not the oppressors of the people bounded by known limits abridged in the power of doing ill directed by human sagacity and only at freedom to distribute happiness and plenty  chap xv of the ocean in general and of its saltness if we look upon a map of the world we shall find that the ocean occupies considerably more of the globe than the land is found to do this immense body of waters is diffused round both the old and new continent to the south and may surround them also to the north for what we know but the ice in those regions has stopped our enquiries although the ocean properly speaking is but one extensive sheet of waters continued over every part of the globe without interruption and although no part of it is divided from the rest yet geographers have distinguished it by different names as the atlantic or western ocean the northern ocean the southern ocean the pacific ocean and the indian ocean others have divided it differently and given other names as the frozen ocean the inferior ocean or the american ocean but all these being arbitrary distinctions and not of natures making the naturalist may consider them with indifference  in this vast receptacle almost all the rivers of the earth ultimately terminate nor do such great supplies seem to increase its stores for it is neither apparently swollen by their tribute nor diminished by their failure it still continues the same indeed what is the quantity of water of all the rivers and lakes in the world compared to that contained in this great receptacle buffon vol ii p  0  if we should offer to make a rude estimate we shall find that all the rivers in the world flowing into the bed of the sea with a continuance of their present stores would take up at least eight hundred years to fill it to its present height for supposing the sea to be eightyfive millions of square miles in extent and a quarter of a mile upon an average in depth this upon calculation will give above twentyone millions of cubic miles of water as the contents of the whole ocean now to estimate the quantity of water which all the rivers supply take any one of them the po for instance the quantity of whose discharge into the sea is known to be one cubic mile of water in twentysix days now it will be found upon a rude computation from the quantity of ground the po with its influent streams covers that all the rivers of the world furnish about two thousand times that quantity of water in the space of a year therefore they will have discharged into the sea about twentysix thousand cubic miles of water and not till eight hundred years will they have discharged as much water as is contained in the sea at present i have not troubled the reader with the odd numbers lest he should imagine i was giving precision to a subject that is incapable of it  thus great is the assemblage of waters diffused round our habitable globe and yet immeasurable as they seem they are mostly rendered subservient to the necessities and the conveniences of so little a being as man nevertheless if it should be asked whether they be made for him alone the question is not easily resolved some philosophers have perceived so much analogy to man in the formation of the ocean that they have not hesitated to assert its being made for him alone the distribution of land and water derham physico theol  say they is admirable the one being laid against the other so skilfully that there is a just equipoise of the whole globe thus the northern ocean balances against the southern and the new continent is an exact counterweight to the old as to any objection from the oceans occupying too large a share of the globe they contend that there could not have been a smaller surface employed to supply the earth with a due share of evaporation on the other hand some take the gloomy side of the question they either magnify burnets theory passim its apparent defects or assert that popes ethic epistles passim what seems defects to us may be real beauties to some wiser order of beings they observe that multitudes of animals are concealed in the ocean and but a small part of them are known the rest therefore they fail not to say were certainly made for their own benefit and not for ours how far either of these opinions be just i will not presume to determine but of this we are certain that god has endowed us with abilities to turn this great extent of waters to our own advantage he has made these things perhaps for other uses but he has given us faculties to convert them to our own this much agitated question therefore seems to terminate here we shall never know whether the things of this world have been made for our use but we very well know that we have been made to enjoy them let us then boldly affirm that the earth and all its wonders are ours since we are furnished with powers to force them into our service man is the lord of all the sublunary creation the howling savage the winding serpent with all the untamable and rebellious offspring of nature are destroyed in the contest or driven at a distance from his habitations the extensive and tempestuous ocean instead of limiting or dividing his power only serves to assist his industry and enlarge the sphere of his enjoyments its billows and its monsters instead of presenting a scene of terror only call up the courage of this little intrepid being and the greatest dangers that man now fears on the deep is from his fellow creatures indeed when i consider the human race as nature has formed them there is but very little of the habitable globe that seems made for them but when i consider them as accumulating the experience of ages in commanding the earth there is nothing so great or so terrible what a poor contemptible being is the naked savage standing on the beach of the ocean and trembling at its tumults how little capable is he of converting its terrors into benefits or of saying behold an element made wholly for my enjoyment he considers it as an angry deity and pays it the homage of submission but it is very different when he has exercised his mental powers when he has learned to find his own superiority and to make it subservient to his commands it is then that his dignity begins to appear and that the true deity is justly praised for having been mindful of man for having given him the earth for his habitation and the sea for an inheritance  this power which man has obtained over the ocean was at first enjoyed in common and none pretended to a right in that element where all seemed intruders the sea therefore was open to all till the time of the emperor justinian his successor leo granted such as were in possession of the shore the sole right of fishing before their respective territories the thracian bosphorus was the first that was thus appropriated and from that time it has been the struggle of most of the powers of europe to obtain an exclusive right in this element the republic of venice claims the adriatic the danes are in possession of the baltic but the english have a more extensive claim to the empire of all the seas encompassing the kingdoms of england scotland and ireland and although these have been long contested yet they are now considered as their indisputable property every one knows that the great power of the nation is exerted on this element and that the instant england ceases to be superior upon the ocean its safety begins to be precarious  it is in some measure owing to our dependence upon the sea and to our commerce there that we are so well acquainted with its extent and figure the bays gulphs currents and shallows of the ocean are much better known and examined than the provinces and kingdoms of the earth itself the hopes of acquiring wealth by commerce has carried man to much greater lengths than the desire of gaining information could have done in consequence of this there is scarce a strait or an harbor scarce a rock or a quicksand scarce an inflexion of the shore or the jutting of a promontory that has not been minutely described but as these present very little entertainment to the imagination or delight to any but those whose pursuits are lucrative they need not be dwelt upon here while the merchant and the mariner are solicitous in describing currents and soundings the naturalist is employed in observing wonders though not so beneficial yet to him of a much more important nature the saltness of the sea seems to be the foremost  whence the sea has derived that peculiar bitterish saltness which we find in it appears by aristotle to have exercised the curiosity of naturalists in all ages he supposed and mankind were for ages content with the solution that the sun continually raised dry saline exhalations from the earth and deposited them upon the sea and hence say his followers the waters of the sea are more salt at top than at bottom but unfortunately for this opinion neither of the facts is true sea salt is not to be raised by the vapors of the sun and sea water is not salter at the top than at the bottom father bohours is of opinion that the creator gave the waters of the ocean their saltness at the beginning not only to prevent their corruption but to enable them to bear greater burdens but their saltness does not prevent their corruption for stagnant seawater like fresh soon grows putrid and as for their bearing greater burdens fresh water answers all the purposes of navigation quite as well the established opinion therefore is that of boil boil vol iii p      who supposes that the seas saltness is supplied not only from rocks or masses of salt at the bottom of the sea but also from the salt which the rains and rivers and other waters dissolve in their passage through many parts of the earth and at length carry with them to the sea but as there is a difference in the taste of rocksalt found at land and that dissolved in the waters of the ocean this may be produced by the plenty of nitrous and bituminous bodies that with the salts are likewise washed into that great receptacle these substances being thus once carried to the sea must for ever remain there for they do not rise by evaporation so as to be returned back from whence they came nothing but the fresh waters of the sea rise in vapors and all the saltness remains behind from hence it follows that every year the sea must become more and more salt and this speculation doctor halley carries so far as to lay down a method of finding out the age of the world by the saltness of its waters for if it be observed phil trans vol v p      says he what quantity of salt is at present contained in a certain weight of water taken up from the caspian sea for example and after some centuries what greater quantity of salt is contained in the same weight of water taken from the same place we may conclude that in proportion as the saltness has increased in a certain time so much must it have increased before that time and we may thus by the rule of proportion make an estimate of the whole time wherein the water would acquire the degree of saltness it should be then possessed of all this may be fine however an experiment begun in this century which is not to be completed till some centuries hence is rather a little mortifying to modern curiosity and i am induced to think the inhabitants round the caspian sea will not be apt to undertake the enquiry  this saltness is found to prevail in every part of the ocean and as much at the surface as at the bottom it is also found in all those seas that communicate with the ocean but rather in a less degree  the great lakes likewise that have no outlets nor communication with the ocean are found to be salt but some of them in less proportion on the contrary all those lakes through which rivers run into the sea however extensive they be are notwithstanding very fresh for the rivers do not deposit their salts in the bed of the lake but carry them with their currents into the ocean thus the lakes ontario and erie in north america although for magnitude they may be considered as inland seas are nevertheless fresh water lakes and kept so by the river st lawrence which passes through them but those lakes that have no communication with the sea nor any rivers going out although they be less than the former are however always salt thus that which goes by the name of the dead sea though very small when compared to those already mentioned is so exceedingly salt that its waters seem scarce capable of dissolving any more the lakes of mexico and of titicaca in peru though of no great extent are nevertheless salt and both for the same reason  those who are willing to turn all things to the best have not failed to consider this saltness of the sea as a peculiar blessing from providence in order to keep so great an element sweet and wholesome what foundation there may be in the remark i will not pretend to determine but we shall shortly find a much better cause for its being kept sweet namely by its motion  on the other hand there have been many who have considered the subject in a different light and have tried every endeavor to make salt water fresh so as to supply the wants of mariners in long voyages or when exhausted of their ordinary stores at first it was supposed simple distillation would do but it was soon found that the bitter part of the water still kept mixed it was then tried by uniting salt of tartar with seawater and distilling both but here the expense was greater than the advantage calcined bones were next thought of but an hogshead of calcined bones carried to sea would take up as much room as an hogshead of water and was more hard to be obtained in this state therefore have the attempts to sweeten seawater rested the chemist satisfied with the reality of his invention and the mariner convinced of its being useless i cannot therefore avoid mentioning a kind of succedaneum which has been lately conceived to answer the purposes of fresh water when mariners are quite exhausted it is well known that persons who go into a warm bath come out several ounces heavier than they went in their bodies having imbibed a correspondent quantity of water this more particularly happens if they have been previously debarred from drinking or go in with a violent thirst which they quickly find quenched and their spirits restored it was supposed that in case of a total failure of fresh water at sea a warm bath might be made of seawater for the use of mariners and that their pores would thus imbibe the fluid without any of its salts which would be seen to crystallize on the surface of their bodies in this manner it is supposed a sufficient quantity of moisture may be procured to sustain life till time or accident furnish a more copious supply  but however this be the saltness of the sea can by no means be considered as a principal cause in preserving its waters from putrefaction the ocean has its currents like rivers which circulate its contents round the globe and these may be said to be the great agents that keep it sweet and wholesome its saltness alone would by no means answer this purpose and some have even imagined that the various substances with which it is mixed rather tend to promote putresence than impede it sir robert hawkins one of our most enlightened navigators gives the following account of a calm in which the sea continuing for some time without motion began to assume a very formidable appearance were it not says he for the moving of the sea by the force of winds tides and currents it would corrupt all the world the experiment of this i say in the year    0 lying with a fleet about the islands of azores almost six months the greatest part of which time we were becalmed upon which all the sea became so replenished with several sorts of gellies and forms of serpents adders and snakes as seemed wonderful some green some black some yellow some white some of diverse colors and many of them had life and some there were an yard and an half and two yards long which had i not seen i could hardly have believed and hereof are witnesses all the company of the ships which were then present so that hardly a man could draw a bucket of water clear of some corruption in which voyage toward the end thereof many of every ship fell sick and began to die apace but the speedy passage into our country was a remedy to the crazed and a preservative for those that were not touched  this shows abundantly how little the seas saltness was capable of preserving it from putrefaction but to put the matter beyond all doubt mr boil kept a quantity of seawater taken up in the english channel for some time barrelled up and in the space of a few weeks it began to acquire a foetid smell boil vol iii p      he was also assured by one of his acquaintance who was becalmed for twelve or fourteen days in the indian sea that the water for want of motion began to stink and that had it continued much longer the stench would probably have poisoned him it is the motion therefore and not the saltness of the sea that preserves it in its present state of salubrity and this very probably by dashing and breaking in pieces the rudiments if i may so call them of the various animals that would otherwise breed there and puterfy  there are some advantages however which are derived from the saltness of the sea its waters being evaporated furnish that salt which is used for domestic purposes and although in some places it is made from springs and in others dug out of mines yet the greatest quantity is made only from the sea that which is called bay salt from its coming to us by the bay of biscay is a stronger kind made by evaporation in the sun that called common salt is evaporated in pans over the fire and is of a much inferior quality to the former  another benefit arising from the quantity of salt dissolved in the sea is that it thus becomes heavier and consequently more buoyant mr boil who examined the difference between seawater and fresh found that the former appeared to be about a fortyfifth part heavier than the latter those also who have had opportunities of bathing in the sea pretend to have experienced a much greater ease in swimming there than in fresh water however as we see they have only a fortyfifth part more of their weight sustained by it i am apt to doubt whether so minute a difference can be practically perceivable be this as it may as seawater alters in its weight from fresh so it is found also to differ from itself in different parts of the ocean in general it is perceived to be heavier and consequently salter the nearer we approach the line phil trans vol ii p       but there is an advantage arising from the saltness of the waters of the sea much greater than what has been yet mentioned which is that their congelation is thus retarded some indeed have gone so far as to say that macrobius seawater never freezes but this is an assertion contradicted by experience however it is certain that it requires a much greater degree of cold to freeze it than fresh water so that while rivers and springs are seen converted into one solid body of ice the sea is always fit for navigation and no way affected by the coldness of the severest winter it is therefore one of the greatest blessings we derive from this element that when at land all the stores of nature are locked up from us we find the sea ever open to our necessities and patient of the hand of industry  but it must not be supposed because in our temperate climate we never see the sea frozen that it is in the same manner open in every part of it a very little acquaintance with the accounts of mariners must have informed us that at the polar regions it is embarrassed with mountains and moving sheets of ice that often render it impassable these tremendous floats are of different magnitudes sometimes rising more than a thousand feet above the surface of the water krantzs history of greenland vol i p     sometimes diffused into plains of above two hundred leagues in length and in many parts sixty or eighty broad they are usually divided by fissures one piece following another so close that a person may step from one to the other sometimes mountains are seen rising amidst these plains and presenting the appearance of a variegated landscape with hills and valleys houses churches and towers these are appearances in which all naturalists are agreed but the great contest is respecting their formation mr buffon asserts buffon vol ii p     that they are formed from fresh water alone which congealing at the mouths of great rivers accumulate those huge masses that disturb navigation however this great naturalist seems not to have been aware that there are two sorts of ice floating in these seas the flat ice and the mountain ice the one formed of seawater only the other of fresh krantz   the flat or driving ice is entirely composed of seawater which upon dissolution is found to be salt and is readily distinguished from the mountain or fresh water ice by its whiteness and want of transparency this ice is much more terrible to mariners than that which rises up in lumps a ship can avoid the one as it is seen at a distance but it often gets in among the other which sometimes closing crushes it to pieces this which manifestly has a different origin from the fresh water ice may perhaps have been produced in the icy sea beneath the pole or along the coasts of spitzberg or nova zembla  the mountainice as was said is different in every respect being formed of fresh water and appearing hard and transparent it is generally of a pale green color though some pieces are of a beautiful sky blue many large masses also appear gray and some black if examined more nearly they are found to be incorporated with earth stones and brushwood washed from the shore on these also are sometimes found not only earth but nests with birds eggs at several hundred miles from land the generality of these though almost totally fresh have nevertheless a thick crust of salt water frozen upon them probably from the power that ice has sometimes to produce ice such mountains as are here described are most usually seen at springtime and after a violent storm driving out to sea where they at first terrify the mariner and are soon after dashed to pieces by the continual washing of the waves or driven into the warmer regions of the south there to be melted away they sometimes however strike back upon their native shores where they seem to take root at the feet of mountains and as martius tells us are sometimes higher than the mountains themselves those seen by him were blue full of clefts and cavities made by the rain and crowned with snow which alternately thawing and freezing every year augmented their size these composed of materials more solid than that driving at sea presented a variety of agreeable figures to the eye that with a little help from fancy assumed the appearance of trees in blossom the inside of churches with arches pillars and windows and the blue colored rays darting from within presented the resemblance of a glory  if we enquire into the origin and formation of these which as we see are very different from the former i think we have a very satisfactory account of them in krantzs history of greenland and i will take leave to give the passage with a very few alterations these mountains of ice says he are not salt like the seawater but sweet and therefore can be formed no where except on the mountains in rivers in caverns and against the hills near the seashore the mountains of greenland are so high that the snow which falls upon them particularly on the north side is in one nights time wholly converted into ice they also contain clefts and cavities where the sun seldom or never injects his rays besides these are projections or landingplaces on the declivities of the steepest hills where the rain and snowwater lodge and quickly congeal when now the accumulated flakes of snow slide down or fall with the rain from the eminences above on these prominences or when here and there a mountainspring comes rolling down to such a lodging place where the ice has already seated itself they all freeze and add their tribute to it this by degrees waxes to a body of ice that can no more be overpowered by the sun and which though it may indeed at certain seasons diminish by a thaw yet upon the whole through annual acquisitions it assumes an annual growth such a body of ice is often prominent far over the rocks it does not melt on the upper surface but underneath and also cracks into many larger or smaller clefts from whence the thawed water trickles out by this it becomes at last so weak that being overloaded with its own ponderous bulk it breaks loose and tumbles down the rocks with a terrible crash where it happens to overhang a precipice on the shore it plunges into the deep with a shock like thunder and with such an agitation of the water as will overset a boat at some distance as many a poor greenlander has fatally experienced thus are these amazing ice mountains launched forth to sea and found floating in the waters round both the poles it is these that have hindered mariners from discovering the extensive countries that lie round the south pole and that probably block up the passage to china by the north  i will conclude this chapter with one effect more produced by the saltness of the sea which is the luminous appearance of its waves in the night all who have been spectators of a sea by night a little ruffled with winds seldom fail of observing its fiery brightness in boil vol i p     some places it shines as far as the eye can reach at other times only when the waves boom against the side of the vessel or the oar dashes into the water some seas shine often others more seldom some ever when particular winds blow and others within a narrow compass a long tract of light being seen along the surface whilst all the rest is hid in total darkness it is not easy to account for these extraordinary appearances some have supposed that a number of luminous insects produced the effect and this is in reality sometimes the case in general however they have every resemblance to that light produced by electricity and probably arise from the agitation and dashing of the saline particles of the fluid against each other but the manner in which this is done for we can produce nothing similar by any experiments hitherto made remains for some happier accident to discover our progress in the knowledge of nature is slow and it is a mortifying consideration that we are hitherto more indebted for success to chance than industry  chap xvii of the tides motion and currents of the sea with their effects it was said in the former chapter that the waters of the sea were kept sweet by their motion without which they would soon putrefy and spread universal infection if we look for final causes here indeed we have a great and an obvious one that presents itself before us had the sea been made without motion and resembling a pool of stagnant water the nobler races of animated nature would shortly be at an end nothing would then be left alive but swarms of ill formed creatures with scarce more than vegetable life and subsisting by putrefaction were this extensive bed of waters entirely quiescent millions of the smaller reptile kinds would there find a proper retreat to breed and multiply in they would find there no agitations no concussion in the parts of the fluid to crush their feeble frames or to force them from the places where they were bred there they would multiply in security and ease enjoy a short life and putrefying thus again give nourishment to numberless others as little worthy of existence as themselves but the motion of this great element effectually destroys the number of these viler creatures its currents and its tides produce continual agitations the shock of which they are not able to endure the parts of the fluid rub against each other destroy all viscidities and the ocean if i may so express it acquires health by exercise  the most obvious motion of the sea and the most generally acknowledged is that of its tides this element is observed to flow for certain hours from south toward north in which motion or flux which lasts about six hours the sea gradually swells so that entering the mouths of rivers it drives back the river waters to their heads after a continual flux of six hours the sea seems to rest for a quarter of an hour and then begins to ebb or retire back again from north to south for six hours more in which time the waters sinking the rivers resume their natural course after a seeming pause of a quarter of an hour the sea again begins to flow as before and thus it has alternately risen and fallen twice a day since the creation  this amazing appearance did not fail to excite the curiosity as it did the wonder of the ancients after some wild conjectures of the earliest philosophers it became well known in the times of pliny that the tides were entirely under the influence in a small degree of the sun but in a much greater of the moon it was found that there was a flux and reflux of the sea in the space of twelve hours fifty minutes which is exactly the time of a lunar day it was observed that whenever the moon was in the meridian or in other words as nearly as possible over any part of the sea that the sea flowed to that part and made a tide there on the contrary it was found that when the moon left the meridian the sea began to flow back again from whence it came and there might be said to ebb thus far the waters of the sea seemed very regularly to attend the motions of the moon but as it appeared likewise that when the moon was in the opposite meridian as far off as possible on the other side of the globe that there was a tide on this side also so that the moon produced two tides one by her greatest approach to us and another by her greatest distance from us in other words the moon in once going round the earth produced two tides always at the same time one on the part of the globe directly under her and the other on the part of the globe directly opposite  mankind continued for several ages content with knowing the general cause of these wonders hopeless of discovering the particular manner of the moons operation kepler was the first who conjectured that attraction was the principal cause asserting that the sphere of the moons operation extended to the earth and drew up its waters the precise manner in which this is done was discovered by newton  the moon has been found like all the rest of the planets to attract and to be attracted by the earth this attraction prevails throughout our whole planetary system the more matter there is contained in any body the more it attracts and its influence decreases in proportion as the distance when squared increases this being premised let us see what must ensue upon supposing the moon in the meridian of any tract of the sea the surface of the water immediately under the moon is nearer the moon than any other part of the globe is and therefore must be more subject to its attraction than the waters any where else the waters will therefore be attracted by the moon and rise in an heap whose eminence will be the highest where the attraction is greatest in order to form this eminence it is obvious that the surface as well as the depths will be agitated and that wherever the water runs from one part succeeding waters must run to fill up the space it has left thus the waters of the sea running from all parts to attend the motions of the moon produce the flowing of the tide and it is high tide at that part wherever the moon comes over it or into its meridian  but when the moon travels onward and ceases to point over the place where the waters were just risen the cause here of their rising ceasing to operate they will flow back by their natural gravity into the lower parts from whence they had traveled and this retiring of the waters will form the ebbing of the sea  thus the first part of the demonstration is obvious since in general it requires no great sagacity to conceive that the waters nearest the moon are most attracted or raised highest by the moon but the other part of the demonstration namely how there come to be high tides at the same time on the opposite side of the globe and where the waters are farthest from the moon is not so easy to conceive to comprehend this it must be observed that the part of the earth and its waters that are farthest from the moon are the parts of all others that are least attracted by the moon it must also be observed that all the waters when the moon is on the opposite side of the earth must be attracted by it in the same direction that the earth itself attracts them that is if i may so say quite through the body of the earth toward the moon itself this therefore being conceived it is plain that those waters which are farthest from the moon will have less weight than those of any other part on the same side of the globe because the moons attraction which conspires with the earths attraction is there least now therefore the waters farthest from the moon having less weight and being lightest will be pressed on all sides by those that having more attraction are heavier they will be pressed i say on all sides and the heavier waters flowing in will make them swell and rise in an eminence directly opposite to that on the other side of the globe caused by the more immediate influence of the moon  in this manner the moon in one diurnal revolution produces two tides one raised immediately under the sphere of its influence and the other directly opposite to it as the moon travels this vast body of waters rears upward as if to watch its motions and pursues the same constant rotation however in this great work of raising the tides the sun has no small share it produces its own tides constantly every day just as the moon does but in a much less degree because the sun is at an immensely greater distance thus there are solar tides and lunar tides when the forces of these two great luminaries concur which they always do when they are either in the same or in opposite parts of the heavens they jointly produce a much greater tide than when they are so situated in the heavens as each to make peculiar tides of their own to express the very same thing technically in the conjunctions and oppositions of the sun and moon the attraction of the sun conspires with the attraction of the moon by which means the high springtides are formed but in the quadratures of the sun and moon the water raised by the one is depressed by the other and hence the lower neap tides have their production in a word the tides are greatest in the syzigies and least in the quadratures  this theory well understood and the astronomical terms previously known it may readily be brought to explain the various appearances of the tides if the earth were covered with a deep sea and the waters uninfluenced by shoals currents straits or tempests but in every part of the sea near the shores the geographer must come in to correct the calculations of the astronomer for by reason of the shallowness of some places and the narrowness of the straits in others there arises a great diversity in the effect not to be accounted for without an exact knowledge of all the circumstances of the place in the great depths of the ocean for instance a very slow and imperceptible motion of the whole body of water will suffice to raise its surface several feet high but if the same increase of water is to be conveyed through a narrow channel it must rush through it with the most impetuous rapidity thus in the english channel and the german ocean the tide is found to flow strongest in those places that are narrowest the same quantity of water being in this case to be driven through a smaller passage it is often seen therefore pouring through a straight with great force and by its rapidity considerably raised above the surface of that part of the ocean into which it runs  this shallowness and narrowness in many parts of the sea give also rise to a peculiarity in the tides of some parts of the world for in many places and in our own seas in particular the greatest swell of the tide is not while the moon is at its meridian height and directly over the place but some time after it has declined from thence the sea in this case being obstructed pursues the moon with what dispatch it can but does not arrive with all its waters till long after the moon has ceased to operate lastly from this shallowness of the sea and from its being obstructed by shoals and streights we may account for the mediterranean the baltic and the black sea having no sensible tides these though to us they seem very extensive are not however large enough to be affected by the influence of the moon and as to their communication with the ocean that is through such narrow inlets that it is impossible in a few hours time that they should receive and return water enough to raise or depress them in any considerable degree  in general therefore we may observe that all tides are much higher and more considerable in the torrid zone than in the rest of the ocean the sea in those parts being generally deeper and less affected by changeable winds or winding shores buffon vol ii p      the greatest tide we know of is that at the mouth of the river indus where the water rises thirty feet in height how great therefore must have been the amazement of alexanders soldiers at so strange an appearance they who always before had been accustomed only to the scarcely perceptible risings of the mediterranean or the minute intumescence of the black sea when made at once spectators of a river rising and falling thirty feet in a few hours must no doubt have felt the most extreme awe and as we are told quintius curtius  a mixture of curiosity and apprehension the tides are also remarkably high on the coasts of malay in the streights of sunda in the red sea at the mouth of the river st lawrence along the coasts of china and japan at panama and in the gulf of bengal the tides at tonquin however are the most remarkable in the world in this part there is but one tide and one ebb in twentyfour hours whereas as we have said before in other places there are two besides there twice in each month there is no tide at all when the moon is near the equinoctial the water being for some time quite stagnant these with some other odd appearances attending the same phenomenon were considered by many as inscrutable but sir isaac newton with peculiar sagacity adjudged them to arise from the concurrence of two tides one from the south sea and the other from the indian ocean of each of these tides there come successively two every day two at one time greater and two at another that are less the time between the arrival of the two greater is considered by him as high tide the time between the two lesser as ebb in short with this clue that great mathematician solved every appearance and so established his theory as to silence every opposer  this fluctuation of the sea from the tides produces another and more constant rotation of its waters from the east to the west in this respect following the course of the moon this may be considered as one great and general current of the waters of the sea and although it be not every where distinguishable it is nevertheless every where existent except when opposed by some particular current or eddy produced by partial and local causes this tendency of the sea toward the west is plainly perceivable in all the great streights of the ocean as for instance in those of magellan where the tide running in from the east rises twenty feet high and continues flowing six hours whereas the ebb continues but two hours and the current is directed to the west this proves that the flux is not equal to the reflux and that from both results a motion of the sea westward which is more powerful during the time of the flux than the reflux  but this motion westward has been sensibly observed by navigators in their passage back from india to madagascar and so on to africa in the great pacific ocean also it is very perceivable but the places where it is most obvious are as was said in those streights which join one ocean to another in the streights between the maldivia islands in the gulf of mexico between cuba and jucatan in the streights of the gulf of paria the motion is so violent that it has received the appellation of the dragons mouth northward in the sea of canada in waigats streights in the streights of java and in short in every straight where the ocean on one part pours into the ocean on the other in this manner therefore is the sea carried with an unceasing circulation round the globe and at the same time that its waters are pushed back and forward with the tide they have thus a progressive current to the west which though less observable is not the less real  besides these two general motions of the sea there are others which are particular to many parts of it and are called currents these are found to run in all directions east west north and south being formed as was said above by various causes the prominence of the shores the narrowness of the streigths the variations of the wind and the inequalities at the bottom these though no great object to the philosopher as their causes are generally local and obvious are nevertheless of the most material consequence to the mariner and without a knowledge of which he could never succeed it often has happened that when a ship has unknowingly got into one of these every thing seems to go forward with success the mariners suppose themselves every hour approaching their wished for port the wind fills their sails and the ships prow seems to divide the water but at last by miserable experience they find that instead of going forward they have been all the time receding the business of currents therefore makes a considerable article in navigation and the direction of their stream and their rapidity has been carefully set down this some do by the observation of the surface of the current or by the driving of the froth along the shore or by throwing out what is called the logline with a buoy made for that purpose and by the direction and motion of this they judge of the setting and the rapidity of the current  these currents are generally found to be most violent under the equator where indeed all the motions of the ocean are most perceivable along the coasts of guinea if a ship happens to overshoot the mouth of any river it is bound to the current prevents its return so that it is obliged to steer out to sea and take a very large compass in order to correct the former mistake these set in a contrary direction to the general motion of the sea westward and that so strongly that a passage which with the current is gone in two days is with difficulty performed in six weeks against it however they do not extend above twenty leagues from the coast and ships going to the east indies take care not to come within the sphere of their action at sumatra the currents which are extremely rapid run from south to north there are also strong currents between madagascar and the cape of good hope on the western coasts of america the current always runs from the south to the north where a south wind continually blowing most probably occasions this phenomenon but the currents that are most remarkable are those continually flowing into the mediterranean sea both from the ocean by the streights of gibraltar and at its other extremity from the euxine sea by the archipelago this is one of the most extraordinary appearances in nature this large sea receiving not only the numerous rivers that fall into it such as the nile the rhone and the po but also a very great influx from the euxine sea on one part and the ocean on the other at the same time it is seen to return none of those waters it is thus known to receive outlets running from it there are none no rivers but such as bring it fresh supplies no streights but what are constantly pouring their waters into it it has therefore been the wonder of mankind in every age how and by what means this vast concourse of waters are disposed of or how this sea which is always receiving and never returning is no way fuller than before in order to account for this some have said that the water was reconveyed by subterraneous passages into the red sea kircher mund subt vol i  there is a story told of an arabian califf who caught a dolphin in this sea admiring the beauty of which he let it go again having previously marked it by a ring of iron some time after a dolphin was caught in the red sea and quickly known by the ring to be the same that had been taken in the mediterranean before such however as have not been willing to found their opinions upon a story have attempted to account for the disposal of the waters of the mediterranean by evaporation for this purpose they have entered into long calculations upon the extent of its surface and the quantity of water that would be raised from such a surface in a year they then compute how much water runs in by its rivers and streights in that time and find that the quantity exhausted by evaporation greatly exceeds the quantity supplied by rivers and seas and this solution no doubt would be satisfactory did not the ocean and the euxine evaporate as well as the mediterranean and as these are subject to the same drain it must follow that all the seas will in this respect be upon a par and therefore there must be some other cause for this unperceived drain and continual supply this seems to be satisfactorily enough accounted for by doctor smith who supposes an under current running through the streights of gibraltar to carry out as much water into the ocean as the upper current continually carries in from it to confirm this he observes that nearer home between the north and south foreland the tide is known to run one way at top and the ebb another way at bottom this double current he also confirms by an experiment communicated to him by an able seaman who being with one of the kings frigates in the baltic found he went with his boat into the midstream and was carried violently by the current upon which a basket was sunk with a large cannonball to a certain depth of water which gave a check to the boats motion as the basket sunk still lower the boat was driven by the force of the water below against the upper current and the lower the basket was let down the stronger the under current was found and the quicker was the boats motion against the upper stream which seemed not to be above four fathom deep from hence we may readily infer that the same cause may operate at the streights of gibraltar and that while the mediterranean seems replenishing at top it may be emptying at bottom  the number of the currents at sea are impossible to be recounted nor indeed are they always known new ones are daily produced by a variety of causes and as quickly disappear when a regular current is opposed by another in a narrow straight or where the bottom of the sea is very uneven a whirlpool is often formed these were formerly considered as the most formidable obstructions to navigation and the ancient poets and historians speak of them with terror they are described as swallowing up ships and dashing them against the rocks at the bottom apprehension did not fail to add imaginary terrors to the description and placed at the center of the whirlpool a dreadful den fraught with monsters whose howlings served to add new horrors to the dashings of the deep mankind at present however view these eddies of the sea with very little apprehension and some have wondered how the ancients could have so much overcharged their descriptions but all this is very naturally accounted for in those times when navigation was as yet but beginning and the slightest concussion of the waves generally sent the poor adventurer to the bottom it is not to be wondered at that he was terrified at the violent agitations in one of these when his little ship but ill fitted for opposing the fury of the sea was got within the vortex there was then no possibility of ever returning to add to the fatality they were always near the shore and along the shore was the only place where this ill provided mariner durst venture to sail these were therefore dreadful impediments to his navigation for if he attempted to pass between them and the shore he was sometimes sucked in by the eddy and if he attempted to avoid them out at sea he was often sunk by the storm but in our time and in our present improved state of navigation charybdis and the euripus with all the other irregular currents of the mediterranean are no longer formidable mr addison not attending to this train of thinking upon passing through the streights of sicily was surprised at the little there was of terror in the present appearance of sylla and charybdis and seems to be of opinion that their agitations are much diminished since the times of antiquity in fact from the reasons above all the wonders of the mediterranean sea are described in much higher colors than they merit to us who are acquainted with the more magnificent terrors of the ocean the mediterranean is one of the smoothest and most gentle seas in the world its tides are scarce perceivable except in the gulf of venice and shipwrecks are less known there than in any other part of the world  it is in the ocean therefore that these whirlpools are particularly dangerous where the tides are violent and the tempests fierce to mention only one that called the maelstroom upon the coasts of norway which is considered as the most dreadful and voracious in the world the name it has received from the natives signifies the navel of the sea since they suppose that a great share of the water of the sea is sucked up and discharged by its vortex a minute description of the internal parts is not to be expected since none who were there ever returned to bring back information the body of the waters that form this whirlpool are extended in a circle above thirteen miles in circumference kircher mund subt vol i p      in the midst of this stands a rock against which the tide in its ebb is dashed with inconceivable fury at this time it instantly swallows up all things that come within the sphere of its violence trees timber and shipping no skill in the mariner nor strength of rowing can work an escape the sailor at the helm finds the ship at first go in a current opposite to his intentions his vessels motion though slow in the beginning becomes every moment more rapid it goes round in circles still narrower and narrower till at last it is dashed against the rocks and instantly disappears nor is it seen again for six hours till the tide flowing it is vomited forth with the same violence with which it was drawn in the noise of this dreadful vortex still farther contributes to increase its terror which with the dashing of the waters and the dreadful valley if it may be so called caused by their circulation makes one of the most tremendous objects in nature  chap xvii of the changes produced by the sea upon the earth from what has been said as well of the earth as of the sea they both appear to be in continual fluctuation the earth the common promptuary that supplies subsistence to men animals and vegetables is continually furnishing its stores to their support but the matter which is thus derived from it is soon restored and laid down again to be prepared for fresh mutations the transmigration of souls is no doubt false and whimsical but nothing can be more certain than the transmigration of bodies the spoils of the meanest reptile may go to the formation of a prince and on the contrary as the poet has it the body of caesar may be employed in stopping a beer barrel from this and other causes therefore the earth is in continual change its internal fires the deviation of its rivers and the falling of its mountains are daily altering its surface and geography can scarce recollect the lakes and the valleys that history once described  but these changes are nothing to the instability of the ocean it would seem that inquietude was as natural to it as its fluidity it is first seen with a constant and equable motion going toward the west the tides then interrupt this progression and for a time drive the waters in a contrary direction beside these agitations the currents act their part in a smaller sphere being generally greatest where the other motions of the sea are least namely nearest the shore the winds also contribute their share in this universal fluctuation so that scarce any part of the sea is wholly seen to stagnate  nil enim quiescit undis impellitur unda et spiritus et calor toto se corpore miscent as this great element is thus changed and continually laboring internally it may be readily supposed that it produces correspondent changes upon its shores and those parts of the earth subject to its influence in fact it is every day making considerable alterations either by overflowing its shores in one place or deserting them in others by covering over whole tracts of country that were cultivated and peopled at one time or by leaving its bed to be appropriated to the purposes of vegetation and to supply a new theater for human industry at another  in this struggle between the earth and the sea for dominion the greatest number of our shores seem to defy the whole rage of the waves both by their height and the rocky materials of which they are composed the coasts of italy for instance buffon vol ii p      are bordered with rocks of marble of different kinds the quarries of which may easily be distinguished at a distance from sea and appear like perpendicular columns of the most beautiful kinds of marble ranged along the shore in general the coasts of france from breast to bourdeaux are composed of rocks as are also those of spain and england which defend the land and only are interrupted here and there to give an egress to rivers and to grant the conveniences of bays and harbors to our shipping it may be in general remarked that wherever the sea is most violent and furious there the boldest shores and of the most compact materials are found to oppose it there are many shores several hundred feet perpendicular against which the sea when swollen with tides or storms rises and beats with inconceivable fury in idem vol ii p     the orkneys where the shores are thus formed it sometimes when agitated by a storm rises two hundred feet perpendicular and dashes up its spray together with sand and other substances that compose its bottom upon land like showers of rain  from hence therefore we may conceive how the violence of the sea and the boldness of the shore may be said to have made each other where the sea meets no obstacles it spreads its waters with a gentle intumescence till all its power is destroyed by its wanting depth to aid its motion but when its progress is checked in the midst by the prominence of rocks or the abrupt elevation of the land it dashes with all the force of its depth against the obstacle and forms by its repeated violence that abruptness of the shore which confines its impetuosity where the sea is extremely deep or very much vexed by tempests it is no small obstacle that can confine its rage and for this reason we see the boldest shores projected against the deepest waters all less impediments having long before been surmounted and washed away perhaps of all the shores in the world there is not one so high as that to the west of st kilda which upon a late admeasurement description of st kilda  was found to be six hundred fathom perpendicular above the surface of the sea here also the sea is deep turbulent and stormy so that it requires great force in the shore to oppose its violence in many parts of the world and particularly upon the coasts of the east indies the shores though not high above water are generally very deep and consequently the waves roll against land with great weight and irregularity this rising of the waves against the shore is called by mariners the surf of the sea and in shipwrecks is generally fatal to such as attempt to swim on shore in this case no dexterity in the swimmer no float he can use neither swimming girdle nor cork jacket will save him the weight of the superincumbent wave breaks upon him at once and crushes him with certain ruin some few of the natives however have the art of swimming and of navigating their little boats near those shores where an european is sure of instant destruction  in places where the force of the sea is less violent or its tides less rapid the shores are generally seen to descend with a more gradual declivity over these the waters of the tide steal by almost imperceptible degrees covering them for a large extent and leaving them bare on its recess upon these shores as was said the sea seldom beats with any great violence as a large wave has not depth sufficient to float it onwards so that here only are to be seen gentle surges making calmly toward land and lessening as they approach as the sea in the former description is generally seen to present prospects of tumult and uproar here it more usually exhibits a scene of repose and tranquil beauty its waters which when surveyed from the precipice afforded a muddy greenish hue arising from their depth and position to the eye newtons optics p         when regarded from a shelving shore wear the color of the sky and seem rising to meet it the deafening noise of the deep sea is here converted into gentle murmurs instead of the waters dashing against the face of the rock it advances and recedes still going forward but with just force enough to push its weeds and shells by insensible approaches to the shore  there are still other shores beside those already described which either have been raised by art to oppose the seas approaches or from the seas gaining ground are threatened with imminent destruction the seas being thus seen to give and take away lands at pleasure is without question one of the most extraordinary considerations in all natural history in some places it is seen to obtain the superiority by slow and certain approaches or to burst in at once and overwhelm all things in undistinguished destruction in other places it departs from its shores and where its waters have been known to rage it leaves fields covered with the most beautiful verdure  the formation of new lands by the seas continually bringing its sediment to one place and by the accumulation of its sands in another is easily conceived we have had many instances of this in england the island of oxney which is adjacent to romneymarsh was produced in this manner this had for a long time been a low level continually in danger of being overflown by the river rother but the sea by its depositions has gradually raised the bottom of the river while it has hollowed the mouth so that the one is sufficiently secured from inundations and the other is deep enough to admit ships of considerable burden the like also may be seen at that bank called the doggersands where two tides meet and which thus receive new increase every day so that in time the place seems to promise fair for being habitable earth on many parts of the coasts of france england holland germany and prussia the sea has been sensibly known to retire buffon vol vi p      hubert thomas asserts in his description of the country of liege that the sea formerly encompassed the city of tongres which however is at present thirtyfive leagues distant from it this assertion he supports by many strong reasons and among others by the iron rings fixed in the walls of the town for fastening the ships that came into the port in italy there is a considerable piece of ground gained at the mouth of the river arno and ravenna that once stood by the seaside is now considerably removed from the same but we need scarce mention these when we find that the whole kingdom of holland seems to be a conquest upon the sea and in a manner rescued from its bosom the surface of the earth in this country is below the level of the bed of the sea and i remember upon approaching the coast to have looked down upon it from the sea as into a valley however it is every day rising higher by the depositions made upon it both by the sea the rhine and the meuse and those parts which formerly admitted large men of war are now known to be too shallow to receive ships of very moderate burden buffon vol vi p      the province of jucatan a peninsula in the gulf of mexico was formerly a part of the sea this tract which stretches out into the ocean an hundred leagues and which is above thirty broad is every where at a moderate depth below the surface composed of shells which evince that its land once formed the bed of the sea in france the town of aigues mortes was a port in the times of st louis which is now removed more than four miles from the sea psalmodi in the same kingdom was an island in the year     but is now more than six miles from the shore all along the coasts of norfolk i am very well assured that in the memory of man the sea has gained fifty yards in some places and has lost as much in others  thus numerous therefore are the instances of new lands having been produced from the sea which as we see is brought about two different ways first by the waters raising banks of sand and mud where their sediment is deposited and secondly by their relinquishing the shore entirely and leaving it unoccupied to the industry of man  but as the sea has been thus known to recede from some lands so has it by fatal experience been found to encroach upon others and probably these depredations on one part of the shore may account for their dereliction from another for the current which rested upon some certain bank having got an egress in some other place it no longer presses upon its former bed but pours all its stream into the new entrance so that every inundation of the sea may be attended with some correspondent dereliction of another shore  however this be we have numerous histories of the seas inundations and its burying whole provinces in its bosom many countries that have been thus destroyed still bear melancholy witness to the truth of history and show the tops of their houses and the spires of their steeples still standing at the bottom of the water one of the most considerable inundations we have in history is that which happened in the reign of henry i which overflowed the estates of the earl godwin and forms now that bank called the goodwin sands in the year      a similar irruption of the sea destroyed an hundred thousand persons in the territory of dort and yet a greater number round dullart in friezland and zealand there were more than three hundred villages overwhelmed and their remains continue still visible at the bottom of the water in a clear day the baltic sea has by slow degrees covered a large part of pomerania and among others destroyed and overwhelmed the famous port of vineta in the same manner the norwegian sea has formed several little islands from the main land and still daily advances upon the continent the german sea has advanced upon the shores of holland near catt so that the ruins of an ancient citadel of the romans which was formerly built upon this coast are now actually under water to these accidents several more might be added our own historians and those of other countries abound with them almost every flat shore of any extent being able to show something that it has lost or something that it has gained from the sea  there are some shores on which the sea has made temporary depredations where it has overflowed and after remaining perhaps some ages it has again retired of its own accord or been driven back by the industry of man buffon vol ii p      there are many lands in norway scotland and the maldivia islands that are at one time covered with water and at another free the country round the isle of ely in the times of bid about a thousand years ago was one of the most delightful spots in the whole kingdom it was not only richly cultivated and produced all the necessaries of life but grapes also that afforded the most excellent wine the accounts of that time are copious in the description of its verdure and fertility its rich pastures covered with flowers and herbage its beautiful shades and wholesome air but the sea breaking in upon the land overwhelmed the whole country took possession of the soil and totally destroyed one of the most beautiful valleys in the world its air from being dry and healthful from that time became most unwholesome and clogged with vapors and the small part of the country that by being higher than the rest escaped the deluge was soon rendered uninhabitable from its noxious vapors thus this country continued under water for some centuries till at last the sea by the same caprice which had prompted its invasions began to abandon the the earth in like manner it has continued for some ages to relinquish its former conquests and although the inhabitants can neither boast the longevity nor the luxuries of their former preoccupants yet they find ample means of subsistence and if they happen to survive the first years of their residence there they are often known to arrive at a good old age  but although history be silent as to many other inundations of the like kind where the sea has overflowed the country and afterward retired yet we have numberless testimonies of another nature that prove it beyond the possibility of doubt i mean those numerous trees that are found buried at considerable depths in places where either rivers or the sea has accidentally overflown buffon vol ii p  0   at the mouth of the river ness near bruges in flanders at the depth of fifty feet are found great quantities of trees lying as close to each other as they do in a wood the trunks the branches and the leaves are in such perfect preservation that the particular kind of each tree may instantly be known about five hundred years ago this very ground was known to have been covered with the sea nor is there any history or tradition of its having been dry ground which we can have no doubt must have been the case thus we see a country flourishing in verdure producing large forests and trees of various kinds overwhelmed by the sea we see this element depositing its sediment to an height of fifty feet and its waters must therefore have risen much higher we see the same after it has thus overwhelmed and sunk the land so deep beneath its slime capriciously retiring from the same coasts and leaving that habitable once more which it had formerly destroyed all this is wonderful and perhaps instead of attempting to enquire after the cause which has hitherto been inscrutable it will best become us to rest satisfied with admiration  at the city of modena in italy and about four miles round it wherever it is dug when the workmen arrive at the depth of sixtythree feet they come to a bed of chalk which they bore with an augre five feet deep they then withdraw from the pit before the augre is removed and upon its extraction the water bursts up through the aperture with great violence and quickly fills this new made well which continues full and is affected neither by rains nor droughts but that which is most remarkable in this operation is the layers of earth as we descend at the depth of fourteen feet are found the ruins of an ancient city paved streets houses floors and different pieces of mosaic under this is found a solid earth that would induce one to think had never been removed however under it is found a soft oozy earth made up of vegetables and at twentysix feet depth large trees entire such as walnuttrees with the walnuts still sticking on the stem and their leaves and branches in exact preservation at twentyeight feet deep a soft chalk is found mixed with a vast quantity of shells and this bed is eleven feet thick under this vegetables are found again with leaves and branches of trees as before and thus alternately chalk and vegetable earth to the depth of sixtythree feet these are the layers wherever the workmen attempt to bore while in many of them they also find pieces of charcoal bones and bits of iron from this description therefore it appears that this country has been alternately overflowed and deserted by the sea one age after another nor were these overflowings and retirings of trifling depth or of short continuance when the sea burst in it must have been a long time in overwhelming the branches of the fallen forest with its sediment and still longer in forming a regular bed of shells eleven feet over them it must have therefore taken an age at least to make any one of these layers and we may conclude that it must have been many ages employed in the production of them all the land also upon being deserted must have had time to grow compact to gather fresh fertility and to be drained of its waters before it could be disposed to vegetation or before its trees could have shot forth again to maturity  we have instances nearer home of the same kind given us in the philosophical transactions one of them by mr derham an inundation of the sea at dagenham in essex laying bare a part of the adjacent pasture for above two hundred feet wide and in some places twenty deep it discovered a number of trees that had lain there for many ages before these trees by lying long under ground were become black and hard and their fibers so tough that one might as easily break a wire as any of them they lay so thick in the place where they were found that in many parts he could step from one to another he conceived also that not only all the adjacent marshes for several hundred acres were covered underneath with such timber but also the marshes along the mouth of the thames for several miles the meeting with these trees at such depths he ascribes to the sediment of the river and the tides which constantly washing over them have always left some part of their substance behind so as by repeated alluvions to work a bed of vegetable earth over them to the height at which he found it  the levels of hatfieldchace in yorkshire a tract of above eighteen thousand acres which was yearly overflown was reduced to arable and pastureland by one sir cornelius vermusden a dutchman at the bottom of this wide extent are found millions of the roots and bodies of trees of such as this island either formerly did or does at present produce the roots of all stand in their proper postures and by them as thick as ever they could grow the respective trunks of each some above thirty yards long the oaks some of which have been sold for fifteen pounds a piece are as black as ebony very lasting and close grained the ashtrees are as soft as earth and are commonly cut in pieces by the workmens spades and as soon as flung up into the open air turn to dust but all the rest even the willows themselves which are softer than the ash preserve their substance and texture to this very day some of the firs appear to have vegetated even after they were fallen and to have from their branches struck up large trees as great as the parent trunk it is observable that many of these trees have been burnt some quite through some on one side some have been found chopped and squared others riven with great wooden wedges all sufficiently manifesting that the country which was deluged had formerly been inhabited near a great root of one tree were found eight coins of the roman emperors and in some places the marks of the ridge and furrow were plainly perceivable which testified that the ground had formerly been patient of cultivation  the learned naturalist who has given this description phil trans vol iv part ii p      has pretty plainly evinced that this forest in particular must have been thus levelled by the romans and that the falling of the trees must have contributed to the accumulation of the waters the romans says he when the britons fled always pursued them into the fortresses of low woods and miry forests in these the wild natives found shelter and when opportunity offered issued out and fell upon their invaders without mercy in this manner the romans were at length so harrassed that orders were issued out for cutting down all the woods and forests in britain in order to effect this and destroy the enemy the easier they set fire to the woods composed of pines and other inflamable timber which spreading the conflagration destroyed not only the forest but infinite numbers of the wretched inhabitants who had taken shelter therein when the pinetrees had thus done what mischief they could the romans then brought their army nearer and with whole legions of the captive britons cut down most of the trees that were yet left standing leaving only here and there some great trees untouched as monuments of their fury these unneedful of their labor being destitute of the support of the underwood and of their neighboring trees were easily overthrown by the winds and without interruption remained on the places where they happened to fall the forest thus fallen must necessarily have stopped up the currents both from land and sea and turned into great lakes what were before but temporary streams the working of the waters here the consumption and decay of rotten boughs and branches and the vast increase of watermoss which flourishes upon marshy grounds soon formed a covering over the trunks of the fallen trees and raised the earth several feet above its former level the earth thus every day swelling by a continual increase from the sediment of the waters and by the lightness of the vegetable substances of which it was composed soon overtopt the waters by which this intumescence was at first effected so that it entirely got rid of its inundations or only demanded a slight assistance from man for that purpose and this may be the origin of all bogs whatsoever which are formed by the putrefaction of vegetable substances mixed with the mud and slime deposited by waters and at length acquiring a sufficient consistency  from this we see what powerful effects the sea is capable of producing upon its shores either by overflowing some or deserting others by altering the direction of these and rendering those craggy and precipitate which before were shelving but the influence it has upon these is nothing to that which it has upon that great body of earth which forms its bottom it is at the bottom of the sea that the greatest wonders are performed and the most rapid changes are produced it is there that the motion of the tides and the currents have their whole force and agitate the substances of which their bed is composed but all these are almost wholly hid from human curiosity the miracles of the deep are performed in secret and we have but little information from its abysses except what we receive by inspection at very shallow depths or by the plummet or from diverse who are known to descend from twenty to thirty fathom phil trans vol iv part ii p       the eye can reach but a very short way into the depths of the sea and that only when its surface is glassy and serene in many seas it perceives nothing but a bright sandy plain at bottom extending for several hundred miles without an intervening object but in others particularly in the red sea it is very different the whole bottom of this extensive bed of waters is literally speaking a forest of submarine plants and corals formed by insects for their habitation sometimes branching out to a great extent here are seen the madrepores the sponges mosses sea mushrooms and other marine productions covering every part of the bottom so that some have even supposed the sea to have taken its name from the color of its plants below however these plants are by no means peculiar to this sea as they are found in great quantities in the persian gulf along the coasts of africa and those of provence and catalonia  the bottom of many parts of the sea near america presents a very different though a very beautiful appearance this is covered with vegetables which make it look as green as a meadow and beneath are seen thousands of turtles and other sea animals feeding thereon  in order to extend our knowledge of the sea to greater depths recourse has been had to the plummet which is generally made of a lump of lead of about forty pounds weight fastened to a cord buffon vol ii p    this however only answers in moderate depths for when a deep sea is to be sounded the matter of which the cord is composed being lighter than the water floats upon it and when let down to a considerable depth its length so increases its surface that it is often sufficient to prevent the lead from sinking so that this may be the reason that some parts of the sea are said to have no bottom  in general we learn from the plummet that the bottom of the sea is tolerably even where it has been examined and that the farther from the shore the sea is in general the deeper notwithstanding now and then in the midst of a great and unfathomable ocean we often find an island raising its head and singly braving its fury such islands may be considered as the mountains of the deep and could we for a moment imagine the waters of the ocean removed or dried away we should probably find the inequalities of its bed resembling those that are found at land here extensive plains there valleys and in many places mountains of amazing height m buache has actually given us a map of that part of its bottom which lies between africa and america taken from the several soundings of mariners in it we find the same uneven surface that we do upon land the same eminences and the same depressions in such an imaginary prospect however there would be this difference that as the tops of land mountains appear the most barren and rocky the tops of seamountains would be found the most verdant and fruitful  the plummet which thus gives us some idea of the inequalities of the bottom leaves us totally in the dark as to every other particular recourse therefore has been had to diverse these either being bred up in this dangerous way of life and accustomed to remain some time under water without breathing or assisted by means of a divingbell have been able to return some confused and uncertain accounts of the places below in the great divingbell improved by doctor halley which was large enough to contain five men and was supplied with fresh air by buckets that alternately rose and fell they descended fifty fathom in this huge machine which was let down from the mast of the ship the doctor himself went down to the bottom where when the sea was clear and especially when the sun shone he could see perfectly well to write or read and much more to take up any thing that was underneath at other times when the water was troubled and thick it was as dark as night below so that he was obliged to keep a candle lighted at the bottom but there is one thing very remarkable which is that the water which from above was usually seen of a green color when looked at from below appeared to him of a very different one casting a redness upon one of his hands like that of damask roses newtons optic p      a proof of the seas taking its color not from any thing floating in it but from the different reflections of the rays of light upon the whole the accounts we have received from the bottom by this contrivance are but few we learn from it and from diverse in general that while the surface of the sea may be deformed by tempests it is usually calm and temperate below boil vol iii p      that some diverse who have gone down when the weather was calm and came up when it was tempestuous were surprised at their not perceiving the change at the bottom this however must not be supposed to obtain with regard to the tides and the currents as they are seen constantly shifting their bottom taking their bed with great violence from one place and depositing it upon another we are informed also by diverse that the sea grows colder in proportion as they descend to the bottom that as far as the suns rays pierce it is influenced by their warmth but lower the cold becomes almost intolerable a person of quality who had been himself a diver as mr boil informs us declared that though he seldom descended above three or four fathoms yet he found it so much colder than near the top that he could not well endure it and that being let down in a great divingbell although the water could not immediately touch him he found the air extremely cold upon his first arrival at the bottom  from diverse also we learn that the sea in many places is filled with rocks at bottom and that among their clifts and upon their sides various substances sprout forward which are either really vegetables or the nests of insects increased to some magnitude some of these assume the shape of beautiful flowers and though soft when taken up soon harden and are kept in the cabinets of the curious  but of all those diverse who have brought us information from the bottom of the deep the famous nicola pesce whose performances are told us by kircher is the most celebrated i will not so much as pretend to vouch for the veracity of kirchers account which he assures us he had from the archives of the kings of sicily but it may serve to enliven an heavy chapter in the times of frederic king of sicily there lived a celebrated diver whose name was nicolas and who from his amazing skill in swimming and his perseverance under water was surnamed the fish this man had from his infancy been used to the sea and earned his scanty subsistence by diving for corals and oysters which he sold to the villages on shore his long acquaintance with the sea at last brought it to be almost his natural element he frequently was known to spend five days in the midst of the waves without any other provisions than the fish which he caught there and ate raw he often swam over from sicily into calabria a tempestuous and dangerous passage carrying letters from the king he was frequently known to swim among the gulphs of the lipari islands no way apprehensive of danger some mariners out at sea one day observed something at some distance from them which they regarded as a sea monster but upon its approach it was known to be nicolas whom they took into their ship when they asked him whither he was going in so stormy and rough a sea and at such a distance from land he showed them a packet of letters which he was carrying to one of the towns of italy exactly done up in a leather bag in such a manner as that they could not be wetted by the sea he kept them thus company for some time on their voyage conversing and asking questions and after eating an hearty meal with them he took his leave and jumping into the sea pursued his voyage alone  in order to aid these powers of enduring in the deep nature seemed to have assisted him in a very extraordinary manner for the spaces between his fingers and toes were webbed as in a goose and his chest became so very capacious that he could take in at one inspiration as much breath as would serve him for an whole day  the account of so extraordinary a person did not fail to reach the king himself who actuated by the general curiosity ordered that nicolas should be brought before him it was no easy matter to find nicolas who generally spent his time in the solitudes of the deep but at last however after much searching he was found and brought before his majesty the curiosity of this monarch had been long excited by the accounts he had heard of the bottom of the gulf of charybdis he now therefore conceived that it would be a proper opportunity to have more certain information he therefore commanded our poor diver to examine the bottom of this dreadful whirlpool and as an incitement to his obedience ordered a golden cup to be flung into it nicolas was not insensible of the danger to which he was exposed dangers best known only to himself and he therefore presumed to remonstrate but the hopes of the reward the desire of pleasing the king and the pleasure of showing his skill at last prevailed he instantly jumped into the gulf and was swallowed as instantly up in its bosom he continued for three quarters of an hour below during which time the king and his attendants remained upon shore anxious for his fate but he at last appeared buffeting upon the surface holding the cup in triumph in one hand and making his way good among the waves with the other it may be supposed he was received with applause upon his arrival on shore the cup was made the reward of his adventure the king ordered him to be taken proper care of and as he was somewhat fatigued and debilitated by his labor after an hearty meal he was put to bed and permitted to refresh himself by sleeping  when his spirits were thus restored he was again brought to satisfy the kings curiosity with a narrative of the wonders he had seen and his account was to the following effect he would never he said have obeyed the kings commands had he been apprized of half the dangers that were before him there were four things he said that rendered the gulf dreadful not only to men but even to the fishes themselves first the force of the water bursting up from the bottom which require great strength to resist secondly the abruptness of the rocks that on every side threatened destruction thirdly the force of the whirlpool dashing against those rocks and fourthly the number and magnitude of the polypous fish some of which appeared as large as a man and which every where sticking against the rocks projected their fibrous arms to entangle him being asked how he was able so readily to find the cup that had been thrown in he replied that it happened to be flung by the waves into the cavity of a rock against which he himself was urged in his descent this account however did not satisfy the kings curiosity being requested to venture once more into the gulf for further discoveries he at first refused but the king desirous of having the most exact information possible of all things to be found in the gulf repeated his solicitations and to give them still greater weight produced a larger cup than the former and added also a purse of gold upon these considerations the unfortunate pessacola once again plunged into the whirlpool and was never heard of more    chap xviii a summary account of the mechanical properties of air having described the earth and the sea we now ascend into that fluid which surrounds them both and which in some measure supports and supplies all animated nature as upon viewing the bottom of the ocean from its surface we see an infinity of animals moving therein and seeking food so were some superior being to regard the earth at a proper distance he might consider us in the same light he might from his superior station behold a number of busy little beings immersed in the aerial fluid that every where surrounds them and sedulously employed in procuring the means of subsistence this fluid though too fine for the gross perception of its inhabitants might to his nicer organs of sight be very visible and while he at once saw into its operations he might smile at the varieties of human conjecture concerning it he might readily discern perhaps the height above the surface of the earth to which this fluid atmosphere reaches he might exactly determine that peculiar form of its parts which gives it the spring or elasticity with which it is endued he might distinguish which of its parts were pure incorruptible air and which only made for a little time to assume the appearance so as to be quickly returned back to the element from whence it came but as for us who are immersed at the bottom of this gulf we must be contented with a more confined knowledge and wanting a proper point of prospect remain satisfied with a combination of the effects  one of the first things therefore that our senses informs us of is that although the air is too fine for our sight it is very obvious to our touch although we cannot see the wind contained in a bladder we can very readily feel its resistance and though the hurricane may want color we often fatally experience that it does not want force we have equal experience of the airs spring or elasticity the bladder when pressed returns again upon the pressure being taken away a bottle when filled often bursts from the spring of air which is included  so far the slightest experience reaches but by carrying experiment a little farther we learn that air also is heavy a round glass vessel being emptied of its air and accurately weighed has been found lighter than when it was weighed with the air in it upon computing the superior weight of the full vessel a cubic foot of air is found to weigh something more than an ounce  from this experiment therefore we learn that the earth and all things upon its surface are every where covered with a ponderous fluid which rising very high over our heads must be proportionably heavy for instance as in the sea a man at the depth of twenty feet sustains a greater weight of water than a man at the depth of but ten feet so will a man at the bottom of a valley have a greater weight of air over him than a man on the top of a mountain  from hence we may conclude that we sustain a very great weight of air and although like men walking at the bottom of the sea we cannot feel the weight which presses equally round us yet the pressure is not the less real as in morals we seldom know the blessings that surround us till we are deprived of them so here we do not perceive the weight of the ambient fluid till a part of it is taken away if by any means we contrive to take away the pressure of the air from any one part of our bodies we are soon made sensible of the weight upon the other parts thus if we clap our hand upon the mouth of a vessel from whence the air has been taken away there will thus be air on one side and none on the other upon which we shall instantly find the hand violently sucked inwards which is nothing more than the weight of the air upon the back of the hand that crushes it into the space which is empty below  as by this experiment therefore we perceive that the air presses with great weight upon every thing on the surface of the earth so by other experiments we learn the exact weight with which it presses first if the air be exhausted out of any vessel a drinkingglass for instance this may be done by burning a bit of paper in the same and then quickly turning it down upon the water  and this vessel be set with the mouth downwards in water the water will rise up into the empty space and fill the inverted glass for the external air will in this case press up the water where there is no weight to resist as one part of a bed being pressed makes the other parts that have no weight upon them rise in this case therefore as was said the water being pressed without will rise in the glass and would continue to rise if the empty glass were tall enough thirtytwo feet high in fact there have been pipes made purposely for this experiment of above thirtytwo feet high in which upon being exhausted the water has always risen to the height of thirtytwo feet there it has always rested and never ascended higher from this therefore we learn that the weight of the air which presses up the water is equal to a pillar or column of water which is thirtytwo feet high as it is just able to raise such a column and no more in other words the surface of the earth is every where covered with a weight of air which is equivalent to a covering of thirtytwo feet deep of water or to a weight of twentynine inches and an half of quicksilver which is known to be just as heavy as the former  thus therefore we see that the air at the surface of the earth is just as heavy as thirtytwo feet of water or twentynine inches and an half of quicksilver and it is easily found by computation that to raise water thirtytwo feet will require a weight of fifteen pounds upon every square inch now if we are fond of computations we have only to calculate how many square inches are in the surface of an ordinary human body and allowing every inch to sustain fifteen pounds we may amaze ourselves at the weight of air we sustain it has been computed and found that our ordinary load of air amounts to within a little of forty thousand pounds this is wonderful but wondering is not the way to grow wise  notwithstanding this be our ordinary load and our usual supply there are at different times very great variations the air is not like water equally heavy at all seasons but sometimes is lighter and sometimes more heavy it is sometimes more comprest and sometimes more elastic or springy which produces the same effects as an increase of its weight the air which at one time raises water thirtytwo feet in the tube and quicksilver twentynine inches will not at another raise the one to thirty feet or the other to twentysix inches this makes therefore a very great difference in the weight we sustain and we are actually known by computation to carry at one time four thousand pounds of air more than at another  the reason of this surprising difference in the weight of air is either owing to its pressure from above or to an increase of vapor floating in it its increased pressure is the consequence of its spring or elasticity which cold and heat sensibly affect and are continually changing  this elasticity of the air is one of its most amazing properties and to which it should seem nothing can set bounds a body of air that may be contained in a nutshell may easily with heat be dilated into a sphere of unknown dimensions on the contrary the air contained in an house may be compressed into a cavity not larger than the eye of a needle in short no bounds can be set to its confinement or expansion at least experiment has hitherto found its attempts indefinite in every situation it retains its elasticity and the more closely we compress it the more strongly does it resist the pressure if to the increasing the elasticity on one side by compression we increase it on the other side by heat the force of both soon becomes irresistible and a certain french philosopher supposed monsieur amontons  that air thus confined and expanding was sufficient for the explosion of a world  many instruments have been formed to measure and determine these different properties of the air and which serve several useful purposes the barometer serves to measure its weight to tell us when it is heavier and when lighter it is composed of a glass tube or pipe of about thirty inches in length closed up at one end this tube is then filled with quicksilver this done the maker clapping his finger upon the open end inverts the tube and plunges the open end finger and all into a basin of quicksilver and then takes his finger away now the quicksilver in the tube will by its own weight endeavor to descend into that in the basin but the external air pressing on the surface of the quicksilver in the basin without and no air being in the tube at top the quicksilver will continue in the tube being pressed up as was said by the air on the surface of the basin below the height at which it is known to stand in the tube is usually about twentynine inches when the air is heavy but not above twentysix when the air is very light thus by this instrument we can with some exactness determine the weight of the air and of consequence tell beforehand the changes of the weather before fine dry weather the air is charged with a variety of vapors which float in it unseen and render it extremely heavy so that it presses up the quicksilver or in other words the barometer rises in moist rainy weather the vapors are washed down or there is not heat sufficient for them to rise so that the air is then sensibly lighter and presses up the quicksilver with less force or in other words the barometer is seen to fall our constitutions seem also to correspond with the changes of the weatherglass they are braced strong and vigorous with a large body of air upon them they are languid relaxed and feeble when the air is light and refuses to give our fibers their proper tone  but although the barometer thus measures the weight of the air with exactness enough for the general purposes of life yet it is often affected with a thousand irregularities that no exactness in the instrument can remedy nor no theory account for when high winds blow the quicksilver generally is low it rises higher in cold weather than in warm and is usually higher at morning and evening than at midday it generally descends lower after rain than it was before it there are also frequent changes in the air without any sensible alteration in the barometer  as the barometer is thus used in predicting the changes of the weather so it is also serviceable in measuring the heights of mountains which mathematicians cannot so readily do for as the higher we asccend from the surface of the earth the air becomes lighter so the quicksilver in the barometer will descend in proportion it is found to sink at the rate of the tenth part of an inch for every ninety feet we ascend so that in going up a mountain if i find the quicksilver fallen an inch i conclude that i am got upon an ascent of near nine hundred feet high in this there has been found some variation into a detail of which it is not the business of a natural historian to enter  in order to determine the elasticity of air the wind gun has been invented which is an instrument variously made but in all upon the principle of compressing a large quantity of air into a tube in which there is an ivory ball and then giving the compressed elastic air free power to act and drive the ball as directed the ball thus driven will pierce a thick board and will be as fatal at small distances as if driven with gunpowder i do not know whether ever the force of this instrument has been assisted by means of heat certain i am that this which could be very easily contrived by means of phosphorus or any other hot substance applied to the barrel would give such a force as i doubt whether gunpowder itself could produce  the airpump is an instrument contrived to exhaust the air from round a vessel adapted to that purpose called a receiver this method of exhausting is contrived in the simple instrument by a piston like that of a syringe going down into the vessel and thus pushing out its air which by means of a valve is prevented from returning into the vessel again but this like all other complicated instruments will be better understood by a minute inspection than an hours description it may suffice here to observe that by depriving animals and other substances of all air it shows us what the benefits and effects of air are in sustaining life or promoting vegetation  the digester is an instrument of still more extraordinary effects than any of the former and sufficiently discovers the amazing force of air when its elasticity is augmented by fire a common teakettle if the spout were closed up and the lid put firmly down would serve to become a digester if strong enough but the instrument used for this purpose is a strong metal pot with a lid to screw close on so that when down no air can get in or return into this pot meat and bones are put with a small quantity of water and then the lid screwed close a lighted lamp is put underneath and what is very extraordinary yet equally true in six or eight minutes the whole mass bones and all are dissolved into a jelly so great is the force and elasticity of the air contained within struggling to escape and breaking in pieces all the substances with which it is mixed care however must be taken not to heat this instrument too violently for then the enclosed air would become irresistible and burst the whole with perhaps a fatal explosion  there are numberless other useful instruments made to depend on the weight the elasticity or the fluidity of the air which do not come within the plan of the present work the design of which is not to give an account of the inventions that have been made for determining the nature and properties of air but a mere narrative of its effects the description of the pump the forcing pump the fire engine the steam engine the siphon and an hundred others belong not to the naturalist but the experimental philosopher the one gives an history of nature as he finds she presents herself to him and he draws the obvious picture the other pursues her with close investigation tortures her by experiment to give up her secrets and measures her latent qualities with laborious precision much more therefore might be said of the mechanical effects of air and of the conjectures that have been made respecting the form of its parts how some have supposed them to resemble little hoops coild up in a spring others like fleeces of wool others that the parts are endued with a repulsive quality by which when squeezed together they endeavor to fly off and recede from each other we might have given the disputes relative to the height to which this body of air extends above us and concerning which there is no agreement we might have enquired how much of the air we breathe is elementary and not reducible to any other substance and of what density it would become if it were supposed to be continued down to the center of the earth at that place we might with the help of figures and a bold imagination have shown it twenty thousand times heavier than its bulk of gold we might also prove it millions of times purer than upon earth when raised to the surface of the atmosphere but these speculations do not belong to natural history and they have hitherto produced no great advantages in that branch of science to which they more properly appertain  chap xix an essay toward a natural history of the air a late eminent philosopher has considered our atmosphere as one large chemical vessel in which an infinite number of various operations are constantly performing in it all the bodies of the earth are continually sending up a part of their substance by evaporation to mix in this great alembic and to float awhile in common here minerals from their lowest depths ascend in noxious or in warm vapors to make a part of the general mass seas rivers and subterraneous springs furnish their copious supplies plants receive and return their share and animals that by living upon consume this general store are found to give it back in greater quantities when they die boil vol ii p      the air therefore that we breathe and upon which we subsist bears very little resemblance to that pure elementary body which was described in the last chapter and which is rather a substance that may be conceived than experienced to exist air such as we find it is one of the most compounded bodies in all nature water may be reduced to a fluid every way resembling air by heat which by cold becomes water again every thing we see gives off its parts to the air and has a little floating atmosphere of its own round it the rose is encompassed with a sphere of its own odorous particles while the nightshade infects the air with scents of a more ungrateful nature the perfume of musk flies off in such abundance that the quantity remaining becomes sensibly lighter by the loss a thousand substances that escape all our senses we know to be there the powerful emanations of the lodestone the effluvia of electricity the rays of light and the insinuations of fire such are the various substances through which we move and which we are constantly taking in at every pore and returning again with imperceptible discharge  this great solution or mixture of all earthly bodies is continually operating upon itself which perhaps may be the cause of its unceasing motion but it operates still more visibly upon such grosser substances as are exposed to its influence for scarce any substance is found capable of resisting the corroding qualities of the air the air say the chemists is a chaos furnished with all kinds of salts and menstruums and therefore it is capable of dissolving all kinds of bodies it is well known that copper and iron are quickly covered and eaten with rust and that in the climates near the equator no art can keep them clean in those dreary countries the instruments knives and keys that are kept in the pocket nevertheless are quickly encrusted and the great guns with every precaution after some years become useless stones as being less hard may be readily supposed to be more easily soluble the marble of which the noble monuments of italian antiquity are composed although in one of the finest climates in the world nevertheless show the impressions which have been made upon them by the air in many places they seem wormeaten by time and in others they appear crumbling into dust gold alone seems to be exempted from this general state of dissolution it is never found to contract rust though exposed never so long the reason of this seems to be that sea salt which is the only menstruum capable of acting upon and dissolving gold is but very little mixed with the air for salt being a very fixed body and not apt to volatilize and rise with heat there is but a small proportion of it in the atmosphere in the elaboratories and shops however where salt is much used and the air is impregnated with it gold is found to rust as well as other metals  bodies of a softer nature are obviously destroyed by the air buffon vol iii p     mr boil says that silks brought to jamaica will if there exposed to the air rot even while they preserve their color but if kept therefrom they both retain their strength and gloss the same happens in brasil where their clothes which are black soon turn of an iron color though in the shops they preserve their proper hue ibid vol iii p     in these tropical climates also such are the putrescent qualities of the air that white sugar will sometimes be full of maggots drugs and plasters lose their virtue and become verminous in some places they are obliged to expose their sweetmeats by day in the sun otherwise the night air would quickly cause them to putrefy on the contrary in the cold arctic regions animal substances during their winter are never known to putrefy and meat may be kept for months without any salt whatsoever this experiment happily succeeded with the eight englishmen that were accidentally left upon the inhospitable coasts of greenland at a place where seven dutchmen had perished but a few years before for killing some reindeer for their subsistence and having no salt to preserve the flesh to their great surprise they soon found it did not want any as it remained sweet during their eight months continuance upon that shore  these powers with which air is endued over unorganized substances are exerted in a still stronger manner over plants animals of an inferior nature and lastly over man himself most of the beauty and the luxuriance of vegetation is well known to be derived from the benign influence of the air and every plant seems to have its favorite climate not less than its proper soil the lower ranks of animals also seem formed for their respective climates in which only they can live man alone seems the child of every climate and capable of existing in all however this peculiar privilege does not exempt him from the influences of the air he is as much subject to its malignity as the meanest insect or vegetable  with regard to plants air is so absolutely necessary for their life and preservation that they will not vegetate in an exhausted receiver all plants have within them a quantity of air which supports and agitates their juices they are continually imbibing fresh nutriment from the air to increase this store and to supply the wants which they sustain from evaporation when therefore the external air is drawn from them they are no longer able to subsist even that quantity of air which they before were possessed of escapes through their pores into the exhausted receiver and as this continues to be pumped away they become languid grow flaccid and die however the plant or flower thus ceasing to vegetate is kept by being secured from the external air a much longer time sweet than it would have continued had it been openly exposed  that air which is so necessary to the life of vegetables is still more so to that of animals there are none found how seemingly torpid soever that do not require their needful supply fishes themselves will not live in water from whence the air is exhausted and it is generally supposed that they die in frozen ponds from the want of this necessary to animal existence many have been the animals that idle curiosity has tortured in the prison of a receiver merely to observe the manner of their dying we shall from a thousand instances produce that of the viper as it is known to be one of the most vivacious reptiles in the world and as we shall feel but little compassion for its tortures mr boil took a new caught viper and shutting it up into a small receiver began to pump away the air boyles phico mechan exper passim  at first upon the airs being drawn away it began to swell some time after he had done pumping it began to gape and open its jaws being thus compelled to open its jaws it once more resumed its former lankness it then began to move up and down within as if to seek for air and after a while foamed a little leaving the foam sticking to the inside of the glass soon after the body and neck grew prodigiously tumid and a blister appeared upon its back an hour and an half after the receiver was exhausted the distended viper moved and gave manifest signs of life the jaws remained quite distended as it were from beneath the epiglottis came the black tongue and reached beyond it but the animal seemed by its posture not to have any life the mouth also was grown blackish within and in this situation it continued for twentythree hours but upon the airs being readmitted the vipers mouth was presently closed and soon after opened again and for some time those motions continued which argued the remains of life such is the fate of the most insignificant or minute reptile that can be thus included mites fleas and even the little eels that are found swimming in vinegar die for want of air not only these but the eggs of these animals will not produce in vacuo but require air to bring them to perfection  as in this manner air is necessary to their subsistence so also it must be of a proper kind and not impregnated with foreign mixtures that factitious air which is pumped from plants or fluids is generally in a short time fatal to them mr boil has given us many experiments to this purpose after having shown that all vegetable and most mineral substances properly prepared may afford air by being placed in an exhausted receiver and this in such quantities that some have thought it a new substance made by the alteration which the mineral or plant has undergone by the texture of its parts being loosened in the operation  having shown i say that this air may be drawn in great quantities from vegetable animal or mineral substances such as apples cherries amber burnt or hartshorn boyles physic mechan vol ii p      he included a frog in artificial air produced from paste in seven minutes space it suffered convulsions and at last lay still and being taken out recovered no motion at all but was dead a bird enclosed in artificial air from raisins died in a quarter of a minute and never stirred more a snail was put into the receiver with air of paste in four minutes it ceased to move and was dead although it had survived in vacuo for several hours so that factitious air proved a greater enemy to animals than even a vacuum itself  air also may be impregnated with fumes that are instantly fatal to animals the fumes of hot iron copper or any other heated metal blown into the place where an animal is confined instantly destroy it we have already mentioned the vapors in the grotto del cane suffocating a dog the ancients even supposed that these animals as they always ran with their noses to the ground were the first that felt any infection in short it should seem that the predominance of any one vapor from any body how wholesome soever in itself becomes infectious and that we owe the salubrity of the air to the variety of its mixture  but there is no animal whose frame is more sensibly affected by the changes of the air than man it is true he can endure a greater variety of climates than the lower orders generally are able to do but it is rather by the means which he has discovered of obviating their effects than by the apparent strength of his constitution most other animals can bear cold or hunger better endure greater fatigues in proportion and are satisfied with shorter repose the variations of the climate therefore would probably affect them less if they had the same means or skill in providing against the severities of the change however this be the body of man is an instrument much more nicely sensible of the variations of the air than any of those which his own art has produced for his frame alone seems to unite all their properties being invigorated by the weight of the air relaxed by its moisture enfeebled by its heat and stiffened by its frigidity  but it is chiefly by the predominance of some peculiar vapor that the air becomes unfit for human support it is often found by dreadful experience to enter into the constitution to mix with its juices and to putrefy the whole mass of blood the nervous system is not less affected by its operations palsies and vertigoes are caused by its damps and a still more fatal train of distempers by its exhalations in order that the air should be wholesome it is necessary as we have seen that it should not be of one kind but the compound of several substances and the more various the composition to all appearance the more salubrious a man therefore who continues in one place is not so likely to enjoy this wholesome variety as he who changes his situation and if i may so express it instead of waiting for a renovation of air walks forward to meet its arrival thus mere motion independent even of the benefits of exercise becomes wholesome by thus supplying a greater variety of that healthful fluid by which we are sustained  a thousand accidents are found to increase these bodies of vapor that make one place more or less wholesome than another heat may raise them in too great quantities and cold may stagnate them minerals may give off their effluvia in such proportion as to keep away all other kind of air vegetables may render the air unwholesome by their supply and animal putrefaction seems to furnish a quantity of vapor at least as noxious as any of the former all these united generally make up the mass of respiration and are when mixed together harmless but any one of them for a long time singly predominant becomes at length fatal  the effects of heat in producing a noxious quality in the air are well known those torrid regions under the line are always unwholesome at senegal i am told the natives consider forty as a very advanced time of life and generally die of old age at fifty at carthagena ulloa vol i p     in america where the heat of the hottest day ever known in europe is continual where during their winter season these dreadful heats are united with a continual succession of thunder rain and tempests arising from their intenseness the wan and livid complexions of the inhabitants might make strangers suspect that they were just recovered from some dreadful distemper the actions of the natives are conformable to their color in all their motions there is somewhat relaxed and languid the heat of the climate even affects their speech which is soft and slow and their words generally broken travelers from europe retain their strength and ruddy color in that climate possibly for three or four months but afterward suffer such decays in both that they are no longer to be distinguished from the inhabitants by their complexion however this languid and spiritless existence is frequently drawled on sometimes even to eighty young persons are generally most affected by the heat of climate which spares the more aged but all upon their arrival on the coasts are subject to the same train of fatal disorders few nations have experienced the mortality of these coasts so much as our own in our unsuccessful attack upon carthagena more than three parts of our army were destroyed by the climate alone and those that returned from that fatal expedition found their former vigor irretrievably gone in our more fortunate expedition which gave us the havannah we had little reason to boast of our success instead of a third not a fifth part of the army were left survivors of their victory the climate being an enemy that even heroes cannot conquer  the distempers that thus proceed from the cruel malignity of those climates are many that for instance called the chapotonadas carries off a multitude of people and extremely thins the crews of european ships whom gain tempts into those inhospitable regions the nature of this distemper is but little known being caused in some persons by cold in others by indigestion but its effects are far from being obscure it is generally fatal in three or four days upon its seizing the patient it brings on what is there called the black vomit which is the sad symptom after which none are ever found to recover some when the vomit attacks them are seized with a delirium that were they not tied down they would tear themselves to pieces and thus expire in the midst of this furious paroxysm this disorder in milder climates takes the name of the bilious fever and is attended with milder symptoms but very dangerous in all  there are many other disorders incident to the human body that seem the offspring of heat but to mention no other that very lassitude which prevails in all the tropical climates may be considered as a disease the inhabitants of india linnaei amonitates vol v p      says a modern philosopher sustain an unceasing languor from the heats of their climate and are torpid in the midst of profusion for this reason the great disposer of nature has clothed their country with trees of an amazing height whose shade might defend them from the beams of the sun and whose continual freshness might in some measure temperate their fierceness from these shades therefore the air receives refreshing moisture and animals a cooling protection the whole race of savage animals retire in the midst of the day to the very center of the forests not so much to avoid their enemy man as to find a defense against the raging heats of the season this advantage which arises from shade in torrid climates may probably afford a solution for that extraordinary circumstance related by boil which he imputes to a different cause in the island of ternate belonging to the dutch a place that had been long celebrated for its beauty and healthfulness the clove trees grew in such plenty that they in some measure lessened their own value for this reason the dutch resolved to cut down the forests and thus to raise the price of the commodity but they had soon reason to repent of their avarice for such a change ensued by cutting down the trees that the whole island from being healthy and delightful having loft its charming shades became extremely sickly and has actually continued so to this day boerhaave considered heat so prejudicial to health that he was never seen to go near a fire  an opposite set of calamities are the consequence in climates where the air is condensed by cold in such places all that train of distempers which are known to arise from obstructed perspiration are very common krantzs history of greenland vol i p      eruptions boils scurvy and a loathsome leprosy that covers the whole body with a scurf and white putrid ulcers these disorders also are infectious and while they thus banish the patient from society they generally accompany him to the grave the men of those climates seldom attain to the age of fifty but the women who do not lead such laborious lives are found to live longer  the autumnal complaints which attend a wet summer indicate the dangers of a moist air the long continuance of an east wind also shows the prejudice of a dry one mineral exhalations when copious are every where known to be fatal and although we probably owe the increase and luxuriance of vegetation to a moderate degree of their warmth yet the natives of those countries where there are mines in plenty but too often experience the noxious effects of their vicinity those trades also that deal in the preparations of metals of all kinds are always unwholesome and the workmen after some time are generally seen to labor under palsies and other nervous complaints the vapors from some vegetable substances are well known to be attended with dangerous effects the shade of the machinel tree in america is said to be fatal as was that of the juniper if we may credit the ancients those who walk through fields of poppies or in any manner prepare those flowers for making opium are very sensibly affected with the drowsiness they occasion a physician of mr boyles acquaintance causing a large quantity of black hellebore to be pounded in a mortar most of the persons who were in the room and especially the person who pounded it were purged by it and some of them strongly he also gathered a certain plant in ireland which the person who beat in a mortar and the physician who was standing near were so strongly affected by that their hands and faces swelled to an enormous size and continued tumid for a long time after  but neither mineral nor vegetable steams are so dangerous to the constitution as those proceeding from animal substances putrefying either by disease or death the effluvia that comes from diseased bodies propagate that frightful catalogue of disorders which are called infectious the parts which compose vegetable vapors and mineral exhalations seem gross and heavy in comparison of these volatile vapors that go to great distances and have been described as spreading desolation over the whole earth they fly every where penetrate every where and the vapors that fly from a single disease soon render it epidemic  the plague is the first upon the list in this class of human calamities from whence this scourge of mans presumption may have its beginning is not well known but we well know that it is propagated by infection whatever be the general state of the atmosphere we learn from experience that the noxious vapors though but singly introduced at first taints the air by degrees every person infected tends to add to the growing malignity and as the disorder becomes more general the putrescence of the air becomes more noxious so that the symptoms are aggravated by continuance when it is said that the origin of this disorder is unknown it implies that the air seems to be but little employed in first producing it there are some countries even in the midst of africa that we learn have never been insected with it but continue for centuries unmolested on the contrary there are others that are generally visited once a year as in egypt which nevertheless seems peculiarly blessed with the serenity and temperature of its climate in the former countries which are of vast extent and many of them very populous every thing should seem to dispose the air to make the plague continual among them the great heats of the climate the unwholsomeness of the food the sloth and dirt of the inhabitants but above all the bloody battles which are continually fought among them after which heaps of dead bodies are left unburied and exposed to putrefaction all these one might think would be apt to bring the plague among them and yet nevertheless we are assured by leo africanus that in numidia the plague is not known once in an hundred years and that in negroland it is not known at all this dreadful disorder therefore must have its rise not from any previous disposition of the air but from some particular cause beginning with one individual and extending the malignity by communication till at last the air becomes actually tainted by the generality of the infection  the plague which spread itself over the whole world in the year      as we are told by mezeray was so contagious that scarce a village or even an house escaped being infected by it before it had reached europe it had been for two years traveling from the great kingdom of cathay where it began by a vapor most horridly fetid this broke out of the earth like a subterranean fire and upon the first instant of its eruption consumed and desolated above two hundred leagues of that country even to the trees and stones  in that great plague which desolated the city of london in the year      a pious and learned schoolmaster of mr boyles acquaintance who ventured to stay in the city and took upon him the humane office of visiting the sick and the dying who had been deserted by better physicians averred that being once called to a poor woman who had buried her children of the plague he found the room where she lay so little that it scarce could hold any more than the bed whereon she was stretched however in this wretched abode beside her in an open coffin her husband lay who had some time before died of the same disease and whom she poor creature soon followed but what showed the peculiar malignity of the air thus suffering from animal putrefaction was that the contagious steams had produced spots on the very wall of their wretched apartment and mr boyles own study which was contiguous to a pesthouse was also spotted in the same frightful manner happily for mankind this disorder for more than a century has not been known in our island and for this last age has abated much of its violence even in those countries where it is most common diseases like empires have their revolutions and those which for a while were the scourge of mankind sink unheard of to give place to new ones more dreadful as being less understood  for this revolution in disorders which has employed the speculation of many mr boil accounts in the following manner since says he there want not causes in the bowels of the earth to make considerable changes amongst the materials that nature has plentifully treasured up in those magazines and as those noxious steams are abundantly supplied to the surface it may not seem improbable that in this great variety some may be found capable of particularly affecting the human frame in a particular manner and thus of producing new diseases the duration of these may be greater or less according to the lastingness of those subterraneous causes that produced them on which account it need be no wonder that some diseases have but a short duration and vanish not long after they appear whilst others may continue longer as having under ground more settled and durable causes to maintain them  from the recital of this train of mischiefs produced by the air upon minerals plants animals and man himself a gloomy mind may be apt to dread this indulgent nurse of nature as a cruel and an inexorable stepmother but it is far otherwise and although we are sometimes injured yet almost all the comforts and blessings of life spring from its propitious influence it would be needless to observe that it is absolutely necessary for the support of our lives for of this every moments experience assures us but how it contributes to this support is not so readily comprehended all allow it to be a friend to whose benefits we are constantly obliged and yet to this hour philosophers are divided as to the nature of the obligation the dispute is whether the air is only useful by its weight to force our juices into circulation keil robinson  or whether by containing a peculiar spirit it mixes with the blood in our vessels and acts like a spur to their industry whytt upon vital and involuntary motions  perhaps it may exert both these useful offices at the same time its weight may give the blood its progressive motion through the larger vessels of the body and its admixture with it cause those contractions of all the vessels which serve to force it still more strongly forward through the minutest channels of the circulation be this as it may it is well known that that part of our blood which has just received the influx of the air in our bodies is of a very different color from that which has almost performed its circuit it has been found that the arterial blood which has been immediately mixed with the air in the lungs and if i may so express it is just beginning its journey through the body is of a fine florid scarlet color while on the contrary the blood of the veins that is returning from having performed its duty is of a blackish crimson hue whence this difference of color should proceed is not well understood we only know the fact that this florid color is communicated by the air and we are well convinced that this air has been admitted into the blood for very useful purposes  besides this vital principle in animals the air also gives life and body to flame a candle quickly goes out in an exhausted receiver for having soon consumed the quantity of air it then expires for want of a fresh supply there has been a flame contrived that will burn under water but none yet has been found that will continue to burn without air gunpowder which is the most catching and powerful fire we know will not go off in an exhausted receiver nay if a train of gunpowder be laid so as that one part may be fired in the open air yet the other part in vacuo will remain untouched and unconsumed wood also set on fire immediately goes out and its flame ceases upon removing the air for something is then wanting to press the body of the fire against that of the fuel and to prevent the too speedy diffusion of the flame we frequently see cooks and others whose business it is to keep up strong fires take proper precautions to exclude the beams of the sun from shining upon them which effectually puts them out this they are apt to ascribe to a wrong cause namely the operation of the light but the real fact is that the warmth of the sunbeams lessen and dissipate the body of the air that goes to feed the flame and the fire of consequence languishes for want of a necessary supply  the air while it thus kindles fire into flame is notwithstanding found to moderate the rays of light to dissipate their violence and to spread an uniform luster over every object were the beams of the sun to dart directly upon us without passing through this protecting medium they would either burn us up at once or blind us with their effulgence but by going through the air they are reflected refracted and turned from their direct course a thousand different ways and thus are more evenly diffused over the face of nature  among the other necessary benefits the air is of to us one of the principal is its conveyance of sound even the vibrations of a bell which have the loudest effect that we know of ceases to be heard when under the receiver of an airpump thus all the pleasures we receive from conversation with each other or from music depend entirely upon the air  odours likewise are diffused only by the means of air without this fluid to swim in they would for ever remain torpid in their respective substances and the rose would affect us with as little sensations of pleasure as the thorn on which it grew  those who are willing to augment the catalogue of the benefits we receive from this element assert also that tastes themselves would be insipid were it not that the air presses their parts upon the nerves of the tongue and palate so as to produce their grateful effects thus continue they upon the tops of high mountains as on the pike of teneriff the most poignant bodies as pepper ginger salt and spice have no sensible taste for want of their particles being thus sent home to the sensory but we owe the air sufficient obligations not to be studious of admitting this among the number in fact all substances have their tastes as well on the tops of mountains as in the bottom of the valley and i have been one of many who have ate a very savoury dinner on the alps  it is sufficient therefore that we regard the air as the parent of health and vegetation as a kind dispenser of light and warmth and as the conveyer of sounds and odours this is an element of which avarice will not deprive us and which power cannot monopolize the treasures of the earth the verdure of the fields and even the refreshments of the stream are too often seen going only to assist the luxuries of the great while the less fortunate part of mankind stand humble spectators of their encroachments but the air no limitations can bound nor any landmarks restrain in this benign element all mankind can boast an equal possession and for this we all have equal obligations to heaven we consume a part of it for our own sustenance while we live and when we die our putrefying bodies give back the supply which during life we had accumulated from the general mass  chap xx of winds irregular and regular wind is a current of air experimental philosophers produce an artificial wind by an instrument called an aeolipile this is nothing more than an hollow copper ball with a long pipe a tea kettle might be readily made into one if it were entirely closed at the lid and the spout left open through this spout it is to be filled with water and then set upon the fire by which means it produces a violent blast like wind which continues while there is any water remaining in the instrument in this manner water is converted into a rushing air which if caught as it goes out and left to cool is again quickly converted into its former element besides this as was mentioned in the former chapter almost every substance contains some portions of air vegetables or the bodies of animals left to putrefy produce it in a very copious manner but it is not only seen thus escaping from bodies but it may be very easily made to enter into them a quantity of air may be compressed into water so as to be intimately blended with it it finds a much easier admission into wine or any fermented liquor and an easier still into spirits of wine some salts suck up the air in such quantities that they are made sensibly heavier thereby and often are melted by its moisture in this manner most bodies being found either capable of receiving or affording it we are not to be surprised at those streams of air that are continually fleeting round the globe minerals vegetables and animals contribute to increase the current and are sending off their constant supplies these as they are differently affected by cold or heat by mixture or putrefaction all yield different quantities of air at different times and the loudest tempests and most rapid whirlwinds are formed from their united contributions  the sun is the principal instrument in rarefying the juices of plants so as to give an escape to their imprisoned air it is also equally operative in promoting the putrefaction of animals mineral exhalations are more frequently raised by subterranean heat the moon the other planets the seasons are all combined in producing these effects in a smaller degree mountains give a direction to the courses of the air fires carry a current of air along their body night and day alternately chill and warm the earth and produce an alternate current of its vapors these and an hundred other causes may be assigned for the variety and the activity of the winds their continual change and uncertain duration  with us on land therefore as the wind proceeds from so many causes and meets such a variety of obstacles there can be but little hopes of ever bringing its motions to conform to theory or of foretelling how it may blow a minute to come the great bacon indeed was of opinion that by a close and regular history of the winds continued for a number of ages together and the particulars of each observation reduced to general maxims we might at last come to understand the variations of this capricious element and that we could foretell the certainty of a wind with as much ease as we now foretell the return of an eclipse indeed his own beginnings in this arduous undertaking seem to speak the possibility of its success but unhappily for mankind this investigation is the work of ages and we want a bacon to direct the process  to be able therefore with any plausibility to account for the variations of the wind upon land is not to be at present expected and to understand any thing of their nature we must have recourse to those places where they are more permanent and steady this uniformity and steadiness we are chiefly to expect upon the ocean there where there is no variety of substances to furnish the air with various and inconstant supplies where there are no mountains to direct the course of its current but where all is extensively uniform and even in such a place the wind arising from a simple cause must have but one simple motion in fact we find it so there are many parts of the world where the winds that with us are so uncertain pay their stated visits in some places they are found to blow one way by day and another by night in others for one half of the year they go in a direction contrary to their former course but what is more extraordinary still there are some places where the winds never change but for ever blow the same way this is particularly found to obtain between the tropics in the atlantic and aethiopic oceans as well as in the great pacific sea  few things surely can appear more extraordinary to a person who has never been out of our variable latitudes than this steady wind that for ever sits in the sail sending the vessel forward and as effectually preventing its return he who has been taught to consider that nothing in the world is so variable as the winds must certainly be surprised to find a place where there is nothing more uniform with us their inconstancy has become a proverb with the natives of those distant climates they may talk of a friend or a mistress as fixed and unchangeable as the winds and mean a compliment by the comparison when our ships are once arrived into the proper latitudes of the great pacific ocean the mariner forgets the helm and his skill becomes almost useless neither storms nor tempests are known to deform the glassy bosom of that immense sheet of waters a gentle breeze that for ever blows in the same direction rests upon the canvas and speeds the navigator in the space of six weeks ships are thus known to cross an immense ocean that takes more than so many months to return upon returning the tradewind which has been propitious is then avoided the mariner is generally obliged to steer into the northern latitudes and to take the advantage of every casual wind that offers to assist him into port this wind which blows with such constancy one way is known to prevail not only in the pacific ocean but also in the atlantic between the coasts of guinea and brazil and likewise in the aethiopic ocean this seems to be the great universal wind blowing from the east to the west that prevails in all the extensive oceans where the land does not frequently break the general current were the whole surface of the globe an ocean there would probably be but this one wind for ever blowing from the east and pursuing the motions of the sun westward all the other winds seem subordinate to this and many of them are made from the deviations of its current to form therefore any conception relative to the variations of the wind in general it is fittest to begin with that which never varies  there have been many theories to explain this invariable motion of the winds among the rest we cannot omit that of doctor lyster for its strangeness the sea says he in those latitudes is generally covered over with green weeds for a great extent and the air produced from the vegetable perspiration of these produces the tradewind the theory of cartesius was not quite so absurd he alleged that the earth went round faster than its atmosphere at the equator so that its motion from west to east gave the atmosphere an imaginary one from east to west and thus an east wind was eternally seen to prevail rejecting those arbitrary opinions conceived without force and asserted without proof doctor halley has given one more plausible which seems to be the reigning system of the day  to conceive his opinion clearly let us for a moment suppose the whole surface of the earth to be an ocean and the air encompassing it on every side without motion now it is evident that that part of the air that lies directly under the beams of the sun will be rarefied and if the sun remained for ever in the same place there would be a great vacuity in the air if i may so express it beneath the place where the sun stood but the sun moving forward from east to west this vacuity will follow too and still be made under it but while it goes on to make new vacuities the air will rush in to fill up those the sun has already made in other words as it is still traveling forward the air will continually be rushing in behind and pursue its motions from east to west in this manner the air is put into motion by day and by night the parts continue to impel each other till the next return of the sun that gives a new force to the circulation  in this manner is explained the constant east wind that is found blowing round the globe near the equator but it is also known that as we recede from the equator on either side we come into a tradewind that continually blows from the poles from the north on one side or the south on the other both directing toward the equator this also proceeds from a similar cause with the former for the air being more rarefied in those places over which the sun more directly darts its rays the currents will come both from the north and the south to fill up the intermediate vacuity  these two motions namely the general one from east to west and the more particular one from both the poles will account for all the phenomenon of tradewinds which if the whole surface of the globe were sea would undoubtedly be constant and for ever continue to blow in one direction but there are a thousand circumstances to break these aircurrents into smaller ones to drive them back against their general course to raise or depress them to condense them into storms or to whirl them in eddies in consequence of this regard must be often had to the nature of the soil the position of the high mountains the course of the rivers and even to the luxuriance of vegetation  if a country lying directly under the sun be very flat and sandy and if the land be low and extensive the heats occasioned by the reflection of the sunbeams produces a very great rarefaction of the air the deserts of africa which are conformable to this description are scarce ever fanned by a breath of wind by day but the burning sun is continually seen blazing in intolerable splendour above them for this reason all along the coasts of guinea the wind is always perceived blowing in upon land in order to fill up the vacuity caused by the suns operation in those shores therefore the wind blows in a contrary direction to that of its general current and is constantly found setting in from the west  from the same cause it happens that those constant calms attended with deluges of rain are found in the same part of the ocean for this tract being placed in the middle between the westerly winds blowing on the coast of guinea and the easterly tradewinds that move at some distance from shore in a contrary direction the tendency of that part of the air that lies between these two opposite currents is indifferent to either and so rests between both in torpid serenity and the weight of the incumbent atmosphere being diminished by the continual contrary winds blowing from hence it is unable to keep the vapors suspended that are copiously borne thither so that they fall in continual rains  but it is not to be supposed that any theory can account for all the phenomenon of even those winds that are known to be most regular instead therefore of a complete system of the tradewinds we must rather be content with an imperfect history these buffon vol ii p   0  as was said being the result of a combination of effects assume as great a variety as the causes producing them are various  besides the great general wind abovementioned in those parts of the atlantic that lie under the temperate zone a north wind prevails constantly during the months of october november december and january these therefore are the most favorable months for embarking for the east indies in order to take the benefit of these winds for crossing the line and it has been often found by experience that those who had set sail five months before were not in the least farther advanced in their voyage than those who waited for the favorable wind during the winter of nova zembla and the other arctic countries a north wind reigns almost continually in the cape de verde islands a south wind prevails during the month of july at the cape of good hope a northwest wind blows during the month of september there are also regular winds produced by various causes upon land the ancient greeks were the first who observed a constant breeze produced by the melting of the snows in some high neighboring countries this was perceived in greece thrace macedonia and the aegean sea the same kind of winds are now remarked in the kingdom of congo and the most southern parts of africa the flux and reflux of the sea also produces some regular winds that serve the purposes of trade and in general it may be observed that wherever there is a strong current of water there is a current of air that seems to attend it  beside these winds that are found to blow in one direction there are as was said before others that blow for certain months of the year one way and the rest of the year the contrary way these are called the monsoons from a famous pilot of that name who first used them in navigation with success varenii geographia geurculis cap  0  in all that part of the ocean that lies between africa and india the east winds begin at the month of january and continue till about the commencement of june in the month of august or september the contrary direction takes place and the west winds prevail for three or four months the interval between these winds that is to say from the end of june to the beginning of august there is no fixed wind but the sea is usually tossed by violent tempests proceeding from the north these winds are always subject to their greatest variations as they approach the land so that on one side of the great peninsula of india the coasts are for near half the year harrassed by violent hurricanes and northern tempests while on the opposite side and all along the coasts of coromandel these dreadful tempests are wholly unknown at java and ceylon a west wind begins to reign in the month of september but at fifteen days of south latitude this wind is found to be lost and the great general tradewind from the east is perceived to prevail on the contrary at cochin in china the west wind begins at march so that these monsoons prevail at different seasons throughout the indies so that the mariner takes one part of the year to go from java to the moluccas another from cochin to molucca another from molucca to china and still another to direct him from china to japan  there are winds also that may be considered as peculiar to certain coasts for example the south wind is almost constant upon the coasts of chili and peru western winds almost constantly prevail on the coast of terra magellanica and in the environs of the streights le maire on the coasts of malabar north and northwest winds prevail continually along the coast of guinea the northwest wind is also very frequent and at a distance from the coasts the northeast is always found prevailing from the beginning of november to the end of december a west wind prevails on the coasts of japan and during the whole winter no ships can leave the port of cochin on account of the impetuosity of the winds that set upon the coast these blow with such vehemence that the ports are entirely choked up with sand and even boats themselves are not able to enter however the east winds that prevail for the other half of the year clear the mouths of their harbors from the accumulations of the preceding winter and set the confined ships at liberty at the streights of babelmandel there is a south wind that periodically returns and which is always followed by a northeast  beside winds thus peculiar to certain coasts there are others found to prevail on all the coasts in warm climates which during one part of the day blow from the shore and during another part of it blow from the sea the seabreeze in those countries as dampier observes commonly rises in the morning about nine proceeding slowly in a fine small black curl upon the surface of the water and making its way to refresh the shore it is gentle at first but increases gradually till twelve then insensibly sinks away and is totally hushed at five upon its ceasing the landbreeze begins to take its turn which increases till twelve at night and is succeeded in the morning by the seabreeze again without all doubt nothing could have been more fortunate for the inhabitants of the warm countries where those breezes blow than this alternate refreshment which they feel at those seasons when it is most wanted the heat on some coasts would be insupportable were it not for such a supply of air when the sun has rarefied all that which lay more immediately under the coast the seabreeze temperates the heat of the sun by day and the landbreeze corrects the malignity of the dews and vapors by night where these breezes therefore prevail and they are very common the inhabitants enjoy a share of health and happiness unknown to those that live much farther up the country or such as live in similar latitudes without this advantange the cause of these obviously seems to arise from the rarefaction of the air by the sun as their duration continues with its appearance and alters when it goes down the sun it is observed equally diffusing his beams upon land and sea the land being a more solid body than the water receives a greater quantity of heat and reflects it more strongly being thus therefore heated to a greater degree than the waters it of consequence drives the air from land out to sea but its influence being removed the air returns to fill up the former vacuity such is the usual method of accounting for this phenomenon but unfortunately these sea and land breezes are visitants that come at all hours on the coasts of malabar buffon vol ii p      the landbreezes begin at midnight and continue till noon then the seabreezes take their turn and continue till midnight again while again at congo the landbreezes begin at five and continue till nine the next day  but if the cause of these be so inscrutable that are as we see tolerably regular in their visitations what shall we say to the winds of our own climate that are continually shifting and incapable of rest some general causes may be assigned which nothing but particular experience can apply and in the first place it may be observed that clouds and heat and in short whatever either increases the density or the elasticity of the air in any one place will produce a wind there for the increased activity of the air thus pressing more powerfully on the parts of it that are adjacent will drive them forward and thus go on in a current till the whole comes to an equality  in this manner as a denser air produces a wind on the one hand so will any accident that contributes to lighten the air produce it on the other for a lighter air may be considered as a vacuity into which the neighboring air will rush and hence it happens that when the barometer marks a peculiar lightness in the air it is no wonder that it foretells a storm  the winds upon large waters are generally more regular than those upon land the wind at sea generally blows with an even steady gale the wind at land puffs by intervals increasing its strength and remitting it without any apparent cause this in a great measure may be owing to the many mountains towers or trees that it meets in its way all contributing either to turn it from its course or interrupt its passage  the east wind blows more constantly than any other and for an obvious reason all other winds are in some measure deviations from it and partly may owe their origin thereto it is generally likewise the most powerful and for the same reason  there are often double currents of the air while the wind blows one way we frequently see the clouds move another this is almost ever the case before thunder for it is well known that the thunder cloud always moves against the wind the cause of this surprising appearance has hitherto remained a secret from hence we may conclude that weathercocks only inform us of that current of the air which is near the surface of the earth but are often erroneous with regard to the upper regions and in fact derham has often found them erroneous  winds are generally more powerful on elevated situations than on the plain because their progress is interrupted by fewer obstacles in proportion as we ascend the heights of a mountain the violence of the weather seems to increase until we have got above the region of storms where all is usually calm and serene sometimes however the storms rise even to the tops of the highest mountains as we learn from those who have been on the andes and as we are convinced by the deep snows that crown even the highest  winds blowing from the sea are generally moister and more attended with rains than those which blow over extensive tracts of land for the sea gives off more vapors to the air and these are rolled forward upon land by the winds blowing from thence derhams phisico theol  for this reason our easterly winds that blow from the continent are dry in comparison of those that blow from the surface of the ocean with which we are surrounded on every other quarter  in general the winds are more boisterous in spring and autumn than at other seasons for that being the time of high tides the sea may communicate a part of its motions to the winds the sun and moon also which then have a greater effect upon the waters may also have some influence upon the winds for there being a great body of air surrounding the globe which if condensed into water would cover it to the depth of thirtytwo feet it is evident that the sun and moon will to a proportionable degree affect the atmosphere and make a tide of air this tide will be scarce perceivable indeed but without doubt it actually exists and may contribute to increase the vernal and autumnal storms which are then known to prevail  upon narrowing the passage through which the air is driven both the density and the swiftness of the wind is increased for as currents of water flow with greater force and rapidity by narrowing their channels so also will a current of air driven through a contracted space grow more violent and irresistible hence we find those dreadful storms that prevail in the defiles of mountains where the wind pushing from behind through a narrow channel at once increases in speed and density levelling or tearing up every obstacle that rises to obstruct its passage  winds reflected from the sides of mountains and towers are often found to be more forceful than those in direct progression this we frequently perceive near lofty buildings such as churches or steeples where winds are generally known to prevail and that much more powerful than at some distance the air in this case by striking against the side of the building acquires additional density and therefore blows with more force  these differing degrees of density which the air is found to possess sufficiently show that the force of the winds do not depend upon their velocity alone so that those instruments called anemometers which are made to measure the velocity of the wind will by no means give us certain information of the force of the storm in order to estimate this with exactness we ought to know its density which also these are not calculated to discover for this reason we often see storms with very powerful effects that do not seem to show any great speed and on the contrary we see these wind measurers go round with great swiftness when scarce any damage has followed from the storm  such is the nature and the inconstancy of the irregular winds with which we are best acquainted but their effects are much more formidable in those climates near the tropics where they are often found to break in upon the steady course of the tradewinds and to mark their passage with destruction with us the tempest is but rarely known and its ravages are registered as an uncommon calamity but in the countries that lie between the tropics and for a good space beyond them its visits are frequent and its effects anticipated in these regions the winds vary their terrors sometimes involving all things in a suffocating heat sometimes mixing all the elements of fire air earth and water together sometimes with a momentary swiftness passing over the face of the country and destroying all things in their passage and sometimes raising whole sandy deserts in one country to deposit them upon some other we have little reason therefore to envy these climates the luxuriance of their soil or the brightness of their skies our own muddy atmosphere that wraps us round in obscurity though it fails to gild our prospects with sunshine or our groves with fruitage nevertheless answers the calls of industry they may boast of a plentiful but precarious harvest while with us the labourer toils in a certain expectation of a moderate but an happy return  in egypt buffon vol ii p      a kingdom so noted for its fertility and the brightness of its atmosphere during summer the south winds are so hot that they almost stop respiration besides which they are charged with such quantities of sand that they sometimes darken the air as with a thick cloud these sands are so fine and driven with such violence that they penetrate every where even into chests be they shut never so closely if these winds happen to continue for any length of time they produce epidemic diseases and are often followed by a great mortality it is also found to rain but very seldom in that country however the want of showers is richly compensated by the copiousness of their dews which greatly tend to promote vegetation  in persia the winter begins in november and continues till march the cold at that time is intense enough to congeal the water and snow falls in abundance upon their mountains during the months of march and april winds arise that blow with great force and seem to usher in the heats of summer these return again in autumn with some violence without however producing any dreadful effects but during their summer all along the coasts of the persian gulf a very dangerous wind prevails which the natives call the sameyel still more dreadful and burning than that of egypt and attended with instant and fatal effects this terrible blast which was perhaps the pestilence of the ancients instantly kills all those that it involves in its passage what its malignity consists in none can tell as none have ever survived its effects to give information it frequently as i am told assumes a visible form and darts in a kind of bluish vapor along the surface of the country the natives not only of persia but arabia talk of its effects with terror and their poets have not failed to heighten them with the assistance of imagination they have described it as under the conduct of a minister of vengeance who governs its terrors and raises or depresses it as he thinks proper herbelot bibliotheque oriental  these deadly winds are also known along the coasts of india at necapatan masulipatan and petapoli but luckily for mankind the shortness of their duration diminishes the injuries that might ensue from their malignity  the cape of good hope as well as many islands in the west indies are famous for their hurricanes and that extraordinary kind of cloud which is said to produce them this cloud which is the forerunner of an approaching hurricane appears when first seen like a small black spot on the verge of the horizon and is called by sailors the bulls eye from being seen so minute at a vast distance all this time a perfect calm reigns over the sea and land while the cloud grows gradually broader as it approaches at length coming to the place where its fury is to fall it invests the whole horizon with darkness during all the time of its approach an hollow murmur is heard in the cavities of the mountains and beasts and animals sensible of its approach are seen running over the fields to seek for shelter nothing can be more terrible than its violence when it begins the houses in those countries which are made of timber the better to resist its fury bend to the blast like osiers and again recover their rectitude the sun which but a moment before blazed with meridian splendour is totally shut out and a midnight darkness prevails except that the air is incessantly illuminated with gleams of lightening by which one can easily see to read the rain falls at the same time in torrents and its descent has been resembled to what pours from the spouts of our houses after a violent shower these hurricanes are not less offensive to the sense of smelling also and never come without leaving the most noisome stench behind them if the seamen also lay by their wet clothes for twentyfour hours they are all found swarming with little white maggots that were brought with the hurricane our first mariners when they visited these regions were ignorant of its effects and the signs of its approach their ships therefore were dashed to the bottom at the first onset and numberless were the wrecks which the hurricane occasioned but at present being forewarned of its approach they strip their masts of all their sails and thus patiently abide its fury these hurricanes are common in all the tropical climates on the coasts of guinea they have frequently three or four in a day that thus shut out the heavens for a little space and when past leave all again in former splendour hey chiefly prevail on that coast in the intervals of the trade winds the approach of which clears the air of its meteors and gives these mortal showers that little degree of wholesomeness which they possess they chiefly obtain there during the months of april and may they are known at loango from january to april on the opposite coast of africa the hurricane season begins at may and in general whenever a trade wind begins to cease these irregular tempests are found to exert their fury  all this is terrible but there is a tempest known in those climates more formidable than any we have hitherto been describing which is called by the spaniards a tornado as the former was seen arriving from one part of the heavens and making a line of destruction so the winds in this seem to blow from every quarter and settle upon one destined place with such fury that nothing can resist their vehemence when they have all met in their central spot then the whirlwind begins with circular rapidity the sphere every moment widens as it continues to turn and catches every object that lies within its attraction this also like the former is preceded by a flattering calm the air is every where hushed and the sea is as smooth as polished glass however as its effects are more dreadful than those of the ordinary hurricane the mariner tries all the power of his skill to avoid it which if he fails of doing there is the greatest danger of his going to the bottom all along the coasts of guinea beginning about two degrees north of the line and so downward lengthwise for about a thousand miles and as many broad the ocean is unnavigable upon account of these tornados in this torpid region there reigns unceasing tornados or continual calms among which whatever ship is so unhappy as to fall is totally deprived of all power of escaping in this dreadful repose of all the elements the solitary vessel is obliged to continue without a single breeze to assist the mariners wishes except those whirlwinds which only serve to increase his calamity at present therefore this part of the ocean is totally avoided and although there may be much gold along the coasts of that part of africa to tempt avarice yet there is something much more dreadful than the fabled dragon of antiquity to guard the treasure as the internal parts of that country are totally unknown to travelers from their burning sands and extensive deserts so here we find a vast tract of ocean lying off its shores equally unvisited by the mariner  but of all those terrible tempests that deform the face of nature and repress human presumption the sandy tempests of arabia and africa are the most terrible and strike the imagination most strongly to conceive a proper idea of these we are by no means to suppose them resembling those whirlwinds of dust that we sometimes see scattering in our air and sprinkling their contents upon our roads or meadows the sandstorm of africa exhibits a very different appearance as the sand of which the whirlwind is composed is excessively fine and almost resembles the parts of water its motion entirely resembles that of a fluid and the whole plain seems to float onward like a slow inundation the body of sand thus rolling is deep enough to bury houses and palaces in its bosom travelers who are crossing those extensive deserts perceive its approach at a distance and in general have time to avoid it or turn out of its way as it generally extends but to a moderate breadth however when it is extremely rapid or very extensive as sometimes is the case no swiftness no art can avail nothing then remains but to meet death with fortitude and submit to be buried alive with resignation  it is happy for us of britain that we have no such calamity to fear for from this even some parts of europe are not entirely free we have an account given us in the history of the french academy of a miserable town in france that is constantly in danger of being buried under a similar inundation with which i will take leave to close this chapter in the neighborhood of st paul de leon in lower brittany histoire de laccademic des sciences an       there lies a tract of country along the seaside which before the year      was inhabited but now lies deserted by reason of the sands which cover it to the height of twenty feet and which every year advance more and more in land and gain ground continually from the time mentioned above the sand has buried more than six leagues of the country inward and it is now but half a league from the town of st paul so that in all appearance the inhabitants must be obliged to abandon it entirely in the country that has been overwhelmed there are still to be seen the tops of some steeples peeping through the sand and many chimnies that still remain above this sandy ocean the inhabitants however had sufficient time to escape but being deprived of their little all they had no other resource but begging for their subsistence this calamity chiefly owes its advancement to a north or an east wind raising the sand which is extremely fine in such great quantities and with such velocity that m deslands who gave the account says that while he was walking near the place during a moderate breeze of wind he was obliged from time to time to shake the sand from his clothes and his hat on which it was lodged in great quantities and made them too heavy to be easily borne still further when the wind was violent it drove the sand across a little arm of the sea into the town of roscoff and covered the streets of that place two feet deep so that they have been obliged to carry it off in carts it may also be observed that there are several particles of iron mixed with the sand which are readily affected by the loadstone the part of the coast that furnishes these sands is a tract of about four leagues in length and is upon a level with the sea at high water the shore lies in such a manner as to leave its sands subject only to the north and east winds that bear them farther up the shore it is easy to conceive how the same sand that has at one time been borne a short way in land may by some succeeding and stronger blast be carried up much higher and thus the whole may continue advancing forward deluging the plain and totally destroying its fertility at the same time the sea from whence this deluge of sand proceeds may furnish it in inexhaustible quantities this unhappy country thus overwhelmed in so singular a manner may well justify what the ancients and the moderns have reported concerning those tempests of sand in africa that are said to destroy villages and even armies in their bosom  chap xxi of meteors and such appearances as result from a combination of the elements in proportion as the substances of nature are more compounded and combined their appearances become more inexplicable and amazing the properties of water have been very nearly ascertained many of the qualities of air earth and fire have been discovered and estimated but when these come to be united by nature they often produce a result which no artificial combinations can imitate and we stand surprised that although we are possessed of all those substances which nature makes use of she shows herself a much more various operator than the most skilful chemist ever appeared to be every cloud that moves and every shower that falls serves to mortify the philosophers pride and to show him hidden qualities in air and water that he finds it difficult to explain dews hail snow and thunder are not less difficult for being more common indeed when we reflect on the manner in which nature performs any one of these operations our wonder increases to see water which is heavier than air rising in air and then falling in a form so very different from that in which i rose to see the same fluid at one time descending in the form of hail at another in that of snow to see two clouds by dashing against each other producing an electrical fire which no watery composition that we know of can effect these i say serve sufficiently to excite our wonder and still the more in proportion as the objects are ever pressing on our curiosity much however has been written concerning the manner in which nature operates in these productions as nothing is so ungrateful to mankind as hopeless ignorance  and first with regard to the manner in which water evaporates and rises to form clouds much has been advanced and many theories devised all water spectacle de la nature vol iii  say some has a quantity of air mixed with it and the heat of the sun darting down disengages the particles of this air from the grosser fluid the suns rays being reflected back from the water carry back with them those bubbles of air and water which being lighter than the condensed air will ascend till they meet with a more rarefied air and they will then stand suspended experience however proves nothing of all this particles of air or fire are not thus known to ascend with a thin coat of water and in fact we know that the little particles of steam are solid drops of water but besides this water is known to evaporate more powerfully in the severest frost than when the air is moderately warm memoires de laccademie des sciences an   0   doctor hamilton therefore of the university of dublin rejecting this theory has endeavored to establish another according to him as aqua fortis is a menstruum that dissolves iron and keeps it mixed in the fluid as aqua regia is a menstruum that dissolves gold or as water dissolves salts to a certain quantity so air is a menstruum that corrodes and dissolves a certain quantity of water and keeps it suspended above but however ingenious this may be it can hardly be admitted as we know by marriottes experiment mariotte de la nature de lair p     0   that if water and air be enclosed together instead of the airs acting as a menstruum upon the water the water will act as a menstruum upon the air and take it all up we know also that of two bodies that which is most fluid and penetrating is most likely to be the menstruum of the other but water is more fluid and penetrating than air and therefore the most likely of the two to be the menstruum we know that all bodies are more speedily acted upon the more their parts are brought into contact with the menstruum that dissolves them but water enclosed with comprest air is not the more diminished thereby see boyles works vol ii p      in short we know that cold which diminishes the force of other menstruums is often found to promote evaporation in this variety of opinion and uncertainty of conjecture i cannot avoid thinking that a theory of evaporation may be formed upon very simple and obvious principles and embarrassed as far as i can conceive with very few objections  we know that a repelling power prevails in nature not less than an attractive one this repulsion prevails strongly between the body of fire and that of water if i plunge the end of a red hot bar of iron into a vessel of water the fluid rises and large drops of it fly up in all manner of directions every part bubbling and steaming until the iron be cold why may we not for a moment compare the rays of the sun darted directly upon the surface of the water to so many bars of red hot iron each bar indeed infinitely small but not the less powerful in this case wherever a ray of fire darts the water from its repulsive quality will be driven on all sides and of consequence as in the case of the bar of iron a part of it will rise the parts thus rising however will be extremely small as the ray that darts is extremely so the assemblage of the rays darting upon the water in this manner will cause it to rise in a light thin steam above the surface and as the parts of this steam are extremely minute they will be lighter than air and consequently float upon it there is no need for supposing them bubbles of water filled with fire for any substance even gold itself will float on air if its parts be made small enough or in other words if its surface be sufficiently increased this water thus disengaged from the general mass will be still farther attenuated and broken by the reflected rays and consequently more adapted for ascending  from this plain account every appearance in evaporation may be easily deduced the quantity of heat increases evaporation because it raises a greater quantity of steam the quantity of wind increases evaporation for by waving the surface of the water it thus exposes a greater surface to the evaporating rays a dry frost in some measure assists the quantity of evaporation as the quantity of rays are found to be no way diminished thereby moist weather alone prevents evaporation for the rays being absorbed refracted and broken by the intervening moisture before they arrive at the surface cannot produce the effect and the vapor will rise in a small proportion  thus far we have accounted for the ascent of vapors but to account for their falling again is attended with rather more difficulty we have already observed that the particles of vapor disengaged from the surface of the water will be broken and attenuated in their ascent by the reflected and even the direct rays that happen to strike upon their minute surfaces they will therefore continue to ascend till they rise above the operation of the reflected rays which reaches but to a certain height above the surface of the earth being arrived at this region which is cold for want of reflected heat they will be condensed and suspended in the form of clouds some vapors that ascend to great heights will be frozen into snow others that are condensed lower down will put on the appearance of a mist which we find the clouds to be when we ascend among them as they hang along the sides of a mountain these clouds of snow and rain being blown about by winds are either entirely scattered and dispersed above or they are still more condensed by motion like a snowball that grows more large and solid as it continues to roll at last therefore they will become too weighty for the air which first raised them to sustain and they will descend with their excess of weight either in snow or rain but as they will fall precipitately when they begin to descend the air in some measure will resist the falling for as the descending fluid gathers velocity in its precipitation the air will increase its resistance to it and the water will therefore be thus broken into rain as we see that water which falls from the tops of houses though it begins in a spout separates into drops before it has got to the bottom were it not for this happy interposition of the air between us and the water falling from a considerable height above us a drop of rain might fall with dangerous force and an hailstone might strike us with fatal rapidity  in this manner evaporation is produced by day but when the sun goes down a part of that vapor which his rays had excited being no longer broken and attenuated by the reflecting rays it will become heavier than the air even before it has reached the clouds and it will therefore fall back in dews which differ only from rain in descending before they have had time to condense into a visible form  hail the cartesians say is a frozen cloud half melted and frozen again in its descent an hoarfrost is but a frozen dew lightening we know to be an electrical flash produced by the opposition of two clouds and thunder to be the sound proceeding from the same continued by an echo reverberated among them it would be to very little purpose to attempt explaining exactly how these wonders are effected we have as yet but little insight into the manner in which these meteors are found to operate upon each other and therefore we must be contented with a detail rather of their effects than their causes  in our own gentle climate where nature wears the mildest and kindest aspect every meteor seems to befriend us with us rains fall in refreshing showers to enliven our fields and to paint the landscape with a more vivid beauty snows cover the earth to preserve its tender vegetables from the inclemency of the departing winter the dews descend with such an imperceptible fall as no way injures the constitution thunder itself is seldom injurious and it is often wished by the husbandman to clear the air and to kill numberless insects that are noxious to vegetation hail is the most injurious meteor that is known in our climate but it seldom visits us with violence and then its fury is but transient  one of the most dreadful storms we hear of phil trans vol ii p      was that at hertfordshire in the year      it began by thunder and lightening which continued for some hours when suddenly a black cloud came forward against the wind and marked its passage with devastation the hailstones which it poured down being measured were found to be many of them fourteen inches round and consequently as large as a bowlinggreen ball wherever it came every plantation fell before it it tore up the ground split great oaks and other trees without number the fields of rye were cut down as if levelled with a scythe wheat oats and barley suffered the same damage the inhabitants found but a precarious shelter even in their houses their tiles and windows being broke by the violence of the hailstones which by the force with which they came seemed to have descended from a great height the birds in this universal wreck vainly tried to escape by flight pigeons crows rooks and much more of the smaller and feebler kinds were brought down an unhappy young man who had not time to take shelter was killed one of his eyes was struck out of his head and his body was all over black with the bruises another had just time to escape but not without the most imminent danger his body being bruised all over but what is most extraordinary all this fell within the compass of a mile  mezeray in his history of france tells us of a shower of hail much more terrible which happened in the year    0 when the french monarch invaded italy there was for a time an horrid darkness thicker than that of midnight which continued till the terrors of mankind were changed to still more terrible objects by thunder and lightening breaking the gloom and bringing on such a shower of hail as no history of human calamities could equal these hailstones were of a bluish color and some of them weighed not less than an hundred pounds a noisome vapor of sulphur attended the storm all the birds and beasts of the country were entirely destroyed numbers of the human race suffered the same fate but what is still more extraordinary the fishes themselves found no protection from their native element but were equal sufferers in the general calamity  these however are terrors that are seldom exerted in our mild climates they only serve to mark the page of history with wonder and stand as admonitions to mankind of the various stores of punishment in the hands of the deity which his power can treasure up and his mercy can suspend  in the temperate zones therefore meteors are rarely found thus terrible but between the tropics and near the poles they assume very dreadful and various appearances in those inclement regions where cold and heat exert their chief power meteors seem peculiarly to have fixed their residence they are seen there in a thousand terrifying forms astonishing to europeans yet disregarded by the natives from their frequency the wonders of air fire and water are there combined to produce the most tremendous effects and to sport with the labors and apprehensions of mankind lightenings that flash without noise hurricanes that tear up the earth clouds that all at once pour down their contents and produce an instant deluge mock suns northern lights that illuminate half the hemisphere circular rainbows halos fleeting balls of fire clouds reflecting back the images of things on earth like mirrors and waterspouts that burst from the sea to join with the mists that hang immediately above them these are but a part of the phenomenon that are common in those countries and from many of which our own climate is in a great measure exempted  the meteors of the torrid zone however are different from those that are found near the polar circles and it may readily be supposed that in those countries where the sun exerts the greatest force in raising vapors of all kinds there should be the greatest quantity of meteors upon the approach of the winter months as they are called under the line which usually begin about may the sky from a fiery brightness begins to be overcast and the whole horizon seems wrapped in a muddy cloud mists and vapors still continue to rise and the air which so lately before was clear and elastic now becomes humid obscure and stifling the fogs become so thick that the light of the sun seems in a manner excluded nor would its presence be known but for the intense and suffocating heat of its beams which dart through the gloom and instead of dissipating only serve to increase the mist after this preparation there follows an almost continual succession of thunder rain and tempests during this dreadful season the streets of cities flow like rivers and the whole country wears the appearance of an ocean the inhabitants often make use of this opportunity to lay in a stock of fresh water for the rest of the year as the same cause which pours down the deluge at one season denies the kindly shower at another the thunder which attends the fall of these rains is much more terrible than that we are generally acquainted with with us the flash is seen at some distance and the noise shortly after ensues our thunder genenerally rolls on one quarter of the sky and one stroke pursues another but here it is otherwise the whole sky all around seems illuminated with unremitted flashes of lightening every part of the air seems productive of its own thunders and every cloud produces its own shock the strokes come so thick that the inhabitants can scarce mark the intervals but all is one unremitted roar of elementary confusion it should seem however that the lightening of those countries is not so fatal or so dangerous as with us since in this case the torrid zone would be uninhabitable  when these terrors have ceased with which however the natives are familiar meteors of another kind begin to make their appearance the intense beams of the sun darting upon stagnant waters that generally cover the surface of the country raise vapors of various kinds floating bodies of fire which assume different names rather from their accidental forms than from any real difference between them are seen without surprise the draco volans or flying dragon as it is called the ignis fatuus or wandering fire the fires of st helmo or the mariners light are every where frequent and of these we have numberless descriptions as i was riding in jamaica says mr barbham one morning from my habitation situated about three miles northwest from jago de la bega i saw a ball of fire appearing to me of the bigness of a bomb swiftly falling down with a great blaze at first i thought it fell into the town but when i came nearer i saw many people gathered together a little to the southward in the savannah to whom i rode up to enquire the cause of their meeting they were admiring as i found the grounds being strangely broke up and ploughed by a ball of fire which as they said fell down there i observed there were many holes in the ground one in the middle of the bigness of a mans head and five or six smaller round about it of the bigness of ones fist and so deep as not to be fathomed by such implements as were at hand it was observed also that all the green herbage was burnt up near the holes and there continued a strong smell of sulphur near the place for some time after  ulloa gives an account of one of a similar kind at quito ulloa vol i p     about nine at night says he a globe of fire appeared to rise from the side of the mountain pichinca and so large that it spread a light over all the part of the city facing that mountain the house where i lodged looking that way i was surprised with an extraordinary light darting through the crevices of the windowshutters on this appearance and the bustle of the people in the street i hastened to the window and came time enough to see it in the middle of its career which continued from west to south till i lost sight of it being intercepted by a mountain that lay between me and it it was round and its apparent diameter about a foot i observed it to rise from the sides of pichinca although to judge from its course it was behind that mountain where this congeries of inflammable matter was kindled in the first half of its visible course it emitted a prodigious effulgence then it began gradually to grow dim so that upon its disappearing behind the intervening mountain its light was very faint  meteors of this kind are very frequently seen between the tropics but they sometimes also visit the more temperate regions of europe we have the description of a very extraordinary one given us by montanari that serves to show to what great heights in our atmosphere these vapors are found to ascend in the year      a great globe of fire was seen at bononia in italy about three quarters of an hour after sunset it past westward with a most rapid course and at the rate of not less than a hundred and sixty miles in a minute which is much swifter than the force of a cannonball and at last stood over the adriatic sea in its course it crossed over all italy and by computation it could not have been less than thirtyeight miles above the surface of the earth in the whole line of its course wherever it approached the inhabitants below could distinctly hear it with a hissing noise resembling that of a firework having past away to sea toward corsica it was heard at last to go off with a most violent explosion much louder than that of a cannon and immediately after another noise was heard like the rattling of a great cart upon a stony pavement which was probably nothing more than the echo of the former sound its magnitude when at bononia appeared twice as long as the moon one way and as broad the other so that considering its height it could not have been less than a mile long and half a mile broad from the height at which this was seen and there being no volcano on that quarter of the world from whence it came it is more than probable that this terrible globe was kindled on some part of the contrary side of the globe in those regions of vapors which we have been just describing and thus rising above the air and passing in a course opposite to that of the earths motion in this manner it acquired its amazing rapidity  to these meteors common enough southward we will add one more of a very uncommon kind which was seen by ulloa at quito in peru the beauty of which will in some measure serve to relieve us after the description of those hideous ones preceding at daybreak says he the whole mountain of pambamarca where we then resided was encompassed with very thick clouds which the rising of the sun dispersed so far as to leave only some vapors too fine to be seen on the side opposite to the rising sun and about ten fathoms distant from the place where we were standing we saw as in a lookingglass each his own image the head being as it were the center of three circular rainbows one without the other and just near enough to each other as that the colors of the internal verged upon those more external while round all was a circle of white but with a greater space between in this manner these circles were erected like a mirror before us and as we moved they moved in disposition and order but what is most remarkable though we were six in number every one saw the phenomenon with regard to himself and not that relating to others the diameter of the arches gradually altered as the sun rose above the horizon and the whole after continuing a long time insensibly faded away in the beginning the diameter of the inward iris taken from its last color was about five degrees and a half and that of the white arch which surrounded the rest was not less than sixtyseven degrees at the beginning of the phenomenon the arches seemed of an oval or eliptical figure like the disk of the sun and afterward became perfectly circular each of these was of a red color bordered with an orange and the last bordered by a bright yellow which altered into a straw color and this turned to a green but in all the external color remained red such is the description of one of the most beautiful illusions that has been ever seen in nature this alone seems to have combined all the splendours of optics in one view to understand the manner therefore how this phenomenon was produced would require a perfect knowledge of optics which it is not our present province to enter upon it will be sufficient here therefore only to observe that all these appearances arise from the density of the cloud together with its uncommon and peculiar situation with respect to the spectator and the sun it may be observed that but one of these three rainbows was real the rest being only reflections thereof it may also be observed that whenever the spectator stands between the sun and a cloud of falling rain a rainbow is seen which is nothing more than the reflection of the different colored rays of light from the bosom of the cloud if for instance we take a glass globe filled with water and hang it up before us opposite the sun in many situations it will appear transparent but if it is raised higher or sideways to an angle of fortyfive degrees it will at first appear red altered a very little higher yellow then green then blue then violet color in short it will assume successively all the colors of the rainbow but if raised higher still it will become transparent again a falling shower may be considered as an infinite number of these little transparent globes assuming different colors by being placed at the proper heights the rest of the shower will appear transparent and no part of it will seem colored but such as are at angles of fortyfive degrees from the eye fortyfive degrees upward fortyfive degrees on each side and fortyfive degrees downward did not the plain of the earth prevent us we therefore see only an arch of the rainbow the lower part being cut off from our sight by the earths interposition however upon the tops of very high mountains circular rainbows are seen because we can see to an angle of fortyfive degrees downward as well as upward or sideways and therefore we take in the rainbows complete circle  in those forlorn regions round the poles the meteors though of another kind are not less numerous and alarming when the winter begins and the cold prepares to set in the same misty appearance which is produced in the southern climates by the heat is there produced by the contrary extreme paul egedes history of greenland  the sea smokes like an oven and a fog arises which mariners call the frost smoke this cutting mist most commonly raises blisters on several parts of the body and as soon as it is wafted to some colder part of the atmosphere it freezes to little icy particles which are driven by the wind and create such a cutting cold on land that the limbs of the inhabitants are sometimes frozen and drop off  there also halos or luminous circles round the moon are oftener seen than in any other part of the earth being formed by the frost smoke although the air otherwise seems to be clear a lunar rainbow also is often seen there though somewhat different from that which is common with us as it appears of a pale white striped with gray in these countries also the aurora borealis streams with peculiar luster and variety of colors in greenland it generally arises in the east and darts its sportive fires with variegated beauty over the whole horizon its appearance is almost constant in winter and at those seasons when the sun departs to return no more for half a year this meteor kindly rises to supply its beams and affords sufficient light for all the purposes of existence however in the very midst of their tedious night the inhabitants are not entirely forsaken the tops of the mountains are often seen painted with the red rays of the sun and the poor greenlander from thence begins to date his chronology it would appear whimsical to read a greenland calendar in which we might be told that one of their chiefs having lived forty days died at last of a good old age and that his widow continued for half a day to deplore his loss with great fidelity before she admitted a second husband  the meteors of the day in these countries are not less extraordinary than those of the night mock suns are often reflected upon an opposite cloud and the ignorant spectator fancies that there are often three or four real suns in the firmament at the same time in this splendid appearance the real sun is always readily known by its superior brightness every reflection being seen with diminished splendor the solar rainbow there is often seen different from ours instead of a pleasing variety of colors it appears of a pale white edged with a stripe of dusky yellow the whole being reflected from the bosom of a frozen cloud  but of all the meteors which mock the imagination with an appearance of reality those strange illusions that are seen there in fine serene weather are the most extraordinary and entertaining nothing says krantz ever surprised me more than on a fine warm summers day to perceive the islands that lie four leagues west of our shore putting on a form quite different from what they are known to have as i stood gazing upon them they appeared at first infinitely greater than what they naturally are and seemed as if i viewed them through a large magnifying glass they were not thus only made larger but brought nearer to me i plainly descried every stone upon the land and all the furrows filled with ice as if i stood close by when this illusion had lasted for a while the prospect seemed to break up and a new scene of wonder to present itself the islands seemed to travel to the shore and represented a wood or a tall cut hedge the scene then shifted and showed the appearance of all sorts of curious figures as ships with sails streamers and flags antique elevated castles with decayed turrets and a thousand forms for which fancy found a resemblance in nature when the eye had been satisfied with gazing the whole groupe of riches seemed to rise in air and at length vanish into nothing at such times the weather is quite serene and clear but comprest with such subtle vapors as it is in very hot weather and these appearing between the eye and the object give it all that variety of appearances which glasses of different refrangibilities would have done mr krantz observes that commonly a couple of hours afterward a gentle west wind and a visible mist follows which puts an end to this lusus naturae  it were easy to swell this catalogue of meteors with the names of many others both in our own climate and in other parts of the world such as falling stars which are thought to be no more than unctuous vapors raised from the earth to small heights and continuing to shine till that matter which first raised and supported them being burnt out they fall back again to the earth with extinguished flame burning spears which are a peculiar kind of aurora borealis bloody rains which are said to be the excrements of an insect that at that time has been raised into the air showers of stones fishes and ivyberries at first no doubt raised into the air by tempests in one country and falling at some considerable distance in the manner of rain to astonish another but omitting these of which we know little more than what is thus briefly mentioned i will conclude this chapter with the description of a waterspout a most surprising phenomenon not less dreadful to mariners than astonishing to the observer of nature  these spouts are seen very commonly in the tropical seas and sometimes in our own those seen by tournefort in the mediterranean he has described as follows the first of these says this great botanist that we saw was about a musket shot from our ship there we perceived the water began to boil and to rise about a foot above its level the water was agitated and whitish and above its surface there seemed to stand a smoke such as might be imagined to come from wet straw before it begins to blaze it made a sort of a murmuring sound like that of a torrent heard at a distance mixed at the same time with an hissing noise like that of a serpent shortly after we perceived a column of this smoke rise up to the clouds at the same time whirling about with great rapidity it appeared to be as thick as ones finger and the former sound still continued when this disappeared after lasting for about eight minutes upon turning to the opposite quarter of the sky we perceived another which began in the manner of the former presently after a third appeared in the west and instantly beside it still another arose the most distant of these three could not be above a musket shot from the ship they all continued like so many heaps of wet straw set on fire that continued to smoke and to make the same noise as before we soon after perceived each with its respective canal mounting up in the clouds and spreading where it touched the cloud like the mouth of a trumpet making a figure to express it intelligibly as if the tail of an animal were pulled at one end by a weight these canals were of a whitish color and so tinged as i suppose by the water which was contained in them for previous to this they were apparently empty and of the color of transparent glass these canals were not straight but bent in some parts and far from being perpendicular but rising in their clouds with a very inclined ascent but what is very particular the cloud to which one of them was pointed happening to be driven by the wind the spout still continued to follow its motion without being broken and passing behind one of the others the spouts crossed each other in the form of a st andrews cross in the beginning they were all about as thick as ones finger except at the top where they were broader and two of them disappeared but shortly after the last of the three increased considerably and its canal which was at first so small soon became as thick as a mans arm then as his leg and at last thicker than his whole body we saw distinctly through this transparent body the water which rose up with a kind of spiral motion and it sometimes diminished a little of its thickness and again resumed the same sometimes widening at top and sometimes at bottom exactly resembling a gut filled with water pressed with the fingers to make the fluid rise or fall and i am well convinced that this alteration in the spout was caused by the wind which pressed the cloud and impelled it to give up its contents after some time its bulk was so diminished as to be no thicker than a mans arm again and thus swelling and diminishing it at last became very small in the end i observed the sea which was raised about it to resume its level by degrees and the end of the canal that touched it to become as small as if it had been tied round with a cord and this continued till the light striking through the cloud took away the view i still however continued to look expecting that its parts would join again as i had before seen in one of the others in which the spout was more than once broken and yet again came together but i was disappointed for the spout appeared no more  many have been the solutions offered for this surprising appearance mr buffon supposes the spout here described to proceed from the operation of fire beneath the bed of the sea as the waters at the surface are thus seen agitated however the solution of dr stuart is not divested of probability who thinks it may be accounted for by suction as in the application of a cuppingglass to the skin  wherever spouts of this kind are seen they are extremely dreaded by mariners for if they happen to fall upon a ship they most commonly dash it to the bottom but if the ship be large enough to sustain the deluge they are at least sure to destroy its sails and rigging and render it unfit for sailing it is said that vessels of any force usually fire their guns at them laden with a bar of iron and if so happy as to strike them the water is instantly seen to fall from them with a dreadful noise though without any further mischief  i am at a loss whether we ought to reckon these spouts called typhons which are sometimes seen at land of the same kind with those so often described by mariners at sea as they seem to differ in several respects that for instance observed at hatfield in yorkshire in      as it is described by the person who saw it seems rather to have been a whirlwind than a waterspout the season in which it appeared was very dry the weather extremely hot and the air very cloudy after the wind had blown for some time with considerable force and condensed the black clouds one upon another a great whirling of the air ensued upon which the center of the clouds every now and then darted down in the shape of a thick long black pipe in which the relator could distinctly view a motion like that of a screw continually screwing up to itself as it were whatever it happened to touch in its progress it moved slowly over a grove of young trees which it violently bent in a circular motion going forward to a barn it in a minute stripped it of all the thatch and filled the whole air with the same as it came near the relator he perceived that its blackness proceeded from a gyration of the clouds by contrary winds meeting in a point or a center and where the greatest force was exerted there darting down like an archimedess screw to suck up all that came in its way another which he saw some time after was attended with still more terrible effects levelling or tearing up great oak trees catching up the birds in its vortex and dashing them against the ground in this manner it proceeded with an audible whirling noise like that of a mill and at length dissolved after having done much mischief  but we must still continue to suspend our assent as to the nature even of these land spouts since they have been sometimes found to drop in a great column of water at once upon the earth and produce an instant inundation phil trans vol iv p    0   which could not readily have happened had they been caused by the gyration of a whirlwind only indeed every conjecture regarding these meteors seems to me entirely unsatisfactory they sometimes appear in the calmest weather at sea of which i have been an eyewitness and therefore these are not caused by a whirlwind they are always capped by a cloud and therefore are not likely to proceed from fires at the bottom they change place and therefore suction seems impracticable in short we still want facts upon which to build a rational theory and instead of knowledge we must be contented with admiration to be well acquainted with the appearances of nature even though we are ignorant of their causes often constitutes the most useful wisdom  chap xxii the conclusion having thus gone through a particular description of the earth let us now pause for a moment to contemplate the great picture before us the universe may be considered as the palace in which the deity resides and this earth as one of its apartments in this all the meaner races of animated nature mechanically obey him and stand ready to execute his commands without hesitation man alone is found refractory he is the only being endued with a power of contradicting these mandates the deity was pleased to exert superior power in creating him a superior being a being endued with a choice of good and evil and capable in some measure of cooperating with his own intentions man therefore may be considered as a limited creature endued with powers imitative of those residing in the deity he is thrown into a world that stands in need of his help and has been granted a power of producing harmony from partial confusion  if therefore we consider the earth as allotted for our habitation we shall find that much has been given us to enjoy and much to amend that we have ample reasons for our gratitude and still more for our industry in those great outlines of nature to which art cannot reach and where our greatest efforts must have been ineffectual god himself has finished these with amazing grandeur and beauty our beneficent father has considered these parts of nature as peculiarly his own as parts which no creature could have skill or strength to amend and therefore made them incapable of alteration or of more perfect regularity the heavens and the firmament show the wisdom and the glory of the workman astronomers who are best skilled in the symmetry of systems can find nothing there that they can alter for the better god made these perfect because no subordinate being could correct their defects  when therefore we survey nature on this side nothing can be more splendid more correct or amazing we there behold a deity residing in the midst of an universe infinitely extended every way animating all and cheering the vacuity with his presence we behold an immense and shapeless mass of matter formed into worlds by his power and dispersed at intervals to which even the imagination cannot travel in this great theater of his glory a thousand suns like our own animate their respective systems appearing and vanishing at divine command we behold our own bright luminary fixed in the center of its system wheeling its planets in times proportioned to their distances and at once dispensing light heat and action the earth also is seen with its twofold motion producing by the one the change of seasons and by the other the grateful vicissitudes of day and night with what silent magnificence is all this performed with what seeming ease the works of art are exerted with interrupted force and their noisy progress discovers the obstructions they receive but the earth with a silent steady rotation successively presents every part of its bosom to the sun at once imbibing nourishment and light from that parent of vegetation and fertility  but not only provisions of heat and light are thus supplied but its whole surface is covered with a transparent atmosphere that turns with its motion and guards it from external injury the rays of the sun are thus broken into a genial warmth and while the surface is assisted a gentle heat is produced in the bowels of the earth which contributes to cover it with verdure waters also are supplied in healthful abundance to support life and assist vegetation mountains arise to diversify the prospect and give a current to the stream seas extend from one continent to the other replenished with animals that may be turned to human support and also serving to enrich the earth with a sufficiency of vapor breezes fly along the surface of the fields to promote health and vegetation the coolness of the evening invites to rest and the freshness of the morning renews for labor  such are the delights of the habitation that has been assigned to man without any one of these he must have been wretched and none of these could his own industry have supplied but while many of his wants are thus kindly furnished on the one hand there are numberless inconveniences to excite his industry on the other this habitation though provided with all the conveniences of air pasturage and water is but a desert place without human cultivation the lowest animal finds more conveniences in the wilds of nature than he who boasts himself their lord the whirlwind the inundation and all the asperities of the air are peculiarly terrible to man who knows their consequences and at a distance dreads their approach the earth itself where human art has not pervaded puts on a frightful gloomy appearance the forests are dark and tangled the meadows overgrown with rank weeds and the brooks stray without a determined channel nature that has been kind to every lower order of beings has been quite neglectful with regard to him to the savage uncontriving man the earth is an abode of desolation where his shelter is insufficient and his food precarious  a world thus furnished with advantages on one side and inconveniences on the other is the proper abode of reason is the fittest to exercise the industry of a free and a thinking creature these evils which art can remedy and prescience guard against are a proper call for the exertion of his faculties and they tend still more to assimilate him to his creator god beholds with pleasure that being which he has made converting the wretchedness of his natural situation into a theater of triumph bringing all the headlong tribes of nature into subjection to his will and producing that order and uniformity upon earth of which his own heavenly fabric is so bright an example  end of the first volume
