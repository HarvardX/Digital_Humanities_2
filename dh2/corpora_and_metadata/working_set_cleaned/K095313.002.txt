longsword earl of salisbury an historical romance  volume the second  dublin printed by george faulkner in parliament street mdcclxvi  longsword earl of salisbury book iv sect i in the religious house to which oswald had retired was a monk called reginhald whose mind but ill suited his profession or his residence in a seat of piety he was brother to gray and by his interest had been not long since admitted into the monastery and promoted to some degree of dignity and authority his manners were equally brutal with those of gray but less disguised by art and hypocrisy he was like him abject and servile but by no means so well skilled in the arts of flattery insolent and assuming but not careful to distinguish between those who feared and those who defied his power hence was he frequently controuled and mortified by his brethren whom he dreaded from a consciousness of his own excesses and who detested and scorned him indeed yet feared the power which supported or seemed to support him they regarded his brother as the favorite of lord raymond and lord raymond as heir to the house of salisbury and already possessed of all its greatness to purchase his protection therefore they turned their eyes from his offenses and suffered him to disgrace and disturb their house by scandalous excesses utterly subversive of holy discipline and order drunkenness and riot and lewdness had oftentimes profaned their walls with impunity they lamented these enormities of their unworthy brother but instead of disclosing and punishing them lamented to each other in secret lest they should forfeit the favor and protection of lord raymond although the miscreant had been scarcely known and was utterly unnoticed and disregarded by this lord  gray had conceived a sudden hope of preventing the effects which the flight of oswald threatened by means of this reginhald and if not of gaining young william into his own power at least of preventing any emissaries from spreading the intelligence of his escape to sanctuary and the distresses of his mother this it was that determined him to depart instantly and to visit this monastery but his brother active and officious in every deed of baseness had already prevented his desires oswald had happily reached the monastery and reginhald was among the first to demand the reason of his appearance scarcely could he restrain his passion until oswald had completed his story and then burst forth with unbounded rage into the vilest and severest reproaches he charged him with falsehood and treachery declared himself resolved instantly to learn the real nature of his crime and purpose of his flight and for this reason to repair in person to the castle in the mean time with an assumed air of authority he ordered that this fugitive should be strictly guarded and kept from all intercourse till his return oswald heard his brutal virulence and passion not without some terror which was noted and regarded as an indication of guilt the directions of reginhald were obeyed and he himself now hastened to inform his brother of this event he met him when he had but just rode a few paces from the castle whither gray instantly returned with the monk  they retired to a private conference with equal eagerness and with minds equally prepared for outrage or treachery the monk prevented the enquiries of his brother by relating what had just now passed at the monastery gray expressed a sullen joy when informed that oswald was closely guarded and for the present effectually prevented from spreading his saucy tale or pursuing the design for which he had fled he commended the zeal of reginhald and seizing his arm with an aspect earnest and mysteriously solemn he declared that both their future fortunes depended on confining oswald from all intercourse and gaining young william into their own power and disposal the rude monk whose first thoughts were ever to recur to violence instantly declared for seizing both and forcing them from their retreat but he was stopped by gray who censured such procedure as dangerous and unwarrantable and pronounced it necessary to pursue measures the most deliberate and most cautiously concerted he proceeded to disclose all the transactions of lord raymond from his first arrival at the castle of salisbury all the efforts made to shake the constancy of ela and all the opposition and disdain of that proud countess he began to explain how much their fortunes must be advanced by finding means of conquering her resolution and by the final success of lord raymond in obtaining full and indisputable possession of the lands and dignities of the house of salisbury but reginhald conscious that his own security from disgrace and punishment depended on the influence and protection of this lord needed no inducement to concur in the designs and practices of his brother he broke in upon his discourse with a passionate heat and loudly condemned all his late proceedings why said he was not i made acquainted with your difficulties why were not their hands forcibly joined i should have at once pronounced the nuptial benediction over them and without regard to female pride or scruples have united them for ever in those bands which no human power can rend asunder  gray again began to condemn his violence and to urge the necessity of caution when their conference was suddenly interrupted by a domestic who surprised them by declaring that he sought the monk and had in charge to conduct him to the countess  the mind of this unhappy lady had long been violently agitated the true cause of that languor and malady which oppressed her gentle frame the hopes she had conceived of the safety of her son and the speedy arrival of friends and deliverers had acted on her harassed spirits like a powerful medicine and checked the progress of her disorder she had now leisure to turn her thoughts to her husband and to weigh those accounts of his fate which oswald had rashly conveyed to her the idea of his disloyalty was piercing she revolved it frequently she reasoned on the intelligence she had received she believed she doubted she indulged her suspicions and strove to banish them by turns ill were those reflections suited to restore her impaired health yet she dwelt upon them the faithful elinor from whom she could not conceal her thoughts in vain endeavored to compose her distractions and to allay her inward grief still she tormented herself with reflections on the supposed falsehood of her lord and on his unhappy fate when the attendant casually discovered from a window the approach of reginhald and observed with some surprise that a religious man who by his habit seemed of the neighboring monastery was now entering the castle he comes with news of my son said the countess hastily let him be called hither  and alas this distracted breast has but too much need of spiritual counsel and comfort  a domestic was instantly dispatched to seek the monk who now appeared before the countess naturally base and mean and never before admitted into such a presence he stood abashed and confused and the consciousness of his own vile purposes served to increase his disorder his aspect in which the sensual and malignant passions had fixed their seat and his deportment which was that of the rude hind or midnight brawler not of the holy and lettered clerk were surveyed by the countess with sudden disgust she shuddered as at the view of some loathsome animal yet assuming a placid air and endeavoring to conceal her dislike she asked of his order and residence no sooner had he named the brotherhood of sarum than raising herself from the couch on which she leaned you then said she bring me news of my son  dispatched to acquaint me with his safe arrival within your holy walls  is it not so reginhald coldly answered that her son was safe and had been deposited in the monastery hy his conductor the countess with clasped hands and earnest accents uttered a prayer for his protection elinor was tenderly affected and uniting her fervours with those of her beloved mistress commended young william to every saint and holy angel the monk stood unmoved and scarcely could assume the appearance of devotion just as far as to pronounce a cold assent to their petitions the countess was on the point of imploring his protection for her son but the disgust which she had conceived at his aspect and which was increased by his demeanor repressed that thought she contented herself with speaking her hopes in general that his innocence and his wrongs would not fail to raise him friends in the house of piety and charity she spoke of the oppression which she herself had suffered in terms of bitterness and indignation and seemed to demand as her just right the vigorous interposition of every good man for her relief but more especially the dutiful and faithful offices of those holy men who had experienced her favor and munificence the silence of reginhald gave her an occasion of repeating and enforcing her discourse but her discourse was directed to an unfriendly ear the wicked monk had fixed his eyes upon an object which totally diverted his attention from the countess near her couch there stood a table on which among some female ornaments was deposited a ring an ancient and precious jewel which had long been the distinguishing ornament of her noble house and bore its ensigns armorial curiously impressed the sight of this instantly suggested a treacherous purpose to the monk for which it was necessary to possess himself of the jewel his situation was convenient for seizing it unnoticed by ela or her attendant he watched a favorable moment to convey it to his bosom and having once secured his prize he was more at leisure to answer the discourse of the countess to assume some appearance of gravity and to affect the dignity and spiritual authority of his function he declared that within their walls her son could not suffer wrong but that it was necessary to send him thither for protection nature and the royal pleasure pointed to his noble kinsman raymond as his true protector  the countess prepared to express her indignation but with an insolence which he mistook for grave authority he warned her to beware of froward pride their liege lord he said had graciously considered her widowed state and provided relief and comfort  her hand her affection and her obedience were now due to lord raymond such was the kings command heaven had approved his kind purpose and would not fail to punish that obstinacy and haughty perverseness which rejected its blessings  and dare thou abandoned and hateful wretch  thus did the countess suffer her virtuous anger to break forth dare thou profane the name of heaven art thou devoted to its service and do thou flatter the baseness and would thou promote the lewd purposes of him who has renounced its laws and defies its vengeance  thy obstinacy be upon thine own head this was the reply of reginhald who was hardened against all reproof and impatient to seek his brother he turned away in sullen disdain and left the countess in wonder and just resentment at his brutal insolence nor did this interview tend to allay the fears and suspicions of a fond mother if the oppression of lord raymond could have its ministers and favorers among the professed votaries of religion where might innocence find refuge or where seek its just redress she now dreaded that the sacred privileges of sanctaury might not find the due regard as her enemy seemed to have corrupted the reverend brethren and to have gained them over to his wicked purposes she wished she had contended with her malady and accompanied her son again she wished she had not rashly entrusted him to false and treacherous guardians her presence might have proved a sufficient protection to him raymond could not dare openly to have raised his arm against him and surely the outrage and usurpation of this lord could not long be concealed  thus did she condemn her conduct and torment her soul with gloomy and terrible imaginations though yet unacquainted with the dangers and distress now prepared for herself and her son  sect ii reginhald had sought his brother and recounted all his interview with ela gray still accused him of violence and turbulence and urged the necessity of welltimed dissimulation of art caution and smooth address the monk was provoked at this affectation of superior wisdom and instead of retorting his reproof displayed the stolen jewel in silent and contemptuous triumph gray was too well versed in the arts of fraud and mischief not to conceive at once that this ring was to be used for deceiving the brethren of the monastery or abusing oswald as occasions might require by pretended orders and directions from the countess he viewed it eagerly and regarded it not without reason as an instrument of his purposes too important to be entrusted wholly to the violent hands of reginhald he commended his zeal and address which he confidently promised should in due time meet their full reward he invited him to refreshment reminded him of his satigue and that the hour of rest approached he promised that by the dawn of morning he himself would be ready to accompany him to the monastery where he made no doubt of happily accomplishing their purposes and laying a firm foundation of their future fortunes reginhald yielded to his instances and retired gray repaired without delay to the apartment of lord raymond and appeared before him with a face of joy and satisfaction he congratulated him upon the prospect of a speedy and final accomplishment of his wishes he briefly related the conduct of his brother at the monastery his reception of oswald and the means already taken to prevent that traitor from officiously spreading his tale he declared his purpose of seeking him instantly in his retirement and was fully assured he said that by the assistance of the monk whose zeal and vigilance he praised he should be able to bring oswald to that punishment which his falsehood merited and to gain young william into his absolute disposal the sure means of prevailing over the pride of ela and engaging her to a full compliance with his wishes raymond wondered but gray repeated his confident assurances of success and departed with requesting his lord patiently to wait the events which the succeeding day must produce  it was now night but fraud and interested malice are strangers to rest the monk was wholly engaged by the thoughts of future favor and preferment and gray watched like the great enemy of mankind to ensnare the innocent and to seduce the weak he busily revolved in his mind the late transactions and his future designs he thought of an expedient which reignhald had mentioned that of forcibly joining the hands of raymond and the countess and pronouncing the nuptial blessing without regard to her consent an expedient which he now considered not as the suggestion of rashness and unexperienced heat but such as the best guided policy might have recourse to and such as their designs might necessarily require in the mean time he resolved if possible to reserve the disposal of young william to himself and even to secret him from lord raymonds power if this lord should prove successful he might forget the services of his creature or not reward them to the full extent of his wishes the possession of this boy might hereafter enable him to revenge such neglect by unexpectedly producing a young heir to assert his rights or if the countess should be relieved from her present oppression and her suitor recalled or forced from her castle the important service of restoring her son might atone for his former insolence and shield him from punishment or should it be necessary for his purposes to destroy this child this might be done more securely in some place of private retirement and more acceptably to his lord when executed without his knowledge or participation his own interest was the sole object of his thoughts and as to the means of advancing it to him all were equally indifferent  the dawn of morning stole upon him while he was anxiously engaged in these reflections and reginhald now stood before him urging him to pursue his intended course without further delay he first summoned some chosen vassals of raymond and in the name of that lord ordered them to follow his steps at some distance and to hold themselves ready to obey his orders the brothers then took their way and soon reached the monastery here they found that notwithstanding the directions of reginhald the lord abbot had been made acquainted with the arrival of oswald had examined him in person had heard and was duly affected by his story promised him protection and that he would assist in all honest means of gaining redress for the injured countess and that at this very time he was shut up in the apartment of oswald hearing examining and enquiring still more minutely into the circumstances of all those events which he related with so much confidence and with such appearance of integrity the brothers congratulated each other on arriving so opportunely and at their desire were conducted into the same apartment oswald started and trembled at the sight of gray who with a demeanor grave and solemn and with well affected humility addressed himself to the abbot in the following manner  reverend father this humane attention to the appearance of distress will be rewarded and heaven forefend but that it should meet the just return of praise from every honest tongue nor is there less honor due to your pious and charitable cares because in the present case they are not called forth by real danger or calamity you have entertained a fugitive already pardoned by his lord and an infant whom his fond mother is at this moment impatient to embrace  you wonder but vouchsafe me a favorable ear i shall unsold what seems so strange and perplexing this venerable brotherhood must have heard how the royal savor has been extended to lord raymond has invested him with all the power and dignity of the house of salibury has consigned to his protection the widow of that noble house and destined his hand for that of the gentle countess when raymond first arrived at her castle to execute the orders of his liege lord he found her alas sunk deep in sorrowful reflections on the fate of her unhappy lord and but ill disposed to listen to his honorable passion nor could his noble nature permit him to break in too precipitately upon her melancholy by declaring his suit and demanding her consent  here oswald would have interrupted his discourse but gray with a mild yet commanding look claimed a free and undisturbed audience the abbot seemed to assent and the crasty minion proceeded thus a decent interval of retirement was allowed to her grief and in the mean time her suitor was entertained with the respect due to his greatness nor was she long a stranger to his purpose nor did she disdain his suit although she still deemed it dishonorable openly to admit a second lover until she had fully paid her duty to the memory of lord william in this interval heaven was pleased to afflict the unhappy lady with severe sickness her fever was violent and long and obstinate was her delirium she raved i know not how of force and oppression she called upon her late lord who she declared was yet alive now in her castle and concealed from her by treachery and cruelty she spoke of blood of murder of her son his dangers and his enemies even when her bodily disorder began to abate the disorder of her mind was still unconquered nor were those wild visions yet dispelled which had so long tormented her her discourse indeed seemed more consistent though the discourse of madness and unhappily imposed on the weakness and inexperience of her attendants they indulged her madness and persuaded her to fly for they believed that lord raymond was really her persecutor who on his part was only anxious for her recovery for this were his prayers incessantly breathed to heaven for this did he bind himself by solemn vow to reward the devotion of your house with ample donations nor was his piety unnoticed or his prayers rejected scarcely had the distraction of this lady prompted her to send away her son and to retire from the castle when heaven was pleased as it were miraculously to awaken her from her frightful dreams and restore her unsettled reason the first sign of recollection which she discovered was her orders to those who had been deceived by her distraction and rashly conveyed her at midnight from her castle to conduct her back again she was obeyed and instantly called for lord raymond acknowledged her infirmity and entreated his pardon and indulgence he noble and gentle lord expressed nothing but the most rapturous joy at this happy change earnestly pressing her to reward his love and crown his wishes no longer now reluctant or insensible to the happiness which heaven and the royal favor had ordained for her she only requested that some little respite might still be granted some time allowed to pay what farther duties the memory of her late lord demanded this holy father came opportunely to confirm her in those sentiments and to direct her pious intentions by his persuasions am i ordered to attend him hither directed by lord raymond to enquire by what means and in what manner he may most effectually discharge his vow and by the gentle countess to desire that a solemn requiem shall without delay be performed by this reverend brotherhood to her departed lord i am still farther to declare that she reflects with confusion on the late disorder of her mind which had driven her young son from her arms that she is impatient to embrace him that at her request to lord raymond he has sreely and fully pardoned the flight of this his attendant nothing now remains but that both return and share in that general joy which reigns in the castle  the abbot wondered and hesitated oswald prepared to speak but gray again prevented him  to remove doubts or scruples said he turning to reginhald let us produce the token of our truth and fairly delivered charge behold lord abbot this ancient ring the wellknown signet of the countess entrusted to us from her fair hand by this she speaks her pleasure that young william be instantly delivered to our care that without delay we may conduct him to her noble presence  the abbot had listened with suspicion and distrust nor was his perplexity dissipated by the conclusion of this speech the accounts which he had received from oswald seemed natural and consistent those of gray subtle and improbable and yet this ring was such an attestation of his truth and integrity as seemed to warrant a full assent he wavered for a while but endeavored to persuade himself that the orders which gray delivered were real and demanded his compliance timorous by nature and possessed with strong imaginations of the power of raymond and the danger of his displeasure he therefore labored to suppress all his doubts affected to be fully convinced and satisfied and consented to deliver up young william to be conducted back to his mother by the monk and gray who dissembled their joy and studied to complete their success by seducing oswald from his retreat they exerted all their artifice to persuade him that the resentment of his lord had totally subsided that he could not but consent to the desires of the gentle countess and forgive an honest though mistaken zeal for the service of a lady who in a few days was to be united with him in the bands of love and wedlock oswald hesitated he knew the falsehood of some part of what gray had declared yet he conceived that he must have delivered this jewel from the hand of the countess and by her command and that of consequence she must have been reconciled to her suitor he thought it natural on such a reconciliation to conceal some late transactions thus he endeavored to account for the misrepresentations of gray yet still he feared and doubted  gray as by the authority of his lord and in his name not only pronounced his full pardon but assured him of favor and reward the abbot condemned his irresolution as weak and criminal as highly prejudicial to his own interest and an undutiful suspicion of the truth and honor of his master the simplicity and inexperience of the vassal gave force to these solicitations he dreaded to renew the displeasure of raymond by delay or hesitation he consented to return and resigned himself to gray who now led away his victims in triumph  the party which gray had appointed to attend him soon appeared in view obeyed his signal and advanced at the sight of armed men the misguided oswald felt all his suspicions renewed he trembled and his fears were instantly confirmed gray with an air of sullen authority ordered him to be seized and bound he attempted to expostulate but was silenced with all the insolence of a successful malice committed to a guard and led away a prisoner to the castle and there was this friend to the afflicted and oppressed consigned to the dreary dungeon the infant heir of salisbury was entrusted to others of the party whose services gray purchased by rich bribes and in whom he chiefly confided a kinsman he had upon the distant coast of devon to whom they were directed to convey their charge with strictest care thus he resolved to dispose of the young lord for the present as he relied on the attachment of this kinsman and by his means might hereafter remove him to some safe and secret residence as his future purposes might require  sect iii thus far the wicked arts of gray had been completely successful and now he hastened to the presence of lord raymond with his flattering congratulations he acquainted him in a few words that all the mischief which the flight of oswald had threatened was now effectually prevented that he had safely disposed of young william with such guardians as were devoted to his and to his masters service and that the false slave who had attempted to betray him was now his prisoner raymond wondered embraced his minion and applauded his address and vigilance in his first violence of pride and resentment he pronounced that oswald should instantly be hanged upon the next tree but gray restrained his passion and entreated him to suspend the fate of this vassal and to reserve the power of granting his forfeited life to the requests of ela if this might hereafter contribute to conciliate her regards at the name of ela raymond fighed and turned upon his creature with an aspect of perplexity and sorrow trust me said he i am weary of this unprofitable pursuit and would to heaven i had never seen this proud dame never felt the power of her beauty  this morning was i unexpectedly summoned to her presence i saw the charming mourner i saw her tortured with fears she had just discovered the loss of an ancient ring the usual ornament of her hand and although she knows not by whom or for what purpose it may have been secreted yet this incident has awakened her suspicions and she dreads some farther design upon her peace but chiefly she fears for her son she condemns her late conduct as weak and precipitate and repents of having trusted the boy from her side at first she made an effort to preserve her dignity and in the language of greatness and affected disdain demanded how long my usurpation was to be continued i interrupted her with humble and ardent expressions of love she wept and was still deaf to my solicitations yet methought she spoke of her late lord with less pride and exultation if said she he has indeed paid the debt of nature may heaven look on his offenses with mercy and protect his helpless infant and injured widow then with earnest and affecting accents she entreated me to accept of all her wealth and magnificence to indulge my wishes freely with the rich inheritance of her lordly house but not to pursue the ruin of an helpless infant to suffer his mother to follow him in peace to hide her grief and waste her few melancholy days in the holy retirement of the monastery  o my friend who could stand unmoved at her disorder but i did not suffer all my emotion to break out i contented myself in general with entreating her to banish all gloomy thoughts to expect happy days to study her real happiness and to command it i then retired impatiently expecting your arrival and your sage and friendly counsel  the success which had hitherto attended the practices and designs of gray gave him authority and consequence with his lord and encouraged him to urge his advice boldly and violently when he had first informed him in general of the transactions of the monastery he pressed him to consider seriously that new incidents might arise new dangers threaten him which might not always be prevented he spoke with severity of his irresolute and timid conduct asked if it was his purpose to abandon all his glorious hopes to return disgraced and rejected to encounter scorn and reproach as a person unworthy of the regards of this lady presumptuous and unjust nothing could secure his honor from ruin or perhaps his life from revenge but his immediate nuptials with the countess of this he spoke as of an event absolutely in the power of raymond and delayed only by his mistaken tenderness he was heard with earnest surprise but when his lord began to plead the difficulties he had encountered and the obstinacy of ela in denying her consent he hastily interrupted him  let a day be appointed cried this minion for the celebration of your nuptials let it be known through the land let your attendants be ordered to prepare for this event and your knights directed to hold themselves in such readiness as the joyful occasion requires  let the rest be my care raymond who still preserved a tender affection for the countess and remembered with horror how dangerously she had been affected by the insolence of gray hesitated and insisted on a full explanation of this mysterious language gray again urged the absolute necessity of prevailing in his present undertaking both for his honor and his safety the eternal infamy nay the utter impossibility of receding after having already proceeded thus far to this he added some artful praises of the countess and many animated observations on the happiness of that man who should possess such a treasure of beauty when the passions of his lord had by such discourse been raised to the utmost degree of fervor he began to flatter his hopes this lady said he you at first found reluctant and no wonder for she had not been assured that lord william was really no more of this she now seems persuaded but regards his death as an event too recent to admit another wooer what though she has discovered such impatience of your love what though she has attempted to escape from this place would she not have persevered in her design would she not have continued her flight if this reluctance and aversion had not been artfully assumed to give her honor and respect in the general eye she affects to summon friends to rescue her from your power but she hopes that they will interpose and persuade her to accept your hand but do we delay till some new suitor shall arrive and under the pretense of relieving the oppressed and revenging her wrongs shall successfully court her love and build his own fortune on your disgrace and ruin  raymond was moved and seemed ready to pay implicit obedience to the dictates of his creature  gray then spoke of the zeal of reginhald his brother and his entire devotion to the service of his noble patron this faithful monk said he will be of use observe the countess for some days continue your fond wooing with all modest and respectful duty but with unabated zeal she will soon experience that the flight of oswald has not proved effectual to collect her creatures round her and the disappointment will depress her proud spirit and convince her that her own and her sons fate still depend on you the day on which your attendants are taught to expect your nuptials may perhaps find her consenting to your wishes but why should we demand or expect her formal consent reginhald shall join your hands by virtue of his sacred authority and pronounce the solemn benediction which shall make her yours for ever her heart shall secretly applaud this gentle violence at least her son restored to her arms shall be the purchase of your pardon  little of art was required to disguise or palliate the baseness of this design so effectually had he prepared the mind of raymond for its reception by raising the storm of passions to darken and confound his reason this lord at once resigned himself to the guidance of his minion and consented to pursue such measures as he should dictate the monk was now summoned before him and appeared in the most abject abasement and servility raymond thanked him for his zeal promised to repay his services and ordered him to observe exactly the directions of his brother reginhald bowed lowly and attempted to speak his duty and submission but in disordered and ungraceful language then retired with gray  these wicked agents thus invested with full authority and prompted by their hopes of interest and savor vigorously pursued the work of oppression and deceit reginhald repaired to his monastery so was he directed by his brother where he urged the fathers to proceed without delay in their obsequies to the deceased lord as his widow now prepared and had appointed a day for her secend nuptials which were only delayed till these religious rites had first been duly performed the reverend clerks were arrayed in their sacred vestments and chaunted forth the solemn requiem the neighboring peasants caught the religious sounds curiously enquired the cause of these extraordinary devotions and spread the tidings of the intended marriage through the adjacent country in the mean time the attendants and domestics of raymond were taught to expect the nuptials of their lord on a day assigned and ordered to hold them ready for this joyful event the found of busy preparation was loud through all the castle and was heard even to the apartment of the countess who wondered enquired and was not long a stranger to the cause she conceived it to be no other than an artifice of her importunate wooer to deceive the friends of her house and to destroy the credit of oswald her faithful emissary of whose confinement she was yet uninformed with scorn and indignation she reflected on the base attempt to sully her bright fame and to persuade her friends that in defiance of the strict restraints of decent widowhood and the respect which the memory of a noble husband claimed she had within the space of a few months listened to the solicitations of a new suitor and consented to receive the hand of her oppressor if the honor and reverence with which she reflected on lord william had been somewhat impaired by her suspicions of his disloyalty a new and more violent aversion to lord raymond now possessed her mind and there still kept up an inflexible resolution never to acknowledge his pretensions to her inheritance or to accept his love in such dispositions she received the visits of this lord with disdain nor answered his tenders of affection but by inveighing with all the bitterness of contempt and abhorrence against the mean deceit which he was now practicing raymond was abashed he could not deny the accusation but with an illaffected openness declared that he had indeed assured his friends that his wishes would be speedily crowned as he would not suppose that she could ever continue thus unreasonably obdurate and obstinately insensible to her own happiness  such were their interviews and such the fixed aversion and proud disdain of the countess unsubdued by oppression grief and fear her tedious and melancholy hours were still wasted in alarms for her son in anxious expectation of relief of the arrival and vigorous interposition of her friends and of the defeat and disgrace of her oppressor in vain did she incessantly enquire complain condemn the slow procedure of those who should fly to assert her cause no messenger of deliverance appeared no voice of comfort did she receive but on the morning of that day which raymond had presumptuously proclaimed his marriageday she still found herself the helpless and joyless prisoner of her false guest  sect iv raymond now on the point of executing his bold purpose trembled with anxiety doubt and solicitude gray himself felt an inward agitation although he labored to encourage and confirm his lord the monk alone stood stupidly insensible of the importance or of the baseness of the design the attendants were disposed in their appointed stations and joy and festivity seemed prepared the apartments of the countess alone were sad and solitary where elinor was still suffered to perform all kind offices to her afflicted lady at the appointed hour raymond appeared before her and first in gentle terms reproached her unkind coldness and severity but urged his love in a manner more bold and peremptory she was silent he renewed his instances she breathed a deep sigh and looked up to heaven as if complaining of her unmerited distress her helpless state which exposed her to these insolent and hateful solicitations he seized her hand she struggled to disengage herself whilst her eyes darted fiery disdain in that moment the brothers entered at sight of reginhald she shuddered with horror and dismay though yet unacquainted with the purpose of his appearance a solemn pause of silence ensued the countess trembling raymond confounded and the brothers who could not behold this disorder without some faint emotion collecting new force and arming themselves against the assaults of pity  an encouraging glance from gray at length emboldened his lord to break silence he conjured the countess by all her hopes of peace all the tenderness she felt for her darling son no longer to delay her own happiness no longer to continue thus perversely insensible of his just pretensions to her love he now stood before her he declared to claim those rights which the royal favor had conferred upon him that neither his honor nor his love permitted him any longer to flatter her pride or to indulge her weak scruples  she fell upon her knees and began to utteran earnest and passionate vow that she never would consent to accept his hand but raymond and his associates quickly interrupted and raised her from the ground nor was her great spirit yet subdued by this rude violence she turned upon them with looks of astonishment and disdain raymond entreated gray reproved her pride and reginhald denounced the vengeance of heaven against her obstinacy whilst the tender mind of elinor wounded deeply by the distress of her dear mistress thus surrounded with cruelty and oppression eased itself in unavailing tears raymond still held the hand of ela and the impious monk who had waited for the signal from gray suddenly began to pronounce the marriage rites but was instantly interrupted by loud and piercing shrieks frequently and violently repeated both by the countess and her attendant the unhappy lady could not long support this violent emotion she sunk down upon her couch and raymond hung over her with a mixture of tenderness and vexation after a long interval of faint and breathless depression she seemed to revive and prepared to speak reginhald seized the moment of her recovery and again began the holy office  but in that instant a new and unexpected interruption checked his profane purpose and confounded the base attempt of usurpation and cruel oppression the sound of haste and trepidation seemed to approach the chamber raymond started the brothers shook at the alarm a voice was heard calling loudly on gray he issued forth raymond and the monk followed they saw a domestic pale and breathless with haste who just found words to declare that lord william was on his way and would speedily reach the castle  not the condemned criminal when he receives his final sentence not the sinner yet unconfirmed in guilt when the sudden crash of thunder appalls his spirit ever shrunk into such abject consternation as raymond now experienced from this shocking intelligence gray was scarcely less confounded although he feared only for his safety and had no sense of wounded honor they hastened into an adjacent apartment where reginhald alone was sufficiently composed to examine this messenger of terror who informed them that his appointed duty had led him to some distance from the castle where he had discovered a small company of travelers who on his nearer approach appeared in disorder and perplexity that they had demanded his condition and place of residence and on their part informed him that they were the attendants and messengers of lord william who had landed on the coast of cornwall and was soon to resume the possession of his castle the information they had receive on their way of the nuptials of the countess had filled them with consternation three of them had resolved to return and convey this intelligence to their lord whilst an equal number now hastened forward if possible to prevent so fata a purpose  behold said he pointing downwards from the window which commanded a sull view of the castlegates their speed has equalled mine and they are now entering  gray rushed out and ordered the domestic to follow he received the unwelcome guests with an appearance of respect they were conducted to an apartment and entertained with due courtesy by the man who had brought the news of their arrival and who now had strict charge that for a while they should be kept from any intercourse or conference with the other attendants  a small ray of hope seemed to dart through the gloom which had possessed the mind of gray when he found that lord william himself was not yet arrived a little respite seemed of moment as it allowed him to reflect and to concert his suture measures at first he thought of abandoning his lord and securing himself by flight but although raymond should not be able to revenge such desertion the power and resentment of lord hubert were terrible and could not fail to destroy him gay hopes of sharing in the riches of this great house of salisbury had long possessed his imagination and he now felt the most implacable hatred of the man who was approaching to defeat these gay hopes his malice and his fears conspired to recommend the most desperate course of action he resolved to make one daring effort more and if possible still to establish the pretensions of his master and to remove his rival by a bold assassination  in such dispositions did this wicked minion return to his lord he found him sunk in despair and tortured with distraction scarcely had he begun to speak when raymond starting up in frantic emotion seized upon him with dreadful menaces of vengeance as the treacherous murderer of his honor and his peace and cursed himself and his vile seducer in all the bitterness of remorse reginhald fled and sought to hide himself from the terror of his resentment gray without the least expostulation the least attempt to allay the fury of his lord suffered the violence of passion to take its free course and to waste its force in fruitless execrations and soon was the storm allayed and raymond as if recovering from a sudden phrenzy softened into grief and tenderness condemned his own extravagance and entreated his favorite to advise direct and extricate him from this difficult and dangerous situation  gray neither endeavored to palliate the disgrace nor to lessen the danger which his lord dreaded he observed that raymond had indeed proceeded so far as to leave no doubt that he had disregarded the conditions imposed by the king and had attempted the most lawless acts of oppression his own part in these transactions he represented as the effects of his unbounded zeal for the service of his master a zeal which threatened to involve him in the fatal consequences of an injured husbands vengeance such discourse only served to irritate the pain which raymond felt is there no way to retreat with honor cried he no nor with safety returned his minion let us not think of retreat we are engaged and must pursue our purpose you wonder but the way is obvious and there is but one way perhaps this husband comes but slightly attended you have knights and men of arms nay start not shall we tamely hold our throats and receive death from him no this arm shall prevent the blow  raymond had long been accustomed to resign himself to the guidance of this favorite by him he had been gradually led on from one excess to the other and so thoroughly was his mind prepared to receive the very worst impressions such is the fatal consequence of the first deviation from virtue that instead of trembling at this last proposal he seemed only sollicitous to know the surest means of effecting it  and here again the favorite assumed that superiority which the pliant temper of his lord and an intimate acquaintance with his weakness and unjust designs had given him he desired that all future measures should be entrusted to him that from him the attendants should be directed to receive their orders raymond acquiesced yet not without the utmost anxiety and most melancholy presages his retirement was disturbed and painful all the inhabitants of the castle plainly perceived that something extraordinary had occured something to disorder their lord and to perplex his designs the countess alone felt some degree of comfort she fondly imputed the sudden retreat of her persecutors to some happy event which the flight of oswald had produced some appearance of her friends or some accounts of their motions hence was her harassed mind enabled to recover from the violent shock which it had just now received  in the mean time the vigilant and crafty gray once more sought the messengers of earl william who by this time were much alarmed at the manner of their reception he met them with courteous looks and declared that the countess who was now ill at ease and could not admit them to her presence had sent to inform herself particularly of the intelligence which they brought they related briefly the landing of william the place of his present residence and his intention of speedily returning to his own castle gray received the account with coldness and affected diffidence he observed that the most positive assurances had been received that earl william had perished in france that if he really was approaching he must be received with due respect but if envy or malice sought to disturb the approaching happiness of lord raymond by false intelligence his power was great and his resentment would be violent by his directions they were for a short time to be strictly guarded lest they should alarm the minds of his friends by rumors which might possibly prove groundless if otherwise a few days would release them  they gazed upon each other with surprise but it was in vain to expostulate they appealed to time to confirm the truth of their declarations and gray then proceeded to summon some of the boldest and most zealous of the attendants on raymond who were conducted to their lord and by him commanded to receive their orders from his favorite and implicitly to follow his direction  these commands gray pretended to explain more fully he told them that from advices lately received their lord had good reason to apprehend a false design to drive him from those possessions which he so justly claimed and from whence alone he hoped to derive the power of rewarding his faithful followers that they were to arm themselves with speed and carefully to guard all the approaches to the castle against force or treachery nor were they slow to express their zeal and chearsul obedience and now this wicked minion stood prepared at the head of a resolute and well appointed band to oppose the entrance of lord william and to plunge a dagger in his heart  long they waited in anxious expectation of their invaders but in vain no invaders appeared no danger threatened them gray began indeed to hope that these strangers had been employed to deceive them and to raise these false alarms for some purpose yet undiscovered perhaps by some friends of the countess who had learned or suspected her present condition he visited the messengers frequently insulted them on the appearance of falsehood which their intelligence now seemed to wear menaced and endeavored to terrify them into a confession of the real purpose of their coming they steadily adhered to their former declarations and related such circumstances of the fortunes the dangers and the arrival of lord william on the coast of england as but too plainly demonstrated their truth and integrity gray was convinced but dissembled his conviction he waited impatiently for the approach of the earl but no intelligence could be received no unusual appearance no arrival of strange and unexpected visitants had broke in upon the silence and tranquillity of the adjacent lands the disappointment served but the more to perplex and alarm him his vigilance was not relaxed he kept his force collected about him and still stood resolved to meet his danger and confirmed in his bloody purpose  end of book iv book v sect i the three faithful followers of earl william who had determined to return to their lord found him just issuing forth from the hall of randolph at the head of a small body of attendants at sight of them his mind was silled with sad presages he turned upon his ancient friend with surprise then both rushed forward impatient to learn the cause of this unexpected return and instantly received the melancholy tidings that whilst their companions had brought the news of the earls arrival to the castle of salisbury they had returned to acquaint him that the countess had given her hand to raymond and that his nuptials had been solemnized on the very day of their approach  the bitterness of this intelligence was too great even for the great soul of william he sunk into a silent dismay and seemed unwilling or unable to contend with despair the knight whose suspecting thoughts had been prepared for this account strove to rouse and comfort him but a long time were his efforts fruitless the afflicted lord scarcely forced out at long and heavy intervals some broken sighs some confused and imperfect expressions of anguish of resentment at the supposed unkindness of his wife and the weakness and unworthiness of her fatal compliance at length suddenly starting from this extreme of depression to that of the most violent fury he uttered dreadful denunciations of vengeance against the destroyer of his peace and called on his friends to attend him instantly to his castle and to assist him in a brave and jost revenge but here the caution of the old knight interposed and with difficulty prevailed on him to return to his friendly roof and there to consult maturely upon the most prudent measures the earl obeyed yet seemed intent only on the most violent and daring course in vain did randolph remind him of the insufficient numbers of his retinue and the superior advantages of the usurper the storm of passion was still loud and terrible nor could the earl liften to danger or difficulty the injuries which his honor had sustained were the sole object of his thoughts and revenge his sole purpose  the fair jacqueline soon perceived a confusion and disorder arising from some unexpected incident and impatient to learn the cause appeared before her host and her protector randolph accosted and entreated her to unite her gentle persuasion and to prevent lord william from rushing precipitately on ruin no cried the earl hastily interrupting him the attempt is not rash nor the purpose desperate what though my wife has so soon forgotten me what though the absence of a few months was too great for her impatience what though she has accepted a second husband have my numerous dependents too been false have they forgotten me no let us collect them let us fire their brave spirits to revenge their injured lord and let his fury fall with its due force upon this adulterous pair  jacqueline seemed lost in consusion randolph again interposed and urged the danger of venturing thus weakly attended to seek his vassals and openly to give defiance to raymond but now the noble maid recovered from her first furprise and her great soul began to beam forth through all her virgin reserve where is that power and influence said she in the court of england which lord william boasted if his own wrongs cannot there find redress if he must have recourse to the precarious chance of arms in vain have i sought relief in this strange land in vain have i indulged the pleasing hopes of regaining my lost inheritance and if he still supports the miseries of oppression my injured parent will not the king protect  he shall give me justice cried william this arm raised him to the throne this arm can tear him from it then embracing her with a paternal sondness the spirit of thy brave father said he dwells in thee yes fair partner of my fortunes the king shall give me justice let my wife no the wife of raymond now enjoy for a while her foul disloyalty my vengeance shall be first directed a against the great author of my wrongs the proud hubert in the face of his misguided sovereign before the gallant nobles of england will i proclaim his baseness and demand full redress let us hasten to the royal presence there shall my friends crowd round me and my vassals attend my orders  randolph was pleased at this resolution which william considered as the most honorable but he as the safest course the time the manner and all the circumstances of their departure were now settled with more temper and composed deliberation the knight insisted to accompany his noble friend together with his band of followers jacqueline consented still to reside in cornwall until the earl had obtained first the sull redress of his own injuries and then the happy means of rescuing her father or of revenging his fate the little troop was soon prepared to enter on their march and soon took their way with no ungallant show the mind of lord william was still gloomy and disordered he thought on his wife the tenderness of her former love the noble nature which all hen actions had invariably displayed recurred to his mind but now served only to aggiavate his despair her strange and precipitate compliance with the desires of raymond was perplexing but to be so soon forgotten was tormenting and ever and anon he unbosomed his distracted thoughts to the friendly knight  foolish and wretched is the man thus would he exclaim who builds his happiness on the frail and instable affection of woman o my friend how securely did i conceive our loves to have been founded how firmly did her heart seem linked to mine can i forget the time when all the noble youth of england courted the smiles of the rich and beautiful heiress of earl patrick when her eyes marked me out as their most worthy object and her love graced my rising fame can i forget the day when i was first publicly distinguished by her favor the solemn jousts were prepared the knights glittered in their pompous array we were surrounded with all the beauties of the land but our thoughts and desires were fixed on ela how did i labor to engage her intention by my gorgeous entry well do i remember the device which then adorned my shield and which my youthful pride had dictated it was an eagle towering in air with his eyes fixed on the sun and these words beneath not akrogant but conscious of nobleness we traversed the lists in solemn state and each champion as he passed made low obeisance toward the place where ela sat but each unnoticed till william pacing proudly by and paying the just homage to her high beauty suddenly she let fall the knot of ribbons which adorned her lovely arm i seized kissed and fixed it in my crest and on that day did my gallant deeds consess my zeal to merit her high regards many a spear was bravely shivered but ere our appointed courses were finished a loud and sudden shriek assailed our affrighted ears we turned and saw the scaffold where this fair dame was seated yielding to its load i burst like lightning to her rescue and amidst all the officious and vigorous interposition of the crowd which the dangerous incident had collected this arm it was which saved her  and did our loves decrease was my heart ever estranged was it one moment seduced to any other object  and yet so soon to be forgotten the false tidings of my death so eagerly received  randolph was studious to divert him from this melancholy subject revenge he knew was grateful to the high foul of william and he labored to inspire him with hopes of a brave revenge he spoke of the arts that had been used to influence the weakness of widowed unfriended unassisted woman of the craft of hubert and his iniquitous abuse of the royal favor but now said he the king shall know this minion he shall know with what malicious purpose of oppression and unjustice his false heart conceived and his false tongue uttered the lying tale of earl williams death and speedily shall he execute the full vengeance due to the wounded honor of his brave kinsman  with eyes darting indignation and sounds of disdain the earl replied that his own influence and reputation in england his noble friends and numerous adherents had made kings and that he relied on these much more than on the justice of young harry alas said he little can thy honest heart conceive of that crast and wily insinuation with which this courtier has wound himself to the heart of his easy prince he alone directs and commands him the noblest spirits of england are insolently scorned and the remotest corner of the realm feels his pernicious influence good heaven cried randolph still laboring to divert the earl from the gloomy subject which lay deeply fixed in his mind and was ever ready to rife and torment him when shall our distracted country feel the blessings of a wife and virtuous rule shall faction and tumult for ever disturb the land and forbid avarice and slavish adulation for ever surround the throne is the insolence of illgotten power to know no control sad and gloomy is the prospect  and yet the spirits of my brave countrymen though depressed and overborne are still unbroken they have already contended and they may again contend for the great prize of freedom perhaps and truly pleasing it is to indulge that hope england may yet experience some happy age when wisdom and valor and virtue shall conspire to bless and to exalt her some glorious monarch may yet hold her imperial scepter flourishing in all the pride of youth loved and revered by his grateful people and dreaded by the enemies of justice and his kingdom perhaps the pious care of some illustrious parent may have formed his mind to all princely virtues perhaps some noble friend of exalted merit and unsullied integrity may have aided the glorious work wisdom and justice may guide his councils and valor lead forth his victorious armies the united voice of a happy people may bless him and the united force of all his enemies may sink before him if heaven should be thus gracious to our country could its transcendent favor admit of any accession  yes let the happiness dissused from the throne be reflected back on such a monarch let him be amply rewarded in a princely consort fitted to grace his royal seat and relieve his generous cares  then let the ardent prayers of his people be accepted let the princely pair flourish and very late pay the debt of nature from heir to heir let their virtues be transmitted and immortal be the glories and blessings of their reign  the spirit of the good knight was elevated and inflamed by this idea of public selicity the most exalted and complete which his imagination could form and william seemed to forget his private grief and to be wrapped in the same pleasing dream and now they approached toward the city of marlborough where henry still held his court the distant view of this royal seat raised a violent agitation in the breast of salisbury he was now on the point of breaking from his obscurity and once more shining forth in his native sphere and he selt all the emotion of an high and noble mind impatient of wrongs ready to urge them boldly and resolutely to seek redress he entered the city when suddenly his spirit was still farther agitated by a strange and unexpected encounter a small but gallant troop approached him headed by a youth of noble port their leader had already fixed his eyes upon him with marks of wonder and stoping as if deprived of all power of motion pronounced the name of salisbury william came forward with courtous demeanor attentively surveying the stranger who at once ended his suspense yet increased his wonder by declaring himself the young lord of poictiers that chauvigny whom his generosity had restored to an injurious father a sudden exclamation of surprise burst from the earl and an interval of silence ensued at length he was enabled to exclaim  good heavens the son of the oppressor and murderer of my friend  and in england  the father too perhaps is ready to insuit our wrongs and boast of his perfidious cruelty  with his ashes replied the youth let his errors also lie buried do thou love the good les roches he is my friend and father extend thy love to me and say bless me with the happy tidings that the fair jacqueline has escaped the storm of contention and misfortune and lives in sasety  would to heaven cried the earl that her father were now in england to embrace and bless her to be witness of her noble nature and to thank the faints for her preservation  the young lord could no longer restrain his impatient ardour they had both alighted and he now rushed on earl william and clung round his neck with all the extravagance of joy what tho said he the brave les roches be still pursued by the severity of fortune he may be rescued he may be yet restored to honor and happiness lord william will not deny his assistance he will aid me with his power whilst i labor to restore him  now cried the earl i am indeed thy friend  but we are at the english court here must i make a trial of my power if the name of salisbury be not forgotten if a few months of obscurity have not totally effaced the remembrance of my birth my actions and my services i shall yet obtain redress of my private wrongs and if he still survives i shall relieve my friend  thus saying he rushed forward with an aspect of fiery resentment and indignation chauvigny turned back with his followers and attended him expecting some important discovery some explanation of what the earl had hastily and obscurely hinted they soon reached the very center of greatness and magnificence and now the long lost earl of salisbury once more appeared in becoming state amidst the nobles of england shining like the great light of heaven when just emerged from a dark and baleful eclipse his ancient friends embraced him his peers crowded round him impatient to learn the story of his wonderful deliverance not so the crasty hubert he heard of his arrival with terror and beheld him with confusion and dismay the young king hastened to congratulate his noble kinsman who sunk upon his knee loudly calling for justice and redress henry raised him and demanded the cause and purpose of his petition the earl collected his great spirit and with locks of terror and disdain pointed to hubert whilst silence and suspense possessed the crowd of nobles come forth said he thou wicked author of my wrongs come forth and meet the vengeance due to thy treachery  here stands the wretched caitiff such this arm shall prove him who basely seized the fatal moment of my absence to destroy my peace and happiness for ever bear witness for me ye warlike barons and nobles of this land with what zealous loyalty i labored to support the cause of henry and to establish our rightful king on that royal feat for him and for our country have i encountered the toils and desperate calamities of war the fury of proud foes and formidable hosts the rage of storms and waves and the dangers of the tempestuous ocean scarcely have these shattered limbs supported the painful task of honor and wonderful has my deliverance been and what is my recompense whilst i fought in gascoigne this pernicious courtier who never experienced the hazards and distresses of the field never knew aught but the luxurious ease of a palace contrived the ruin of the brave harrassed soldier he chose out his minion his nephew the unworthily ennobled raymond he filled the royal ears with false and malicious tales of my death he sent his creature to seize my castle my power and my extended domain and to insult my unhappy countess with his adulterous love he has abused her weakness he has deceived her credulity or perhaps by force possessed himself of her bed i seek not for reparation my wrongs wist not admit of this but i call for just punishment for vengeance due to that deadly wound my honor has thus sustained to the justice of my liege lord i fly  to your royal justice rather than to the influence which salisbury still maintains and the power which he still commands in england  henry was embarrassed and disordered by the boldness of this address the precipitation with which he had yielded to the desires of hubert now appeared in the true light and covered him with confusion he prepared to accost the earl in such soothing terms as he could command in this disorder of his thoughts when the favorite versed in all the refined arts of dissimulation hastily prevented him and thus assumed the semblance of a generous impatience of all censure or suspicion  that i rejoice at the happy arrival of earl william the saints are witnesses that i believed him dead surely cannot be deemed a crime when such repeated assurances were received that he had shared the fate of his unhappy countrymen what though i too indulgently consented to the wishes of my nephew and obtained him permission to woo the gentle countess whom all the land regarded as a widow what force what fraud what injury was meditated what injustice has been committed what vile dishonest purposes have been pursued that vengeance is so loudly denounced the soul of raymond is noble and his procedure has been honorable true he sought the countess he found her deep in sorrow he indulged her sorrow nor urged his passion with the importunity of violent love he waited if happily time and his tender cares might move the countess to listen to his suit but thanks to the interposing providence of heaven his suit could not prevail  go lord william repair to thy princely castle there thy wise waits to receive thee there shall thou find her unassailed and unpolluted go and be happy and when thou reflectest on thine own credulity learn to forgive those who too easily received the false story of thy death  the earl gazed in silence doubting yet willing to believe these happy tidings hubert repeated his assurances with an aspect steady and composed by my holidame exclaimed the king it rejoiceth us that lord william has now found his suspicions false not the unexpected deliverance and happy arrival of our noble consin give us greater joy but let us forget all jealousies and depise all false rumors  embrace and forgive lord hubert command our power and enjoy the reward of thy gallant toils  the courtiers echoed the sentiments of their prince and william with a constrained submission gave his hand to hubert his noble friends were collected round him and renewed their congratulations the king by his caresses seemed willing to efface the remembrance of that easiness with which he had yielded to the desires of his savourite and this favorite by an assumed affection and humbleness of deportment sought to quench all remains of animosity in the mind of the injured earl but conscious of his own artifice and hypocrisy he naturally suspected that readiness of belief with which salisbury seemed to yield his declarations as well as that sudden calm of peace and reconciliation in which his fury seemed to subside he had injured and therefore hated him he had affirmed boldly to divert the present storm but whether the countess had already yielded to raymond or whether he had forcibly possessed himself of her bed as yet he knew not and possibly lord william might detect his falsehood and return with double fury to urge his wrongs and seek his just vengeance such thoughts he revolved for a while in his busy mind and then confirmed himself in the dreadful purpose of concealing his baseness and providing effectually for his safety and power by the immediate destruction of this lord  far other thoughts now employed the earl he had by slow degrees and by the repeated arts of refined and steady hypocrisy been wrought into a firm persuasion that hubert had declared the truth that his messengers had been deceived and that his wife still preserved her loyalty and he freely indulged these delightful thoughts which naturally inspirited an enlivened joy and complacency the gracious condescensions of the king he received with just returns of duty he shared in the delight which his noble friends expressed at their return and although he wondered yet was he affected with due pleasure at the zeal and love which the young lord of france discovered at that earnestness of friendship which seemed so kindly interested in his sortunes but not the splendor and pleasures of a court not the affection of friends nor the smiles of royal favor could detain him in the city of marlborough he was impatient to seek his own noble mansion and his attendants held themselves in readiness to accompany him without any delay but what refreshment necessarily demanded he took a dutiful leave of the king he received the repeated assurances of hubert that his nephew had already retired from the castle and that the countess waited to embrace him with unabated love and he departed at the head of his little troop now reinforced by the followers of lord chauvigny who declared his resolution to attend the earl of salisbury  they took their way and william who had hitherto been totally engaged by his own great affairs was now more at ease and more at leisure to recall the tender sentiments of friendship and to think on the good les roches gentle lord said he addressing himself to young chauvigny how have i deserved this zealous attachment these extraordinary instances of your affection say what surprising events have brought thee hither say how has les roches merited those tender names i think thou gavedst him of friend and father what of his fortunes can thou inform me if he indeed survives where shall i seek him how shall i restore his daughter  the mention of jacqueline brightened the countenance of her lover with a momentary joy which was instantly clouded and with a sigh which awakened all the sears of william he exclaimed at the severity with which fortune had pursued his generous friend i still hope said he and on that hope rests all my comfort that he is now in england but whither driven or where he may now lay his melancholy head alas i know not it is my purpose to seek him and in this good purpose earl william surely must assist me  let me unfold the story of our fortunes and no longer wonder to see chauvigny in this land  they rode slowly on apart from their associates all but the good old knight and the frenchman thus began  sect ii how can i reflect on that credulity with which my father yielded to the false and malicious renresentations of malleon and that unmerited severity with which he pursued our generous friend peace and forgiveness to his departed spirit  if thou have already heard how the hunted fugitive ranged through the wild and desert mountains spare me the odious recital yes thou must have heard thy brave countrymen who long defended him must have at length found their lord their valor only could have rescued thee from the snares of envy and cruelty and may due honor and reward attend that fidelity which guarded the unhappy devoted head of les roches long time they watched over him in his melancholy retreat nor was it their want of vigilance but his own absence of thought and careless inattention to danger which at last separated him from their protection  it was on the morning of a night of broken and disordered slumbers that the unhappy lord started from his hard couch full of inward grief and agitation the woody covert where he had sought repose at first concealed his motions from the englishmen who watched at some distance insensibly was he led on wrapped up in sad and painful reflection and wandered solitary down the winding path which led from the mountain was divided and gradually lost in a vale incumbered with shrubs and rocks and watered by a resounding current at length he awakened as from a dream stared round on the awful prospect and sought to gain his companions but alas he had wandered too far and too incautiously perplexed and confounded encompassed with steep hills which the luxuriant hand of nature had clothed with a wild magnificence of forest and ever and anon diverted from his course by the rocky fragments which the torrent seemed to have washed down into the valley his eyes searched in vain for the path which he had taken he hasted on and paused by turns without direction nor totally free from terror when suddenly he descried a venerable personage clad in the habit of austere piety on which the silver beard descended from a grave and emaciated visage the hermit advanced raising his shrivelled hands in holy benediction over our astonished friend and as les roches bowed before him he enquired with surprise what fate or chance had led him into this rude and solitary retreat  the afflicted lord awed by his reverend aspect yet comforted by that benevolence which beamed forth from his looks and softened all his accents freely acknowledged that he was the wretched child of calamity driven to the desert by persecution and oppression and that he sought the neighboring hills where a few friends the two sharers in his misfortune waited his return the reverend father who saw his anguish comforted exhorted and by degrees so far gained on his confidence that he freely acknowledged his name and quality and briefly related the events which had driven him from the society of men the hermit was moved and pointing to his cell which lay at no great distance there said he shall thou find refuge till these storms of calamity have wasted their violence come on my son enter and partake of my homely refreshment your friends too shall be my care tarry there i know all the windings and secret paths of these unfrequented hills i shall soon find them and here shall they enjoy a more secure and perhaps less uncomfortable retreat the baron made obeisance and accepted the generous invitation the hermit labored up the precipice with slow and painful steps toward the place which les roches had described but here he found no unhappy strangers all was silence and solitude he returned full of fears and sad forebodings which his tenderness of nature had dictated he entered his cave but this too was silent and solitary no guest appeared no afflicted lord waited his arrival  however cautiously les roches had directed his course however secret and retired he had chosen his residence still had his motions been long watched by some base and ignoble men allured by the rewards promised to those who should discover and seize him four sordid hinds disguised in the garb of wood men had diligently traced him through all his various progress but still were terrified and kept at wary distance by the vigilance and well known valor of his attendants the moment of his separation had not escaped them they exulted and resolved to seize this critical occasion they pursued his steps and hastened down to the valley by different routs to them well known  they lay unnoticed impatient to snatch their prey they marked the late conference and saw the hermit depart and no sooner was he lost in the distant wood than rushing furiously into the cave and drawing their concealed weapons they seized the unhappy lord unprepared for resistance in vain did he enquire the cause and endeavor to expostulate they sternly commanded him to attend their pleasure and hurrying him precipitately away directed their course toward the castle of poictiers filled with the delightful idea of those rewards they were to receive for a service so important their victim attended them patient and resigned to their insolence disdaining all entreaties and complaints and was at length conducted into our hall as a man indifferent to his fate and prepared boldly to meet the worst that oppression could inflict  but here he found a strange and unlooked for reception and all the sanguine hopes of his sordid hunters were lost in confusion and disgrace fortunately some followers of les roches who had been made prisoners and were examined by my father distinctly recounted the events in the isle of the and fired his brave spirit with indignation and contempt for the count malleon he began to lament the precipitate and misguided severity with which he had pursued our friend and to revere the character of lord salisbury in that moment he received the account of my flight with true paternal grief and anxiety his joy at my speedy return was equally extravagant and soon was he informed of the generosity that restored me to his arms alas these violent and repeated impressions were too great for his weak and disordered frame he had long been oppressed by a dangerous malady which as it had inflamed and irritated his spirit to an unusual degree of impatience and fretful violence so was it in return inflamed and irritated by the events which this violence had produced too late did he lament his fatal rashness and utter his ineffectual wishes to make a full atonement on the very morning when les roches arrived at poictiers we were alarmed with the symptoms of his dissolution and in these arms did he expire  too intent on paying the mournful offices of my deceased parent i could scarcely give a thought to les roches i had just the power to issue my command that he should be treated nobly thus did he continue for some time a prisoner unnoticed and uncertain of his fate an interval which we afterward lamented bitterly to that we imputed the loss of jacqueline to that the distresses of lord william which our imaginations represented in the most frightful form all derived from my unhappy delay in seeking and offering him protection at length the remains of lord chauvigny were interred with all solemn rites befitting his exalted condition i now became lord of his power and domain and soon found leisure to think on the father of my beloved jacqueline the hinds who had made him my prisoner and now applied for their reward faw me fall at his feet and embrace him with all the rapture of affection and reverence they would gladly have a merit of preserving and conveying him to my castle nor should i have denied their reward but that their rude insolence had aggravated the distresses of my friend i instantly pronounced him free i vowed to devote all my influence and power to make atonement for his unmerited sufferings to exert the most zealous efforts of love and friendship to regain his daughter and to relieve lord salisbury but les roches was indeed reinstated in full possession of his lands and castle but not all our most diligent enquiries not all our vigilance and labor in traversing the wildest and most unfrequented parts of our province could obtain the least information of his daughter or his friend so secretly had salisbury chosen his retreat or perhaps he was then contending with storms and waves perhaps securely landed on his own native shore this last thought was pleasing and we were inclined to indulge it  thus while my breast was filled with all the impatience of love and paternal fondness equally predominant in les roches we soon concurred in the adventurous resolution of seeking the dear treasure in england which fortune had so unkindly torn from us thither said we has jacqueline been conducted by her noble protector and there shall we find both utterly despairing to regain les roches inflamed with such hopes we instantly prepared our retinue a gay and gallant train we soon reached the coast and soon were we embarked alas too soon little suspecting the severe reverse of fortune that now threatened to confound all our flattering expectations  the sea was rough and stormy our bark stout and amply furnished but our mariners were unskilful and long time did we contend with all the violence of the winds and long time were we driven from our destined course and when at last after various dangers and difficulties we were cheared with the hopes of speedily gaining the english coast suddenly we found ourselves assailed by a bold piratical vessel and threatened with a severe captivity the hostile intentions of our adversary were but too plainly discovered as he bore down upon us our force was instantly collected and we resolved to defend our liberty with due spirit tortured at the thought of being prevented from pursuing my design i raved in all the wildness of frenzy and desperation which the good les roches endeavored to restrain himself equally resolute but inspired with a more deliberate and rational courage no sooner had the enemy closed with us than this gallant lord earnest to prevent me in the pursuit of danger leaped on board his vessel was followed by a few attendants and there maintained a bloody and unequal conflict we pressed forward earnest to second this bold attack the pirate was alarmed at our numbers and our resolution when suddenly the violence of the surge separated our vessels and as we endeavored to regain our former station anxious for the rescue of our companions we were shocked with the view of the pirate flying before us his vessel was of quicker sail and his mariners more expert he left us in rage and anguish uttering fruitless execrations and straining our limbs in fruitless efforts to regain our captive friends in the bitterness of grief and disappointment i resolved to continue the pursuit if happily some favorable incident might bring the enemy once more into our reach and for a while the pursuit was continued but the storm was loud and my followers too sensible of their danger they forced me to make toward land and after much hazard and difficulty we were at length disembarked on the southern coast of england  we recounted our late adventure to the inhabitants of the coast who well knew the pirate we described and had oftentimes suffered by his depredations they informed us that his name was william de morisco a bold adventurer who had of late frequently infested their dwellings and probably ere long might alarm them by another descent that his exactions had ever been severe but that his nature rude as it was discovered no wanton cruelty no malicious thirst for blood that an honorable ransom might prevail upon him to set our friends at liberty i was comforted by this intelligence and waited for a time in hopes of some favorable opportunity of recovering les roches but no vessel appeared no intelligence was received  unable to support this delay i resolved once more to seek the enemy at sea my followers i knew would prove averse to such an attempt and the occasion demanded more skilful mariners and a vessel more completely appointed than ours which by this time had felt the severity of winds and seas i therefore formed the bold design of applying for assistance directly at the english court a young king jealous of his honor could not be unmoved at the insults offered to his territory by this obscure adventurer he must readily favor the generous purpose of pursuing and engageing him and if lord salisbury has now regained his native country he cannot be less zealous to rescue his friend he must effectually aid my endeavors  thus i reasoned and leaving a part of my retinue on the coast to treat for the ransom of our friends if the pirate should appear i proceeded to the court of england where jousts and tournaments were prepared for the entertainment of the king now recovering from a tedious sickness in these i engaged nor was i disgraced or my attendants unnoticed henry vouchsafed his attention to the stranger and received me with a princely welcome i called myself a young lord of one of those provinces of france that acknowledged the english jurisdiction and declared the whole story of my adventure on the voyage toward england the king was duly affected with indignation commended the gallant resolution i expressed of seeking the pirate and readily promised to entrust the chastisement of this insolent plunderer to my command  lord hubert whom i soon found to be principal in the confidence of his master echoed the sentiments of henry he frequently held converse with me and enquired much about the affairs of my province discourse of the late wars naturally introduced the name of salisbury i sighed and hubert hastily demanded if i could say aught of the fortunes of this lord the melancholy air which i assumed redoubled his attention i told him that lord william had landed in france had been pursued by the fury of his unjust enemies fled with a noble maid whose father had deeply snared in his calamities and since he was not by this time returned to his native country i seared for both  hubert with an impatience and violence to me unaccountable hastily interrupted me by declaring that william must have perished and this was delivered in a tone and manner which indicated too plainly that he felt a peculiar pleafure in this persuasion i was alarmed i cautiously avoided all farther explanation and coldly assented to his opinion but hubert naturally jealous and practiced in the arts and policy of courts suspected my silence he was sensible that i had suppressed some part of my story he treated me with distance and reserve and my suit sped but coldly frequently did i remind him of the royal promise i had received and urged him to issue the orders necessary for enabling me to seek the pirate i was long tortured with delays till quite wearied out by the insincerity of a minister who interposed like a baleful cloud between me and the favor of his prince i sought a convenient hour and once more kneeled to young henry he graciously directed me to repair to the coast without farther delay and at the same time commanded that a vessel should be there prepared ready to receive and to acknowledge me commander i bowed and kissed the royal hand i collected my attendants  i met lord william  in a happy hour replied the earl  but gentle lord be not diverted from thy purpose haste thou to the coast i shall but visit my castle and straight follow thee if happily we may yet recover our noble friend jacqueline shall receive us at our joyful return and thank thee for her father  sect iii chauvigny prepared to answer when their conference was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a stranger who with gentle aspect and deportment addressed himself to salisbury and kindly congratulated his sase return to england the earl beheld him with surprise tempered with due courtesy and ere he could demand his name the stranger observed with earnestness that the dampy shades of night were approaching fast and pointing to a fair dwelling which lay at some small distance invited the lords to accept of residence and refreshment under his roof till morning there said he shall your retinue be also entertained and there shall lord william receive some pleasing intelligence from the castle of salisbury without farther hesitation or enquiry the earl joyfully aceepted this invitation and pressing forward as his host directed entered a goodly hall which seemed decked and prepared for his hospitable reception  little did this lord conceive of the danger which now awaited him of the desperate purposes of raymond and his associates and the secret malignity of hubert who for some time had entertained a design against his life and hesitated only about the mears of execution conscious of the vengeance due to his own baseness and salsehood and firmly determined to prevent it he revolved many different schemes of destroying earl william either by force or fraud in the midst of such bloody thoughts he was surprised by the arrival of a messenger from lord raymond who desired a private conference raymond and his wicked minion had for some time been perplexed and confounded the intelligence of the three english men whom they still kept under restraint was clear and explicit they adhered invariably to their first account and frequently repeated their declarations with an ingenuous appearance of truth wondering that their lord was not yet arrived on the other hand salisbury did not appear no farther intelligence was received no discoveries made by those sent out to watch his approach in this suspense and uncertainty raymond whose mind was too violently agitated to suggest any calm and deliberate counsels and gray whose wiles seemed to be at length exhausted concurred in the expediency of dispatching an emisfary to lord hubert to inform him of their situation and to desire his direction reginhald was appointed for this purpose and recommended as a person in whom hubert might confide the monk now appeared before him and delivered his letters having already received the dreadful intelligence that william was now safe in the town of marlborough the piercing eye of hubert long used to scan the countenances of men and there to read their thoughts narrowly surveyed the aspect of reginhald and sormed too just conceptions of his temper and disposition he enquired particularly into the measures his nephew had pursued and the monk answered to his questions in such a manner as admitted hubert to a thorough knowledge of his wicked heart fully persuaded that he now had a proper instrument of his deadly purpose he dismissed the monk for a while and appointed an hour for a second conference  the dark design he now meditated required still some farther assistance a man there was at this time attendant on the court whom the crasty minister had frequently made the agent of his oppression and unjustice he had often times sent him out to harrass the land by severe and fraudulent exactions and had suffered him to be enriched by a share of the spoil tyrrel so was he named lived but by the favor of hubert who reserved him for his wicked purposes yet might at once take away his life with a fair semblance of public justice should he at any time rebel against his sovereign pleasure this man was now summoned before him and with a brow of care and anxiety as if some design of moment possessed his mind hubert commanded him instantly to repair to his house which lay near the road lord william was to take to invite this lord to entertain him with all nospitable rites and in some other matters which should hereafter be explained more fully to submit entirely to the guidance of a monk whom he should speecily send to him and whom he was also to entertain tyrrel was alarmed at this mysterious language he knew the desperate unrelenting spirit of his master and suspected that some bloody design was now to be executed and that his house was to be the fatal scene of violence or treachery he trembled and hesitated for he was not yet consummate in villainy but hubert thundered in his ears the most terrible denunciations of vengeance and utter destruction should he betray the least reluctance the smallest defect of zeal and alacrity in executing his orders tyrrel bowed before him with a slavish submission and promised full obedience  still he had to practice with reginhald but here he expected and indeed found an easy task the monk was again summoned to his presence the distinction and apparent confidence with which he was treated served to intoxicate his base mind and to prepare him for some deed of violence or mischief hubert artfully commended his fidelity and promised to reward it but lamented the danger in which raymond and all his adherents were now to be involved lord william he observed must soon reach his castle the shame of disappointment and the violence of hatred and revenge must soon fall on raymond and the zeal of his faithful friends must appear odious and criminal then with wellaffected perplexity and terror addressing himself earnestly to the monk he desired his sage counsel in this dangerous emergency reginhald with an awkward and abject abasement declared that he was totally unable to advise but ready to follow the directions of lord hubert with implicit submission the subtle courtier seized him by the hand applauded his zeal and lavished the amplest promises upon him be bold said he and be happy  there is but one way  let us prevent the attempts of our common enemy  by destroying him  reginhald took fire at this propofal he at once freely offered himself to be the agent and seemed impatient to learn the means of executing a design so suited to a heart that never felt humanity or remorse  hubert hastily produced a phial filled with a deadly poison behold said he the sure means of destroying our enemy let it be thy care to present lord william with this fatal draught and name the reward of so great a service  and now he proceeded to explain his fell purpose to the monk more particularly he dismissed him fully instructed and impatient for the execution reginhald was received by the abject creature of hubert and invested with absolute authority over his domestics tyrrel watched the approach of lord william this lord accepted his insidious invitation and the monk was brought before him as a person from whom he was to receive some particular intelligence of his countess the earl was earnest in his enquiries and reginhald prompt in his false assurances he declared as he had been instructed by hubert that he had for some time resided in the castle of salisbury employed in administering spiritual consolation to a domestic of the countess that he had frequently seen this lady been witness of the melancholy of her widowed state and of the affection with which she cherished the memory of her lord a suitor indeed had visited her but she had obstinately shut her ears against all his solicitations and lord raymond was long since retired in despair  these studied falsehoods had all the effect for which they were intended the heart of william was dilated with joy he embraced his friends with that warmth of affection which sudden good fortune naturally excites then turning again to reginhald repeated his eager enquiries about his wife his son his house and received such answers as confirmed his joy he now secretly condemned his own rash suspicions of the countess his love was redoubled he was impatient to receive her in his arms and all the lively impressions of delight and satisfaction which he felt were communicated to his friends chauvigny embraced him in joyful congratulation randolph forgot his suspicions and wore a face of serenity and pleasure a generous repast was prepared and the board was graced with the most enlivened social festivity  the false host knew full well the dreadful purpose now to be executed and dared not oppose though he shuddered at the thought of it to reginhald he resigned the absolute command of his domestics the wicked monk was officiously attentive to oblige lord salisbury eager to promote the joy of the table but less intent on sharing in this joy than in providing for the guests he had now mixed the fatal draught and saw the poisoned bowl in the hand of an attendant ready to be delivered to lord william he stood unnoticed in a distant part of the hall his heart panting his limbs trembling and his haggard eyes fixed upon the earl he saw him receive the bowl he retired toward the entrance of the hall he heard him salute his host and his associates he turned and saw him raise the poison toward his head  in that instant he rushed impetuously out regardless of those who were entering with equal haste mounted his horse which stood prepared by his appointment and in an extravagance of horrid and malignant joy fled to lord raymond with the important news that the earl of salisbury was no more  the joy of raymond was extravagant with eyes all on fire and accents faltering with impatience and emotion he demanded the particulars of this surprising intelligence and the shameless and abandoned wickedness of reginhald scrupled not to declare the whole of his adventures since his late departure from the castle he was heard with eagerness and anxiety at the mention of poison raymond trembled the blood forsook his cheeks and his brow bespoke horror and consternation but gray labored to quiet his disordered spirit by observing that he had taken no part in the deed that it was past and irrevocable that now he had but to consider how to approve this event to his own advantage to the interests of his love and fortune the wretch who has once deviated from the paths of goodness is easily reconciled to the horrors of his progress in iniquity the thoughts of this lord were soon turned to the flattering prospects of happiness which were presented to his imagination his first emotions of joy and triumph returned he commended the zeal and daring spirit of reginhald and gray joined in the applause although his wicked heart secretly repined at the share which his brother might now boast in advancing the designs of lord raymond and envied the vast rewards which his services might justly claim  raymond was now sully persuaded that all his wishes were speedily to be crowned with success that future difficulties would gradually vanish in his present state of exultation he forgot the obstinacy with which the countess had hitherto opposed his desires and flattered himself with the hopes that a little time together with a full and clear assurance of the death of salisbury would prevail on her to listen more favorably to his suit for a while he resolved to suspend his solicitations but as the prospect of success served to inflame his passion he obstinately adhered to his resolution of possessing the proud lady and even of recurring once more to violence if violence should be necessary with an affected lenity and generosity he ordered the three followers of william to be dismissed when he had first severely reproved them for presuming to disturb the minds of his friends by false intelligence they returned toward the house of randolph still wondering at the delay of their lord and impatient to acquaint him with those important tidings which the unhappy oswald had found means of giving them in their confinement notwithstanding the vigilance of their guards  nor did these late extraordinary events which had engaged all the attention of raymond and his creatures fail to excite the wonder and expectation of the countess they had suspended her persecution and now gave her leisure to indulge her hopes of relief and deliverance such hopes she had not yet resigned though tormented by delay and painful disappointment some fears indeed sometimes arose to cloud the pleasing thoughts she was studious to entertain yet when she reflected how abruptly raymond had retreated from his wicked purpose of forcibly possessing himself of her bed under the pretense of a nuptial ceremony when she considered the appearances of commotion and disorder which were evidently discoverable in the castle she seemed to have good reasons to persuade herself that some intelligence must have been received equally favorable to her and confounding to her oppressor she expected every moment to hear of the vigorous and effectual interposition of some friends to affert the rights and to redeem her from her present captivity yet did she frequently lament to her faithful attendant that her rescue was so long delayed whatever consolation elinor could give was now dissembled and constrained for oswald had been enabled to convey to his sister an account of the seizing of young william and his own return and confinement she was but too well acquainted with the violence of ela too much alarmed with the dread of her relapsing into her former malady to entrust this fatal intelligence to her ear with a heart oppressed with grief and terror she assumed the aspect of ease and serenity when the countess expressed her fears a sigh sometimes escaped from the attendant but it seemed the sigh of friendly sympathy and in her moments of pleasing thoughts and expectations elinor had ever at command some general expressions of comfort some effussions of pious confidence in the great protector of innocence to brighten the dawn of hope which arose within her gentle mistress but she was soon to be undeceived too soon was her heart to be pierced with the most dreadful didings  end of book v book vi sect i the two brothers who had proved such zealous agents in oppression and cruelty were once again to aggravate the distresses of the countess the discontent and envy which gray had conceived toward reginhald since his last arrival which he was not studious to conceal together with the insolence and presumption of this monk founded on the opinion of his great services produced mutual coldness and contempt in their wicked hearts and threatened to dissolve their iniquitous union a new and unexpected incident now served to light up their animosity  some enormities of reginhald had lately been discovered in the monastery too great to be concealed or palliated a country maiden had been seduced to a compliance with his sensual desires he had for some time consorted with her until by degrees his brutal passion grew sated and required some new object he fixed his lascivious eyes upon the concubine of one of his associates in revelling and made some attempts to possess her which had provoked her paramour to utter the most violent menaces against the monk to appease his resentment reginhald basely proposed to give him up the unhappy victim of his own lewdness the man was not yet so abandoned to all sense of virtue as not to feel the utmost abhorrence at this instance of transcendent villainy less scrupulous to acknowledge his own shame as he was not of the clerical order and too violently provoked against the monk to admit any thought of reconciliation he only waited to procure such proofs as might confirm his information then seized the moment of reginhalds absence produced the wretched woman he had corrupted as well as her he had attempted and wounded the ears of the reverend fraternity with a full detection of their wicked brother the whole cloister was instantly filled with sorrow and indignation every instance of outrage and irreverence which he had committed was now recalled to mind and repeated by every tongue how often he had disturbed or disgraced their religious house was now freely told how often his inoffensive brethren had been exposed to his insolence or malice how often his beastly revels had been prolonged until roused by the matinbell he had mixed his debauchery with their early devotions it was at length resolved to send a deputation to the castle of salisbury to demand that reginhald should be sent back to the monastery there to here his accusers and to suffer the punishment due to his accumulated baseness  the persons entrusted with this commission were now arrived the monk was made acquainted with the purpose of their coming and affected to treat them with defiance and contempt although he was too conscious of his guilt not to feel the most violent secret emotions of terror he sought his brother and demanded his advice and assistance in this emergency they chose for their private conference a garden belonging to the castle in which the countess had chiefly delighted in her happier days and which she now sometimes visited to refresh her harassed mind gray listened to the story of his brothers danger with a provoking coldness and insensibility reginhald rudely vaunted his important services to hubert and raymond and seemed to expect as his just right their full protection in this his present difficulty gray at length broke silence by lamenting this fatal discovery which he industriously represented as in the highest degree dangerous and terrible the monk could scarcely restrain his impatience at the affected air of superiority which his brother assumed and the insolence of reproof and censure which his words conveyed gray as if still desirous to mortify him to the utmost continued his discourse by observing with what zeal he had labored to recommend a man to the notice of lord raymond who he feared must now appear in the general eye as unworthy of the favor of this lord and that he himself must share in his disgrace  dog exclaimed the monk flying furiously upon his brother who was alarmed and retired from his violence which he endeavored to allay by hastily promising his friendly interposition with lord raymond  thy interposition cried reginhald am i to depend on thee thou caitiff is this my reward am i to sue thee for the protection of thy great friends who was it that saved them and their pernicious minion from disgrace and ruin thou indeed could steal away from sanctuary the infant heir of salisbury but this was the daring hand which presented the fatal draught to the father  here a loud and piercing shriek broke off their discourse ela and her kind attendant had taken their seat unnoticed in an adjoining bower and heard the last passionate exclamations of the monk the emotions of the countess was too great to be suppressed the brother started were confounded and hastily separated whilst elinor fled with frantic speed to summon assistance to her mistress  she was soon conveyed to her chamber and laid upon her couch languid and silent elinor hung over her with streaming eyes and ever and anon entreated her to give vent to her sorrows but they were too great for utterance her eyes indeed were sometimes raised to heaven with all the expression of silent misery and then again gently closed as if inviting the kind and healing hand of death to cover them in eternal darkness but no complaints did she breathe no exclamations of anguish did she utter at length her frame seemed convulsed and violently agitated a torrent of tears poured down her lovely cheeks and elinor conceived some hopes that her great soul was now struggling to shake off the intolerable weight of sorrow but the calm which succeeded was the calm of insensibility she gazed round her with a vacant eye and all her nobleness of nature seemed irrecoverably lost in senseless melancholy  the disorder of her apartment had reached the cars of raymond and in the violence of surprise and anxiety he once again rushed into her presence  with all the bitterness of remorse he viewed the majestic ruins of exalted beauty and greatness the fatal effect of his lawless passions his haughty soul melted into pity he demanded the cause of her disorder and received from elinor a distinct account of the horrid discourse to which her unhappy lady had been witness all the train of dreadful passions that attend on detected guilt tore the heart of raymond with their united tortures he started and wildly traversed the chamber he paused bent his eyes again upon the countess then turning suddenly from the afflicting object uttered terrible execrations upon himself and his vile seducers he fell upon his knees and addressing himself to ela as if she were sensible of his discourse he passionately vowed to restore her son to her arms and instantly to abandon her castle  again rising suddenly and issuing forth with wild precipitation he called loudly for gray who appeared before him trembling and to prevent his rage began with cursing the brutal violence of reginhald  bid my knights prepare said raymond let my retinue stand ready before the gates  we must depart  the countenance of his creature expressed surprise and dissatisfaction  no expostulation none of thy damned arts  where have thou bestowed the son of this unhappy woman see that he be instantly conveyed back to her castle do it slave or woe upon thy head haste  answer me not  give out my orders for departure  then once more entering the chamber of the countess with all the remorse and anguish of a man at length awakened to a sense of his unjust misguided conduct when it was now too late to be corrected or repaired he gazed distractedly upon her and with a deep and dismal groan pronounced a solemn farewell then turning quickly upon elinor who wept by his side speak to her said he she disdains and justly to hold converse with a villain say that her persecution is now erded tell her i know not i contrived not the murder of her husband let her pronounce his doom and the officious slave that acted the foul deed shall die her son lives and shall yet be happy in her embraces  hear me woman tell her i am gone gone never more to torment the weak unfriended solitary widow  yes these cheeks are yet lovely that form still noble but what of that for me for me could heaven have reserved so rich a treasure horrid presumption  elinor kneeled before him petitioned with all humility for the enlargment of her brother and that to assist her in the necessary attendance of the unhappy countess he might be ordered to reside for some time in the castle  cursed castle cried raymond cursed be the hour in which i first entered these fatal walls and for ever cursed be the slaves who forced me against my better reason to persevere in cruelty  in the midst of this frenzy he was surprised into some degree of composure by the appearance of a stranger who forcing his way violently into the apartment approached toward the countess with an air and aspect of affection and reverence he accosted her without deigning to cast a look upon lord raymond and soon perceived the wretched state to which she was reduced what cried he no ear for joy and comfort no voice to greet the arrival of an old faithful servant  raymond advancing with a stern and haughty frown demanded to know who he was and what the cause of this bold unmannered intrusion question thy own base hinds said he who dared to forbid my approach  nay let thy weapon rest i have a sword as keen and an arm as brave as thine  raymond here attempted to summon his attendants  beware proud lord continued the stranger poor as i am single as i stand in the midst of thy creatures i fear not the power of lord raymond the least violence done to this person would be instantly repaid with tenfold vengeance if this noble dame has been reduced to her present state of misery by thee  hear and tremble yes thou have cause to tremble my lord my gracious master the princely salisbury approaches and before the close of day shall resume his rightful power and authority within these walls  here elinor who had listened in amazement fell suddenly on her knees returned thanks to heaven with the most rapturous devotion and called passionately upon her mistress to hear the joyful tidings but was answered only by a deep and heartfelt sigh  the soul of raymond was harrowed with consternation he stood speechless and motionless and suffered the stranger to depart without further question he found himself on the brow of a precipice whither he had been fatally misled by the wickedness of his flatterers and now was prevented from retreating justice followed close upon him and vengeance was ready to push him head long down after an hideous pause of dismay he rushed out and once more called suriously for gray but gray had heard the fatal intelligence and hid himself from the fury of his lord which echoed loudly through the halls the attendants were collected round him whom he ordered instantly to prepare for their departure and to retire from this accursed place he loudly and frequently cried out to horse still ranging madly through the castle in search of gray in this state of distraction he chanced to espy the monk who trembled and shrunk from him in abject terror traitor cried raymond seizing him by the throat thy falsehood has done this thou have listened to my enemies and been their agent to abuse me by thy falsehoods to deceive and destroy me but thou at least shall feel my vengeance reginhald fell at his feet and would have expostulated but the storm in the breast of raymond was too violent to be allayed by his submissions the unhappy lord fully persuaded that the monk had purposedly framed a tale to luil him into false security called to his followers and commanded them to hang up the traitor  there said he sternly repeating his command and pointing to a large oak which stood in view near the castle walls there let me see my sentence executed without delay and without delay did they proceed to execute this dreadful sentence the wicked reginhald condemned by the man for whom he had proceeded to such enormous guilt was led away in vain imploring mercy urging the unmerited severity of his fate and gnashing his teeth in rage and despair gray from his place of concealment was terrified with the view of his brother in the agonies of death and tortured with the fear of becoming the next victim to the distracted violence of raymond  sect ii the dreadful intelligence now received was speedily and fatally confirmed to these wicked intruders heaven had graciously watched over the earl of salisbury and with a wonderful hand rescued him from the brink of destruction just in that moment when the cup poisoned by the monk had reached and wet his lips a sudden exclamation from chauvigny surprised and discomposed him he started and withdrew the fatal draught the noise was loud in the hall and the crowd increased his eyes quickly encountered les roches rushing eagerly forward the cup fell from his hand and he pressed on with equal ardor to meet the embraces of his longlost friend they clung together in that tumult of joy which knows no words and when at length les roches found leisure to turn to chauvigny the gentle youth pressing him earnestly in his arms completed his happiness by exclaiming that jacqueline too was safe nature was exhausted by these violent emotions and les roches sunk down upon a seat breathless and silent again recovering he cast his eyes round and surveyed the wellknown countenances of his followers and associates the attendants of chauvigny and some of the brave soldiers of lord william he started up and pressed the hands of each then again turning to his two noble friends again he gazed upon them with eager joy and again they renewed their embraces now said the earl i shall indeed return home in triumph now are all my toils my terrors and dangers amply recompensed then resuming his seat at the table he invited les roches to share in their repast and to allow some indulgence and refreshment to his fatigue  and have thou indeed preserved my daughter cried the frenchman let me see her let her father take the dear treasure to his arms is she well is she at hand  safely bestowed under the hospitable roof of this good knight replied william and pointed to randolph the noble maid shall straight be summoned to meet thee and soon shall she share thy joy  thanks to the eternal goodness replied les roches that goodness which has been pleased to unite us to each other by mutual and repeated offices of friendship lo for my daughter i present thee with a gist as precious then beckoning to one of his followers who had entered with him the man retired and soon returned leading young william in his hand who flew to his father with tears of infant joy the astonishment of the earl could scarcely allow him leisure to return the fond endearments of his son he looked wildly on his friend and seemed to demand an explanation of this wonder yes said les roches thou do embrace thy son rescued from danger perhaps from destruction  but be calm thou shall be satisfied hear then the story of my fortunes since i was last separated from thee my dearest chauvigny a few words will relate it all  thou have already heard lord william how much i am indebted to this noble youth he has informed thee no doubt of our preparations for seeking thee in england and of our adventure with the pirate who attempted to seize our vessel little suspecting that strength and desperate resolution which soon taught him to consult his safety by a precipitate flight just in that instant when the swelling waters had separated our ships and our enemies were crouding their sails to escape from that force which they had rashly provoked their captain had been borne down by the press and lay at the feet of one of our brave followers whose sword was now ready to descend with fury upon his head but i stopped his arm and perceiving our situation that we were unseconded and now surrounded by our enemies i deemed it madness to provoke them by any farther resistance i yielded myself a prisoner and the few who had leaped on board with me soon followed my example at first the attention of our enemies was wholly engaged on securing their escape when they had left our vessel at sufficient distance their captain accosted me and with a gloomy courtesy thanked me for rescuing him from his danger i answered that as he had experienced our valor and when we still might have sold our liberties at a dearer rate we had declined the effusion of blood i hoped he would treat us nobly he demanded to know who we were and what our purpose he had taken us he said for merchants that as he approached our numbers and appearance had alarmed his people but as we had made every attempt in our power to avoid him he was encouraged to persevere in his design of attacking us that he himself lived by plunder and he suspected that we were engaged in the same pursuit  if so we might unite our force with his and share his fortunes  to convince him of his mistake i informed him freely of my country my condition and my destination earnestly conjuring him to restore me to my companions and promising the most ample rewards for a service so important let me once regain my countrymen said i and they shall enrich thee with such a ransom as shall exceed thy wishes but not all my promises could prevail upon the pirate again to seek our ship he had experienced our force and dreaded a severe revenge for his attempt yet my repeated solicitations at length so far prevailed that after some time ineffectually roving in search of prey he proposed to keep three of my companions and myself on board to land the rest with a small number of his own men on the coast of england as it was probable our friends had sought this coast and that if they could regain them and send back the stipulated ransom i should then be free i gladly embraced this proposal the pirate steered toward the land the coast was alarmed at the sight of his vessel but to prevent all opposition we chose the dead hour of night and sent off our men in a boat which brought them unnoticed to shore they traveled for some time ere they had the good fortune to find those of our attendants whom lord chauvigny had left to treat for my liberty at length however they were found and the men returned unmolested with my ransom to this i added a rich jewel taken from my finger which i presented to the pirate in acknowledgement of my gratitude  i now hastened to join my friends and from them i learned that lord chauvigny had proceeded to the city of marlborough i was earnest to follow him but my fatigues demanded some refreshment i was conducted to the house of an inhabitant of the coast who received me with all hospitable kindness  let us unite in adoring the invisible power that directed my steps thither  the friendly repast was prepared for me nor were my followers neglected i was pleased at the honest undesigning affection of my host and taught to revere the generous people amongst whom fortune had now placed me at the hour of rest i was courteously conducted to my chamber but my mind had been too long and too violently agitated to admit repose i revolved the dangers and distresses i had experienced i thought of the great purpose for which i had visited this country i thought of my daughter and my friend i sometimes indulged my hopes of finding them and again checked and condemned these flattering imaginations thus did i pass the weary night till roused by a voice in the adjacent chamber i listened attentively and heard my host in earnest conference with his wife i like not said he this message from the castle of salisbury  i started at the name and redoubled my attention  this boy is to be carefully guarded and concealed but wherefore lord raymond is to wed the widow of the earl why then this concealment unless he purposes to destroy the young heir i know the soul of gray and though he be my brother our souls are not allied i dread his temper nature formed him stern and cruel nor do i doubt but that he may easily be wrought upon to act a deed of blood but shall my humble dwelling be made the scene of murder of an infants murder  his wife here began to chide his jealous fears but they seemed to have taken too deep root in his mind to be easily removed what though my house should not be made the place of execution said this good man what though they should not proceed to the utmost pitch of cruelty their purpose cannot be honest and i am made their accomplice by concealing him  i had heard enough and now i busily revolved this alarming discourse  it was evident that the son of my preserver was exposed to danger  perhaps abandoned by his widow  pardon me lord william if my suspicion was rash and ungentle  certainly concealed for some mysterious purpose a stranger seemed to pity and to fear for him what then became a friend what was the part of les roches were his father still alive heaven has now enabled me to restore him to his arms but if he really has perished surely it must be my care to protect and cherish this boy to form the unhappy orphan to honor and virtue to make him worthy of his illustrious descent and enable him in due time to assert his native rights  thus i reasoned and rising with the early dawn summoned my followers communicated this important discovery and desired their counsel and assistance they readily concurred in the design of rescuing the young lord from his present danger by their advice i waited the appearance of our host i accosted him gently and led him on to discourse of his situation his condition his friends and his country he answered me without reserve till i at length mentioned the name of earl william and asked if he could inform me of the fortunes of this lord and his noble house he started and answered hesitating and confused i at once sternly told him i was no stranger to the designs formed against the young heir of that house that as i had been a friend to the father i resolved to be a protector to the son who i knew was concealed under this roof if he would consent to give him up peaceably into my hands the service should be duly rewarded if not  i had force sufficient to rescue him from danger the man trembled and without delay resigned his charge into my hands  and now was my mind possessed with new fears and scruples methought i had been too rash a mothers tenderness perhaps has concealed this boy and for a weighty cause no doubt how then shall the news of this violent removal afflict her soul what terrors must she feel yet still upon mature reflection i deemed it the safest course to convey this youth to marlborough where i hoped to gain such intelligence as might direct my future conduct thither we bent our course and near this place did i receive those joyful tidings which brought me to deliver up my dear charge into his fathers care  from my soul i thank thee replied the earl  yet has thy tale renewed some doubts and suspicions  but let suspicions sleep till tomorrow then starting up earnestly he asked with a loud voice who of my brave followers will undertake the charge of repairing instantly to cornwall bearing to the fair jacqueline the chearing news of her fathers arrival and conveying her to my castle fitzalan stood forth and with five more who defied toil and fatigue insisted that this pleasing charge should be entrusted to them they departed each fresh and vigorous as the sturdy hind that rises to his morning labors and now lord william turning kindly toward les roches attempted once more to speak his joy and gratitude but suddenly his voice failed his cheeks grew pale a cold dew issued from his pores his whole frame was disordered and he sunk faintly down the guests arose in confusion and amazement tyrrel trembled in an agony of terror nor was his consternation unobserved  treason cried chauvigny seizing the false host and this sword shall revenge it  but what revenge on thee thou wretched slave  say have thou indeed murdered this noble lord has thy vile hand dealt him poison confess thy villainy or this moment is thy last the abject tyrrel had fallen on his knees and now loudly and vehemently asserted his innocence but when terrified by the view of instant death he scrupled not to confess that by the direction of lord hubert he had invited the earl to his house but that he was not privy to any deadly purpose if such had heen concerted the monk alone was privy the monk alone had executed it reginhald was sought for but he had fled which confirmed their suspicions and filled the hall with grief and dismay william alone seemed unmoved he gently pressed the hand of les roches my enemies have prevailed said he the snares of hubert have caught me  alas thou know him not  visit my castle comfort my wife and oh continue thy kind protection to my son  the grief of lord chauvigny was outrageous that of les roches had choked his voice he hung over the languid earl in silence and consternation whilst on the other hand the boy clung passionately round the knees of his father the scene was affecting and even the rough soldier to whom death had been long familiar melted into tears  poisoned and by lord hubert was repeated with sorrow and indignation the dismal tidings were soon caught by busy tongues spread abroad and propagated through the land to aggravate the disgrace the wicked favorite was soon to experience  his afflicted friends conveyed the earl to his couch and now the good old randolph whose venerable face had worn the deepest marks of sorrow seemed to be suddenly enlivened by a gleam of hope he paused appeared earnest to collect his dissipated thoughts and now looked as a man unexpectedly visited by comfort the eyes of his friends were fixed upon him as if demanding an explanation when addressing himself hastily to lord william he asked of his present state whether his pain was increased or his languor more oppressing he thanked the gentle knight and declared that now he seemed more at ease  yes cried randolph and soon shall this malady cease and still shall william live  the frenchmen were astonished but the knight confidently repeated his joyful assurances experienced and sagacious and accustomed to survey all objects with more calmness and composure than young chauvigny he revolved all the incidents since their arrival at the house of tyrrel he had marked the aspect of the monk and from thence had formed the blackest suspicions of his temper and designs he had marked his officious cares and obsequious zeal in attending on the earl he had marked how at the first entrance of les roches the cup had dropped from the hands of salisbury he recollected that after this the monk had not been seen and justly concluded that this was the fatal cup which had been prepared for his friend that the fell purpose of hubert had been happily deseated by his sudden surprise and that the poisonous mixture which if drunk must have instantly proved fatal had now when but just scarcely tasted raised a temporary disorder in the frame of william which nature still free from deep infection would soon be able to overcome these thoughts which he communicated to his noble companions were received with joy and soon were they confirmed by that ease and vigor which the earl gradually recovered tyrrel had been secured and was now examined at more leisure his discoveries served to convince them of what was really the truth that he indeed connived at the base design but had not been directly an assistant but he was not an object worthy of noble revenge against lord hubert was vengeance loudly denounced and the soul of salisbury was on fire to inflict the full severity of justice on his treachery and unrelenting malice  his resentment and indignation were still to be more inflamed the unhappy oswald who had for some time groaned under a severe captivity at length had found means to make some impression on the heart of his keeper who kindly consented to relax his hardships when the messengers of lord william were confined he had desired and was secretly admitted to hold some conference with them the keeper was witness with what clearness and ingenuous honesty they entered into the detail of all their fortunes and declared that their lord must ere long appear to confront his enemies the man was alarmed he had heard the story of oswald and he heard it now repeated with honest pity and indignation he was persuaded that the power of lord raymond was soon to expire and that he should do an acceptable service to the earl by favoring the escape of that man who had been punished for his affection to the countess he revolved these thoughts for some time at length listened to the solicitations of his prisoners and suffered oswald to escape he lay concealed for a while resolving to take his way cautiously toward cornwall but soon learned the important tidings which by this time began to spread through the adjacent country that the earl of salisbury had arrived at marlborough and was preparing to return to his castle he therefore changed his course and directed his wary steps toward the royal seat fortunately he encountered fitzalan and his companions who informed him where he might find their noble master he entered the hall of tyrrel at midnight and demanded to be instantly conducted to the earl alarmed at that general sorrow and dismay which dwelt upon every face he ventured to enquire and was soon informed of the cause alas said he if the malice of his enemies has reached the earl how shall oswald hope to escape then sitting down in mournful silence he passed the heavy hours in all the bitterness of anguish and despair till the dawn of morning  the friends and vassals of the earl who by this time began to collect round their lord had scarcely felt the alarm of his danger when they received the joyful tidings of his recovery oswald too was cheared and again demanded immediate admittance to the earl and he was soon admitted for his appearance and demeanor promised something extraordinary he kneeled before lord william and wept  i come said he from thy castle i come to tell thee of thy unhappy countess  the agitation of the earl grew violent but he commanded him to proceed and he heard him with breathless attention till oswald who began to relate all the events of the castle of salisbury which he had known proceeded without reserve to describe the oppression of lord raymond with an artless and ingenuous freedom the rage of william was kindled he started wildly from his seat and thundered out the most terrible denunciations of vengeance and destruction  so may this arm prosper so may this good sword do me service in the hour of danger as i will revenge thee noble dame and may i be cursed and scorned and vile as thou thou recreant lord if i forget thy treachery and oppression  but come my friends let us away  o murderous thief is it thus thy wolfish nature has stolen in upon my helpless fold  his friends labored to recall him to calmness and attention oswald proceeded in his tale and filled the breasts of all his hearers with the most enlivened indignation he concluded with relating the reception of the messengers and his own escape humbly imploring the protection of the earl against his incensed lord may heaven forget me replied william if i forget thy honesty but come my friends if ever pity softened your breasts if ever manhood dwelt in your noble hearts assist me in punishing the injuries of my gentle countess  here young william entered and ran fondly to embrace his father at sight of him oswald fell upon his knees and with an extravagance of pious joy thanked the gracious powers who had preserved him the boy turned and acknowledged his former protector thus was the truth of all that oswald had delivered wonderfully confirmed and william renewed his thanks and promises of favor the attendants were summoned every moment brought in more and more of the earls vassals les roches chauvigny and randolph vied with each other in their expressions of zeal and impatience to redress the injured all were ready to take their way and william enjoyed the pleasing thoughts of surprising the base usurpers in the midst of their presumption but fitzalan had prevented this surprise he could not suppress his impatient affection for his noble mistress to delight her with the first joyful tidings of her lords approach he had turned aside and visited the castle and there did he raise that confusion which had overwhelmed lord raymond and his wicked creature  sect iii but whilst the anguish and consternation of raymond which arose from shame and remorse grew every moment more violent gray who was concerned solely for his personal safety gradually regained some share of recollection and began to consider of the means to ward off the impending danger from his own head his chief reliance was on the important service which he conceived to be in his own power that of discovering the residence of young william and restoring him to his father but still farther to increase his merit and to atone for past offenses he determined to betray his master and to give him up naked and defenseless into the hands of his enemies this base resolution once formed no time was to be lost in executing it raymond was preparing to depart this must be instantly prevented he flew among his followers and attendants he represented the danger which now threatened them in the most alarming colors he told them that their lord had long proceeded in a course of injustice and oppression which must be revenged with indiscriminate fury on all who had accompanied him that he now prepared to retire hoping that whilst the injured earl was taking a bloody vengeance on his innocent followers he might escape in the confusion that the only means of providing for their safety of approving their innocence and of disarming the resentment of lord william was to continue in their present situation without any appearance of hostile intentions any purpose of opposing the entrance of the rightful lord of this castle and to oblige their leader also to stay and answer for his own actions to the nobler few he hinted these things with caution and they received his insinuations with disdain loudly declaring that they were resolved to live or die with raymond to the baser and the greater number he spoke more plainly to them he scrupled not to declare that the violent passions of their lord had disordered his understanding and asked with wellaffected terror who could be safe after the outrageous dealing with his unhappy brother whose only fault was that he had served lord raymond alas with too blind and too violent a zeal  they heard him with approbation and readily consented to submit to his direction in this dangerous emergency  the unhappy raymond was now reduced to the lowest state of human wretchedness tormented with the consciousness of his own guilt and weakness unable to repair or to atone for the mischief he had occasioned pierced with all the stings of remorse unable to conceal his disgrace yet still too great of soul to bear it helpless and solitary whilst the arm of vengeance was lifted against him deserted by his followers and betrayed by the man whose wicked arts had sunk him into this depth of misery gray on the other hand seemed to have composed his fears and to enjoy a short lived triumph he had collected a party round him which gave him the command of the castle his lord had retired to give his distractions some moments of rest and his creatures now issued out orders to his associates to watch his motions and even to oppose his departure by force  in the midst of his presumption he sought lord raymond whom he had but now avoided with the most abject terror with an insolent composure he desired him to explain his intentions  oh are you come cried raymond  i have commanded my people to prepare for departure let us this instant be gone  whither said gray how shall we escape whither shall we fly the powers of earl william are at hand  but what of that his resentment is not directed against us we have not sought to pollute his bed we have not destroyed the repose and happiness of his wife  his lord started up in sudden fury as if preparing to punish this insolence but gray nothing dismayed bad him compose his passions they had already proved too violent  alas said he what was the crime of my unhappy brother  guilty indeed he was but not to thee cruel lord but i will not upbraid thee now  those followers whom raymond cannot protect he must no longer hope to command  nay my lord seek not to pass here thou have no longer power this chamber must content thee here must earl william find thee answer him as thou may  there only wanted this treacherous insolence to fill up the mighty sum of miseries under which raymond groaned he found himself indeed a prisoner guarded by his own people and in the absolute power of his perfidious creature he stood in mute surprise and gray was just preparing to repeat his insolence when the noise of horsemen called him suddenly forth  a small troop had been descried at a considerable distance pressing toward the castle with the most violent and precipitate speed those of raymonds attendants who had refused to unite in the treachery of gray first espied their approach and mounting their horses called for their lord to stand on his defense or bravely to lead them against the enemy for such they deemed them but gray now appeared and with a sudden recollection of thought told them in the name of raymond that no resistance was to be attempted that their lord feared not nor would oppose these visiters but that he directed his friends to march a mile eastward of the castle and there to expect him they obeyed and gray now observed the little troop more distinctly wondering at the small number and struck with a sudden and instinctive terror when he discovered lord william whose person he well knew at the head of this company he gazed earnestly round him yet still but a few persons only were in view  by heaven cried gray he comes not with a force to drive us hence but to make himself our prisoner then hastily ordered his associates to suffer these men to enter unopposed and unmolested and instantly afterward to shut fast the castlegates he cursed his own folly and rashness which had led him to betray himself to lord raymond he now saw a noble occasion of repairing his fault and instead of persevering in his resolution of giving up raymond into the hands of the earl he now deemed it in his power and judged it the wisest course to give up the earl into the hands of his lord  sect iv william had indeed exposed himself to the utmost danger by his ungoverned violence he had taken his way at the head of a princely retinue well appointed and zealous to vindicate his cause so that now his port was that of a warlike baron marching to assist his king against some sudden invasion part of his powers was directed to advance toward the castle by different approaches so as to surround it and prevent the escape of raymond or his people he himself at the head of a chosen band attended by the two french nobles rushed directly forward but the impetuosity of the earl soon left his attendants at a distance all but young chauvigny and a few others who with difficulty kept pace with him they arrived at the castlegates without perceiving that they were come unsupported and william far from recollecting his danger rushed on with furious and impatient ardour till he had reached the apartment of the countess  he flew to take her in his arms and started back in an agony of terror and surprise at the discovery of her unhappy condition he called upon her with earnest yet tender accents and now nature seemed to make some efforts to shake off its lethargic weight the countess trembled as at some extraordinary appearance gazed with a look less vacant as if the dawn of reason were returning sighed and wept  art thou said the earl turning to elinor who busily assisted him to support her mistress art thou that good matron whose cares have administered comfort to my wife  heaven shall reward thee and william shall not be unmindful of thy honest affection but say  conceal not the truth whence this sad disorder in her noble mind has not her oppressor completed his vile design has he not forcibly taken possession of her bed  elinor assured him that heaven had been pleased to preserve her from such pollution but that surprised by the shocking tidings of his death she had lately fallen into this her present state of melancholy  william again pressed the hand of ela speak to me cried he say that thou rejoicest at my return  no word of congratulation no look of joy is this the happiness which my busy fancy formed is this my reception  the countess gazed upon him and seemed in violent agitation but still she was unable to return his affection reason had not yet regained its seat  at length the earl whose heart was torn with anguish bounded furiously from the ground where he had fixed his knee and loudly demanding the vile murderer of his peace issued forth in search of raymond  by this time the castle was in confusion chauvigny and his few attendants had been prevented by superior numbers from following earl william they expressed their surprise and now began too late to perceive their danger one of them suddenly taking a horn from his side prepared to give so shrill a blast as would have reached the ears of their companions and quickened their speed but gray who now had the sole command as suddenly prevented him by declaring with a stern insolence that the least alarm should prove immediate death to lord william his design which he now sought to execute was to raise a violent broil and tumult in the castle and to assassinate the earl in the confusion  the presence and interposition of raymond he deemed necessary and he hastened to summon this lord to embrace the fair occasion of destroying his rival which fortune presented to him at first entering the apartment his eyes were wounded by an object of terror which at once confounded all his designs raymond had fallen upon his sword gray started back in amazement and in that moment william entered and saw the unhappy lord pale and bleeding on the ground who shut his languid eyes as if ashamed to meet the countenance of him he had wronged the art the hypocrisy the boldness and recollection of gray all deserted him he stood trembling and confounded awed by the presence of the earl as by that of a superior being at length he attempted to retire but william drawing his sword forbad him with a terrible authority and demanded the meaning of what he now beheld raymond lifting his eyes faintly just found breath at broken and painful intervals to declare that his own hand had done it  i have indeed wronged thee lord nor could i endure thy triumph and my own shame yes i have destroyed the noblest lady  but there stands the accursed wretch the false and traitorous  here his emotion grew too violent for his languid condition he was seized with a sudden pang he groaned and expired  the earl then turning to gray exclaimed yes thou art the wretch who labored to aggravate the distresses of ela with such infernal diligence thou art he who basely stole away my son  gray fell upon his knees supplicating for mercy with the most abject and servile fear and promising to restore young william the earl raised his arm and prepared to strike the miscreant kill me not cried gray or thy son is for ever lost i alone know the secret of his present residence here a sudden and violent shout arrested the sword of william his followers had arrived had quickly forced the gates open and rushed in a rapid torrent through the halls les roches and chauvigny randolph and oswald directed by the outcries of gray and the loud rage of salisbury forced in just as the wicked agent of oppression was entreating for mercy at sight of oswald despair pierced his soul heart and when he espied young william led on and protected from the violence of the rout he closed his eyes and crouched to receive the deadly blow o shame to manhood cried randolph shall such a slave die by the arm of william  look there noble lord pointing from the window to the body of reginhald which still hung from the oak behold thy just vengeance is prevented behold the punishment which befits such vileness be it so cried william well do thou instruct me and without farther respite was gray led forth to share the fate of his wicked brother  the view of blood and death allayed the joy of william and his noble friends the good old knight was moved and now seemed to regret that the just punishment of gray had not been inflicted but by abfolute and violent power all the late dismal effects of lawless oppression crowded into his mind and he felt the want of that inestimable blessing a wise righteous and well attempered rule  the thoughts of ela and her unhappy condition still diffused a gloom over the countenance of the earl his thanks and congratulations were grave and solemn the body of raymond was removed his attendants were suffered to depart unmolested order and tramquillity were restored in the castle and lord william was at leisure to inform his noble friends of that terrible impression which her misfortunes had made upon his wife they had scarcely begun to offer condolence and comfort when elinor appeared with earnest looks beseeching the earl instantly to visit her afflicted lady the sight of him had awakened her to some degree of reason and his removal had excited in her mind a violent and dangerous emotion of fear and anxiety he hastened to her presence leading his young son who ran to the arms of his mother she hung upon the dear objects with tenderness and pleasure and uttered some words of joy that melancholy which had clouded her noble mind began gradually to dissipate at length she looked as if roused from a dream of misery returned the ardent caresses of her husband and breathed out her pious thanks to that goodness which had preserved him a little time so far contributed to compose her mind that she required the story of her husbands fortunes and dangers but this he suspended until her health should be confirmed and her mind less subject to violent emotions  jacqueline was now arrived had embraced her father and her lover and was presented to the countess at sight of her ela felt some agitation and recollected the tidings which oswald had conveyed to her but when william informed her that he had saved and protected this maid from danger that she was daughter to a dear friend to whom he owed his life and betrothed to a noble youth both of whom were now in the castle she embraced her with a tender affection and secretly felt some shame at her former suspicions and now the two barons of france and the old knight were admitted to offer their congratulations to the countess the friends of earl william crowded from different parts to share his joy and the castle was for some days a scene of gladness and festivity but chauvigny impatient to complete his happiness gently urged to les roches the necessity of returning to france william was soon acquainted with their purpose not so said he shall i not be witness of the happiess now to crown the virtues of that dear maid the lovely companion of my dangers and comforter of my distress here even here shall her plighted hand be given to lord chauvigny  les roches consented the nuptial rites were prepared and celebrated with all due solemnity  the two sons of randolph had attended jacqueline to the castle and now she earnestly entreated their father to permit them to accompany her to france they shall be my knights said she and shall be treated with all honorable care the countess requested with equal earnestness that randolph would permit them to live with her son but the fond father could not yield to these solicitations he declared that his sons must first endeavor to render themselves more worthy of such favor  the faithful elinor still attended on her beloved mistress and was entertained with an affection which made the remembrance of her former misfortunes less bitter her brother too found that respect and reward which his honest zeal had so justly merited  the resentment of the earl against lord hubert was in some degree disarmed when he received the tidings that this wicked favorite had forfeited the royal grace and was ignominiously banished he now reflected on his wrongs without emotion ela too seemed to forget her sufferings and each was the more endeared to the other by the late dangers and distress of their separation  the end books printed and sold by dillon chamberlain in dame street
