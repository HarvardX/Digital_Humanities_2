which this is intended as a supplement    london printed for richardson and urquhart under the royal exchange mdcclxvii  advertisement the editors chief intention in making the following collection was to bring into one point of view the best pieces which have appeared since the conclusion of dodsleys collection and he will venture to affirm that whatever be the merit of that entertaining miscellany this does not fall short any ways of it as some of the volumes in that are made up from the publications of a few years whereas this contains whatever has been most applauded in a course of twenty but he has not confined himself to that period only but inserted many pieces in his opinion of great merit which the inattention of the public or the obscurity of the publication had long suffered to remain unnoticed to these are added many originals by writers of acknowledged merit among which those of mr mendez author of the chaplet and several admired poems in dodsleys miscellany

pauses now and now with rising knell flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound yes  is dead attend the strain daughters of albion ye that light as air so often have tript in her fantastic train with hearts as gay and faces half as fair for she was fair beyond your brightest bloom this envy owns since now her bloom is fled fair as the forms that wove in fancys loom float in light vision round the poets head whenever with soft serenity she smiled or caught the orient blush of quick surprise how sweetly mutable how brightly wild the liquid luster darted from her eyes each look each motion waked a newborn grace that over her form its transient glory cast some lovelier wonder soon usurped the place chased by a charm still lovelier than the last that bell again it tells us what she is on what she was no more the strain prolong luxuriant fancy pause an hour like this demands the tribute of a serious song maria claims it from that sable bier where cold and wan the slumberer rests her head in

hand that led her hence though soon by steps so slow long at her couch death took his patient stand and menaced often and often withheld the blow to give reflection time with lenient art each fond

selim or the shepherds moral scene a valley near bagdat time the morning ye persian maids attend your poets lays and hear how shepherds pass their golden days not all are blessed whom fortunes hand sustains with wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains well may your hearts believe the truths i tell it is virtue makes the bliss wherever we dwell thus selim sung by sacred truth inspired nor praise but such as truth bestowed desired wise in himself his meaning songs conveyed informing morals to the shepherd maid or taught the swains that surest bliss to find what groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind when sweet and blushing like a virgin bride the radiant morn resumed her orient pride when wanton gales along the valleys play breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away by tigris wandering waves he sat and sung this useful lesson for the fair and young ye persian dames he said to you belong well may they please the morals of my song no fairer maids i trust than you are found graced with soft arts the peopled world around the morn that lights you to your loves supplies each gentler ray delicious to your eyes for you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow and yours the love that kings delight to know yet think not these all beauteous as they are the best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair who trust alone in beautys feeble ray boast but the worth bassoras pearls display drawn from the deep we own their surface bright but dark within they drink no lustrous light such are the maids and such the charms they boast by sense unaided or to virtue lost selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain that love shall blind when once he fires the swain or hope a lover by your faults to win as spots on ermin beautify the skin who seeks secure to rule be first her care each softer virtue that adorns the fair each tender passion man delights to find the loved perfections of a female mind blessed were the days when wisdom held her reign and shepherds sought her on the silent plain with truth she wedded in the secret grove immortal truth and daughters blessed their love o haste fair maids ye virtues come away sweet peace and plenty lead you on your way the balmy shrub for you shall love our shore by ind excelled or araby no more lost to our fields for so the fates ordain the dear deserters shall return again come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear to lead the train sweet modesty appear here make thy court amidst our rural scene and shepherd girls shall own thee for their queen with thee be chastity of all afraid distrusting all a wise suspicious maid but man the most  not more the mountain do holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew a silken veil conceals her from the view no wild desires amidst thy train be known but faith whose heart is fixed on one alone desponding meekness with her downcast eyes and friendly pity full of tender sighs and love the last by these your hearts approve these are the virtues that must lead to love thus sung the swain and ancient legends say the maids of bagdat verified the lay dear to the plains the virtues came along the shepherds loved and selim blessed his song eclogue ii hassan or the cameldriver scene the desert time midday in silent horror over the boundless waste the driver hassan with his camels past one cruise of water on his back he bore and his light scrip contained a scanty store a fan of painted feathers in his hand to guard his shaded face from scorching sand the sultry sun had gained the middle sky and not a tree and not an herb was nigh the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view with desperate sorrow wild the affrighted man thrice sighed thrice struck his breast and thus began  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way ah little thought i of the blasting wind the thirst or pinching hunger that i find bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage soon shall this scrip its precious load resign then what but tears and hunger shall be thine ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griefs a more than equal share here where no springs in murmurs break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way cursed be the gold and silver which persuade weak men to follow farfatiguing trade the lilly peace outshines the silver store and life is dearer than the golden ore yet money tempts us over the desert brown to every distant mart and wealthy town full often we tempt the land and often the sea and are we only yet repaid by thee ah why was ruin so attractive made or why fond man so easily betrayed why heed we not while mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefore think the flowery mountains side the mountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o cease my fears  all frantic as i go when thought creates unnumberd scenes of woe what if the lion in his rage i meet  often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to the mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way at that dead hour the silent asp shall creep if aught of rest i find upon my sleep or some swollen serpent twist his scales around and wake to anguish with a burning wound thrice happy they the wise contented poor from lust of wealth and dread of death secure they tempt no deserts and no griefs they find peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o hapless youth for she thy love has won the tender zara will be most undone big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid when fast she dropped her tears as thus she said  farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain  yet as thou go may every blast arise  weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  safe over the wild no perils may thou see  no griefs endure nor weep false youth like me o let me safely to the fair return say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn o let me teach my heart to lose its fears recalled by wisdoms voice and zaras tears he said and called on heaven to bless the day when back to schiraz walls he bent his way eclogue iii abra or the georgian sultana scene a forest time the evening in georgias land where tefflis towers are seen in distant view along the level green while evening dews enrich the glittering glade and the tall forests cast a longer shade what time it is sweet over fields of rice to stray or scent the breathing maize at setting day amidst the maids of zagens peaceful grove emyra sung the pleasing cares of love of abra first began the tender strain who led her youth with flocks upon the plain at morn she came those willing flocks to lead where lilliesrear them in the watery mead from early dawn the livelong hours she told till late at silent eve she penned the fold deep in the grove beneath the secret shade a various wreath of odorous flowers she made gaymotleyd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose the violet blue that on the mossbank grows allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there the finished chaplet welladornd her hair great abbas chanced that fated morn to stray by love conducted from the chase away among the vocal vales he heard her song and sought the vales and echoing groves among at length he found and wooed the rural maid she knew the monarch and with fear obeyed  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved the royal lover bore her from the plain yet still her crook and bleating flock remain often as she went she backward turned her view and bad that crook and bleating flock adieu fair happy maid to her scenes remove to richer scenes of den power and love go leave the simple p and shepherds strain with love delight thee and with abbas reign  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love on the cool fountain or the shady grove still with the shepherds innocence her mind to the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined and often as spring renewed the plains with flowers breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours with sure return she sought the sylvan scene the breezy mountains and the forests green her maids around her moved a duteous band each bore a crook allrural in her hand some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung with joy the mountain and the forest rung  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved and often the royal lover left the care and thorns of state attendant on the fair often to the shades and lowroofd cots retired or sought the vale where first his heart was fired a russet mantle like a swain he wore and thought of crowns and busy courts no more  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved blessed was the life that royal abbas led sweet was his love and innocent his bed what if in wealth the noble maid excel the simple shepherd girl can love as well let those who rule on persias jewelld throne be famed for love and gentlest love alone or wreathe like abbas full of fair renown the lovers myrtle with the warriors crown o happy days the maids around her say o haste profuse of blessings haste away  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved eclogue iv agib and secander or the fugitives scene a mountain in circassia time midnight in fair circassia where to love inclined each swain was blessed for every maid was kind at that still hour when awful midnight reigns and none but wretches haunt the twilight plains what time the moon had hung her lamp on high and past in radiance through the cloudless sky sad over the dews two brother shepherds fled where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led fast as they pressed their flight behind them lay wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away along the mountains bending sides they ran till faint and weak secander thus began secander o stay thee agib for my feet deny no longer friendly to my life to fly friend of my heart o turn thee and survey trace our said flight through all its length of way and first review that longextended plain and yon wide groves already past with pain yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried and last this lofty mountains weary side  agib weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know the toils of flight or some severer woe still as i haste the tartar shouts behind and shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind in rage of heart with ruin in his hand he blasts our harvests and deforms our land yon citron grove whence first in fear we came droops its fair honors to the conquering flame far fly the swains like us in deep despair and leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  secander unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword in vain unheard thou callst thy persian lord in vain thou courtst him helpless to thine aid to shield the shepherd and protect the maid far off in thoughtless indolence resigned soft dreams of love and pleasure sooth his mind midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy no wars alarm him and no fears annoy  agib yet these green hills in summers sultry heat have lent the monarch often a cool retreat sweet to the sight is zabrans flowery plain and once by maids and shepherds loved in vain no more the virgins shall delight to rove by sargis banks or irwans shady grove on tarkies mountain catch the cooling gale or breathe the sweets of alys flowery vale fair scenes but ah no more with peace possessed with ease alluring and with plenty blessed no more the shepherds whitening tents appear nor the kind products of a bounteous year no more the date with snowy blossoms crowned but ruin spreads her baleful fires around  secander in vain circassia boasts her spicy groves for ever famed for pure and happy loves in vain she boasts her fairest of the fair their eyes blue languish and their golden hair those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send those hairs the tartars cruel hand shall rend  agib ye georgian swains that piteous learn from far circassias ruin and the waste of war some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare to shield your harvests and defend your fair the turk and tartar like designs pursue fixed to destroy and steadfast to undo wild as his land in native deserts bred by lust incited or by malice led the villain arab as he prowls for prey often marks with blood and wasting flames the way yet none so cruel as the tartar foe to death inured and nursed in scenes of woe he said when loud along the vale was heard a shriller shriek and nearer fires appeared the affrighted shepherds through the dews of night wide over the moonlight hills renewed their flight  an ode to fear by the same thou to whom the world unknown with all its shadowy shapes is shown who see appalled the unreal scene while fancy lifts the veil between ah fear ah frantic fear i see i see thee near i know thy hurried step thy haggard eye like thee i start like thee disordered fly for lo what monsters in thy train appear danger whose limbs of giant mold what mortal eye can fixed behold who stalks his round an hideous form howling amidst the midnight storm or throws him on the ridgy steep of some loose hanging rock to sleep and with him thousand phantoms joined who prompt to deeds accursed the mind and those the fiends who near allied over natures wounds and wrecks preside while vengeance in the lurid air lifts her red arm exposed and bare on whom that ravening brood of fate who lap the blood of sorrow wait who fear this ghastly train can see and look not madly wild like thee epode in earliest greece to thee with partial choice the grieffull muse addressed her infant tongue the maids and matrons on her awful voice silent and pale in wild amazement hung yet he the bard aeschylus who first invoked thy name disdained in marathon its power to feel for not alone he nursed the poets flame but reached from virtues hand the patriots steel but who is he whom later garlands grace who left a while over hyblas dews to rove with trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace where thou and furies shared the baleful grove wrapped in thy cloudy veil the incestuous queen jocasta  sighed the sad call her son and husband heard when once alone it broke the silent scene and he the wretch of thebes no more appeared o fear i know thee by my throbbing heart thy withering power inspired each mournful line though gentle pity claim her mingled part yet all the thunders of the scene are thine antistrophe thou who such weary lengths have past where will thou rest mad nymph at last say will thou shroud in haunted cell where gloomy rape and murder dwell or in some hollowed seat against which the big waves beat hear drowning seamens cries in tempests brought dark power with shuddering meek submitted thought be mine to read the visions old which thy awakening bards have told and lest thou meet my blasted view hold each strange tale devoutly true never be i found by thee oerawd in that thricehallowd eve abroad when ghosts as cottagemaids believe their pebbled beds permitted leave and goblins haunt from fire or fen or mine or flood the walks of men o thou whose spirit most possessed the sacred seat of shakespeares breast by all that from thy prophet broke in thy divine emotions spoke hither again thy fury deal teach me but once like him to feel his cypress wreath my meed decree and i o fear will dwell with thee the passions an ode for music by the same when music heavenly maid was young while yet in early greece she sung the passions often to hear her shell thronged around her magic cell exulting trembling raging fainting possessed beyond the muses painting by turns they felt the glowing mind disturbed delighted raised refined till once it is said when all were fired filled with fury rapt inspired from the supporting myrtles round they snatched her instruments of sound and as they often had heard apart sweet lessons of her forceful art each for madness ruled the hour would prove his own expressive power first fear his hand its skill to try amid the chords bewildered laid and back recoiled he knew not why even at the sound himself had made next anger rushed his eyes on fire in lightnings owned his secret stings in one rude clash he struck the lyre and swept with hurried hand the strings with woeful measures wan despair  low sullen sounds his grief beguiled a solemn strange and mingled air twas sad by fits by starts twas wild but thou o hope with eyes so fair what was thy delighted measure still it whispered promised pleasure and bad the lovely scenes at distance hail still would her touch the strain prolong and from the rocks the woods the vale she called on echo still through all the song and where her sweetest theme she chose a soft responsive voice was heard at every close and hope enchanted smiled and waved her golden hair and longer had she sung  but with a frown revenge impatient rose he threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down and with a withering look the wardenouncing trumpet took and blew a blast so loud and dread were never prophetic sounds so full of woe and ever and anon he beat the doubling drum with furious heat and though sometimes each dreary pause between dejected pity at his side her soulsubduing voice applied yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien while each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head thy numbers jealousy to naught were fixed sad proof of thy distressful state of differing themes the veering song was mixed and now it courted love now raving called on hate with eyes upraisd as one inspired pale melancholy sat retired and from her wild sequestered seat in notes by distance made more sweet poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul and dashing soft from rocks around bubbling runnels joined the sound through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole or over some haunted streams with fond delay round an holy calm diffusing love of peace and lonely musing in hollow murmurs died away but o how altered was its sprightlier tone when cheerfulness a nymph of healthiest hue her bow across her shoulder flung her buskins gemmd with morning dew blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung the hunters call to faun and dryad known the oakcrownd sisters and their chasteeyed queen satyrs and sylvan boys were seen peeping from forth their alleys green brown exercise rejoiced to hear and sport leapt up and seized his beechen spear last came joys ecstatic trial he with viny crown advancing first to the lively pipe his hand addressed but soon he saw the brisk awakening viol whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best they would have thought who heard the strain they saw in tempes vale her native maids amidst the festal sounding shades to some unwearied minstrel dancing while as his flying fingers kissed the strings love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round loose were her tresses seen her zone unbound and he amidst his frolic play as if he would the charming air repay shook thousand odours from his dewy wings o music spheredescended maid friend of pleasure wisdoms aid why goddess why to us denied layst thou thy ancient lyre aside as in that loved athenian bower you learned an allcommanding power

do the groves such lamentations send why sit the virgins on the hill of tears while heavy sighs their tender bosoms rend they weep for albin with the flowing hair who perished by the cruelty of mey a blameless hero blooming young and fair because he scorned her passion to obey see on you western hill the heap of stones which mourning friends have raised over his bones o woman bloody bloody was thy deed the blackness of thy crime exceeds belief the story makes each heart but thine to bleed and fills both men and maids with keenest grief behold thy daughter beauteous as the sky when early morn transcends yon eastern hills she loved the youth who by thy guile did die and now our ears with lamentations fills it is she who sad and groveling on the ground weeps over his grave and makes the woods resound a thousand graces did the maid adorn her looks were charming and her heart was kind her eyes were like the windows of the morn and wisdoms habitation was her mind a hundred heroes tried her love to gain she pitied them yet did their suits deny young albin only courted not in vain albin alone was lovely in her eye love filled their bosoms with a mutual flame their birth was equal and their age the same her mother mey a woman void of truth in practice of deceit and guile grown old conceived a guilty passion for the youth and in his ear the shameful story told but over his mind she never could prevail for in his life no wickedness was found with shame and rage he heard the horrid tale and shook with indignation at the sound he fled to shun her while with burning wrath the monster in revenge decreed his death amidst lochmey at distance from the shore on a green island grew a stately tree with precious fruit each season covered over delightful to the taste and fair to see this fruit more sweet than virgin honey found served both alike for physic and for food it cured diseases healed the bleeding wound and hungers rage for three long days withstood but precious things are purchased still with pain and thousands tried to pluck it but in vain for at the root of this delightful tree a venomous and awful dragon lay with watchful eyes all horrible to see who drove the affrighted passengers away worse than the vipers sting its teeth did wound the wretch who felt it soon behooved to die nor could physician ever yet be found who might a certain antidote apply even they whose skill had saved a mighty host against its bite no remedy could boast revengeful mey her fury to appease and him destroy who durst her passion slight feigned to be stricken with a dire disease and called the hapless albin to her sight  arise young hero skilled in feats of war on yonder lake your dauntless courage prove to pull me of the fruit now bravely dare and save the mother of the maid you love i die without its influence divine nor will i taste it from a hand but thine with downcastlook the lovely youth replied  though yet my feats of valor have been few my might in this adventure shall be tried i go to pull the healing fruit for you with stately steps approaching to the deep the hardy hero swims the liquid tide with joy he finds the dragon fast asleep then pulls the fruit and comes in safety back then with a cheerful countenance and gay he gives the present to the hands of mey  well have you done to bring me of this fruit but greater signs of prowess must you give go pull the tree entirely by the root and bring it hither or i cease to live though hard the task like lightning fast he flew and nimbly glided over the yielding tide then to the tree with manly steps he drew and pulled and tugged it hard from side to side its bursting roots his strength could not withstand he tears it up and bears it in his hand but long alas ere he could reach the shore or fix his footsteps on the solid sand the monster followed with a hideous roar and like a fury grasped him by the hand then gracious god what dreadful struggling rose he grasps the dragon by the envenomed jaws in vain for round the bloody current flows while its fierce teeth his tender body gnaws he groans through anguish of the grievous wound and cries for help but ah no help was found at length the maid now wondering at his stay and racked with dread of some impending ill swift to the lake to meet him bends her way and there beheld what might a virgin kill she saw her lover struggling on the flood the dreadful monster gnawing at his side she saw young albin fainting while his blood with purple tincture died the liquid tide though pale with fear she plunges in the wave and to the heros hand a dagger gave alas too late yet gathering all his force he drags at last his hissing foe to land yet there the battle still grew worse and worse and long the conflict lasted on the strand at length he happily descried a part just where the scaly neck and breast did meet through this he drove a welldirected dart and laid the monster breathless at his feet the lovers shouted when they saw him dead while from his trunk they cut the bleeding head but soon the venom of his mortal bite within the heros bosom spreads like flame his face grew pale his strength forsook him quite and over his trembling limbs a numbness came then fainting on the slimy shore he fell and uttered with a heavy dying groan these tender words my lovely maid farewell remember albin for his life is gone these sounds like thunder all her sense oppressed and swooning down she fell upon his breast at last the maid awakning as from sleep felt all her soul overwhelmed in deep despair her eyes stard wild she raved she could not weep she beat her bosom and she tore her hair she looked now on the ground now on the skies now gazed around like one imploring aid but none was near in pity to her cries no comfort came to sooth the hapless maid then grasping in her palm that shone like snow the youths dead hand she thus expressed her woe burst burst my heart the lovely youth is dead who like the dawn was wont to bring me joy now birds of prey will hover round his head and wild beasts seek his carcass to destroy while i who loved him and was loved again with sighs and lamentable strains must tell how by no heros valor he was slain but struggling with a beast inglorious fell this makes my tears with double anguish flow this adds affliction to my bitter woe yet fame and dauntless valor he could boast with matchless strength his manly limbs were bound that force would have dismayed a mighty host he showed before the dragon could him wound his curling locks that wantoned in the breeze were blacker than the ravens ebon wing his teeth were whiter than the fragrant trees when blossoms clothe them in the days of spring a brighter red his glowing cheeks did stain than blood of tender heifer newly slain a purer azure sparkled in his eye than that of icy shoal in mountain found whenever he spoke his voice was melody and sweeter far than instrumental sound o he was lovely fair as purest snow whose wreaths the tops of highest mountains crown his lips were radiant as the heavenly bow his skin was softer than the softest down more sweet his breath than fragrant bloom or rose or gale that cross a flowery garden blows but when in battle with our foes he joined and sought the hottest dangers of the fight the stoutest chiefs stood wondering far behind and none durst try to rival him in might his ample shield then seemed a gate of brass his awful sword did like the lightning shine no force of steel could through his armor pass his spear was like a mast or mountainpine even kings and heroes trembled at his name and conquest smiled whereer the warrior came great was the strength of his unconquered hand great was his swiftness in the rapid race none could the valor of his arm withstand none could outstrip him in the days of chase yet he was tender merciful and kind his vanquished foes his clemency confessed no cruel purpose labored in his mind no thought of envy harbored in his breast he was all gracious bounteous and benign and in his soul superior to a king but now he is gone and naught remains but woe for wretched me with him my joys are fled around his tomb my tears shall ever flow the rock my dwelling and the clay my bed ye maids and matrons from your hills descend to join my moan and answer tear for tear with me the hero to his grave attend and sing the songs of mourning round his bier through his own grove his praise we will proclaim and bid the place for ever bear his name edwin and angelina a ballad by dr goldsmith  turn gentle hermit of the dale  and guide my lonely way  to where yon taper cheers the vale  with hospitable ray  for here forlorn and lost i tread  with fainting steps and slow  where wilds immeasurably spread  seem lengthening as i go  forbear my son the hermit cries  to tempt the dangerous gloom  for yonder faithless phantom flies  to lure thee to thy doom  here to the houseless child of want  my door is open still  and

his gentle accents fell the modest stranger lowly bends and follows to the cell far in a wilderness obscure the lonely mansion lay a refuge to the neighboring poor and strangers led astray no stores beneath its humble thatch required a masters care the wicket opening with a latch received the harmless pair and now when busy crowds retire to take their evening rest the hermit trimmed his little fire and cheered his pensive guest and spread his vegetable store and gayly pressed and smiled and skilled in legendary lore the lingering hours beguiled around in sympathetic mirth its tricks the kitten tries the cricket chirrups in the hearth the crackling faggot flies but nothing could a charm impart to sooth the strangers woe for grief was heavy at his heart and tears began to flow his rising cares the hermit spied with answering care oppressed  and whence unhappy youth he cried  the sorrows of thy breast  from better habitations spurned  reluctant do thou rove  or grieve for friendship unreturnd  or unregarded love  alas the joys that fortune brings  are trifling and decay  and those who prize the paltry things  more trifling still than they  and what is friendship but a name  a charm that lulls to sleep  a shade that follows wealth or fame  but leaves the wretch to weep  and love is still an emptier sound  the modern fair ones jest  on earth unseen or only found  to warm the turtles nest  for shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  and spurn the sex he said but while he spoke a rising blush his lovelorn guest betrayed surpised he sees new beauties rise swift mantling to the view like colors over the morning skies as bright as transient too the bashful look the rising breast alternate spread alarms the lovely stranger stands confessed a maid in all her charms  and

purity display  to emulate his mind  the dew the blossom on the tree  with charms inconstant shine  their charms were his but woe to me  their constancy was mine  for still i tried each fickle art  importunate and vain  and while his passion touched my heart  i triumphed in his pain  till quite dejected with my scorn  he left me to my pride  and sought a solitude forlorn  in secret where he died  but mine the sorrow mine the fault  and well my life shall pay  i will seek the solitude he sought  and stretch me where he lay   and there forlorn despairing hid  i will lay me down and die  twas so

raise but gives his mimic no reflected praise thrice happy genius whose unrivaled name shall live for ever in the voice of fame it is thine to lead with more than magic skill the train of captive passions at thy will to bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow in the sweet sense of sympathetic woe through every vein i feel a chilness creep when horrors such as thine have murdered sleep and at the old mans look and frantic stare it is lear alarms me for i see him there nor yet confined to tragic walks alone the comic muse too claims thee for her own with each delightful requisite to please

best not idly pleased at judgments dear expense but burst outrageous with the laugh of sense perfections top with weary toil and pain it is genius only that can hope to gain the playrs profession though i hate the phrase it is so mechanie in these modern days lies not in trick or attitude or start natures true knowledge is his only art the strongfelt passion bolts into the face the mind untouched what is it but grimace to this one standard make your just appeal here lies the golden secret learn to feel or fool or monarch happy or distressed no actor pleases that is not possessed once on the stage in romes declining days when christians were the subject of their plays ever persecution dropped her iron rod and men still waged an impious war with god an actor flourished of no vulgar fame natures disciple and genest his name a noble object for his skill he chose a martyr dying midst insulting foes resigned with patience to religions laws yet braving monarchs in his saviors cause filled with the idea of the secret part he felt a zeal beyond the reach of art while look and voice and gesture all expressed a kindred ardour in the players breast till as the flame through all his bosom ran he lost the actor and commenced the man professed the faith his pagan gods denied and what he acted then he after died the players province they but vainly try who want these powers deportment voice and eye the critic sight it is only grace can please no figure charms us if it has not ease there are who think the stature all in all nor like the hero if he is not tall the feeling sense all other want supplies i rate no actors merit from his size superior height requires superior grace and what is a giant with a vacant face theatric monarchs in their tragic gait affect to mark the solemn pace of state one foot put forward in position strong the other like its vassal dragged along so grave each motion so exact and slow like wooden monarchs at a puppetshow the mien delights us that has native grace but affectation ill supplies its place unskilful actors like your mimic apes will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes however foreign from the poets art no tragic hero but admires a start what though unfeeling of the nervous line who but allows his attitude is fine while a whole minute equipoisd he stands till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands resolved though nature hate the tedious pause by perseverance to extort applause when romeo sorrowing at his juliets doom with eager madness bursts the canvas tomb the sudden whirl stretched leg and lifted staff which please the vulgar make the critic laugh to paint the passions force and mark it well the proper action natures self will tell no pleasing powers distortions ever express and nicer judgment always loathes excess in sock or buskin who oerleaps the bounds disgusts our reason and the taste confounds of all the evils which the stage molest i hate your fool who overacts his jest who murders what the poet finely writ and like a bungler haggles all his wit with shrug and grin and gesture out of place and writes a foolish comment with his face old johnson once though cibbers perter vein but meanly groupes him with a numerous train with steady face and sober humrous mien filled the strong outlines of the comic scene what was writ down with decent uttrance spoke betrayed no symptom of the conscious joke the very man in look in voice in air and though upon the stage appeared no playr the word and action should conjointly suit but acting words is labor too minute grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong while sober humor marks the impression strong her proper traits the fixed attention hit and bring me closer to the poets wit with her delighted over each scene i go wellpleased and not ashamed of being so but let the generous actor still forbear to copy features with a mimics care it is a poor skill which every fool can reach a vile stagecustom honored in the breach worse as more close the disingenuous art but shows the wanton looseness of the heart when i behold a wretch of talents mean drag private foibles on the public scene forsaking natures fair and open road to mark some whim some strange peculiar mode fired with disgust i loath his servile plan despise the mimic and abhor the man go to the lame to hospitals repair and hunt for humor in distortions there fill up

the beehive of its golden hoard and bear the unbought luxuriance to thy board sometimes my books by day shall kill the hours while from thy needle rise the silken flowers and thou by turns to ease my feeble sight resume the volume and deceive the night oh when i mark thy twinkling eyes oppressed soft whispering let me warn my love to rest then watch thee charmed while sleep locks every sense and

inscribed to a lady who expressed a great aversion to marriage in aesops days when trees could speak and talk in hebrew latin greek an elm and vine by chance near neighbors though separate each pursued their labors the vine with native sweetness fraught for man prepared the chearing draught her tendrils curled along the plain and ruddy clusters swelled amain the towering elm could little boast but leaves  a barren shade at most save when by woodmans sturdy stroke cut down to make a chair or spoke yet though but small his claim to merit not wholly void of sense or spirit his neighbors

urge his friendly suit but sorely grieved to meet disdain a tender sigh expressed his pain when lo thick darkness veils the pole dread lightnings flash loud thunders roll impetuous rains in floods

of all epilogue the anxious struggle happily oerpast and every party satisfied at last it now remains to make one short essay and urge the moral lesson in the play in arts long since has britain been renowned in arms high honored and in letters crowned the same great goddess who so nobly sung in shakespeares strains and honeyd over his tongue their deathless marlbro to the triumph led and wreathed eternal laurels round his head yet though the trump of neverdying fame strikes heavens high arches with the british name though on the sands of africa it glows or casts a daylight on the zemblian snows still there are faults in britain to be found which spring as freely as in common ground  we are too gay  they frequently too sad  we run stark wild  they melancholy mad extremes of either reason will condemn nor join with us nor vindicate with them the human genius like revolving suns an equal circuit in the bosom runs and through the various climates where it is placed must strike out new diversities of taste to one grand point eternally it leans however it warps or differs in the means hence on no nation let us turn our eyes and idly raise it spotless to the skies nor still more idly let our censures fall since knaves and madmen may be found in all here then we rest nor further can contend for since the best will find some fault to mend let us wherever the virtues shed their fire with fervor reverence and with zeal admire exert our care the gathering blaze to trace and mark the progress only not the place confess alike the peasants and the kings nor once consider in what

translated from metastasio thanks nice to thy treacherous art at length i breathe again the pitying gods have taken my part and eased a wretchs pain i feel i feel that from its chain my rescued soul is free nor is it now i idly dream of fancied liberty extinguished is my ancient flame all calm my thoughts remain and artful love in vain shall strive to lurk beneath disdain no longer when thy name i hear my conscious color flies no longer when thy face i see my hearts emotions rise i sleep yet not in every dream thy image pictured see i wake nor does my altered mind fix its first thought on thee from thee far distant when i roam no fond concern i know with thee i stay nor yet from thence does pain or pleasure flow often of my nices charms i speak nor thrills my steadfast heart often i review the wrongs i bore yet feel no inward smart no quick alarms confound my sense when nice near i see even with my rival i can smile and calmly talk of thee speak to me with a placid mien or treat me with disdain vain is to me the look severe the gentle smile as vain lost is the empire over my soul which once those lips possessed those eyes no longer can divine each secret of my breast what pleases now or grieves my mind what makes me sad or gay it is not in thy power to give nor can thou take away each pleasant spot without thee charms the wood the mead the hill and scenes of dullness even with thee are scenes of dullness still judge if i speak with tongue sincere thou still art wondrous fair great are the beauties of thy form but not beyond compare and let not truth offend thine ear my eyes at length incline to spy some faults in that loved face which once appeared divine when from its secret deep recess i tore the painful dart my shameful weakness i confess it seemed to split my heart but to relieve a tortured mind to triumph over disdain to gain my captive self once more i would suffer every pain caught by the birdlimes treacherous twigs to which he chanced to stray

dangers they have past the warrior thus the combat over recounts his bloody wars tells all the hardships which he bore and shows his ancient scars thus the glad slave by prosperous fate freed from the servile chain shows to each friend the galling weight which once he dragged with pain i speak yet speaking all my aim is but to ease my mind i speak yet care not if my words with thee can credit find i speak nor ask if my discourse is ever approved by thee or whether thou with equal ease do talk again of me i leave a light inconstant maid thoust lost a heart sincere  i know not which wants comfort

and all the craggy mountains yield there will we sit upon the rocks and see the shepherds feed their flocks by shallow rivers to whose falls melodious birds sing madrigals there will i make thee beds of roses with a thousand fragrant posies a cap of flowers and a kirtle imbroidered all with leaves of myrtle a gown made of the finest wool which from our pretty lambs we pull slippers lined choicely

seek no more than may suffice i press to bear no haughty sway look what i lack my mind supplies lo thus i triumph like a king content with that my mind does bring i see how plenty surfets often and hasty clymbers soonest fall i see that such as sit aloft mishap does threaten most of all these get with toil and keep with fear such cares my mind could never bear no princely pomp nor welthie store no force to win a victory no wily wit to salve a sore no shape to win a lovers eye to none of these i yield as thrall for why my mind dispiseth all some have too much yet still they crave i little have yet seek no more they are but poor though much they have and i am rich with little store they poor i rich they beg i give they lack i lend they pine i give i laugh not at another loss i grudge not at another gain no worldly wave my mind can toss i brook that is anothers bane i fear no foe nor fawn on friend i loath not life nor dread mine end my wealth is health and perfect ease my conscience clear my chief defense i never seek by brybes to please nor by desert to give offense thus do i live thus will i die would all did so as well as i cupids pastime an old sonnet it chanced of late a shepherd swain that went to seek his straying sheep within a thicket on a plain espied a dainty nymph asleep her golden hair overspread her face her careless arms abroad were cast her quiver had her pillows place her breast lay bare to every blast the snepherd stood and gazed his fill naught durst he do naught durst he say whilst chance or else perhaps his will did guide the god of love that way the crafty boy thus sees her sleep whom if she waked he durst not see behind her closely seeks to creep before her nap should ended be there come he steals her shafts away and puts his own into their place nor dares he any longer stay but ere she wakes hies thence apace scarce was he gone but she awakes and spies the shepherd standing by her bended bow in haste she takes and at the simple swain lets fly forth flew the shaft and pierced his heart that to the ground he fell with pain yet up again forthwith he start and to the nymph he ran amain amazed to see so strange a sight she shot and shot but all in vain the more his wounds the more his might love yielded strength amidst his pain her angry eyes were great with tears she blames her hand she blames her skill the bluntness of her shafts she fears and try them on herself she will take heed sweet nymph try not thy shaft each little touch will pierce thy heart alas thou know not cupids craft revenge is joy the end is smart yet try she will and pierce some bare her hands were glovd but next to hand was that fair breast that breast so rare that made the shepherd senseless stand that breast she pierced and through that breast love found an entry to her heart at seeling of this newcome guest lord how this gentle nymph did start she runs not now she shoots no more away she throws both shaft and bow she seeks for what she shunned before she thinks the shepherds haste too slow though mountains meet not lovers may what other lovers do did they the god of love sat on a tree and laughed that pleasant sight to see winifreda away let naught to love displeasing my winifreda move your care let naught delay the heavenly blessing nor squeamish pride nor gloomy fear what though no grants of royal donors with pompous titles grace our blood well shine in more substantial honors and to be noble well be good our name while virtue thus we tender will sweetly sound wherever it is spoke and all the great ones they shall wonder how they respect such little folk what though from fortunes lavish bounty no mighty treasures we possess well find within our pittance plenty and be content without excess still shall each returning season sufficient for our wishes give for we will live a life of reason and that is the only life to live through youth and age in love excelling well hand in hand together tread sweet smiling peace shall crown our dwelling and babes sweetsmiling babes our bed how should i love the pretty creatures while round my knees they fondly clung to see them look their mothers features to hear them lisp their mothers tongue and when with envy time transported shall think to rob us of our joys you will in your girls again be courted and i will go a wooing in my boys admiral hosiers ghost by mr glover author of leonides as near portobello lying on the gently swelling flood at midnight with streamers flying our triumphant navy rode there while vernon sat allglorious from the spaniards late defeat and his crews with shouts victorious drank success to englands fleet on a sudden shrilly sounding hideous yells and skrieks were heard then each heart with fear confounding a sad

shade of hosier brave his pale bands was seen to muster rising from their watery grave over the glimmering wave he hyd him where the burford reared her sail with three thousand ghosts besides him and

has played an english part had been better far than dying of a grieved and broken heart unrepining at thy glory thy successful arms we hail but remember our sad story and let hosiers wrongs prevail

that constant shall remain and i the while will sit and smile to see you spend your time in vain autumn by mr brerewood though the seasons must alter ah yet let me find what all must confess to be rare a female still cheerful and faithful and kind the blessings of autumn to share let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine overspread with its branches and shade whose clusters appear more transparent and fine as its leaves are beginning to fade when the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load in our orchard surrounded with pales in a bed of clean straw let our apples be stowed for a tart that in winter regales when the vapors that rise from the earth in the morn seem to hang on its surface like smoke till dispersed by the sun that gilds over the corn within doors let us prattle and joke but when we see clear all the hues of the leaves and at work in the fields are all hands some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves let us carelessly strole over the lands how pleasing the sight of the toiling they make to collect what kind nature has sent heaven grant we may not of their labor partake but oh give us their happy content and sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook let us silently sit at our ease and there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook struggles hard to procure its release and now when the husbandman sings harvest home and the corns all got into the house when the long wished for time of their meeting is come to frolic and feast and carouse when the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed and are leaving the branches all bare either strewn at the roots shrivelled withered and dead or else blown to and fro in the air when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem and the axletrees ready to break while the waggoner whistles in stopping his team and then claps the poor jades on the neck in the morning let us follow the cry of the hounds or the fearful young covey beset which though skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds are becoming a prey to the net let us enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords still amused with these innocent sports nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords with their grand entertainments in courts in the evening when lovers are leaning on styles deep engaged in some amorous chat and it is very well known by his grin and her smiles what they both have a mind to be at to our dwelling though homely wellpleased to repair let our mutual endearments revive and let no single action or look but declare how contented and happy we live should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul let soft music the phantoms remove for it is harmony only has force to control and unite all the passions in love with her eyes but half open her cap all awry when the lass is preparing for bed and the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by sometimes rouzes and scratches his head in the night when it is cloudy and rainy and dark and the laborers snore as they lie not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark in the farm or the village hard by at the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this ere our eyes are closed up in their lids let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss

irelands pride a pudding too the prudent dame supplied their cheering beverage was a pint of port though small the quantum of the better sort but plenty of good beer both small and stout with wine of elder to prevent the gout the vicar hoped by such a various treat to tempt his scarfembellishd friend to eat with nicest bits provoked his guest to dine he carved the haddock and he served the wine content his own sharp stomach to regale with plain substantial roastmeat and mild ale our courtly chaplain as we may suppose at such oldfashioned commons curled his nose he tried in vain to piddle and in brief pishd at the pudding and declined the beef at length their homely dinner finished quite thus to the vicar spoke the priest polite  how can my brother in this paltry town  live undistinguished

preferment to your share will fall  a good fat living or perhaps  a stall these weighty reasons swayed the vicars mind  to town he hied but left his wife behind  next levee day he waited on his grace with hundreds more who bowed to get a place should in the crowd he stood amazed to see lords who to baal bent the supple knee and doctors sage he could not but admire who stooped profoundly low  to

blessed sick of the scene the vicar sought the door determined never to see london more but as his friend had pleased the hour to fix first went to dinner to my lords at six  he knocked  was ushered to the room of state my lord abroad and dinner served in plate which though it seemed but common soup and hash was really callipee and callipash the relics of the gaudy day before what indians eat and englishmen adore with bright champaign the courtier crowned the feast soothed his own pride and gratified his guest all this conspired our stoic to control and warpt the steady purpose of his soul

quest of prey wide over the forest winged his way whence every bird that haunts the glade or warbles in the rural shade dispersed in wild disorder flies before the tyrant of the skies a linnet feebler than the rest with weary wings and panting breast sought sylvias window in despair and fluttering craved protection there compassion touched the fair ones mind for female hearts are always kind upward the gliding sash she threw and in the little stranger flew there in her fragrant bosom pressed the nymph revives her drooping guest then danger over and all serene restores him to his fields again what wondrous joy what grateful love inspired the wanderer of the grove in unexpected life elate when now he recollects his fate and sets the friendly fair in view who gave him life and freedom too for gratitude to courts unknown and unreturnd by man alone wide through the winged creation reigns and dwells amidst the humble plains in every verdant field and shade the just the generous debt is paid back from the sylvan bower he hies to thank his dear deliverer flies and at her window chaunting stood her praise with all the zeal he could there lin his morning visits pays and there he tunes his evening lays there often the noonday hour prolongs and pours his little soul in songs his heavenly airs attention drew and sylvia soon the warbler knew then uses every charm to win and draw the wild musician in he enters fearless of a snare for how should fraud inhabit there and now by frequent visits free at first he perches on her knee then grown by long acquaintance bolder familiarly ascends her shoulder and wholly now devoid of fear plays with the pendant in her ear over all her neck and bosom strays and like a lover learns to teaze pecks on her hand and fondly sips delicious

night what gave the vagrant such delight strait to the beauteous bower they throng nor for admittance waited long the nymph whom every charm attends receives her new aerial friends with crumbled cake and fruitage feeds and feasts them on her choicest seeds did all that kindness could inspire to bring her coy acquaintance nigh her and linny now returns to pay the due devotions of the day when to his wondering eyes arose a numerous circle of his foes grief touched his soul to see them there but with a seeming easy air he took his place among the rest and sat an undistinguished guest alas how soon can time destroy the surest pledge of earthly joy a favourites flattering hopes defeat and tumble tyrants from their state for time indulgent but to few deposes kings  and linnets too he who was once the nymphs delight sits now neglected in her sight in vain to charm her ear he tries new forms engaged her ears and eyes the goldfinch spreads his gaudy coat and all were ravished with his note while none attends to linnys strain for ah poor linnys plumes were plain and now the mournful warbler flown the nymph and friendly bower their own over all reserve their spleen prevails and every tongue in concert rails all wondered what her eyes could see in such a worthless thing as he who still pursues his private ends ungrateful to his kindest friends one instance sure might serve to show him alas how little did they know him some then recounted all the arts he used to vanquish little hearts affirmed he still was making love and kept a miss in every grove could trifle with the meanest fowl nay offer courtship to an owl scandal though pointed in the dark is seldom known to miss its mark while few will interrupt its aim regardless of anothers fame even they by whom we once were loved through life for several years approved when spleen and envy rail aloud are often carried with the crowd preferring rather than contend to sacrifice their nearest friend thus sylvia yielded to the birds too complaisant to doubt their words nor thought that creatures so polite could deal in calumny and spite the injured linnet with their leaves for decency she still receives who though he sees his foes carest like some fond lover hopes the best and doubts his own discerning eyes but ah how obvious is disguise at length of hope itself bereft when now no friendly look was left and every mark of fondness fled he hung his wings and drooped his head and am i then resigned he says to such ungenerous foes as these by these defrauded of my bliss is all her kindness come to this yet ah my tongue

of my love which she seemed with soft pleasure to hear a blush like the blush of the dawn stole over her beautiful cheek smiles sweeter than infants newborn told more than i wished her to speak i stole from her hand a sweet kiss nor tried she to draw it away no description comes up to the bliss that reigns in my bosom to day methinks every zephyr that blows soft music conveys to my ear methinks every floweret that grows more blooming and fresh does appear the birds tune their musical throats and sing most delightfully sweet in soft and more delicate notes sweet echo my sighs does repeat ode to sensibility thanks to thee nymph whose powerful hand from dullness set me free thy praises i will for ever sing sweet sensibility thy touch so gentle and benign revives the torpid heart

luscious sweets of cloes nectard kiss by thee i laugh or cheerful sing and seize each transient bliss when cloe tunes her liquid voice or tries soft musics art by thee the sounds melodious pierce like lightning to the heart by thee the poets charming lays our various passions move now fire the soul with rage or melt to pity or to love by thee the scientific page the scholars eye delights by thee he

sable mantle clad yet winter art thou welcome to my eye thee here i hail though terrors round thee wait and winds tempestuous howl along the sky but shall i then so soon forget the days when ceres led me through her wheaten mines when autumn plucked me with his tawny hand empurpled clusters from ambrosial vines so soon forget when up the yielding pole i saw ascend the silverbearded hop when summer waving high her crown of hay poured over the mead her odoriferous crop i must forget them  and thee too o spring though many a chaplet thou have weaved for me for now prepared to quit the enchanting scenes cold weeping winter i come all to thee hail to thy rolling clouds and rapid storms though they deform fair natures lovely face hail to thy winds that sweep along the earth though trees they root up from their solid base how sicklied over is the face of things where is the spice kiss of the southern gale where the wild rose that smiled upon the thorn the mountain flower and lilly of the vale how gloomy it is to cast the eye around and view the trees disrobed of every leaf the velvet path grown rough with clotting showers and every field deprived of every sheaf how far more gloomy over the rainbeat heath alone to travel in the dead of night no twinkling star to gild the arch of heaven no moon to lend her temporary light to see the lightning spread its ample sheet discern the wild waste through its liquid fire to hear the thunder rend the troubled air as time itself and nature would expire and yet o winter has thy poet seen thy face as smooth and placid as the spring has felt with comfort felt the beam of heaven and heard thy valleys and thy woodlands ring what time the sun with burnished locks arose the long lost charms of nature to renew when pearls of ice bedecked the grassy turf and treetops floated in the silver dew father of heaven and earth this change is thine by thee the seasons in gradation roll thou great omniscient ruler of the world thou alpha and omega of the whole here humbly bow we down our heads to thee it is ours the voice of gratitude to raise thine to diffuse thy blessings over the land thine to receive the incense of our praise pure if

pleasing aspect wears toward the study then her footsteps tend where columns rise and sculptured arches bend here soothing melancholy holds her seat and contemplation seeks the loved retreat the

translation in which i was the more encouraged as i do not know of any other version but one by thomas twine doctor of physic printed in the year      and he i am sure is no powerful antagonist i shall not pretend to criticize upon my author but shall only observe by the way that i think him too fond of repetitions some of which i have hurried over and others i have entirely struck out  maphaeus vegius was born at lodi in the milaneze in the year   0  and was secretary of the briefs to pope martin the fifth and afterward datary he was likewise endowed with a canonry of st peters with which he was so well contented that he refused a rich bishopric pope eugenius the fourth and nicholas the fifth out of their regard for his learning and affection to his person continued him in his

a great conflagration that lays his city in ashes and is miraculously transformed into a bird called a heron latinus sends messengers to eneas with proposals of peace and a treaty of marriage with his daughter lavinia which are both accepted he comes to laurentum marries the daughter of the king and at his death succeeds him in the kingdom having first founded a city of his own which he names

ground the soul indignant rushing from the wound while eminent amid the gazing bands like mars himself the trojan victor stands groans thick in consort from the latians rise and every heart in every bosom dies as the tall wood bewails in hollow sound by storms impelled her honors on the ground now fixed in earth their spears the humbled foe rest on their swords and targets from them throw condemn the thirst of battle and abhor the dreaded fury of destructive war submit to all the conquror shall impose and pardon crave and end of all their woes as when two bulls inflamed with martial rage impetuous in the bloody fight engage to each his herd inclines who anxious wait the dubious conflict and their champions fate but one victorious to others dames in awe from their foiled chief their former faith withdraw they grieve indeed but join with one accord to share the fortunes of an happier lord so the rutulians struck with mighty dread though deep their sorrow for their leader dead yet now the phrygians glorious arms would join conducted by a leader so divine and a firm league of lasting peace implore that cruel war might vex their lives no more then striding over the foe the ghastly dead the trojan chief expostulating said  what madness seized thee daunian in the thought that we by heavens appointment hither brought here planted by the thunderers decree could from our mansions be expelled by thee oh rash the will celestial to oppose to anger jove and make the gods thy foes at length the utmost of thy rage is done against teucers race with breach of league begun lo

all his arms your hero i restore except the belt which erst young pallas wore that to his hoary sire i mean to send perhaps some comfort may the gift attend the sullen joy that slakd revenge bestows

his friends upon the sacred pyre by other flames begins his just returns and to the gods each holy altar burns observant ever of his countrys rites the mitred priest devoted heifers smites the clamorous swine increase the heaps of slain and milkwhite lambkins plead for life in vain forth from each victim are the entrails torn and piecemeal cut in sacred chargers borne they strip the fleecy mother of her pride and roasting fires the attendant throngs provide from deepmouthed urns they pour upon the shrine their due libations to the god of wine with grateful incense they the powers invoke

be firmly mine and trojan shall with latian blood combine from whose great mixture shall a nation spring to give the world one universal king whose wide domain shall stretch from pole to pole where earth is seen or mighty oceans roll then dear companions with thausonian band in peace and concord share this happy land the good latinus as your king obey for who more just more fit for regal sway this have i fixed by me be taught to dare the rough approaches of invasive war by me instructed suffer as you ought nor on the gods cast one unhallowed thought by heaven i swear my friends so often tried now wanton fortune combats on my side the toils you have suffered and the dangers past shall meet with ample usury at last so spoke the chief revolving in his mind the various fortunes that attend mankind rejoiced to see the objects of his care safe through his means from tempests rage and war as when a kite in many a whirling ring intent on blood comes stooping on the wing the anxious hen for her young brood in dread the fell destroyer hovering over their head whets her sharp bill the invader to engage and urged by fondness conquers lawless rage the tyrant flies nor yet her fears suppressed she calls each feathered wanderer to her breast there shields them close and counts them over and over and dangers overpast regards no more anchises son thus to his bands of troy by former woe enhances present joy the perils past of battle land and seas are sweet remembrance to an heart at ease for which the hero grateful homage pays to every god and hymns the thundrers praise the sad rutulians their dead leader bear and the last office for the chief prepare the clamorous sorrow catches all around latinus heard the melancholy sound presaging fears his anxious breast divide but when he saw the wound in turnus side he quickly caught the epidemic woe his bosom heaved his eyes in torrents flow in graceful guise he waved his sceptered hand and ordered silence to the intruding band who came in clusters thronging to the plain to view the features of the mighty slain as when the foaming boar whom dogs surround rips up their generous chief with mortal wound the howling pack about the hunter throng and seem to call him to avenge the wrong the well known signals of his hand and voice reduce their tumult and compose the noise latinus silenced thus the clamorous train and a dumb sorrow dwelt on all the plain the solemn pause the good old monarch broke and the big drops fell from him as he spoke  what scenes of various ills of care and strife await poor mortals on this sea of life pride finds in crowns her pleasures all complete deluded wretch to call a poison sweet ambition hastens to the dusty field can death can dangers soft contentment yield the example now is recent to your eyes young turnus fate should teach you to be wise beneath the glittering throne that bears a king are poniards hid and aspies dart their sting few few alas a monarchs cares behold he sighs in purple and repines in gold controlled to act against his own intent and when he sighs for peace to war consent  ah what availed mistaken turnus say to urge my people to the lawless fray to break that knot which sacred faith had tied and war against those with whom the immortals side twas with regret the sword of rage i drew for ah too well the consequence i knew often have i seen thee on thy bounding steed in burnished arms the willing nations lead as often my prayers have soothed thee from the plain but sober prudence counsels rage in vain  my cities thinnd are nodding to their fall each useless fortress weeps her ruined wall a sanguine dye once happier rivers yield and latian coursers whiten every field ah me what scenes attend latinus age grief devastation war despair and rage  farewell once more ah turnus where is now that warmth for glory and that awful brow that pleasing face by youth more pleasing dressed now shocks the sight that once charmed every breast ah me what horrors shall on daunus wait when he shall hear his turnus rigid fate what stings of sorrow shall his bosom tear and ardeas sons their monarchs grief shall share yet soiled with dust and grim with clotted blood cleanse the pale corse in yonder silver flood perhaps some ease his fathers heart may feel to know he sunk beneath an heros steel he spoke and wept and turning to the train they raise the body off the dusty plain placed on a bier to ardeas walls they tend a horrid present to a sire to send shields horses swords the prizes of the war are borne aloft next moves the rattling car still wet with phrygian blood metiscus now moves slowly on and sorrow clouds his brow metiscus born to tame the generous steed does in procession turnus courser lead the noble beast who never before knew fear now shakes and drops the sympathizing tear full often had he his daring master led where the war thundered and the nations bled to death to danger never known to yield the pride the fear the glory of the field inverted arms the follwing legions bear and stuieks of sorrow pierce the yielding air through nights dull shade they march while latiums king deep in his palace feels keen sorrows sting foresees strange horrors widows maids and wives young men and old all anxious for their lives join in one shrill complaint thus surges roar when pressed by winds they break upon the shore nor yet had daunus heard his son no more should cheer his age or what his army bore in sullen pomp approaching ardeas walls another grief the pensive monarch calls for while the latins had engaged in fight and warlike turnus gloried in his might involving flames had seized his native land and ardeas town was levelled to the sand beyond the stars ascending sparkles fly and gleamy horror blazes through the sky so willed the gods perhaps the crumbling wall in omen dread predicted turnus fall the affrighted citizens in dread array through flames and death pursue their dubious way the shrieks of matrons witness their despair and clouds of smoke involve the darkning air as careful ants for future wants provide where an old oak presents her riven side but if the ax the sheltering timber wound or bring its leafy honors to the ground among the crowd what cares tumultuous rise this way and that the sable cohort flies or as the tortoise broiling on the fire when on her back unable to retire with head with feet with tail declares her pain and tries all strength and stratagem in vain thus ardeas sons beset with perils round and wild confusion no deliverance found when from amid the flames was seen to rise with clapping wings a fowl that cuts the skies twas ardea ardea the latin name for a heron or hern  but transformed and she ever while with turrets crowned and many a stately pile now given the citys name and mark to bear on ample pinions flits around in air fixed with dismay the astonished vulgar gaze nor further fly to shun the dreadful blaze but who a monarchs sorrows can relate a monarch trembling for his countrys fate doomed tales of fresh affliction soon to know doomed to a sad variety of woe the solemn train approaches now too near and turnus corse beheld upon the bier black torches so their countrys rites demand each sad attendant carries in his hand a general sorrow seizes all the crowd the timorous matrons in afflictions loud pierce heavens blue arch their flowing garments tear beat their soft breasts and rend their flowing hair but when the father heard his turnus slain he seemed a statue fixed upon the plain but soon his sorrows found a different way he flies like lightning where the body lay the breathless corse he held in grapples fast and tonguetyd long by grief found words at last  my son my son my ages last relief thy fires late glory now his cause of grief prop of my age and guardian of my throne which totters to its fall now thou art gone comfort no more her healing balm will shed my turnus falls and daunus peace is fled are these the trophies of thy vast renown are these the glories of an added crown are these the honors of extended power o fortune giddy as the whirling hour man builds up schemes for her to overturn we grasp at sceptres and possess an urn and thou who lately a whole nations joy did drive thy thunders on the sons of troy now lie an empty form of lifeless clay our hope no longer nor the foes dismay no more that tongue shall listening crowds persuade no more that face shall charm each gazing maid no more that form shall catch the admiring view those eyes no more their luster shall renew thy port majestic no one now shall prize in arts of peace ah turnus vainly wise mars cropd thy honors in their vernal bloom and every virtue withers on thy tomb urged on to war too eager in thy hate thou rushed to sight and halfway met thy fate o death relentless thy unerring blow strikes down the great and lays the haughty low kings princes people his dread rigor fear and shrink to dust when he approaches near insatiate power among the old and young each day over whom thy sable stole is flung could not thy hand arrestone single dart that through a sons has rivd a parents heart amata happy now at endless rest thy slaughtered son moves not thy quiet breast say say ye powers have i yet more to dread what drive ye next on this devoted head ye cropd my blossom in his earliest spring and blazing ardea flutters on the wing yet what is ardea for my child i moan the loss of him is every loss in one some woe superior was for me decreed i have it now and am a wretch indeed when once the fates have marked their destined prey each various ill pursues him on his way this way and that the fainting wretch is hurled the sport of heaven and pity of the world no more he said but down his reverend cheeks in scalding streams the briny torrent breaks thick groans distend his breast his eye balls stare and all his looks are horror and despair so when a fawn is from thembowring grove trussed by the bird of thunderbearing jove the hapless mother shakes with deadly fear and gives what aid she can a fruitless tear now from the portals of the rosy sky the morn arising earth born vapors fly when good latinus finding that twas vain to try the fortunes of the warlike plain for his pale legions shudderd at the word and almost wished to call eneas lord he much revolved of former breach of vows the truce infringed and longdisputed spouse at length a solemn embassy is sent a thousand men select for that intent commissioned these the virtuous chief timplore to waste laurentum with his arms no more to quiet hostile rage amongst the bands and visit friendly old latinus lands with these went sages versed in wisdoms lore well skilled to plead and princes stand before instructed to declare their kings desire to accomplish what the awful gods require and as they willed that troy and latiums blood should flow commingld in one common flood he yielded gladly to their wise decree and wished the dardans and their chief to see mean while latinus cheers the anxious crew relates his measures and his pious view hope swells their bosoms and expels their fears the news in transport all ausonia hears now the glad city rings with peals of joy and all prepare to meet the sons of troy not in the plain in warfare to contend but as to meet a brother or a friend the royal court is decked with double care worthy the chief who shall be shortly there the appointed envoys reach the camp designed their reverend heads fair olivebranches bind of peace the token and their tongues no less of friendly talk the full intent profess within his palace venus godlike son with kind demeanor welcomes every one to whom thus drances drances first in age and who against turnus nourished endless rage  o trojan chief thy phrygias chiefest boast in virtue first and mightiest of the host our royal master swears by all the powers hear me immortals in your heavenly bowers that against his will the treaties sworn he broke or did to fight your valiant bands provoke but inly wished to gratify the choice the gods had made by his assenting voice to give his daughter to thy longing arms lavinia famed for virtue as for charms but if stern rage has turned his view aside if seas of blood have flowed on either side if madding fury reason over came o powerful chief let turnus bear the blame his busy mind disdained all peace and rest and floods of gall oerflowd his rancrous breast long our latinus steadfastly denied to lend his troops and against his will complied even then our armies wished the frantic boy would yield obedience to the chief of troy our monarch too requesting nations joined but say can reason bend the stubborn mind can human reason hope for weight or force when not the gods could turn his impious course in dire portents they spoke their will in vain his rage renews he hurries to the plain where his reward the daring caitiff found oerborn by thee he bites the bloody ground ah wicked youth in tartarus black shade contract new nuptials with some stygian maid if rage and fury still be thy delight in acheron display thy skill in fight but thou the happy heir of latiums throne whom all our people their protector own whose ample praises are with rapture sung whose glorious deeds untie the infants tongue our youth our sages and each sober dame with one accord all celebrate thy name that turnus fell by thee we all rejoice believe not me but hear a nations voice on thee the latians turn an eye of joy latinus waits thee o thou son of troy forbear a while to seek the shades of night in full expectance of the nuptial rite so shall the italian and the phrygian race join in one stock which time shall never efface then haste great chief thy conduct be our care to gain those honors thou wast born to wear he said the shouting bands his sense approve and former hate gives way to newborn love to which the pious hero smiling kind thus spoke the gentle dictates of his mind  the rage of combats and past scenes of woe ye and your king are guiltless of i know turnus alone provoked the martial strife lavish of blood and prodigal of life a raging passion for delusive fame too often we find the youthful breast inflame then tell your king his will shall be obeyed with rapture i embrace the latian maid and peace eternal swear nor till the powers have stopped the course of good latinus hours shall his imperial sceptres grace these hands but born a king he still shall rule these lands another city shall my trojans found where added household gods shall bless the ground lavinias name shall grace the rising town and equal laws united bands shall own may love and friendship spread through all the host and troy and latium in one name be lost what now remains but with a pious care to burn those corses that infect the air sad victims of the war whose ravenous hand smites mighty heroes and destroys a land that business done tomorrows sun shall guide the happy lover to his blooming bride he said the attentive people round him gaze his virtues charm them and they shout his praise now see the busy legions all around trees crackling fall and axes loud resound with holy zeal they shape the different pyres and high to heaven ascend the curling fires thick clouds of smoke mount slowly to the sky a thousand sheep appointed victims die the blood of swine impurples all the plain and in the flames they cast the heifers slain no more the field is loaded with the dead and noisy shouts around the plain are spread at length the sun diffused his golden ray and all prepared to hasten on their way eneas first his fiery steed bestrode and at his side the reverend drances rode who much bespoke the chief the next to sight ascanius came in youthful honors bright the good aletes deeply worn with age ilioneus and mnestheus worthy sage serestus and sergestus passed along and valiant gyas and cloanthus strong in bands commixd the follwing troops succeed for so the friendly leaders had decreed now on laurentums wall a gaping train viewed the procession moving over the plain each citizen exults with inward joy to think the sword no longer shall destroy latinus from the town a certain way with chosen friends to meet the trojan lay nor could the crowd the godlike chief conceal the mighty prince his actions all reveal high over the rest in graceful pomp he trod each action spoke the offspring of a god thus met the leader of the latian band addressed the chief and pressed his friendly hand  at length thou glory of the trojan race my hopes complete for i behold thy face to me at length the happy hour is given to clasp the choicest favorite of heaven with joy to yield to the divine decree that here has fixed a resting place for thee long tossed through perils here thy rigors cease these lands these happy lands enjoy in peace though furious rage that knows not ever to yield though jove should frown has drenched with blood the field though lawless license armed her harpy claws and wildly boasted violated laws yet i alas unwillingly complied with tears not blood latinus steel was died deceived my legions fought and he who most in joves despite attacked thy pious host now lies a carcass on the barren sand victim of heaven and of thy mighty hand no more the trumpet shall awake to arms thy martial soul that bends to hymens charms some realms i have and towns my own i call fit for defense and girdld with a wall yet of all objects that my soul engage lavinias chief the comfort of my age she and her charms o mighty son be thine in this embrace i the sweet maid resign dear to my soul thy virtues i adore sprung from my loins i could not love thee more to whom eneas when that reverend head meets my glad sight by hoary time overspread i soon conclude that battles stubborn rage was never the option of thy prudent age if thou have fears oh give them to the wind in thee oh monarch i a father find believe thy son whener that form i view the thoughts of good anchises rise anew again his figure in full sight appears and filial duty melts me into tears now to the palace hastes the royal pair the latian crowd confess the strangers fair maids women boys and hoary sires combine to praise the beauties of their guests divine but chief eneas struck their wondrous eyes his fair demeanor and superior size caught every gazer and sincere their praise attends the chief who bless with peace their days as when long rains have drenched the genial plain in gloomy sadness sits each pensive swain with arms infolded and dejected brow the farmer weeps his unavailing plow but clad in splendour should the sun arise and pour his golden glories through the skies they haste exulting to their honest care and wound earths bosom with the crooked share so the ausonians lulled their mind to ease and shout and revel at the approach of peace latinus now had reached the palace gate eneas joins iulus swells the state trojans italians march in pomp along and the court brightens with a noble throng by matrons circled and by virgins led appeared the partner of eneas bed her eyes like stars diffused a luster round her modest eyes she rivets to the ground soon as the trojan saw the beauteous maid he gazed he loved and thus in secret said  i blame not turnus thy ambitious rage for such a prize whod not in war engage to taste such beauties such transcendent charms kings rouse the nations and the worlds in arms the sacred priest fast by the altar stands and joins in marriagebond their plighted hands with peals of joy the vaulted roofs resound and hymeneal songs are wafted all around and now achates by his prince foretaught from out the camp the various presents brought vests worked with gold which hectors consort gave ere yet the greeks had crossed the briny wave a collar too whose gems emitted flame and once the honor of the princely dame nor was forgot a bowl insculpturd high pondious to bear and beauteous to the eye which on anchises board did whilom blaze the gift of priam in his happier days this for latinus good achates brings such royal presents kings may send to kings but the gay robes and collars radiant pride are justly destined for the blooming bride now converse sweet and joy without allay deceives the winged hours and closes day the genial feast is served in sumptuous state for luxury at times becomes the great on purple couches all the nobles lie the taught attendants wait attentive by from crystal urns are living waters poured and every dainty loads the regal board bright ceres here provides her gifts divine and the red god bestows his choicest wine with eye attentive every waiter stands and flies to execute each guests commands this serves the chargers that the mantling bowl and crowds in billows seem to wave and roll latinus near iulus at the board heard him with transport and devoured each word for in the godlike youth at once combined the grace of feature with the worth of mind his manly talk his observations sage bespoke a judgment riper than his age nor could the king withold his honest praise  take this embrace thou wonder of thy days thrice blessed eneas sure the gods conspire to make each son add luster to the sire the banquet ended some their talk employ on grecian battles and the fall of troy now of laurentums broils what shrinking bands fled from the foe or dared opposers hands who first broke through the ranks with furious force and through the slaughter urged his foaming horse but much eneas and latinus told of latiums ancient deeds and heros old how saturn flying from his offsprings rage in fair hesperia hid his hoary age hence latium called he taught to raise the vine and the forced earth her bounties to resign a wandering race and mountainbred he tamed by arts improved them and with laws reclaimed again jove seeks his fathers realms to taste electras beauties and the dame embraced whence dardanus was born his brothers slain by his own hand he fled across the main from corythus he fled with numerous bands and safely settled on the phrygian lands proud of his birth he in his banner bore the bird of jove which after hector wore much fame he won which time shall never destroy the immortal founder of imperial troy to choral airs the highroofd palace rings the torches blaze the minstrel sweeps the strings trojan and latians to the sound advance and mingle friendly in the mazy dance for thrice three days in revelry and joy they drowned their cares at length the chief of troy to other tasks directs his curious eyes marked out by plows shall destined cities rise here form they trenches there dig ditches wide when strange to say the phrygian leader spied a blazing glory round lavinias head which to the sky its flamy honors spread he stood aghast nor knew what meant the sign but thus his prayer addressed o king divine of men and gods if ever my trojan bands have unrepining followed thy commands still through all perils or by land or sea to thee have prayed have sacrificed to thee if i have led them to these pious deeds explain this omen that belief exceeds ah may no dire portent our peace oppose be ended here o jove our various woes while thus he prayed his mother lay concealed behind a cloud but soon to sight revealed thus sooths her son thy doubts and cares give over interpret right the happiness in store the gods predict peace spreads her olive wand and buxom plenty crowns the laughing land the lambient glories round lavinia seen portend the godlike issue of the queen from her a mighty race of chiefs shall rise whose fame immortal shall ascend the skies the vanquished world with pride shall wear their chain realms far divided by the seas in vain this flame great jove from high olympus sent fame yet reserved is marked by this portent her share of honors let lavinia claim call thy new city by her happy name thy household gods escaped from burning troy shall in these walls a double peace enjoy with pious awe their kindly love revere for know they ever shall inhabit here with such affection for these realms they burn that forced from hence again they shall return no other climes their godheads deign to bless then my best son thy happiness confess over trojan bands thy legal sway maintain till good latinus seeks the elysian plain then double scepters shall my offspring grace ruler of troy and latiums hardy race one common law shall bind them all in one no fell division and distinction none yet mark o mark what still remains for thee the gods consenting fixed the kind decree thy days spun out thou shall not mix with earth more honors claim thy virtues and thy birth it is thine to enter in the blessed abodes vanquish proud fate and mingle with the gods she spoke and quickly darting from the sight streaked the thin either with a trail of light the hero stood revolving in his mind the various bounties which the powers designed peace crowned his days latinus yields to fate the pious trojan rules the happy state full wide extends his undisputed sway and all alike one common king obey their rites their customs and their will the same as citizens they share one general name and now the mother of each smiling love prostrate and trembling at the throne of jove bespoke the god almighty sire of heaven to whom the ruling of the world is given who readst mankind and see the hearts intent ere yet the lips have given the secret vent thy sacred promise let a goddess claim a goddess pleading for the trojan name did thou not vow in pity of their woes to ease their sufferings by a blessed repose nor can i tax thy promise made in vain three years has peace beheld this happy plain yet think o jove to sooth a mothers care there yet remains a seat in heaven to spare for great eneas who transcends all praise speak thy decree thine humbler suppliant raise past mortal strength his growing virtues rise too great for earth he ripens for the skies to whom the mighty power with looks serene but first he raised and kissed the cyprian queen  thy mighty son and all his powerful bands that

with an ardor divine that thy brows may the laurel with justice still claim and the temple of liberty mount thee to fame if it ever can give pleasure to know my career when proud london i left with intentions so queer accept it in verse on the very first day when the queen of warm passions precedes the fair may when so custom prescribes and to follow old rules one half of mankind makes the other half fools from the town i first breathed in i sallied in haste through highgate and finchley and barnet i passed at st albans i dined with a laughing gay crew not complete was the set without tucker and you where the dunstable eighth of our harries deserted his mate and procured a full sentence against his old kate our brisk company supped while our wine gave a spring and though at the crown we never thought of the king the morrow succeeding i got from my bed as a sheet all the roads were with snows overspread but the gods who will never abandon a poet as often has been said condescended to show it in a coach and six horses the storm i defied and left by my friends through the tempest i ride newportpannel received me and gave me a dinner and a bed at northampton was pressed by a sinner no signs of fair weather the west chester coach at nine the next morning a welcome approach presents fresh example i traveled all day at crick eat my dinner at coventry lay i tremble whenever i reflect on the roads that lead to those dirty wormeaten abodes where a lady godiva woman rode naked their taxes to clear and a tailor for peeping paid damnably dear for a parliament was held here in the reign of henry iv called parliamentum indoctorum another in henry vi called diabo two parliaments famed which intail a disgrace and have left their foul manners to poison the place next morning the fun with a face of red hue had cleared up the expanse and arrayed it in blue when i left the vile town against which ever i will rail while meriden is famous for ale meriden offers no humble regale but near mixal park dined at house of mean fame and at night to the campus cadaverum was the ancient name for litchfield on account of a prosecution there in the days of dioclesian field of slain carcasses came though full old are thy towers yet receive my just praise may thy ale be recorded and live in my lays thy gothic cathedral new homage still claims nor refuse i thy due though repaired by king james king james ii  i forgot to advise you the sky being clear twas at coventry first i ascended my chair but alas on the morrow how dismal the sight for the day had assumed all the horrors of night the clouds their gay visage had changed to a frown and in a white mantle clothed litchfields old town but at noon all was over when intrepid and bold as a trainband commander or falstaff of old and proudly defying the wind and the snow when the danger was passed i determined to go at stone i reposed but at ousley i dined when our reckoning was cheap and the landlord was kind next morning we sallied and staffordshire lost but not ill entertained by a cestrian host on the banks of the wever at namptwich renowned for an excellent brine pit our dinner we found the wine was not bad though the ale did displease and an unctuous desert was served up of old cheese but as time will not tarry our course we resume and general st georges dragoons were marching up to london and a party of them just came in when we were leaving it st georges dragoons take their seats in our room so traveling onwards with pleasure we see old caerleon so famous over looking the dee four days there we rested and blithsome and gay forgot the bad weather we met on the way then old chester farewell till i see thee again and can stroll through thy streets the streets of chester have shops on each side covered over which if not beautiful to the eye at least preserve one from the rain without dreading the rain may thy river people are now employed to make the river dee navigable up to the town still swell better pleased with his charge than when edgar was rowed by eight kings in his barge be the maidens all virtuous who drink of thy tide and each virgin in bloom be affiancd a bride may the heart and the hand at the altar be joined and no matron complain that a husbands unkind let their bounty to strangers refound in each song be robert barnstone esquire who used me with the utmost hospitality barnstone their copy they cannot go wrong over the cuts of the river our tract we pursue and old flint in the prospect now rises to view how strange to behold here our language is fled to converse with these peoples to talk to the dead and a turk or chinese is as well understood by these roisters who boast of cadwalladars blood as an englishman here who is certainly undone if he thinks to make use of the language of london from flint we depart with our landlord and guide who showed us that kindness which courts never tried the castle where it was at this place that richard was prevailed upon to resign the crown richard his grandeur laid down and betrayed his own life by surrendring the crown now the holywell well we survey where st winifred patroness of wales a virgin of old to all flame but religions was lifeless and cold when in vain princely cradoc had offered his bed the merciless heathen even choppd off her head hence the stones are distained with the color of blood and each cripple is cured who will bathe in the flood thus the rankest absurdity brain can conceive superstition imposes and crowds will believe turn from legends and nonsense to see a gay sight where the the vale of clewyn meadows of clewyn the senses delight and excuse that i aim not to point out the place lest my numbers too lowly the landscape disgrace at rhydland we dine and a castle we view whose founder i would name if the founder i knew but our host gives the word and we hurry away lest the length of the journey outrun the short day now ascend penmenrose oh beware as you rise what a prospect of horror what dreadful surprise see that height more sublime which no footsteps ever tried there the ocean roars loudly how awful his pride how narrow the path observe where you tread nor stumble the feet nor grow dizzy the head if you slip not mankind can avert your sad doom dashed against the rough rocks and the sea for your tomb the danger is past and now conways broad beech fatigued and dismayed with great gladness we reach in a leaky old boat we were wafted safe over though two drunkards our steersmen to the opposite shore here the town and the river are both of a name and boast the first edward who raised her to fame there a supper was ordered which no one could touch this too little was boiled and that roasted too much to his chamber full hungry each pilgrim retreats and forgets his lost meal twixt a pair of welsh sheets a castle hard by i with pleasure behold which kings had long dwelt in or giants of old but the daw and each nightbird now builds up her nest and with clamours and shrieks the old mansion infest we wakened at four and our host left us here as the worst ways were past so but small was our fear we followed our route and crossed penmenmaursside where the prudent will walk but the bolder will ride still above us old rocks seem to threaten a fall and present to spectators the form of a wall now bangor we reach oh if ever thou had fame though lawn sleeves thou bestowst on my life it is a shame there we cross over an arm of the sea and carouse on the opposite shore at an excellent house through angleseas island we rattle our chaise while the goats all in wonder seem on us to gaze for be pleased to observe and with diligence note that twas here first in wales that i met with a goat over roads rough and craggy our journey we sped nor baited again till we reached holyhead the next day at noon in the wyndham we sail and the packet danced brisk with a prosperous gale we at ten past the dublin bar bar in the wherry confined which swims on no water and sails with no wind till near two we sat cursing in vain they may row not a snail is so sluggish nor tortoise so slow till a boat took us in and at length set us down at the quay of st george in st patricks chief town thence i wrote to my friend nor believe what those say or too fond to find fault or too wantonly gay who with taunts contumelious this island oerload as with bogs and with blunders and nonsense full stowed for believe me they live not unblessed with good air and their daughters are beauteous and sons debonair here though bacchus too often displays his red face yet minerva he holds in the strictest embrace nor the maiden is coy every charm to resign and the ivy and laurel peep forth from the vine thus i have told you in verse the whole progress i took as true as if sworn in full court on the book let me know how in london you measure your time twill be welcome in prose but twice welcome in rhyme the answer london aug         dear sir your kind itinerary letter has rendered me so deep your debtor that if in your own coin of wit you look for payment you will be bit in that i scarce can pay a part then take for all a grateful

god yet all to reach the arduous summit try from soaring pope to reptile ogleby among the rest your friend attempts to climb but ah how different poesy and rhyme the midnight bard reciting to his bell who breaks our rest and tolls the muses knell is just a poet matchless and divine as he a raphael who on alehouse sign seats his bold george in attitude so quaint that none can tell the dragon from a saint reckon each sand in wide new market plain mount yon blue vault and count the starry train but numbers never can comprehend the throng of retail dealers in the art of song like summer flies they

carefully skim while the scum as it is called rises up to the brim the fourth part of a pint you next must allow of new milk made as warm as it comes from the cow put the rinds of the lemons the milk and the syrup with the rum in a jar and give em a stir up and if you approve it you may add some perfume goastone or whatever you like in its room let it stand thus three days  but remember to shake

shenstone esquire by the same i come shepherds well follow the hearse well see our loved corydon laid though sorrow may blemish the verse yet let a sad tribute be paid they called him the pride of the plain in sooth he was gentle and kind he marked on his elegant strain the graces that glowed in his mind ii on purpose he planted yon trees that birds in the covert might dwell he cultured his thyme for the bees but never would rifle their cell ye lambkins that played at his feet go bleat  and your master bemoan his music was artless and sweet his manners as mild as your own iii no verdure shall cover the vale no bloom on the blossoms appear the sweets of the forest shall fail and winter discolor the year no birds in our hedges shall sing our hedges so vocal before since he that should welcome the spring can greet the gay season no more iv his phillis was fond of his praise and poets came round in a throng they listened  they envied his lays but which of them equaled his song ye shepherds henceforward be mute for lost is the pastoral strain so give me my corydons flute and thus  let me break it in twain melody by the same i lightsome as conveyed by sparrows love and beauty crossed the plains flights of little pointed arrows love dispatched among the swains but so much our shepherds dread him spoiler of their peace profound swift as scudding fawns they fled him frighted though they felt no wound ii now the wanton god grown slier and for each fond mischief ripe comes disguised in pans attire tuning sweet an oaten pipe echo by the winding river doubles his deluding strains while the boy conceals his quiver from the slow returning swains iii as palemon unsuspecting praised the sly musicians art love his light disguise rejecting lodged an arrow in his heart cupid will enforce your duty shepherds and would have you taught those that timid fly from beauty may by melody be caught
