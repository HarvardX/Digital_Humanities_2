thomas and sally or the sailors return  price one shilling  thomas and sally or the sailors return a musical entertainment as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden the music composed by doctor arne  london printed for g kearsly at the golden lion in ludgate street and j coote at the kings arms in paternoster row mdcclxi  preface the public has made so little difficulty hitherto in swallowing nauseous or at best insipid verses when they have been wrapped up in agreeable music that to offer a word either by way of defense or apology for the following trifle seems altogether unnecessary  it will be easily believed that the author did not write it with a view to acquire the reputation of a genius he must be a simpleton indeed who hopes to give people an idea of his wealth by showing them a handful of farthings he wrote it merely to comply with the request of a theatrical person whom he had an inclination to oblige it was designed and finished in somewhat less than a fortnight and his excuse for now suffering it to appear in print and he really thinks such an excuse necessary must be the nature of a musical entertainment which requires that the words should be put into the hands of the audience who would otherwise find it impossible to accompany the performers in what they sing upon the stage  he is no stranger to the whimsical prejudice which inclines most people to measure the worth of dramatic pieces by their length and because a musical entertainment is unavoidably the shortest of any makes them for that reason deny its being capable of any degree of merit at all but though what he here ventures into the world is neither a tragedy a comedy or even so much as a comedy of two acts he flatters himself there are some few who will not condemn it merely because it is not what it was not designed for he hopes they will consider that when he sat down to write it he sat down to write a musical entertainment and that a certain poet and critic who is allowed to have been a tolerable judge in such matters has told us no author can compass more than he intends  if after this any persons have an inclination to find fault with it they are heartily welcome nay he will so far subscribe to their opinion as to confess there are some as bad lines in it as the worst dablers in singsong ever were guilty of but he thought it needless to correct them as every thing of this kind must be castrated in order to make it perfectly musical and stretched and altered to fit the shape of the stage however he would certainly point out the exceptionable lines to show he is not ignorant of them but that he takes it for granted there will be people enough ready to save him that trouble  thus far by way of preface which the author has written only because he is assured there is nothing so acceptable to the purchasers of any thing in the form of a book now adays as a reasonable pennyworth in print and paper and he had a mind to avail himself of the advantages attending an additional halfsheet  for the same reason too he might possibly have attempted a dedication but unfortunately the only personages likely to patronize his performance are united in a particular society and he was at a loss in what manner to order their titles so as to make a proper blazon at the head of a page however in this place he would be understood to inscribe the following rhimes to those vagrant choiresters who like the bards of old sing verses about the public streets and if when they have thought proper to advance the following ballads to a place in the chimneysweepers garland the sweethearts delight or any other of their ingenious collections they should through their novelty and the prevailing argument of playhouse tunes be the means of rendering more reasonable in their demands those grinders of the muses who have the conscience to expect six and thirty pretty songs in one book for a halfpenny he shall think the time and pains they cost him in composing very well bestowed  to conclude the author thinks there is no doubt on account of the music which is admirable and the performance which will be excellent but this little piece must come off well upon the stage but after having been acquitted there he foresees some busy people will be for bringing it before the judges in the court of criticism now he applies himself to the said judges requiring them to consider all such proceedings as arbitrary at least if not unprecedented he desires that they will suffer the insignificancy of this piece to screen it from their cognizance and that they will not attempt to break a butterfly upon a wheel  dramatis personae men the squire mr beard thomas mr mattocks women sally miss brent dorcas mrs vernon scene the country  thomas and sally or
