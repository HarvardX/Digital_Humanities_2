the platonic wife a comedy  as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by a lady  london printed for w johnston in ludgate street j dodsley in pall mall and t davies in russel street mdcclxv  to her grace the duchess of bedford this piece is most humbly inscribed by her graces much obliged most grateful and obedient servant  the author  advertisement the hint of this piece was taken from one of the contes moraux of marmontel styled lhereux divorce the foible ridiculed in the tale is perhaps the only one imputed to our sex which has never yet been exposed by a theatrical representation it is a simplicity not a coquetry it is the error of a delicate and elevated mind unacquainted with the manners of real life or the general frame of the human heart  the novel was too barren of incident to furnish out an entertainment for the stage which obliged me to contrive an entire underplot and introduce several new characters into the comedy which i shall not take up the readers time to point out here and submit this performance to the candor and clemency of the public after having perhaps too adventurously hazarded their criticism and censure  prologue sent by an

the platonic wife act i scene i a drawing room lady fanshaw and clarinda discovered clarinda i rejoice to find that your ladyships good nature is as much delighted as mine at lady franklands happy escape from the galling chain of matrimony   lady fanshaw why really clarinda i look upon it that next to the felicity of widowhood is that of being separated however there are my dear some material differences while the tyrant lives to whom we have been bound we never can forget we have been slaves there are besides some other disagreeable circumstances which attend a separation from which thank heaven my state is free   clarinda you mean i suppose the power a husband has of withdrawing alimony in case of indiscretion and forcing the wretched wife upon certain moyens de vivre whether she will or no   lady fanshaw true now you know that since that gothic statute of the blackram in the northwest riding has been abolished we widows may choose what hobbyhorse we please sometimes for variety perhaps an ass but oh defend me from a mule it is so vastly like a husband   clarinda oh the happiest simile in the world for on my conscience they seem equally to be deviations from the laws of nature however when broke from restiveness they are the best packsaddle amblers in the world   lady fanshaw but now my dear clarinda that we have got this pretty little bird out of its cage what think you will it do with its freedom it is vastly wild and will i imagine take flight to some arcadian grove and sit and sing alone   clarinda o no that must not be it would disgrace our generalship she dies for sentimental passion and when once her romance is known i warrant we shall be able to supply her with pretenders enough who may assume by turns the crook and scrip the helmet and the lance to hold her in play nay piqued as she was at what she styled lord franklands indifference toward her i am persuaded that if one tender tear had but glistened in his eye at the instant of their separation she would have sunk into his arms and like the plaintive turtle have moaned and cooed away the remainder of her life in true conjugal insipidity   lady fanshaw i am surprised this did not happen for i am quite of opinion that lord frankland loves her   clarinda he certainly does but then he did not deify her my lord knows himself to be a mere mortal man and has not the presumption of lxion to cope with goddesses   lady fanshaw he once i think admired you clarinda it was thought you liked him too how happened you to escape the noose   clarinda platonics lady fanshaw all platonics so vulgar a notion as matrimony never once i believe entered either of our heads and i dare swear he wishes now that he had never changed his mind since in that article   lady fanshaw it is possible he may and that at length tired with the pettishness of a spoiled child he may return and throw his devoirs again at the feet of one who will at least treat him like a reasonable creature   clarinda i dare not indulge the hope but i shall endeavor though to lay every obstacle in the way to their reunion lady frankland is young and handsome she may be virtuous too but how long that same fortress called chastity will hold out when besieged by flattery the love of which is her chief foible i cannot say   lady fanshaw why just as long clarinda as any other fortress where the governor loves money and the besiegers come up to his price but among those who either are or pretend to be her adorers i cannot yet perceive that she has shown the smallest preference and i really believe that she admires alexander cyrus or orondates more than any man alive   clarinda perhaps she may think so too but be assured lady fanshaw that any person who ardently desires to inspire a romantic passion is not unsusceptible of a natural one and when that takes place she will even act an old proverb and accept of the living dog instead of the dead lion   lady fanshaw but come my dear clarinda and let us attend the levee of this eccentric comet which like other blazing stars perhaps glitters but to fall  exeunt scene ii a dressing room lord frankland gazing on a female picture lord frankland thou beauteous shade of that angelic form whose wild caprices have destroyed my peace i could for ever gaze upon thee as lord townly says why did i marry oh rather say why did i quit my charge deputed as i was her virtues guard  enter mr frankland mr frankland good morning to your lordship   lord frankland good morrow charles   mr frankland i grieve to find your lordships contemplations still fixed upon that gloomy subject   lord frankland and wherefore should they not why gloomy charles look with what innocence she smiles upon me and sure that painting is the portrait of her heart   mr frankland i have not the least doubt of lady franklands innocence or virtue but surely my lord it were a childish folly to cast our plaything from us then sit and mourn its loss   lord frankland i have not done so charles i have thrown a diamond in a flaming furnace if it escape without a crack or flaw its value then is proved   mr frankland ay if it does my lord   lord frankland why should you doubt it charles i know her merits and her foibles too  her real love of virtue with her fond wishes to inspire a vain romantic passion   mr frankland and can you think my lord that to obtain so fair so rich a prize there are not men who will assume the semblance of a more romantic passion than even your lordship feels   lord frankland perditions in that thought oh charles had i but shown the thousandth part of that fond love i feel for lady frankland this fatal separation never had happened  enter ambrose ambrose i have been my lord to inquire lady franklands health and was answered by her woman that her ladyship had sat up late reading a new romance that she had wept much and slept little but was in tolerable health this morning   lord frankland may each new morn fresh from its downy wings shed health and happiness around her order my chariot ambrose and see that all things are got ready for my departure this morning i shall go to belleveue for how long i know not perhaps air exercise and change of objects may throw off this sad weight  exit ambrose mr frankland shall i accompany your lordship   lord frankland no charles you seem to have some doubts of lady franklands conduct i would have you therefore be a witness to it for my part i have none your intimacy with emilia who now lives with my wife will furnish you with sufficient opportunities to know every step she takes and i shall thank you with true gratitude to deal with strictest justice  exit mr frankland ay toward myself i will this poor weak man has parted from his wife for wishing he should love her and now sits pining at yon babyface and longs to have the limbs to it again but should that happen he may perhaps get others which must contract and cripple mine counselor frankland with four hundred pounds a year and that dipped up to the chin too is but a poor lover sor emilia with fifteen hundred but the same man heir to lord franklands rank and fortune sounds well enough therefore the case stands thus my bird is almost caught and shall i loose the string and let it fly to lure his to the nest again where it may sit and breed while i am whistled down the wind to prey at fortune  exit scene iii an

where thought meets thought ere from the lips they part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be  heigh ho why cannot i repeat the rest dear unhappy eloise but oh far more unhappy lady frankland she had experienced those transports she so feelingly describes whilst i unhappy i with all the tenderness of fond affections glowing in my breast was doomed to the embraces of a marble statue surely my glass deceives me or i might well inspire that ardent love which lifts us to the skies upon its seraphs wings cruel parents was it for you i wedded you chose indeed a man of worth and honor for me o the rare gift but to become once weary of a faultless person is to be doomed to lassitude for life this surely is severe  enter emilia emilia upon my word lady frankland you will spoil those fine eyes of yours with constant poring and then i fear you will become so very very wise too that our beaux will not be able to converse with you and we shall absolutely be deserted by every creature but the grave sir william belville who i believe reads a little and the sagacious counselor frankland learned in the laws   lady frankland i assure you emilia i almost wish i had never learned my letters sor the delicate and refined sentiments which books have inspired me with have only served to disgust me with almost all mankind   emilia and yet you would have me read and sigh and weep over a parcel of doleful devils who ten to one never existed nor is it a farthing matter whether they did or no not i truly if knowledge is to make me unhappy i am sure it is wisdom to remain in ignorance and i heartily wish dame eve had thought so too   lady frankland yet you lose vast pleasure emilia   emilia grant it you must allow that i escape much pain and i am persuaded that your ladyship might have been as happy with lord frankland as any woman in england if your ideas had not been perverted and disturbed by an heap of vile romantic trash   lady frankland no emilia it was impossible but let me not accuse my lord for this my ill stars only were to blame   emilia bless me what had stars to do in that case  unless you mean stars and garters and i dare say his lordship might easily have obtained a red ribbon at least if that could have rendered you happy   lady frankland my dear wild girl you have wandered very far from my meaning when i accused my fate in order to excuse my lord it was for not having afforded me some glorious opportunity of manifesting a passion for him by some noble generous deed which must have extorted his admiration his gratitude and love for to deal heartily what right had i to have expected that lord frankland should be a passionate lover what sacrifice had i made him by what heroic devotement had i awakened the sensibility of his soul where was the merit of having obeyed my parents and accepted for an husband one to whom i could possibly have no exception   emilia indeed my dear lady frankland you talk strangely and put me in mind of a young lady of my acquaintance deeply versed in romance who with a large fortune ran away with an ensign but when they had got clear off she would not be content unless he returned and suffered her to leap out of a window to him the experiment was made and the poor lady discovered and confined till a more suitable match could be found out for her   lady frankland with which i suppose she was miserable for life why should love meddle in matches of convenience oh ye delights of sensible souls charms of impassioned hearts where are ye alas in free and independent love alone in the mutual yielding of two fond hearts which have bestowed themselves   emilia oh for heavens sake dear lady frankland dont run on at this rate i vow i am frightened lest you should tempt me to throw away myself and fortune upon some beggar in pursuit of these same transports which after all i do not believe are to be found any where but in the heated imagination of some poet or romancemonger   lady frankland i hope that my dear emilia will experience every happiness which she can wish i own your reproof is just and i shall henceforth avoid any discourse that may elevate your notions to such an height as may perhaps make you feel those bitter pangs of disappointment which have been my lot   emilia my dear lady frankland i had not the least idea of your growing serious on the subject but luckily here comes company to divert it i have some letters to write and shall return the moment they are finished  exit enter lady fanshaw clarinda and sir harry wilmot lady fanshaw joy to my dear lady frankland joy to the world of love and gaity   clarinda joy to the lovers of liberty that you have recovered yours   lady frankland i thank ye ladies for your congratulations but as yet i confess i do not see of what great advantage this same boasted liberty will be of to me i have really no pursuits to follow no inclinations to indulge that need restraint and to become ones own mistress at my age is i think a thing rather to be feared than wished   sir harry why truly madam yours is a critical situation but what is female liberty after all but a name for a fine woman can never enjoy it but in the moment she renounces it and it is only worth preserving in order to part with it to good purpose   lady fanshaw i am astonished sir harry to hear you preach such absurd doctrine lady frankland is very young her ignorance is therefore pardonable but give me leave who have been my own mistress these ten years to instruct her ladyship in the charms and use of liberty and i fancy she will find there is something in them more than a name   sir harry madam i bow to your superior judgment and must confess i do not know a more experienced guide to all the paths of pleasure you and the gay clarinda here would have made notable priestesses were the mysteries of the bona dea now in vogue but madam to lady frankland i would not have your ladyship discouraged by what i have said with regard to liberty for it is doubtless a most delightful thing to be free   lady fanshaw true sir harry provided one knows how to use that freedom but to run gadding about the world without meaning or design is certainly a gross abuse of it   sir harry absolute prostitution of our greatest blessing  but in my opinion there is but one measure for your ladyship to pursue to choose a proper conductor and leave the rest to him a person endowed with your ladyships beauty and delicacy of sentiment must surely have the choice of many  bowing affectedly to her lady frankland there lies the difficulty sir harry when they who wished my happiness as ardently as i can do whose judgment and experience were far superior to mine have erred what have i not to fear even in the choice of a mere sentimental friendship which is all my situation can admit of   sir harry your ladyship means i suppose in choosing lord frankland for your husband   clarinda i swear for my part i ever thought it an illsuited match   sir harry why he is really a good sort of man and sensible enough too but unhappily wants taste not at all cut out for discovering the elegant and refined charms of your ladyships mind besides really the desire of pleasing an husband is in general so very languid that a fine woman seldom exerts her most amiable qualities toward him to charm to conquer she reserves for other eyes and other hearts than his   lady frankland indeed sir harry i should look upon myself as highly culpable if that had been my case my utmost wish was to inspire lord frankland with the most delicate passion how i have failed i know not   lady fanshaw oh the sweet plaintive turtle come come my dear lord frankland is a reasonable creature he leaves you at liberty   sir harry and you would be unworthy of such rational treatment should you squander so great a treasure in idleness or dissipation   lady frankland i am not much afraid of falling into either of these extremes sir harry  enter emilia emilia was there ever so rude a monster as that charles frankland i met him in the antechamber and made him as civil a curtesy as any third cousin could possibly do and the bear came up to me whipped me about the neck and kissed me with the same rustic freedom he used to do at my fathers in wales when he came circuit with the judges and dined at our house   clarinda oh poor emilia ha ha ha   emilia do settle my tucker clarinda  enter mr frankland so sir you have followed me i see   mr frankland he must be a dull hound indeed who could be found at a fault in so short a course i am glad to see your ladyship  to lady frankland sir harry i find your ladyship so much engaged with the crowd which surrounds you that i shall for the present take my leave but as i have something of importance to communicate to you i entreat you will allow me the honor of waiting on you this evening when the company may be seated at cards and i may have the felicity of entertaining your ladyship apart   lady frankland i shall be glad to see you sir harry  exit sir harry mr frankland i doubt it not  aside lady frankland well now my dear giddy emilia what is this terrible disaster which you complain of   mr frankland why madam all i know of the matter is that my cousin seems offended at my being glad to see her   emilia not so neither mr charles but you need not drag ones clothes off as you used to do besides i am not so great a romp as i was and had not my hair dressed then i am sure he has disconcerted it mightily has not he lady fanshaw   lady fanshaw not much my dear   lady frankland this fracas will soon be made up i imagine mr frankland you will do me the pleasure of your company to dinner come ladies   mr frankland i shall attend your ladyship exeunt all but mr frankland an assignation so publicly made i think i never saw it almost wears the face of innocence from indiscretion this is a rare place to seek a wife in i think i had better play sir harrys game and look out for an intrigue ay surely were it the woman only that i sought but in that case the fortune is as transferable as the lass and i would not give sixpence for the latter without the former  exit end of the first act act ii scene i lady frankland s house mr frankland and emilia emilia well mr frankland now that you have drawn me from the company prithee what is this mighty important business you said you had to communicate to me   mr frankland how can my dear emilia be so cold  ask such a cruel question   emilia i declare i am not in the least cold i think the weather rather warm for the season and as to cruelty it is a most unjust charge for i vow i never hurt any thing in my life no not a fly   mr frankland how can you trifle thus   emilia nay but it is you that trifle and i beg you will not detain me for i am sure the company within will sit down to loo in five minutes and i would not lose my place at the table for any consideration therefore if you have any thing to say speak vite vite as fontange says   mr frankland since i find madam that you cannot with patience spare a few minutes to one whose every hour of life is devoted to you i shall not trespass on you longer but leave you madam to more agreeable avocations  going emilia no i swear you shall not make a fool of me neither i am sure lady frankland will ask what business you had with me therefore do pray do tell it me directly   mr frankland if my eyes have not already made the too presumptuous declaration then let my tongue avow it  emilia i adore you   emilia ha ha ha and is that the mighty secret laboring in your breast  why my good cousin charles you ought certainly to be a great wit for you really have a very bad memory and seem utterly to forget that you have told me the same story by night and by day an hundred times at least within these three years and that i have always received this pompous declaration just as i do at present  ha ha ha   mr frankland i am extremely unhappy madam to find that the most important concern of my life should become a matter of ridicule and mirth to you but though you cannot feel for others let your own danger awaken your sensibility you stand at present on the brink of ruin and have no other place of safety that i can see but these arms to take refuge in   emilia then sure my case is desperate indeed but what danger sir what ruin am i threatened with   mr frankland with one of the greatest misfortunes that can possibly befall an innocent young woman  the loss of reputation madam   emilia my character sir is far above the reach of malice nor has the tongue of slander ever yet pronounced my name   mr frankland it will not long be silent then be assured of it associated as you now are with persons whose characters have been so long infamous that scandal has forgot their names   emilia i neither know nor own such vile acquaintance but if you would not have me think you worse far worse than those you have described speak out directly name them to me sir nor like a base assassin attempt to wound those by night you dare not look upon by day   mr frankland my dear emilia you are young and do not see through the artifices of that vile woman   emilia what woman sure you dare not hint it   mr frankland lady frankland is    emilia an angel   mr frankland i say a fallen one   emilia oh thou art one and of the blackest dye  she vile she artful thou art a monster but to think it her mind and person are as pure as mountainsnow which the suns beams have never glanced upon   mr frankland this is prodigious fine very poetical truly but now my dear emilia  taking her hand   emilia stand off there is poison in your touch as in your speech   mr frankland are you then deaf as well as blind were you not present this morning when she publicly gave an assignation to sir harry wilmot her bedchamber i suppose will be the scene   emilia sir i command you silence let not your venomed tongue offend my ears with such base such vile suggestions   mr frankland you bid me speak and you shall hear me out is not the grave sir william belville ever sighing at her feet with twenty coxcombs more who in their turns shall hope nor hope in vain   emilia leave me sir i desire you will leave me   mr frankland no my lovely emilia i cannot will not leave you i will defend you even against yourself i have shown you the precipice on which you stand let me now point out the path to happiness and safety this vile lady frankland    emilia again sir   mr frankland can never think of returning back to her husband again and in failure of lawful issue you know i am his heir therefore no despicable match for my emilia   emilia thou art indeed the most despicable meanest wretch that lives so sir the source of this polluted stream at length appears you have traduced one innocent woman to entrap another but know that were you this moment what i hope you never will be in possession of lord franklands wealth and honors and that emilia had not a shilling in the world she would fly you with the same detestation and contempt she does at present and so my lord wouldbe adieu  exit mr frankland i fear i have overshot the mark i thought to have frightened the little welsh puss with the cry of scandal opening against her and that she would have taken cover in my arms but faith she is a stout one and worth scampering after the whole circumference of her estate and by fair or foul means i will yet hunt her down  enter fontange serviteur mademoiselle   fontange oh your honors tres humble servante comment se port mr padrick your honors iris serviteur he never a come to see us since a we leave parliamentarystreet oh he be de inconstant varlet   mr frankland i shall take care to chide him for it mademoiselle and send him to wait upon you directly   fontange oh your honor maka me very very glad i do like mr padrick dearly he be so very coxcomical he maka me laugh and then he maka de plays vid de kisses in it oh it was very very sweet   mr frankland well mademoiselle patrick shall certainly refresh your lips with some of those sweet kisses again but tell me how do you like your manner of living since your removal to pall mall i suppose you are quite happy here without a master   fontange oh point de tout not at all my lady she keep a de very bad hour pauvre fontange she must sit up for her lady i am sure me look a de vizard for want of de sleep   mr frankland how happens that mademoiselle what can she find to do alone   fontange why she have a de company dat stay with her sometime till one or two oclok den she go up to her chamber dear she sit down to sigh or to read a de great big book den may be that laughing miss emilie she come in whip away de book and sit prateaprate to her till we no want candle to go to bed but i beg a your honors pardon i have a de lettre to my lady from sir harry wilmot   mr frankland serviteur mademoiselle proceed in your vocation   fontange your tres humble  pray souvenez monsieur padrick  exit mr frankland a letter from sir harry what then his stomach does not serve or perhaps he thinks the treat will keep cold i am sorry for it i wish he or the devil had her i know not what to think of her i greatly fear she may be honest but if i can contrive any method to ruin her in lord franklands opinion it is quite equal and she may then remain as chaste as she pleases for me this french woman may be of use she certainly knows her ladys secrets and it will be very extraordinary if an englishmans gold and an irishmans kisses may not be able to open the lock of that curious repository she may assist in my design on emilia too whom i am determined to have were it only to gratify my pique  exit scene ii a drawing room in lady frankland s house lady frankland lady fanshaw clarinda and sir william belville seated at a cardtable lady frankland the pool is out and my cards are really so disagreeable that i am tired of playing i wish emilia would come and take them  enter emilia will you play emilia   emilia no madam i would rather be excused at present   sir william then we have done if your ladyship pleases and i am glad of it for i confess i think that play among friends is a most shameful misemployment of time and that cards appear properly in the hands of sharpers only merely as implements of their trade   clarinda for all that sir william cards are a very comfortable resource sometimes   emilia ay where the company is not large enough to make up a countrydance   lady fanshaw i am sure half the people of fashion in england would pass many a dull evening nay perhaps some of them might hang or drown themselves if it was not for the relief which these little innocent paintings afford   lady frankland i am so far of sir william belvilles opinion that i think avarice is the true source of play and how persons of liberal minds and easy fortunes can reconcile so mean a motive to themselves is to me surprising   sir william there are few people madam who are truly acquainted with the springs of their own actions and many who are actuated by the basest would be shocked if they knew them   lady frankland this is a grave subject sir william i think we grow rather too wise   emilia why i really think so too so i will even go trifle o clarinda such a capuchin as i saw in the park yesterday i will have just such another positively and will instantly go enter into close consultation with my milliner on this important subject  exit lady fanshaw i wish sir harry wilmot was here he would enliven us all even without cards   clarinda you will not have your wish tonight lady fanshaw  sir harry is engaged   lady fanshaw prithee where clarinda   clarinda at lady subtles he is solely devoted to her for the present her husband is in the country and i dare say he would not spend this evening from her for a nabobs fortune   lady fanshaw ridiculous how can you talk so why he has been in her good graces above this month which is long enough believe me to surfeit him he has had a dozen amors at least within these twelve months   lady frankland a dozen did you say lady fanshaw   lady fanshaw i did indeed and your ladyship may be assured i have spoken within bounds   clarinda i dare say so too and yet he has behaved with honor to them all   lady frankland how you amaze me with honor said you i thought till now that constancy in love had been a virtue   lady fanshaw i have met with some such musty moral among the metaphysics of old romances but the bon ton of later times have exploded it long since i assure your ladyship  enter fontange fontange i humbly beg a mill pardon of your ladyship and of all de ladyships for me enter here but i have a beg of nicodumpus this halfhour to bring a this lettre to your ladyship but he pretend a he do not entendez moi and i am forced to bring it myself for which i beg a mill pardon again   lady frankland give it to me mademoiselle  i shall return immediately  exit lady frankland and fontange sir william looking after lady frankland each word each glance discovers some new charm and dead not cold is he she cannot warm   lady fanshaw o fie sir william what a mere whining inamorato you are why dont you say all these fine things to her face what signifies your sighing them out after she has got beyond earshot   sir william the delicate and high respect i bear toward her ladyships unhappy situation must seal my lips in everlasting silence nor shall i ever breathe a sigh or wish that may offend her   lady fanshaw and clarinda ha ha ha   clarinda and so you think she would be offended lord sir william though you are very young you need not pretend to be quite so innocent offended ha ha ha  enter lady frankland lady frankland i am pleased to hear you so merry ladies prithee communicate the occasion for i should be glad to try if there be sympathy in mirth as well as contagion in sorrow do tell me what you laugh at   sir william lady fanshaw and clarinda madam were saying    lady frankland what pray   lady fanshaw why that of all simple animals a bashful lover was the most ridiculous   lady frankland i believe there are few men nowadays ridiculous on that account i have indeed read of lovers who have sighed whole years away without daring to acquaint the happy object with their passion   clarinda while perhaps the pining fair one sat sighing in her turn to waving woods and purling streams for him again ha ha ha   lady frankland that too might have happened i believe clarinda   lady fanshaw and dont your ladyship think they were a couple of mighty silly mortals   lady frankland you know my sentiments upon that subject already ladies   sir william for my part i think there is happiness sufficient in the bare loving of an amiable object   clarinda what without any hope or desire of a return   sir william it is impossible to divest a lover of the fond hope of being pitied at least by the object he adores and while he confines his wishes within that bound he is indeed a lover but when he vainly thinks his services should merit a reward perhaps inconsistent with the honor or happiness of the beloved object selflove assumes the place of passion and it no longer deserves even the name   lady frankland upon my word sir william i am charmed with the elegant and just description you have given of love and am rejoiced to find the dear idea still exists in any breast besides my own   sir william they must be insensible indeed who could have had the happiness of conversing with your ladyship without being in some degree inspired by that delicacy and refinement which accompany all your words and actions and if i have been able to conceive or express proper sentiments of the noblest passion i own myself indebted for them to my knowledge of lady frankland   lady fanshaw aside to clarinda this goes on swimmingly let us leave them together i dare say they wish us gone clarinda  to lady frankland we must bid your ladyship good evening clarinda and i are under an engagement to meet lady rattle and some other company at vauxhall  sir william bows to lady frankland at the same time as taking leave clarinda you are not coming with us sir william   sir william no madam but i think it time also to retire i wish your ladyship goodnight   clarinda stupid fellow i would not have gone away these two hours if i had thought so  aside exeunt all but lady frankland lady frankland sir william belville is really a very agreeable and polite man oh if lord frankland had been capable of his refined his delicate sentiments of love how happy had i been this were indeed the golden age again restored to me  but let me see once more what says the gay sir harry  takes out a letter and reads madam  i am totally in despair at losing the most precious moments of my life but company have broke in upon me and prevented my laying my devoirs at your feet what would i not give to escape from them but unluckily they are persons of the first condition  i cannot therefore taste of happiness till tomorrow i most earnestly conjure dear lady frankland to abridge some hours of cruel and distracting absence by permitting me to attend her levee at the toilet till then i have the honor to be  her ladyships most passionate adorer  h wilmot  vain coxcomb is this then the important business he had to communicate to me but i will see him to mortify the insolence of his presumption  enter emilia emilia pray what is your ladyship ruminating so very seriously upon   lady frankland i have much to think of emilia but i promised you this morning you may remember to confine my ideas to my own breast i fancy you look grave too what has mr frankland boisterously presumed to kiss your hand or neglected to take up your fan when you dropped it on purpose for him or    emilia no such matters i assure your ladyship yet he has indeed furnished me with a very copious subject for contemplation but    lady frankland i claim no right over your secrets my dear and from the good opinion i have formed of your character i dare say you may be safely trusted with the keeping of them yourself but as i most sincerely wish your happiness i must say that i think you would have a better chance for it with any other man than mr frankland there is a reserve even in his gayest manners that seems to squint suspicion   emilia i am so far of your ladyships opinion that i promise you mr frankland shall never have it in his power to render me unhappy but let us talk no more upon so disagreeable a subject i have just got the last new song that your ladyship seemed fond of will you step into the next room and hear it with the harpsichord   lady frankland with all my heart  exeunt scene iii mr frankland s chambers in the temple mr frankland musing enter patrick with a letter mr frankland you have staid a confounded while but i suppose you waited for an answer  give it to me   patrick fait and if i had done that myself would not have been here so soon itself for how could miss emilia give an answer to a letter she would not read unless she was a conjuror or a witch   mr frankland not read my letter   patrick not she indeed she scorned the motion though mademoiselle palavered her at the greatest rate and said she was sure it must be very pretty when it would come from the young concealor but madam emilia she said she would not pry into the concealment that is she would not break the seal i suppose augh she is very witty   mr frankland leave your nonsensical prate and be gone   patrick well there is your letter for you again safe and sound not a bit worse than when you gave it me  o yes fait it has got a little clean dirt in my pocket but that is no great signify it will serve a poor body well enough still shall i carry it to mrs susan taper in threadneedlestreet may be it would bid her bring home the shirts if she is able to carry them with the load your honor has given her already   mr frankland blockhead give me the letter  takes and tears it patrick fait that is very foolish now i am sure your honor was a full hour a writing it and what do you throw it away for   mr frankland leave the room exit patrick the insolence of this proud girl distracts me i fear i am on the brink of ruin my fortune mortgaged for more than it is worth my honor pawned at play and what is worse my credit sunk with her who was to have redeemed them all should she acquaint lord frankland with what i have said of his wife his foolish fondness for her honor may make him cast me off both from his heart and fortune beggary contempt and infamy stare in my face i must find out some means to avoid their frowns or else escape from them by the help of a pistol but as that is at any time in my power i will make one effort more before i draw the trigger and deserve death at least before i fly to it   end of the second act act iii scene i lord frankland s dressing room enter lord frankland reading to climates cheered by other suns in vain the wretched exile runs or though he mount the rapid steed care follows with unerring speed how strongly do i feel the force of this sentiment in my own breast i hoped the opening charms of the soft breathing spring would have removed my languor i grew sick of the country in a few hours and i shall probably be tired of london in as short a space  enter ambrose ambrose i hope i see your lordship in good health your sudden return has alarmed me   lord frankland i thank you ambrose but i am as well as ever i expect to be   ambrose my dearest lord you break my heart to hear you talk so sadly if your old servant guesses right your malady is love  love for the sweetest best of women your lordships wife oh she is all made up of gentleness and generosity i wonder indeed i do how you could have the heart to part with her indeed i do my lord   lord frankland full well i know her exquisite perfections ambrose and admire them all but with a heart that loved as mine did how could i bear daily to be reproached with want of tenderness and passion for her i found it impossible to act up to her romantic notions and as i could not make her happy i determined not to make her wretched though it is too sure that she has rendered me so   ambrose i am certain my lord her gentle heart would break if she suspected that you grieved for her she ever has received your poor old servant with the greatest kindness and made me even sit down before her when she thought that i looked feeble or fatigued while she inquired minutely of your lordships health then let me go to her and tell her what i am sure your lordship thinks i know she will hear me indeed she will  oh on my knees i beg that i may be the blessed messenger of peace the happy cause of your reunion   lord frankland i command you not to attempt it the pride of manhood and of love forbid it could i have condescended to have whined and sighed before her we never should have parted but since that has happened nothing but a full conviction of the injury she has done my love shall ever make us meet again mean time i will watch over her like her guardian angel and shield her from each wrong or violence she brings not on herself should that ever happen my care is at an end aside go ambrose and inquire her health and let emilia know i should be glad to see her but for your life breathe not a syllable of what has past   ambrose i will obey your lordship though it is the first severe command you ever laid upon me   lord frankland you will find me in the library  exeunt severally scene ii lady frankland s dressing room lady frankland just risen from dressing fontange settling the toilet enter sir harry and exit fontange sir harry bright as the sun and as the morning fair eh ma charmante what an amazing freshness of complexion what a profusion of lovely hair upon my soul lady frankland you are vastly handsome   lady frankland i am glad to see you in such top spirits sir harry i suppose them the effect of your last nights party   sir harry last night  let me consider where was i last night oh the cursed embarras du monde which prevented my waiting on your ladyship i have a vast mind to turn shepherd and renounce the world at once should not you like to be a shepherdess now   lady frankland o vastly with such a faithful swain   sir harry egad and so i am constancy is i think my greatest foible at present  it is apt to wear out a mistresss patience   lady frankland then lady subtle may boast of her charms if they have been powerful enough to six the lively roving sir harry wilmot   sir harry lady subtle why you know ma chere her charms are in the wane absolutely expiring  we have been old acquaintance and it would have been cruel in me to have refused her the shadow of an amor when she is so very near becoming a ghost i am glad to find she is jealous  aside lady frankland is she in a bad state of health sir harry   sir harry o by no means she is as fat and florid as any woman in england of her age which i believe is near forty   lady frankland pray where is the danger then of her becoming a ghost   sir harry helas ma chere innocente dont you meet a thousand ghosts in every public place bodies without souls who have haunted the world so long that they are worn out of every ones remembrance and might glide in and out without ever being taken notice of if it were not for the space they occupy have you never been jostled by a fat red ghost in the box lobby of the playhouse or at the puppetshow cascade at vauxhall ha ha ha   lady frankland as they differ in every respect from spirits i should never have thought of stiling them ghosts though as you have explained it i own the term is apt enough yet i fancy that blanks would do still better as some authors have lately used them merely to make up bulk and stuff lifes volume   sir harry i vow madam your ladyship has an infinity of wit as well as beauty but now prithee dear lady frankland what do you seriously mean to do with them both   lady frankland i do not find myself overburthend with either of those rare qualities sir harry but if i should i must even look out for some goodnatured person who will be kind enough to assist me in bearing the load   sir harry ay now your ladyship talks reason mutual offices are the very bands of society and among the crowd of adorers who bow before your shrine have you yet fixed on one whom you think equal to so blessed a charge i may be impertinent  your ladyships blushes seem to hint as much   lady frankland no sir harry a heart like mine has nothing to disguise  if i blushed it was not shame but pride that glowed upon my cheek from the slight notion you seem to have conceived of me that among the trifling characters which frequent my drawing room there could be found one capable of attaching my confidence or regards   sir harry why that is vastly severe now when there are such a number of pretty fellows who dedicate their services to your ladyship what pains she takes to show me she is not engaged  aside lady frankland it would be the height of vanity in me to set down their visits to my own account sir harry while i am blessed with a companion in my house whose mind is free and person disengaged and where each charm that can attract in both unite in my emilia   sir harry faith i have always heard your ladyship reckoned a little romantic but never believed it till now emilia why we know her price is matrimony to become a property for life egad and sure no man of spirit would condescend to such terms unless with a view to lord franklands circumstances madam   lady frankland sir you grow insolent   sir harry i vow i did not mean it and ask a thousand pardons  but surely madam with that blaze that glow of youth and beauty which surrounds you it is impossible you should think of living disengaged were the hesperian fruit planted in our streets it would require ten dragons to secure it alas you have not one   lady frankland in this imminent danger what think you of my appointing such an excellent guardian as sir harry wilmot ha ha ha   sir harry you may gibe if you please madam but i certainly should be the very thing if i were not so much engaged lord what shall i do for means to get free   lady frankland pray do not give yourself the least trouble upon that account sir harry for though i am as you observed a little romantic i have not bravery sufficient to turn knight errant and i must surpass even the renowned don quixote should i think of encountering the numerous host of rivals which your attachment might enrage   sir harry no madam your ladyship is mistaken there are not a vast number who at this time lay claim to my devoirs   lady frankland o but sir harry my heart is so very tender that i should be moved to restore you back to the groans of lady subtle or the first stalking shade of those numberless ghosts your cruelty has made that might come to haunt me for you   sir harry i assure your ladyship you are wrong to make a jest of my behavior to lady subtle there are few men of my rank in life who have either morals or politeness sufficient to pay the least regard to a dying reputation  now madam it has ever been my principle and practice both never publicly to abandon a mistress and when i have been insufferably tired of a lady i have kept my chamber and seen no company for three days together in order to give her the credit of the rupture but you are not to expect such nice morals from the generality of men i will assure you madam   lady frankland how you amaze me is this sir harry what you style morals principles politeness to betray to expose a wretched woman surely i am in a dream i cannot think myself awake   sir harry why truly madam i think we are both very near taking a nap we have wandered from the point strangely and i ought to beg your ladyships pardon for having made so improper an use of the favor you have indulged me in eh donc ma belle will you now seriously fix upon the happy man who is to love and be beloved by you   lady frankland you increase my astonishment every syllable you utter   sir harry she must be very ignorant to be so subject to wonder  aside lady frankland i am young perhaps not insensible but neither my youth nor sensibility shall ever betray me into imprudence if my affections are to be gained it must be time assiduity reflection the soft habitudes of friendship and esteem that must obtain them even without my choice   sir harry i admire you vastly madam upon my soul i do  but i have not the honor to be of the ancient chivalry nor had i the least notion of your ladyships allowing me the happiness of a tete a tete merely to assist you in composing a romance adieu donc ma chere princess belle heroine adieu  exit lady frankland where will my wonder end is this the man of gallantry the irresistible sir harry wilmot surely that woman must first be a dupe to her own passions who could comply with his not such the lovers i have read of who sighed whole years in silence nor to the world revealed their bitter anguish their consuming pain the whispering woods alone were conscious of their woe till echo caught the sound and bore it on her dying voice to the beloved fair  exit scene iii the park sir william belville this charming woman fills up all my thoughts my every wish is here is nay my whole soul what delicacy of sentiment what elegance of form and manners happy  rather say unhappy lord frankland whose sure possession made him contemn a prize that kings might become rivals for  enter sir harry sir harry why so grave sir william   sir william you mistake sir harry i was only thoughtful   sir harry why curse me if ever i could distinguish between thought and gravity in all my life and as i look upon reflection to be a mere dull mechanic sort of business i have resolved never to think while i live   sir william a most rational resolution truly   sir harry but my dear sir william egad i had like to have forgot  you are under the highest obligation to me this very moment and i will be thanked positively i will   sir william you need but name it sir harry and rest assured of my gratitude   sir harry why then sir knight i have achieved such a feat in your favor as you will be transported at  cleared the covered way my boy and left the defile open to you and you alone but not to arrogate too much i must confess that it was pure want of that noble spirit of perseverance which you are so amply possessed of that made me quit the assault for to say the truth i am tolerable enough at a skirmish but devilish bad at a siege   sir william you speak in riddle sir harry pray explain yourself that i may thank you as i ought   sir harry well then my dear belville thus the matter stands  we have both of us you know sighed for that delia that cassandra that queen of all romance lady frankland   sir william sir harry lady frankland has a husband and    sir harry sir william i know she has and  they are parted but suppose they lived together is it not possible to fall in love with another mans wife answer me that and from your heart my grave sir william belville   sir william a passion in that place must be an hopeless one   sir harry not at all i assure you for if i would but have starved on hope for a few days i might have lived on certainty as long as i liked it after but egad my constitution is not strong enough to fast through a lent though i were sure to feast at the carnival   sir william sir harry i hope still i do not understand you lady franklands character is free from blame   sir harry and always shall be so for me i assure you but to be plain sir william her ladyship did me the honor of an assignation this morning for all that   sir william an assignation sir harry   sir harry ay positively a tete a tete   sir william go on sir  in a surly tone sir harry go on sir egad i dont know whether i shall or no i fancy i have mistaken my man and instead of talking to my old friend will belville have stumbled on some country cousin who because he is related to her ladyship thinks it incumbent on his honor to vindicate here is go on sir   sir william distraction torture aside sir harry i was only impatient to know the result of this assignation   sir harry to be short then her ladyship assumed all the airs of an heroine in romance talked of constancy assiduity friendship esteem  and modestly gave me to understand that i must dangle some months at least after her before she could think of rewarding my labor ha ha   sir william but did she promise to be kind upon these terms sir harry   sir harry why not expressly indeed but sure belville you and i are too well acquainted with the sex not to know that a constant attendance for a fortnight a few warm sighs some drops of heat distilling from the eyes with a volley of flattery planted against her ears would have carried this proud princess captive and made her fink into my arms   sir william sir harry notwithstanding the lightness of your manners i have ever believed you to be a man of honor i must therefore suppose that you have framed this story purely to try my opinion and regards for lady frankland and that on that discovery you will freely own the falsehood   sir harry the falsehood sir   sir william yes sir  to traduce that ladys honor is the basest meanest falsehood she grant you an assignation   sir harry by heaven she did   sir william by heaven it is false and thus i will assert it  draws sir harry nay then have at you in defense of truth  draws sir william in defense of honor  they fight sir harry is disarmed enter clarinda at the side of the stage clarinda bless me what is the matter   sir harry sir william my life is in your hands   sir william then take it freely i hope you are not hurt  returning his sword sir harry not much if you know how to use it this adventure will be a vast advantage to you a conquering lover is a treasure in romance virtue is her fort but sentiment her foible help me to my chair it is at the park gate my wound grows painful and the walks begin to fill do not boast of this affair to any one but lady frankland   sir william upon my honor i shall not even to her sir harry   sir harry success attend you you deserve it   sir william to deserve is to obtain sir harry for he who founds his schemes in honor has already secured to himself that selfapplause which is more precious than any other gratification can possibly be  exeunt sir harry leaning on sir william clarinda comes forward clarinda virtue is her fort but sentiment her foible that must be lady frankland it is very odd now i have coquetted with half a dozen at once and have been kind to two or three and yet never had the honor of a duel being sought for me though i have endeavored to set the men together by the ears with all my might but these sly slow things that have either the reality or appearance of virtue do fifty times more mischief than we good natured generous hearted girls are capable of doing or perhaps our gallants like our nation love fighting for fighting sake without any hopes of being paid for it  enter emilia oh emilia such a dreadful accident   emilia bless me what has happened   clarinda a duel between sir william belville and sir harry wilmot   emilia how did it end  with emotion clarinda i fear it is all over with poor sir harry   emilia but sir william dear clarinda what of him   clarinda so my little sly one you are caught i sind    emilia can one hear of bloodshed without concern   clarinda but why distinguish between the combatants   emilia pshaw prithee tell me the whole of this story   clarinda prithee first tell me whether your emotion arises from sentiment or passion   emilia neither neither compassion all   clarinda well then all i know of the matter is that just now as i entered the park i saw these gentlemen both draw their swords and engage and before i could get up to the place sir william had become master of sir harrys sword   emilia were they both wounded   clarinda i cannot inform you i know sir harry was   emilia surely the provocation must have been great that could tempt them to draw in the park i thought sir william had more temper and prudence do you know the subject of this quarrel   clarinda i know there was a woman in the case whom i dare pronounce to be lady frankland   emilia impossible what right have either of them to asperse or vindicate her fame she neither does nor can belong to either of them   clarinda that is perhaps the very reason why they fought about her a woman in her circumstances is looked upon as lawful plunder to which the longest sword gives a title   emilia my dear unhappy friend i am grieved to the heart for her i was going to visit lord frankland just across the park but i shall first return to her for a few minutes i entreat clarinda that you will not mention this affair to any mortal   clarinda not i you may depend upon it the secret would burst me aside but shall i send to know how sir william does   emilia pshaw i hope he is not hurt with all my heart   clarinda farewell emilia  exit as emilia is going out she is met by mr frankland mr frankland i am fortunate madam in meeting you in a place where you cannot avoid me   emilia you are much mistaken sir if you think it is not what i would wish to do in every place   mr frankland i have no reason to doubt your sincerity madam but it was carrying your cruelty too far to refuse reading my letter  no judge condemns unheard   emilia i have heard you sir and from your own lips condemn you nor can any of your artful palliatives ever induce me to change my opinion i therefore request that you will spare yourself and me the fruitless trouble of attempting it for be assured that i will never receive letter or message nor hold converse or commerce with you more   mr frankland for heavens sake hear me one word my emilia   emilia no sir but to rid you of perhaps your greatest uneasiness i promise you i never shall repeat the vile calumny you thought proper to insult me with so that your secret remains safer even in a womans breast than it was in your own but for the future i advise you to be more cautious  exit mr frankland so then all is safe with regard to lord frankland i find  but what an ass am i to think myself so while i am in the power of a woman no that can never be till she is in mine  enter patrick well patrick have you seen fontange   patrick yes please your honor i have seen her all over   mr frankland what is all over   patrick why by my shoul she is all over impudence i think   mr frankland what do you mean   patrick why faith when i inquired for her below they said she was above so up i went to the top of the house to the very garret to her chambray as she called it and knocked at the door out of pure civility she answered enter or entry or something like that so in i went and found her sowing on her bodices without so much as an apron or bedgown about her shoulders  augh she has made me sick about the heart   mr frankland you are plaguey dainty truly to be offended at seeing a woman half naked   patrick augh hone my jewel if it was one of my own country girls with a skin as white as a crud or a new potatoe it would not have affected my stomach that way   mr frankland well hold your nonsense  did she promise to come to my chambers   patrick faith honey it is but ask and have with her i will be bound she is there already   mr frankland and you blockhead have got the keys run home directly i will follow you as quick as possible fly    patrick troth let her wait i will not fly a step for her   mr frankland be gone  exeunt patrick running end of the third act act iv scene i a drawing room in lady frankland s house lady frankland and emilia lady frankland you cannot imagine my dear emilia how much i am shocked at what you have told me i fear i shall now become a common topic of discourse what a triumph for lord frankland his character will rise upon the ruin of mine  good heaven what will become of me   emilia indeed my dear lady frankland you first deceive yourself and then argue right upon wrong principles you must certainly imagine lord frankland a monster before you can suppose it possible for him to rejoice at your dishonor on the contrary i am certain he would be sensible of the highest concern were he acquainted even with your present distress   lady frankland o do not say so emilia i can bear his resentment better than his pity i fear i have deserved the one and am certain i have no claim to the other   emilia you judge too hardly of yourself my dear but i have strong hopes that this unlucky affair will never reach his or any other ears sir harry has nothing to boast of we may therefore depend on his silence and i have too good an opinion of sir william belville to suppose him capable of ever mentioning it and i would not have your ladyship seem to know one word of the matter   lady frankland grant it should remain a secret emilia how painful must my situation be conscious of the highest obligation which i must not acknowledge even to the generous hand that has conferred it to a mind open and grateful as mine this must be torture   emilia have a care lady frankland of overrating the obligation sir william knows that your situation cannot admit of a return and if i am not much deceived with regard to his character his sentiments are too generous to expect one   lady frankland by showing my want of power to repay it you but enhance the debt  enter nicodemus nicodemus sir william belville madam  exit lady frankland looks at emilia in some confusion enter sir william sir william your servant ladies i scarce expected the pleasure of finding you at home this fine day when all the world is abroad   lady frankland that may perhaps be one reason for our staying at home sir william i hate crowds of every kind   sir william if half the world could entertain themselves or others as either of you ladies can there would scarce be such a thing as a crowd select parties and rational conversation would then become the fashion but when the mind is vacant of ideas its activity will seek them from outward objects which strike upon the senses yet leave no more impression than our forms do on a looking glass while the charms of refined sense and elegant converse remain indelible upon the soul   emilia for my part sir william i relinquish any share in that very fine compliment for i confess i have great pleasure in seeing a number of well dressed people together looking as if they were pleased themselves and wishing to please others and i should certainly have been in the park an hour ago if i had not staid in compliment to her ladyship   lady frankland you render me uneasy emilia pray do not suffer your complaisance for me to trespass on your pleasures   sir william though you modestly refuse it madam you have still a part in the eulogium nor is it for want of ideas in yourself but to inspire them in others that you need ever wish to appear in public and who that sees emilia must not be captivated with the pleasing one of sprightly innocence   emilia ay but then sir william it leaves no more impression than our forms do on a looking glass you know so i will even vanish away  exit sir william all forms however pleasing are transient i confess but when animated by a noble mind they then become such substances as stars are made of   lady frankland then sure my dear emilia may shine forth the mornings harbinger for never was there yet a nobler mind joined to a fairer person   sir william the comparison had been more just madam had you alluded to our nightly planet which borrows its reflected light from the bright sun as she from you   lady frankland your compliment is so very high sir william that there is no replying to it we seem to have got beyond the clouds and had better beware the fate of icarus   sir william it were falling indeed madam to descend to any terrestrial subject while i have the happiness of contemplating and conversing with a seraph   lady frankland upon my word sir william your extravagant politeness distresses me yet i confess my foible if it is one in being pleased at being approved and esteemed by a person of your refined sentiments i hope too that it is a pleasure i may indulge with innocence   sir william transporting sound my raptures are too strong for expression thus give me leave to thank you  kneels and kisses her hand lady frankland oh sir william beware of ecstasies they are alas inconsistent with my hapless lot   sir william never madam shall i aspire to higher bliss than what i now enjoy  bowing respectfully lady frankland perhaps sir william i have been led too far  but still remember sir that i am bound by the strongest ties they must be preserved inviolate and if i am really dear to you you will ever hold them sacred   sir william far far from belvilles heart be every wish for transient joys attended by remorse much sooner would he die than ever create a pang in the soft bosom of sair innocence  enter nicodemus nicodemus lady fanshaw madam   lady fanshaw i vow you are a most unaccountable creature lady frankland i have waited for you this full hour and what is worse i am afraid the auction is begun and the room so stuffed that we shall not be able to see the beautiful pagoda nor get into the circle among the men but be jammd up in some obscure nook among the canaille who frequent such places merely to stare at their betters and poison the air with the fumes of tobacco   lady frankland i ask your ladyship many pardons  i utterly forgot to order a card to be sent to let you know i could not attend you this morning   lady fanshaw vastly polite truly  not go with me after preventing my being there two hours ago and getting a seat close to the auctioneer i should have had the very best place maam mr langford and i are very well acquainted   sir william by your own account madam her ladyship has done you a favor by preventing you from being squeezed up in a crowd   lady fanshaw you are vastly mistaken sir there is nothing more pleasant and healthful too and i am certain half the people of fashion in london would die of fevers if it were not for the benefit of perspiration which they can only receive in such places as they are too delicate to use exercise sufficient to procure it any other way   sir william this is really madam the only rational argument i ever heard urged in favor of a crowd and i shall henceforth consider myself or any of my friends in such a situation as only suffering a painful operation for the benefit of health   lady fanshaw but now dear lady frankland you have not an idea of what you will lose if you dont come with me directly there is my lord mount fashion who has traveled through persia and the moguls country purely to acquire a knowledge in painting and architecture makes his first public appearance there this morning and will decide exactly with regard to the value of the bronzes and the antiquity of the china   sir william such a virtuoso must be equally an honor and advantage to his country surely   lady fanshaw o but sir william they say he is a mighty pretty fellow too in short all the pretty fellows in town will be there  do come for heavens sake lady frankland i shall break my heart if i dont go and i cannot decently stalk in alone like one that nobody knows   lady frankland rather than your ladyship should suffer so extreme a disappointment come then i will accompany you   lady fanshaw away away then quickly my dear my chariot is at the door yours sir william   lady frankland sir william your servant  exeunt ladies sir william lord mount fashion and all the pretty fellows in town there sure that could not be the motive for her going  yet she absolutely refused till they were mentioned nor once desired me to accompany her this is strange oh she is too dear to my fond heart i cannot bear that other men should gaze upon her charms for if they do they will love i will follow at a distance and observe her she will attract all eyes and i may pass unnoticd  exit scene ii lord frankland s dressing room lord frankland and emilia lord frankland so you think emilia that lady frankland reads too much   emilia i do indeed my lord   lord frankland were her books well chosen that could hardly be but i fear her studies serve rather to augment than amend her only foible but pray emilia who are lady franlkands chief intimates i do not mean the crowds that fill her drawing room but those who are admitted en famille   emilia does your lordship mean men or women   lord frankland both emilia but more particularly the latter for i would have you and every woman i regard more nice in the choice of their female even than their male acquaintance believe me much depends upon it   emilia lady fanshaw and clarinda are i think the most intimate of our female friends sir harry wilmot and sir william belville are more frequently with us than any other men   lord frankland you surprise me emilia clarinda intimate with lady frankland i am sorry for it   emilia and why my lord clarinda is sprightly sensible and cheerful   lord frankland beware of that spirit sense and gaiety emilia which have not virtue for their base they are dangerous instruments in dangerous hands i am shocked at her intimacy with my wife which she has compassed since our separation and if i have yet any influence with lady frankland or with you you will both immediately quit all connection there the rest of the persons you have named i am unacquainted with except sir william belville who bears the character of a man of honor clarinda lady frankland those names ought never to be joined   emilia i am very certain my lord that lady frankland would sacrifice any thing on earth to your desire i will answer for it that she gives up clarinda directly i promise your lordship that i shall   lord frankland do not flatter me emilia could she have sacrificed her only foible to my fond love we had been blessed indeed   emilia pardon me my lord if i suspect that foible might have been cured if proper means had been applied   lord frankland do not speak of it emilia my wounds all bleed afresh there was no way to cure it nor could we have lived on any terms but by indulging it to an excess which must have rendered us both contemptible i am impatient till you see my wife alas all that remains to me of that endearing name is that fair shadow pointing to the picture let her break off all further commerce with clarinda if she regards her own honor or my peace   emilia your lordship need not doubt your being obeyed  exit lord frankland i am grieved at thinking what may be the event of this connection all women who have forfeited their own title to virtue envy those who possess it and would wish to sink them to their own base level i am certain lady frankland is virtuous open and sincere but alas what arms are these to combat the charms of flattery the attractions of pleasure and the snares of seduction should she sink under them i surely am to blame who have exposed her youth and inexperience to a trial perhaps too hard but should she pass this more than ordeal fire unsullied and unhurt she will be something more than woman and adoration late her claim will then become her due i will hope the best  exit scene iii mr frankland s chambers patrick solus patrick what can my master and

master was married to madam emilia because i believe he loves her but this stealing her away by night has an ugly look with it  and to have that wicked mademoiselle get a good thousand pound for helping to ruin the innocent creature augh that would vex me to the heart i will go directly and consult with my old friend and gossip jimmy kavanagh that is in a good place here in town and may be he would tell me what i would do for i dont much care to betray my poor master neither  exit scene iv a drawing room sir harry wilmot in a nightgown clarinda sitting with him sir harry i vow clarinda this was vastly kind now and really more than i deserve but i declare you are the very paragon of goodnature   clarinda why truly sir harry i must say it shows a most dovelike disposition in me to hazard my reputation by visiting a man who has just now endangered his life for another lady   sir harry there you are mistaken clarinda curse me if i either did or would fight for any woman in england  except yourself ma belle fille   clarinda o your servant sir  but what could have been your cause of quarrel then for sir william i think never plays   sir harry why that same doughty knight errant you have named took it into his wise head that because a certain fair lady had never allowed him a tete a tete she never meant to indulge herself or any body else with one and upon my declaring that she had done me that favor talked in a high ridiculous romantic strain of the ladys honor and character and seemed to hint as if he suspected me of a falsehood that you will allow was not to be endured   clarinda o by no means sir harry however i have not quite so much pity for you as i had as you were paid i suppose beforehand a tete a tete with lady frankland was i think an overpayment for the slight scratch you have received but you certainly did ill to boast i could not have suspected you of so much dishonor sir harry   sir harry why now my dear clarinda there is the mischief on it i had nothing to boast of for this same petite party ended in a very absurd proposal on her side for entering into the platonic system which i positively refused car je nai pas le tems admired the elegant impracticability of her ladyships seraphics made my bow and withdrew   clarinda very absurd and ridiculous truly equally so on both sides i never could have supposed that a man who knows the world as well as you have a right to do could have slipped such an opportunity so simply ha ha ha   sir harry why faith clarinda there is a kind of bashful courage about those modest dames that is capable of putting the most impudent fellow in the world out of countenance and though i was never in better spirits for an attack she talked so queerly of friendship esteem honor and such stuff that she left me little to say and less to do so i even quitted the field and marched off   clarinda shame of all cowards say i if your double defeat should be known you will be hooted out of the world both of love and gallantry and faith you deserve it   sir harry point de tout ma chere fille no man is wise or brave at all times and i shall only smile at my late defeat if i can but triumph here  taking hold of her hand clarinda pshaw let me go it would be scandalous in me to submit to a beaten general  conquest is the road to conquest both in love and war and the illustrious name of our victorious leader has been a legion added to our troops english women as well as men choose to list under a brave commander   sir harry vastly severe and piquant truly but i shall have my reprisals some other time   clarinda you will have better luck than you deserve then farewell poor recreant knight   sir harry adieu ma bizarre  exeunt severally scene v the street before lady franklands house enter sir william sir william love and jealousy are twins i find born in the selfsame moment what transports have i felt what agonies endured within a few short hours that angel form which blessed my eyes and ears this morn ere noon transformed into a mortal object surrounded by a crowd of coxcombs by heaven she freely gave her hand to lord mountfashion and suffered him to lead her from that vulgar scene of hurry noise and nonsense i will see if she is returned raps at the door and enter nicodemus is your lady at home friend   nicodemus noa sir ise wish she were for servants are all well yclemmed and cook says dinners aspoiling  madam emilias at home though if your honor pleases to walk in   sir william no friend it is very well exit nicodemus and shuts the door and yet i think i will go in and wait for her  raps again nicodemus soa sir what mun you want now   sir william i have changed my mind and will go in to wait for your ladys return   nicodemus youse welcome ise swear youse a person of quality for they never know their own minds aside do walk in sir pray  exeunt scene vi a dressing room emilia painting enter sir william sir william after the declaration you made this morning it surprises me madam to find you in this retired situation   emilia one often says more sir william as well as less than they think according to the degree of spirits they happen to be in i confess myself a rattle and have vivacity enough to be fond of public places yet i very soon tire of them and frequently prefer the gaiety of these little objects which i can create with my pencil and the enjoyment of my own thoughts to the more glaring shadows which surround me abroad and no thought at all it is vastly pleasant to think sometimes sir william   sir william they are indeed truly unhappy who do not find it so guilt alone can make reflection painful   emilia i must differ with you sir william for i really know many good sort of people who i am sure have nothing to reproach themselves with yet for want of an early habit dread sitting alone as much as if they feared spirits and would run into any kind of company rather than endure their own   sir william charming sensible unaffected girl aside he must be a happy man emilia who shall share the pleasures of retirement with a companion lively and rational as you   emilia pray do not make me vain sir william perhaps no body may have it so much in their power as you   sir william that declaration ought to make me proud madam  but i have been so charmed with your sentiments upon retirement that i almost forgot the occasion of my intruding upon yours do you know any thing of lady frankland does she dine at home   emilia i have not seen her since morning but i am so well acquainted with her ladyships regularity and politeness that i have not the least doubt of her returning to dinner looking at her watch bless me it is very late i have never known her stay so long abroad   sir william i have some little business to communicate to her ladyship and shall take the liberty of waiting on her soon after dinner  going a noise of rapping at a door within emilia o here she comes and as you say you have business i shall withdraw but pray dont detain her long sir william for i am vastly hungry  exit lady frankland speaking before she comes in lady frankland will my dear emilia excuse me this trespass on her patience but i vow it was not possible for me to get away from lord mountfashion one moment sooner enters sir william your servant   sir william yours madam i am surprised that his lordship could part with you even now madam i did suppose you had been gone to dine with him at lady fanshaws or some other of his lordships fond admirers   lady frankland i dont understand you sir william i should certainly have dined abroad if i had happened to have one of my own servants with me to have sent home to emilia i did not expect the favor of your company sir therefore cannot charge myself with any want of politeness toward you   sir william want of politenefs madam is that a term to me whose heart strings you have strained and taught to feel more racking agonies than ever damien knew keep your politeness for your lord mountfashion madam i hoped i had an higher claim   lady frankland are these the sentiments sir william which gave that claim where is that nice respect those soft expressions of friendship and esteem which pleaded for that claim   sir william vanished madam fled in the moment that you gave your hand to that same peregrine lord   lady frankland delusion all they never yet existed in your breast selflove alone assumed the form of sentimental passion and has imposed on you but never shall again on me   sir william cruel unkind vain metaphysical distinction you know i would sacrifice a thousand lives to please you detach myself from the whole universe and give up every thought to you and you alone is this selflove   lady frankland true love requires no sacrifice but the heart self love must have its triumphs suspicion is its constant mate and the least degree of complaisance shown to another object appears a robbery to selfish minds in short there can be no slavery equal to that a jealous lover would impose   sir william i madam i render you a slave you madam whose empire is so absolutely over me   lady frankland sir william i shall ever acknowledge the highest obligations to you you have drawn me from the verge of a precipice into which my own imprudence had like to have plunged me  i awake from an illusion and can dream no more  be my friend still this is the only rank that you can ever hold in my regards   sir william heavens madam what crime have i committed that you should wish my death   lady frankland far from it sir william i wish your happiness so far as it may not be inconsistent with my own and by depriving you of all right to be jealous i lay you under the happy necessity of ceasing to be so i begin to dread the violence of your temper and what we fear we cannot love   sir william i begin to know you madam in my turn the refinement of a platonic passion but ill agrees with the slightness of your conduct sir harry wilmot would have been a more suitable lover and i was certainly wrong to interfere    lady frankland stop there sir william i know already how much i am indebted to you upon that occasion and shall therefore retire to save you the confusion of having reproached me with an obligation which even this behavior cannot cancel nor shall i forget  exit sir william distraction what have i done upbraided lady frankland she is she must be irrecoverably lost to me but by what bond could i have hoped to hold her platonics i am now convinced are all a jest and her virtue and my own honor both forbid all other ties  accursed jealousy too well you prove the fallacy of sentimental love if for themselves alone we sought the fair kindness to others would not cause despair but when selflove begins to warp the mind we dread a rival in each passing wind  end of the fourth act act v scene i lady frankland s dressing room lady frankland and emilia lady frankland my dearest emilia i have now opened my whole soul to you my mind is a perfect chaos yet i feel as if a weight had been taken off my breast by this most fortunate breach with sir william oh my emilia how near have i been to ruin i am frighted even at the prospect   emilia you should contemplate it rather with that kind of pleasure with which they view the wreck who have just escaped the storm with a proper sense toward providence and a steady purpose never to run the same risque again   lady frankland humbled as i now am emilia such resolutions are natural and bare remembrance of the peril i have escaped must certainly insure my perseverance but alas my friend have i not reason to accuse my fate for turning those advantages which are deemed a blessing to my sex into a curse for me youth beauty innocence and sensibility to what have ye reduced me to become the sport of foppery or victim of jealousy is this the world i have been taught to admire for what illusions have i strayed from real happiness which i am now convinced is only to be found in the calm indulgence of rational affections in the repose rather than tumult of the soul   emilia i rejoice to find that the natural good sense of my amiable friend has been only hoodwinked but not blinded and that she can so clearly see her errors now   lady frankland yes wretch that i am i see them but too late after i have forfeited the friendship the confidence and regards of the best of men and husbands thank heaven though that i have nothing to reproach myself with except imprudence and yet emilia can i hope that lord frankland should take my word for this or even condescend to listen to my justification how i detest the writers of romance oh emilia it is but too easy to swerve from the right path but difficult indeed to recover it again   emilia why difficult the little deviation you have made requires no artful clue there are no bars against you but those your fears create lord frankland is still the same tender affectionate husband he has ever been and gave a proof of it this morning by requesting you to quit all farther intimacy with clarinda whom he seems to think no safe companion for your honor   lady frankland another precipice an angels guard has surely hovered over me o were he to forbid my converse with all the world with light itself with every thing but thee nay nay even with thee emilia his will should be obeyed   emilia my heart exults at finding yours so sensible of duty o lady frankland you have indeed escaped from many dangers yet unknown nor can a wife ever find a place of safety but under the protection of that heavenappointed guard her husband lose not a moment then but let us fly to your asylum  that generous man who has ever pitied and bewailed your errors will open wide his arms to your returning virtue   lady frankland alas emilia a certain native pride or rather conscious shame which generous minds alone are capable of restrains my steps i must first endeavor to be reconciled to myself before i can even hope for his forgiveness  enter nicodemus nicodemus mr ambrose is come to wait upon your ladyship   lady frankland in a lucky minute sure a thought has just

see your ladyship for some time past though i have called here daily by my lords command   lady frankland i am obliged to his lordship and to you also mr ambrose   ambrose o madam would it were within my power to oblige your ladyship your poor old servant would lay down his life to show his duty   lady frankland then ambrose you have it in your power to do me a most essential service   ambrose your ladyship has but to command and i obey would to heaven that my lord and you loved yourselves but as well as i love either of you i know not which of you was to blame but i am sure my heart bleeds for you both how it used to delight me to see you together it was a blessed sight and since your separation i have seen nothing but affliction in our house   lady frankland i take the blame upon myself good ambrose yet i have hopes my fault may be repaired if you will but implicitly follow my directions   ambrose doubtless madam i shall obey   lady frankland you know that my picture remains still in my lords house   ambrose ay madam and my lord knows it too full well he shuts himself up with it whole days gazes on it talks to it then sighs enough to break ones heart to hear him  it is all his company and consolation now  i dare not speak but    lady frankland your words pierce through my soul i have not merited this kindness i thought his heart insensible and cold dead to all tenderness for me but let his generous foftness quicken mine ambrose you must steal that picture for me and bring it hither this very instant unseen by mortal eye   ambrose what madam rob my master of his only treasure bid me lay down my life and i will obey   lady frankland be assured i do not mean to deprive him of it this evening you shall replace it in my husbands chamber my sole request is that you will not let him know it has been moved you cannot refuse me sure   ambrose your ladyship is goodness itself and i cannot suppose you would put an end to my life by the grief it would give me to afflict or offend the best of masters  i will then instantly obey your ladyships commands  but pray good lady remember that it must be restored this very evening   lady frankland you may rely upon my promise indeed good ambrose  exit ambrose to hymens sacred power though late an ardent votary i bend  oh may he prosper and assist my purpose  exit scene ii an apartment in lady fanshaw s house lady fanshaw and clarinda clarinda i cannot tell you how much i am disappointed at the folly of that coxcomb sir harry  i had great hopes that his spirited assurance might have conquered her timid bashfulness and a breach once made in that bastion the citadel falls of course i begin to fear she will conterwork us all and either keep the fortress in her own hands or perhaps deliver it back again to the former governor in statu quo   lady fanshaw i cannot agree with you clarinda though even sir harry has failed for i dare swear no woman ever parted from her husband with a design of playing the drude with all the rest of the world i fancy now that sir william will carry the town  not by storm indeed but by starving the besieged into terms of capitulation   clarinda i dont understand your ladyship   lady fanshaw why then in plainer english sir william is grown jealous and will if possible prevent any other man from coming near her by this means she will find herself prisoner and may then probably surrender her person to obtain her liberty en parole at least   clarinda you deal still in tropes lady fanshaw   lady fanshaw ay but you understand me for all that clarinda you know full well that when a woman puts herself into the power of a man he becomes a tyrant she a slave from that moment and all the difference i can find between marriage and gallantry is that one is perpetual the other temporary only   clarinda i care not by what means her ruin is accomplished provided it be accomplished her fatal marriage with lord frankland blasted all my hopes and i cannot bear to think that she should taste the heartfelt joy of her own virtue while i am deprived of that as well as of what i resigned it for   lady fanshaw nay as to that clarinda it is no such mighty matter that one need wish to rob her of it for we both know with regard to the world the appearance will answer as well as the reality but if you are bent upon her ruin blast her reputation my dear  the story you told me of the duel properly managed is sufficient to do that effectually   clarinda that alone shall destroy her fame should she even preserve her chastity which you seem to think improbable   lady fanshaw i have half a score visits to make to morrow morning and i shall take care to whisper this adventure in every one of them with the tenderest professions of pity for her misfortune and a who could have suspected it i vow i thought her perfectly innocent but i am afraid lord frankland had his reasons  though he had too much pride to publish them   clarinda this will do my dear lady fanshaw for let women value themselves ever so much upon their innocence the loss of character is next to that of virtue   lady fanshaw o much worse clarinda  but i must go and visit that simple sir harry as he is confined i own i despise him but to persons of certain ranks in life one must be civil you know   clarinda i shall send to know if lady frankland be at home if she is i will pay her a visit perhaps sir william may be there and i may possibly discover something to corroborate our story but that silly chit emilia never leaves her so that the woman wants opportunity were she ever so well inclined  i wish that girl was any how out of the way   lady fanshaw she will marry charles frankland and be a wretch  exeunt scene iii sir william belville s house sir william and his servant sir

us even i wish thomas was returned  they rise enter betty and delivers a letter to clarinda betty from lady frankland mam   clarinda to me what can it mean opens and reads lady franklands and emilias compliments to clarinda and request she will not give herself the trouble of coming any more to lady franklands house as they are under a necessity of declining her visits for reasons not proper to be explained  forbid the house this is astonishing   lady fanshaw it would almost tempt one to think they had a familiar who could discover your heart to them   betty for that matter i believe one of them is familiar enough  with the gentlemen at least if what thomas says be true   lady fanshaw why really betty gentlemen are the most agreeable familiars a lady can have   betty very true to be sure my lady but too much familiarity breeds content as the proverb says and i never should have thought of repeating what thomas told me the longest day i have to live if it was not for their hypocrisy in refusing the visits of such a sweet virtuous lady as my mistress that i have known as it were from a child but some folks have fair faces and foul hearts in troth    clarinda they had better have shut other peoples doors against me than their own for henceforth where i enter they never more shall be received  i will blast that little prudish minx emilia too i will say any thing of them both that revenge can instigate   betty upon my verily mam i cannot bear to see you so instigationed by slights and malice when if you knew but all you need not be beholding to inventions in the least mam for as sure as day and as i hope to be saved mam thomas saw a man muffled up in a disguise let in just nw to lady franklands house by her mademaselle there who to be sure and sartin is like the rest of her countrywomen no better than she should be   lady fanshaw ha clarinda this is a lucky discovery for you  i find her grave ladyship has not consined her studies entirely to romance but has dipped a little into the more practical business of novel too and seems to be a pretty apt scholar for her time truly   clarinda this secret is worth a million  who could he be   lady fanshaw it must certainly be the sly sir william   clarinda no matter who  she is now in my power and i will use the advantage  this very instant i will write to lord frankland he may command admittance though i am denied for reasons not proper to be explained and will i hope find reason to be convinced that her affected delicacy is as easily conquered as the natural openness of my too generous heart   betty i am sure it would be a burning sin and shame too not to detract and ruinate such vild hypocrite creatures for a couple of slippery heels as they are   lady fanshaw i am of opinion clarinda that your information will have but little weight with lord frankland as you may be supposed to have some interest in the discovery   clarinda you are mistaken madam he has the quickest sense of honor and will fly either to convict or acquit her  bid thomas be in the way to carry my letter exit betty what a triumph will be mine this night i shall expose and laugh to scorn the saintlike lady frankland tear off the veil

fondness and desire she urged me to this deed you would yourself have granted her request  how then could i refuse   lord frankland do not torture me but say with brevity and truth who urged you to this deed   ambrose o moderate the strong emotions of your mind and i will tell you all it was my lady frankland your lordships fond repentant faithful wife  but if the crime be past forgiveness o let your anger fall on me even drive me from your sight which of all punishments would be the saddest to me but forgive my lady   lord frankland rise ambrose rise and share your masters joy which thus runs over wiping his eyes and gazing at the picture it must be so  it was her former it is her present image quick let me fly then to this fair transformed kiss off the pearly drops from her pale cheek and dry them with the warmest sighs of love clasp those imploring hands and press that heaving bosom to my heart  exit ambrose may heaven be praised for this most blessed event i shall see my

at least he sure will pity and forgive  enter lord frankland and stands at the side of the scene gazing at her lord frankland my bounding heart springs from my breast to meet her  how beautiful she looks and oh how exquisite those charms which even the veil of sorrow cannot shade   lady frankland heavens  looking at him and falling back in her chair lord frankland is then the dearest fairest of her sex again restored to the fond heart and arms of her adoring husband  runs to catch her in his arms and embrances her lady frankland oh if not held unworthy of that blessing her wishes are complete   lord frankland unworthy said you you never were nor could be so through all the winding maze of gaiety and youth my eyes have followed still their darling object nor has my heart one moment ceased to love to pity and esteem you had the charms of pleasure or the snares of vice infatuated your heart that heart would never have sighed to turn again to me when i was first flattered at receiving the possession of it with that fair hand i claimed it as an husbands right  i now accept it as a generous gift and set the higher value on the prize   lady frankland alas my lord your tenderness and generosity overpower me  they are indeed much more than i deserve yet though blushing for my follies let me say no crime has rendered me unworthy of your goodness  my heart is free from stain and henceforth i may hope thy image there shall shield it from all future weakness   lord frankland can you suppose i doubt it while with transports such as those i clasp it to my own  embraces her enter emilia emilia my dear lady erankland joy like mine is not to be restrained by common forms  lucy this moment told me she saw lord frankland come into your dressing room and though perhaps i interrupt your happiness i must indulge my own by wishing to you both that true felicity which i well know you both deserve   lady frankland the generous friend who has shared the sorrows of my heart has a right surely to partake its joys and if my present happiness could admit addition it must be found in that which my emilia feels   lord frankland i know of naught that could increase my bliss but seeing you rejoice emilia  enter lucy lucy madam sir william belville is below and begs to speak with you immediately he says the cause of his intrusion at so late an hour will be a sufficient apology for it there is a servant of mr franklands patrick madam who says he has been at lord franklands with a letter for him but his lordship was not at home  to emilia lord frankland they were mistaken lucy for this is now my home   emilia what shall i do lady frankland   lady frankland see him by all means emilia there must be some uncommon cause for such an illtimed visit   lord frankland desire him to walk in here lucy every mark of politeness is due to his character  exit lucy emilia what business mr franklands servant can have with sir william or with me i can not imagine   lady frankland a little time will explain this mystery emilia  enter sir william patrick and lucy sir william i am extremely happy at finding your lordship here as i am persuaded this meeting must render lady frankland and you so and as the affair which brings me hither concerns the honor of your lordships family for which reason i meant to have waited on you at your house   lord frankland sir william i am very glad to see you upon any occasion but i think i have as little to fear on the account you mention as any man for i happen not to be blessed with any female relations but those ladies who now stand before you   sir william then my lord you may indeed boast your having nothing to be alarmed at from feminine connections for if virtue and innocence were to become embodied and choose their forms they would be those of lady frankland and emilia  but your lordship has i think a male relation counselor frankland   patrick augh that is my master now and faith myself is almost sorry i exposed him before such great company  aside lord frankland what of him sir william i look upon him as a very honest sensible and sober young man rather too grave for one of his age   patrick augh hone how little he knows of him  aside sir william i fear then you are deceived my lord  this honest simple fellow here his own servant this morning overheard a scheme laid between him and fontange lady franklands woman for no less than the absolute ruin of this lady  pointing to emilia emilia heavens how i tremble   lord frankland i am unwilling to think so vilely of human nature in any instance and much more so of charles frankland in particular as to suppose this to be true what proof can you produce friend that such a villainy was ever intended  to patrick patrick upon my safe conscience my lord my own two ears heard them talk about it in my masters chambers and that ugly jade that madame fontange was to get a good thousand pounds for assisting him in carrying her off   lord frankland i cannot be persuaded that charles is such a villain   patrick why my lord if he is not in the house this very instant why then patricks a liar and never believe him more aughhone myself is sorry enough for his doing such a bad thing and it would break my heart to see him go to tyburn for it among a parcel of dirty blackguard highwaymen that would lose their life for five or six guineas and not among gentlemen like himself that would be hanged for killing their friend in a fair quarrel or running handsomely away with their mistress but upon my own soul though it would be a thousand pities to ruin that sweet creture for all that   lord frankland if charles be found in the house emilia i fear the rest of the story is then too true yet as the crime has not been perpetrated i would wish to save him both from the shame as well as the punishment he deserves i will go search and bring him from his hold   sir william i request your lordship will allow me and this honest fellow to attend you if it be only to approve our truth   lord frankland by no means sir william your honor has been proved sufficiently in the detection his servants honesty shall be rewarded  exit patrick great luck to your lordship   emilia how is it possible sir william to repay this service   sir william i shall ever consider it as the greatest happiness of my life that it has been in my power to render you any madam and if it might not appear to be presuming too much upon the present incident i should entreat you to accept all the future services of my life i rejoice to find your ladyship has led the way into the only path to real happiness  to lady frankland lady frankland i have not the least doubt of your generosity sir william and shall ever be ready with true gratitude to own my obligations   sir william if your ladyship thinks you have any it is in your power to overpay them now by joining me to request the fair emilia to accept my hand and heart both your ladyship and i have seen the error of imagining they can be separated   lady frankland i allow it sir william and as i know no person so capable of rendering my emilia happy i entreat    emilia my dear lady frankland i will not make a merit of granting that to your request which i think sir williams own deserts have a right to claim   sir william the generous manner of conferring would if possible double the obligation  enter lord frankland lord frankland i have secured the poor unhappy wretch to save him from himself   sir william then it was true my lord   lord frankland too true sir i made his vile accomplice trembling and scared convey me to the place where he lay concealed but when he saw me stand before him guilt and confusion flashed into his face  he thought it was an apparition and stiffened quite with horror i closed upon him instantly and seized the pistols which lay by his side he then fell on his knees confessed his crime and begged that i would give him from my hand that death which he deserved   emilia i grieve to think my lord this happy hour should have been interrupted by such a sad event   lord frankland it is rather sure an addition to my bliss that you are saved from misery emilia  but to sir william belville your first and greatest thanks are due   emilia if he is not satisfied with my payments my lord he must even take out a statute of bankruptcy against me for i have already surrendered to him every thing i was mistress of   lord frankland then i give him joy with all my heart   emilia as for you honest patrick i think the least return i can make you for saving my life and honor is to present you with the same sum that fontange was to have had for destroying both   patrick heaven bless and prosper your ladyship for that patrick will carry it into his own country and that itself would be a help to poor ireland for every one has a pluck at it and would be glad to take all they can get from it and no body never gives it nothing at all  enter nicodemus with a letter to lord frankland nicodemus one of your servants has just brought this from your lordships house he says the man who gave it him bid him carry it wherever you were if he should not meet with your honor at home  exit lord frankland have i permission  they all bow and he opens the letter and looks at the bottom from clarinda reads the letter malicious woman oh let the venomed shaft with which she meant to wound my tenderest part now lodge in her own breast aside gives the letter to lady frankland you see my dear i had sufficient cause to warn you against this dangerous woman and i am pleased to find that her resentment has arisen from your kind attention to my desire in forbidding her your house  exit lady frankland this fortunate deliverance with every other successful event of my future life may add to my happiness but cannot increase that love and gratitude with which my heart overflows to thee its generous protector and its surest guide  enter nicodemus nicodemus please your ladyship mademoiselle has got out of the window of the room where his lordship left her thoa ise have the key safe enough in my pocket  shall i go after and lug her back   lord frankland no let the wretch escape the disappointment of her avarice be the punishment of her crime but henceforth i entreat my dearest wife will never employ foreigners again while there are persons in our own country both in trade and service sufficient to supply our uses   lady frankland in this and every thing else my pride and pleasure shall be to obey my dearest lord  too plainly have i proved that unconfined our little skiff is tossed by every wind on rocks and quicksands often is it cast and frequent sunk by cruel slanders blast but when our pilot at the helm appears with steady hand and compass when he steers in full security we sail with ease and fear nor driving winds nor raging seas  finis epilogue the writer unknown  enter mrs clive with an epilogue in her hand oh
