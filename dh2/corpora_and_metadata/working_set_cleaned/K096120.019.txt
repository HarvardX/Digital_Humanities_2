booksellers  mdccxcvi  a descriptive account of switzerland continued chap v town and canton of friburgh the canton of friburgh contains a small portion of arable land but abounds in pastures and accordingly its principal articles of exportation consist in horned cattle cheese butter and hides  the cheese well known under the name of gruyere which is exported in such large quantities is made in a chain of mountains in this canton about ten leagues in length and four in breadth all the cheese though made in the same manner is not of the same quality a difference probably arising from the diversity of the soil the same plants not growing at all heights and the lower pastures called gites being not in such high estimation for their goodness as those in the more elevated situations  the whole district is divided into greater or lesser farms which the proprietors let out in leases of three or six years at the annual rent of    shillings to  0 shillings during five months for each cow according to the nature or elevation of the ground the lower pastures though not of the best quality are the dearest because being sooner free from the snow and later covered with it they afford food to cattle for a longer space  each farmer having rented a mountain hires from the different peasants in the canton from  0 to  0 cows from the   th of may to the  th of october he pays from the rate of from l   to l     per head and each cow upon an average yields from  0 to    quarts of milk per day and supplies  00 pounds of cheese during the five months on the   th of october the farmer restores the cows to the different proprietors the cattle are then pastured in the meadows which have been twice mowed until the  0th or   th of november when on account of the snow they are usually removed to the stables and fed during winter with hay and aftergrass  as the mountains in the canton of friburgh afford pasture for at least   000 cows it may be estimated that they annually supply about  0000 hundred weight of cheese fit for exportation besides  000 or  000 on their return from the mountains exclusive of a thinner sort which is made in various parts of the canton the cheeses fit for exportation weigh from  0 to  0 pounds each and are sold from l    to l  per hundred weight besides the cows which are pastured during summer in the mountains the canton contains about  0000 belonging to the several landholders which supply their families with milk  the buildings necessary for making the cheeses consist of a chalet or cottage which contains a room with a furnace for the purpose of boiling the milk a cellar where the milk is preserved and a stable for  0 or  0 cows near it is a kind of dairyroom kept in an equal degree of temperature where the cheeses are every day turned and salted the thickness of the vat in which each cheese is pressed is about four inches the casks for exportation contain ten cheeses except those destined for italy which hold only three in order to be conveyed by mules across the great s bernard the cheeses well packed up bear transporting into the most distant countries they ought to be kept in a damp place and frequently washed with white wine for the purpose of preserving them from insects when the cows return from the mountains a species of cream cheese is made in autumn and even in winter it is much esteemed and is dearer than that of gruyerres  the greatest part of the salt used on these occasions is drawn from franche comte a small quantity from lorraine and bavaria but its quality is much inferior the consumption of the whole canton for all purposes is at least  0000 hundred weight of which   000 is drawn from franche comte  a great number of mares foals and horned cattle are annually raised in the canton the oxen of three or four years old are sold in the canton of berne in the country of neuchatel and in franche comte upon an average it may be estimated that the canton of friburgh annually supplies pasture for   000 cows and oxen  in the whole canton of friburgh are seven towns the inhabitants of which speak a kind of patois or corrupt medley of german and french but in the town of friburgh the pure german prevails among persons of rank that language being used in the council the two churches and in all public instruments  friburgh the capital though not one of the most beautiful towns is certainly one of the most picturesque and wild in switzerland it stands partly in a small plain partly on bold acclivities and on a ridge of rugged rocks half encircled by the river sane it is so entirely concealed by the circumjacent hills that the traveller scarce catches the smallest glimpse of it until he bursts upon a view of the whole town from the overhanging eminence  the fortifications which consist of high stone walls and towers enclose a circumference of about four miles within which space the eye comprehends a singular mixture of houses rocks thickets and meadows varying instantly from wild to agreeable from the bustle of a town to the solitude of the deepest retirement  on all sides the descent to the town is extremely steep in one place the streets even pass over the roofs of the houses many of the edifices are raised in regular gradation like the seats of an amphitheatre many overhang the edge of a precipice in such a manner that on looking down a weak head would be apt to turn giddy and an unfortunate lover repulsed in his suit might instantly put an end to his pains by taking a leap from the parlour window without the trouble of a journey to leucate or to the rocks of meillerie  the houses of friburgh are neat and well built but the whole town has a dull and inanimate appearance among the few objects worthy of particular notice are the cathedral an elegant gothic edifice erected in the latter end of the   th century and remarkable for the height and solidity of the tower the town house an ancient building which formerly composed part of the palace belonging to the duke of zoeringen and also a lime tree in the middle of the principal square tradition reports that this tree was instantly planted by one of the soldiers the   d of june      on his return from the battle of morat an emblem of swiss liberty which took deep root on the memorable defeat of charles the bold and thus remaining firm against the conflicts of time has continued to spread and flourish to the admiration and example of future ages  the college of jesuits says addison is reckoned the finest in all switzerland there is a great deal of room in it and several beautiful views from different parts of it they have a collection of pictures representing most of the fathers of their order who have been eminent for their piety or learning among the rest many englishmen whom we name rebels and they martyrs henry garnets inscription says that when the heretics could not prevail with him either by threats or promises to change his religion they hanged and quartered him at the capuchins is the escargotiere which is the more remarkable as nothing of the kind is to be met with in other countries it is a square place boarded in and filled with a vast quantity of large snails that are esteemed excellent food when they are well dressed the floor is strewed about half a foot deep with several kinds of plants among which the snails nestle all the winter season when lent arrives they open their magazines and take out of them the best meagre food in the world for there is no dish that they reckon comparable to a ragout of snails  about a league from friburgh is an hermitage which has been highly extolled by travelers on account of its singularity it is formed in the solid rock and the chief curiosity consists in its having been the work of two men as such it is an astonishing performance but in any other respect it is hardly worth visiting in the last century a hermit scooped out a hollow in this rock just sufficient for him to lie at his full length but his successor desiring a more commodious apartment hewed in the heart of the mountain a chapel several apartments staircases etc the length of the whole is above  00 feet one room is  0 feet long and  0 broad the steeple of this chapel if it may be so called is  0 feet high and the chimney of the kitchen  0 the hermit who perforated this dwelling was near  0 years at the work what an incredible waste of time and industry but such is the folly of sequestered superstition that for want of better occupations to employ the mind it frequently has recourse to laborious trifles the situation of this hermitage is beautiful the rock in which it is cut hangs over the river saine which meandring through two chains of hills covered with wood fills up all the valley beneath  this canton is entirely catholic it is supposed to contain above  0000 inhabitants without including the town of friburgh in which there are  000 the commerce here is too inconsiderable to be mentioned and literature is by no means in a more flourishing state this canton draws considerable subsidies from france both in money and salt and it is computed that in proportion to its size none of the other cantons have so many troops in that service  the government of the canton of friburgh is entirely aristocratic the sovereign and legislative authority being vested in the great council consisting of  00 the members of which are chosen from that council and from a few patrician families this government resembles the other aristocratic states of switzerland the most remarkable circumstance that distinguishes it is the mode of electing the members of the secret and of the little council the names of the candidates are privately placed in a box containing as many divisions as there are persons who solicit the vacant office in one of these partitions the electors put in their ballot as chance directs without knowing to which of the candidates they may happen to give their vote he who has most of these casual ballots is elected  chap vi town and canton of zuric the learned scheuchzer calls this canton an epitome of all switzerland as containing in it hills valleys plains cornlands vineyards lakes rivers vegetables of all kinds and whatever else is necessary to the support of life grain is cultivated all over the country but it ripens later in the mountainous parts where the air is colder than in the levels or sunny valleys the hilly grounds in the east west and south borders afford a specimen of the fertile alps as abounding in milk cattle butter and cheese and toward schafhausen and the county of turgau is a wine country fruits also are every where found here and very good  the lake of zuric is the largest in all this canton and even one of the largest in switzerland it is of an oblong form and between  0 and  0 miles in length but not more than four in breadth the prospect from it is delightful the little eminences by which it is bordered being diversified with towns villages cornfields and vineyards and behind these is every where a gradual ascent of larger hills terminating in the stupendous mountains of glarus schweitz and the grisons the summits of which are always covered with ice and snow  the proportion of grain to the other productions of the earth will appear from the following calculation there are    000 acres laid out in grain   000 in vines   000 in meadows   000 in pasturages and  0 000 in forest  the canton contained in             souls including  0 00 in the capital this large population in proportion to the size of the canton is owing to the trade of zuric as at least two thirds of the inhabitants derive their livelihood by spinning thread and silk and making linen for the manufactures of the town  as sufficient corn is not produced for so large a population the deficiency is chiefly supplied from swabia and in order to prevent a scarcity of so material an article a public granary is maintained at the expense of government the grain is retailed at the common price but in seasons of scarcity it is sold considerably cheaper than it can be purchased at the market the good effects of this establishment appeared in a scarcity of scorn in the year      when on account of its dearness a pound of bread was sold for ten pence the same quantity was delivered by government for fourpence  in the list of those cantons in which abundance is visible says de langle that of zuric ought not to be forgotten the clothes of the poorest people are not disfigured with either rents or dirt they possess good stockings good shoes and good linen i have traversed this canton several times  i have frequently seen the shirts and shifts hung out to dry and of  0 i have scarce perceived three to have a single darn in them  nor is there a town here however small it may be where there is not a flesh market an ox bleeding under the knife of a butcher seems to lose all its horrors in the villages of this canton  a peasant eat beef what a theme adds de langle for bitter reflections to the inhabitants of cities who but too frequently can scarce procure bread  the houses however do not correspond with the neatness and rural luxury of their garments the furniture and utensils of cookery the instruments of labor and the vessels of wood and earthenware are far from numerous the generality of the towns and villages are illbuilt  the houses constructed of wood  and the roofs badly covered scarce exclude the burning rays of the sun or the rigours of cold and the inconveniences of wind and rain almost the whole of them are without doors and the inhabitants enter by the window  the city of zuric stands at the northern extremity of the lake and occupies both sides of the rapid and transparent limmat its environs are extremely delightful and exhibit an amphitheatre of hills gradually sloping to the borders of the water enriched with pasture and vines dotted with innumerable villas cottages and hamlets and backed on the west by a bold and gloomy ridge of mountains which rises gradually toward the alps  the town is divided into two parts the old part surrounded with the same ancient battlements and towers which existed in the   th century and the suburbs which are strengthened by fortifications in the modern style but too extensive the ditches instead of being filled with stagnant water are mostly supplied with running streams the public walk is pleasantly situated in a lawn at the junction of the limmat and the sil an impetuous and turbid torrent which descends from the mountains of einsidlin two rows of lime trees planted by the side of the limmat and following its serpentine direction afford an agreeable shade in the heat of summer the inhabitants are very industrious and carry on with success several manufactures the principal are those of linens cottons muslins and silk handkerchiefs the manufacturers do not in general dwell within the walls but the materials are mostly prepared and the work is completed in the adjacent districts for this reason zuric does not exhibit the activity and numbers of a great commercial city the environs on the contrary are so extremely populous that perhaps few districts in the neighborhood of a town whose population scarcely exceeds  0000 inhabitants contain within so small a compass so many souls the streets are mostly narrow the houses and public buildings accord more with plainness and convenience than with the elegance and splendour of a capital  the increase of luxury and opulence will appear from considering that in      the number of menservants amounted to only    and of maidservants to     whereas in    0 the former were     and the latter      or near a fifth of the whole population in      the amount of the whole population was   000 inhabitants and in    0 there were  0000 inhabitants and upwards  the manners of the inhabitants are in general simple and may perhaps in these times be esteemed antiquated dinner is usually served at    in the afternoon the gentlemen assemble in clubs or small societies in the town during winter and at their respective villas in summer they frequently smoke and partake of wine fruit cakes and other refreshments the women for the most part employed in their domestic occupations or devoted to the improvement of their children are not fond of visiting when they go out they generally assemble in separate coteries to which only a few men and those chiefly the nearest relations are admitted many of the ladies indeed from a consciousness of their provincial accent and a difficulty of expressing themselves in french seldom make their appearance when strangers are received  this reserve however among the ladies begins greatly to abate and to give place to a more sociable intercourse such however is the prevalence of national habit that a few families which form a more agreeable mixture of company are considered as differing from the established customs and are still known by the name of the french society  sumptuary laws as well as those against immorality are here well observed the former indeed may exist and be carried into execution even among a people much corrupted for it may be the policy of government to enforce their observance but the severest penalties will not be sufficient to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency amidst a general dissoluteness of manners it is the popular principles that can alone invigorate such laws and give them their full operation among their sumptuary laws the use of a carriage in the town is prohibited to all sorts of persons except strangers and it is almost inconceivable that in a place so commercial and wealthy luxury should so little prevail  at zuric the original swiss spirit of independence prevails more than in any of the large towns in this country the magistrates less influenced by foreign courts and above corruption generally consult the real advantage of their canton and of the helvetic confederacy zuric still preserves in the general diet a very considerable sway which she deserves more from the opinion entertained of her integrity than from her power she is looked up to as one of the most independent and upright of the    cantons  the charitable establishments at zuric are the orphan house which is regulated with extreme attention and care an almshouse for poor burghers an hospital for incurables and that for the sick of all nations which usually contains between six or  00 patients and the allmosenamt or foundation for the poor this excellent institution puts out children as apprentices and distributes money clothes and books of devotion to poor persons as well in the town as in different parts of the canton at the recommendation of the respective ministers in      it distributed l      among the particular institutions must not be omitted the chirurgical seminary it is formed by voluntary subscriptions and meets with great encouragement  at zuric public education is a matter of state and under the immediate protection of government the principal literary establishments for the instruction of youth are the caroline college for students in divinity the college for polite literature and the school of arts the learned languages divinity natural history mathematics and in short every species of polite learning as well as abstruse science is taught at small expense in these respective seminaries  in consequence of the unremitted attention which since the reformation government has paid to the education of youth many eminent persons have flourished in all branches of literature and there is no town in switzerland where letters are more encouraged or where they have been cultivated with greater success a learned professor of zuric has in a very interesting publication displayed the important services which erudition and science have derived from the labors of his countrymen in those biographical memoirs appear among many others the names of zuingle bullinger conrad gesner hottinger simler spon scheutzer heydegger breitinger bodmer hertzel solomon gesner and lavater  the curiosity of the naturalist will be amply gratified by a view of the library and cabinet of mr john gesner professor of physics and canon of the cathedral who inherits the zeal for natural history which characterized his great ancestor conrad gesner his cabinet is extremely rich in fossils and remarkable for numerous representations of insects admirably painted by schellenberg  the society of physics owes its origin to messrs heydegger schultetz and john gesner the first regular meeting was held in      in a private house and in a few years they received the protection of government which granted the profits of a lottery toward establishing a fund there are now about a hundred and twelve members each pays on his admittance eight florins or about    shillings and the same sum annually since      a suit of apartments in a house belonging to one of the tribes has been assigned for holding their assemblies and for containing their library and apparatus  the grand and principal object of this society is the encouragement and improvement of practical agriculture for this purpose the members correspond with landholders in different parts of the canton visit various districts in rotation offer prizes for improvements in cultivation and furnish small sums of money to the poorer peasants  the public library at zuric contains about   000 volumes and a few curious manuscripts among the latter are the following   the original manuscript of quintilian found in the library of s gallen and from which the first edition of that great rhetorician was printed   the psalms in the greek tongue written on parchment dyed of a violet color the letters are silver except the initials which are in gold characters and the marginal references are red   three latin letters from lady jane gray to bullinger in           and      these letters written with her own hand breathe a spirit of the most unaffected piety and prove the extraordinary progress which this unfortunate and accomplished princess though only in the   th year of her age had made in various branches of literature the greek and hebrew quotations show that she was well acquainted with these languages this library is also rich in the best editions of the classics and particularly in the early impressions of the   th century  the sovereign power resides exclusively in the burgesses of the town consisting of about  000  the burghers beside the advantage of electing their magistrates and of aspiring to the administration of affairs enjoy the sole right of commerce all strangers and even subjects being excluded from establishing manufactures in the city or in any part of the canton  the legislative authority is vested by the burghers in the sovereign council of  00 consisting however of     members drawn from the    tribes into which the burghers are divided and comprising the senate or little council  a burgher is qualified to vote at  0 is eligible into the sovereign council at  0 and into the senate at    by these wise regulations a man must have formed some experience in public affairs before he is capable of holding an important charge  the revenues of government though not exceeding l  000 per annum are more than proportionate to the expenses which are regulated with the strictest economy the state is not only without debts but an annual saving is deposited in the public treasury for a resort upon any public emergency  zuric was the first town in switzerland that separated from the church of rome being converted by the arguments of zuingle the example of zuric was soon followed by berne schafhausen basle with part of glarus and appenzel the other cantons continuing to adhere to the religion of their ancestors in      religious disputes broke out with so much violence and animosity as to occasion a civil war in which the protestants were defeated and zuingle lost his life in the   th year of his age at the battle of cappel since that period two other religious wars have been kindled one in      in which the catholics gained the advantage and the other in      when the protestants proved victorious the peace of arace which terminated these unhappy disputes has it is to be hoped finally composed all religious animosities by that treaty it is stipulated that in all the provinces subject to cantons of different religions there shall be a perfect equality between the two sects and that they shall both enjoy the same privileges to which is added an express prohibition to each party not to use any terms of raillery or contempt in speaking of their respective worships  chap vii town and canton of lucerne lucerne originally subject to the house of austria was continually exposed to the inroads of uri schweitz and underwalden after those cantons had secured their own liberty and independence all her commerce to italy was by this means interrupted her fair unfrequented and her citizens compelled to be ever in arms in order to protect their territory from incessant depredations under these circumstances the house of austria instead of giving the citizens any effectual assistance imprudently loaded them with additional taxes as exorbitant as they were unjust the consequence was that lucerne made her peace with the confederate cantons and having soon after driven out the austrian party entered into a perpetual alliance with the canton of uri schweitz and underwalden and became a member of the helvetic confederacy  the accession of lucerne gave additional credit and power to the confederacy and enabled it in      to resist all the effort of a great and implacable enemy in that year leopold duke of austria invaded the canton with a numerous army when the combined troops gained a bloody victory at sempach in which leopold lost his life  in the accounts of this battle an instance of private valor in an individual is recorded which would have done honor to a grecian or roman name and only wants the pen of a thucydides or a livy to be equalled in fame to the exploits of the most admired heroes of antiquity the austrian army far superior in number were drawn up in firm battalion accoutred in heavy armor and furnished with long pikes which they presented before them the swiss troops were led into the attack in the form of a wedge in order to open their way into the ranks of the enemy and to break the solidity of the battalion the latter nevertheless continuing sometime impenetrable arnold de winkelseid a native of underwalden rushed alone upon the enemy to certain death and seizing as many pikes as he could grasp endeavored to force through the ranks but was killed in the attempt his patriotic valor was not exerted in vain it inflamed the swiss with new courage and taught them the best method of penetrating into the battalion which they at length effected after the most desperate efforts of invincible resolution  leopold himself might have escaped when his troops first began to give way but with a magnanimity worthy of a better fate he determined after having been a witness to the total rout of his army not to survive so ignominious a day accordingly he rushed into the thickest of the enemy and was slain  in the arsenal of this place are still preserved his armor together with a large quantity of cords which according to the tradition of the country he is said to have brought with him in order to have bound the citizens of lucerne the keeper of the arsenal displays these trophies with the same kind of triumph as the man who shows the tower of london points out the chains that were taken on board the spanish armada which he tells strangers were destined by philip ii for the principal nobility in england  the government of lucerne is entirely aristocratical or rather indeed oligarchical there are  00 citizens in the town from whom a council of  00 comprising the senate or council of state are chosen the former is the nominal sovereign but the whole power actually resides in the latter consisting of    members formed like that of zuric into two divisions which exercise the office by rotation the council of state has cognizance of criminal causes but in case of capital condemnation the sovereign council is convoked in order to pronounce the sentence a practice worthy of imitation for the condemnation of a criminal cannot be too maturely weighed and the more solemnity is used in pronouncing the sentence the greater effect it must have upon the minds of the people  as lucerne is first in rank and power among the catholic cantons all affairs relative to religion are treated in the diet which assembles in the town every year composed of the deputies of the other cantons and the popes nuncio resides here the town contains scarcely  000 inhabitants has no manufactures of any consequence and little commerce and as to learning says coxe it no where meets with less encouragement and consequently is less cultivated  the whole of what is remarkable in this town may be comprised in a very short description the cathedral and the jesuits church are the only public buildings worth observing but they are too much loaded with rich ornaments and disgraced by bad paintings in the cathedral is an organ of a fine tone and of an extraordinary size of the latter some judgment may be formed by the dimensions of the center pipe which is said to be  0 feet in length and near three in breadth and weighs   00 pounds  the bridges which skirt the town round the edge of the lake are the fashionable walks of the place and remarkable for their length they are covered at top and open at the sides by which means there is a constant view of this delightful and romantic country  the inhabitants are almost totally engaged in agriculture the southern parts of the canton being chiefly mountainous furnish for exportation cattle hides cheese and butter all the northern parts is fruitful in corn the crops of which being more than sufficient for the consumption of the whole canton there is a constant exportation of this article from the weekly market held in the town this commerce is its chief support  in lucerne is to be seen a topographical representation of part of switzerland which attracts the notice of strangers and merits the most accurate attention of the curious traveller general puiffer who is the ingenious artist of this structure is a native of the place and a general in the french service it is a model in relief and contains about  0 square leagues of the most mountainous parts of switzerland namely part of the cantons of lucerne zug and berne together with the whole of uri schweitz and underwalden this model is    feet long and nine and a half broad the principal part is composed of wax the mountains of stone and the whole is colored but what deserves more particular observation is that not only the woods of beech pine etc are differently marked but also the outward strata of the several mountains as well as their form are distinguished in this work the general employed about ten years with the utmost patience and assiduity he himself raised the plans upon the spots took the elevations of the mountains and laid them down in their several proportions the plan is so minutely exact that it takes in not only all the mountains lakes rivers towns villages and forests but every cottage every torrent every bridge and even every cross is distinctly and accurately represented in the prosecution of this laborious performance he was twice arrested for a spy and in the popular cantons was frequently forced to work by moonlight in order to avoid the jealousy of the peasants who would have thought their liberty endangered by so exact a plan being taken of their country as he was obliged to remain for some time upon the tops of the alps where no provision could be procured he generally carried with him a few shegoats whose milk supplied him with nourishment indeed his perseverance in surmounting all the difficulties that necessarily arose in the course of this undertaking is almost inconceivable when he finished any particular part he sent for the peasants who resided near the spot especially those who hunted the chamois and bid them examine accurately each particular mountain whether it corresponded as far as the smallness of the scale would admit with its natural appearance and then by frequently retouching he corrected the deficiencies  this model exhibiting the most mountainous parts of switzerland conveys a sublime picture of an immense body of alps piled one upon another as if the story of the titans were realized and they had succeeded at least in one part of the globe in heaping an ossa upon pelion and an olympus upon ossa the general informed me says coxe and it is somewhat remarkable that the top of the alps which cross switzerland in the same line are nearly of the same level or in other words there are continued chains of mountains of the same elevation rising in progression to the highest range and from thence gradually descending in the same proportion toward italy  lucerne says martyn is situated at the extremity of a most beautiful lake where the river reuss issues from it this river separates the town into two unequal parts which are connected by three bridges one wide for carriages and two narrow covered ones for foot passengers besides these there is a fourth over an arm of the lake to pass to the cathedral three of these bridges have old bad paintings of the dance of death and the history of the bible and of switzerland the buildings are ancient and the streets narrow nor is lucerne populous in proportion to its extent since this is the great passage to italy by mount s gothard and the merchandise which comes from the alps on mules and is to be transported by the rivers reuss aar and rhines is all deposited here it might have a flourishing trade of arts and manufactures were it attended to  the lake of lucerne exhibits greater variety and more picturesque scenery than any other of the swiss lakes it is seven leagues long in a right line and three wide about kussnacht but the shape is very irregular the town of lucerne forms a fine object at one extremity mount pelat and the rugi are noble mountains the first well known to naturalists for the variety of its plants and fossils the second peculiarly fitted to give a view over great part of switzerland at the foot of this is the smallest republic and perhaps the most perfect democracy in europe that of gersaw the inhabitants are about  000 it is absolutely independent and under the protection of the four cantons the scenery of that part which is called the lake of uri is particularly sublime it is narrow and edged on both sides with the most wild and romantic rocks with woods of beech and pine down to the very waters edge  but this lake is particularly interesting for having been the theater whereon the independency of switzerland was originally planned here is the chapel of william tell on a rock jutting out into the lake under a hanging wood and the village of brunnen where the treaty of      was signed between uri schweitz and underwalden schweitz the capital of the canton is but two miles from it  the canton of lucerne holds the third place among the    and is the head of the catholic cantons though less than zuric and consequently less than berne it is however far more extensive than any of the rest being    or    leagues long and eight broad the population is estimated at  00000 the difference between zuric and lucerne is very striking there every body is employed in useful arts and manufactures here all is gay and pleasure seems the only pursuit  chap viii town and canton of soleure soleure is pleasantly situated on the aar which here expands its banks and opens into a fine broad river it is a small but extremely neat town and is surrounded by regular stone fortifications erected in the beginning of the present century their walls enclose a circumferance of scarcely more than  0 square acres and including the suburbs contain about  000 souls among the most remarkable objects of curiosity in this town is the new church of s urs it is a noble edifice of whitish gray stone drawn from the neighboring quarries which admits a polish and is a species of rude marble the lower part of the building is of the corinthian the upper of the composite order the facade which consists of a portico surmounted by an elegant tower presents itself finely at the extremity of the principal street pizoni was the architect and the expense amounted to at least l 0000 a considerable sum for so small a republic whose revenues scarce surpass l  000 per annum a picture by rubens and his scholars in the church of the cordeliers and one by le saeur in that of the capuchins deserve perhaps to be noticed by the traveller who is fond of the fine arts the townhouse is not in itself worthy of observation but is mentioned only as being the place of meeting for the great council and senate  the public prison newly constructed is a solid edifice of stone and is well adapted to the purpose of the building the prisoners being confined in separate cells although the penal laws are severe in theory yet the judicial sentences in criminal affairs are so remarkably mild that a prisoner on his acquital wrote the following inscription on the wall of his cell he who is inclined to rob and escape hanging let him rob in the canton of soleure the jesuits church is famous for its paintings stuccowork and frontispiece toward which lewis xiv gave  0000 livres  the public library deserves to be mentioned not for the number or rarity of the volumes but for the literary zeal of the abbe herman a canon of the cathedral to whom it owes its origin in      there was no public collection of books but a few years ago that ingenious ecclesiastic amassed about  00 volumes from his own and his friends stock obtained from government an apartment in the townhouse where he deposited them and requested to be appointed librarian but without a salary his petition being granted he continued to augment his little collection and from this small beginning has increased it already to   000 books among which are above   0 printed in the   th century at the two extremities of the room are inscribed the names of the benefactors to the library as yet there is no fund established for its support or augmentation  the abbe has also begun to form a cabinet of medals which though small will increase like the library great merit is due to the abbe for having given birth to this collection at first alone and unsupported and in so disinterested a manner as his income does not exceed l 0 per annum and in a town where literature is not much encouraged this learned ecclesiastic is now employed in writing an account of soleure at the period of the reformation and in collecting ample materials for a complete history of the canton  with respect to natural history the only cabinet in the town is that formed by senator wallier it is a small collection but well chosen and particularly interesting to the naturalist who travels into those parts because the ingenious collector has confined himself chiefly to the minerals and petrefactions of the canton  the environs of this city are planted with very fine walks and the circumjacent country is exceedingly pleasing and diversified and exhibits several points of view which are as agreeable as wild and as pleasing as romantic among these is the situation of a hermitage about half a mile from the town which is remarkably striking it is a most agreeable recess at the extremity of a small wood and between two ridges of bare perpendicular rocks watered by a lively stream one extremity is closed by a small wood and the other opens into fertile grounds backed by the dark mountains of jura  the canton of soleure is nearly twelve leagues in length and seven in its greatest breadth stretching partly through the plain and partly along the ridges of the jura its population may amount to between  0 and  0000 souls of which the capital contains about  000 all the inhabitants of the canton are catholics  the government is aristocratical upon much the same plan as that of lucerne and of fribourg the patrician families are in possession of all the public employments the sovereign council consists of     members from which the senate or acting council consisting of    is elected  the revenues of this government and the stipends of the numerous places held under it are by no means small so that the chief families derive from the several parts they possess very profitable emoluments  the soil of this canton is exceedingly fertile and those districts which lie within the jura abound in excellent pasture but there is a great want of hands for all the purposes of agriculture nevertheless the ground is so particularly favorable to corn that a third part of the yearly produce may be exported without the least detriment to the public the trade both of the town and the canton is of little value although they are very commodiously situated for carrying on an extensive commerce  the french ambassador to the helvetic body resides in this town and distributes from hence those annual pensions or subsidies which the court of france stipulated by treaty to pay the cantons they amount to about  0000 pounds a year  on the road between berne and solure is a monument erected by the republic of berne which tells us the story of an englishman who is not to be met with in any of our own writers the inscription is in latin verse on one side of the stone and in german on the other the substance of it is this one cussinus an englishman to whom the duke of austria had given his sister in marriage came to take her from among the swiss by force of arms but after having ravaged the country for some time he was here overthrown by the canton of berne  chap ix town and canton of basle to the east this canton is bounded by the frickthal to the south and west by the canton of soleure and to the north by the margravate of baden durlach and by rheinfalden a foreign district in austria  from basle as far as lichstal and sissach the whole country abounds in corn and wine but beyond it is extremely mountainous cold and even barren except that on these mountains and in the valleys are the most beautiful pastures covered with cattle in the city of basle are diverse medicinal springs and in the rest of the country baths of approved virtue  in the whole canton are three towns and it has constantly persevered in the profession of protestantism ever since the introduction of that religion in       basle the capital is beautifully situated upon the banks of the rhine near the point where that river which here becomes very broad deep and rapid after flowing some way from east to west turns suddenly to the north it consists of two towns joined together by a long bridge the large town lies on the side of switzerland and the small town on the opposite banks of that river it stands very favorably for commerce an advantage which the inhabitants have by no means neglected for they have established a great variety of manufactures particularly of ribbands and cottons and an extensive trade is carried on by the principal merchants  the cathedral is an elegant gothic building but strangely disfigured by a daubing of rosecoloured paint spread over the whole edifice  in this church are deposited under a marble tomb the venerable remains of the great erasmus this distinguished writer joined to superior learning and a peculiar elegance of style the keenest wit which he pointed not only against the vices and ignorance of the monks but the general corruption and disorders of the roman church he was indeed the forerunner of luther in his first attack upon the catholics respecting the sale of indulgences but afterward when the controversy appeared more serious and an open breach with the court of rome seemed inevitable he condemned the proceedings of that bold reformer erasmus reflected much honor upon this town by choosing it as the favorite place of his residence and publishing from hence the greatest part of his valuable works in the public library are preserved with great veneration several of his letters his last testament written with his own hand as also his hanger and seal  the university of basle founded by pope pius ii in      was formerly eminent in the literary history of europe if it has fallen from its pristine state of renown its decline must be principally imputed to the casual method of electing the professors but it still boasts several members who do honor to their native town by their learning and abilities  the public library contains a small collection of books chiefly remarkable for several rare and valuable editions particularly of those printed in the   th century the most curious manuscripts are numerous letters of the first reformers and of other learned men in the   th   th and   th centuries and an account of the proceedings at the council of basle  in a suit of rooms belonging to this library is a cabinet of petrefactions some ancient medals and gems a few antiquities found at augst a large number of prints and some fine drawings and paintings consisting chiefly of originals by holbein who was a native of this town these pictures are most of them in the highest preservation the connoisieur can here trace all the different manners of holbein and compare the productions of his youth with those of his maturer age  among the works of holbein that discover the liveliness of his fancy must be mentioned the sketches which he drew on perusing the eulogium of folly by erasmus upon the margin of that work which he had received as a present from the author this curious volume is preserved in the library with great attention and has been lately published in french latin and german by m haas with facsimilies of the original designs engraved on wood  the dance of death in the churchyard of the predicants of the suburbs of s john is frequently shown to strangers as being of holbeins pencil it is painted in oil colors upon a wall enclosing the burial ground but as it has been retouched several times no traces are discoverable of that great masters hand in fact the hon horace walpole and other unquestionable judges have proved that this performance was painted before holbein and that he was not employed even in retouching it  basle is the largest and seems formerly to have been one of the most populous towns in switzerland its extent is capable of containing above  00000 inhabitants whereas it can scarcely number   000 many particular causes may have occurred to occasion this remarkable decrease of people but the following is the principal reason to which it may be assigned  it is proved from undoubted calculations that in all great cities the number of burials exceeds that of births consequently unless this unequal proportion is compensated by a constant accession of new inhabitants in process of time every great town must necessarily become depopulated now the citizens of basle are so jealous of the burghership and pride themselves so much upon the privileges which accompany it that they seldom deign to confer it upon foreigners a supply therefore to balance this gradual waste of people can never be derived from an influx of strangers where they are not permitted to carry on commerce or follow any trade a few years ago some of the magistrates procured a law by which the freedom of the town and the right of burghership was allowed to be conferred on strangers but it was clogged with so many restrictions as by no means to answer the purpose for which it was intended for bodies of men are seldom actuated by so generous a spirit as to sacrifice their personal and immediate advantages to the future welfare and prosperity of their country  a very remarkable singularity in this town which surprises every stranger is that all the clocks constantly go an hour faster than the real time different reasons have been assigned for this some assert that it was first practiced during the council at basle in order to assemble at an earlier hour the cardinals and bishops who being very lazy and indolent always arriving too late others maintain that a conspiracy being formed to assassinate the magistrates at midnight one of the burgomasters who had notice of the design caused the clockmaker to advance the townclock an hour by which means the conspirators imagining the appointed time was elapsed retired and that the clocks are kept still in the same advance to commemorate that happy deliverance but there is a third reason given for this strange custom which seems the most probable it is well known that the choirs of cathedrals are constructed toward the east that of basle declines somewhat from this direction and the sundial which is placed on the outside of the choir and by which the townclock is always regulated partakes of this declination a circumstance which according to the celebrated bernoville occasions a variation from the true time above five and forty minutes  the inhabitants of basle are still so attached to this whimsical custom that although it has been often proposed in the sovereign council to regulate their clocks properly yet the motion has been invariably rejected and the people would suspect that their liberties were invaded if their clocks were to agree with those of the rest of europe a few years since several leading men of the town determined to alter the hand of the sundial half a minute a day until the shadow should imperceptibly point to the true hour this expedient was accordingly adopted and the clock had already lost near three quarters of an hour when an accident discovered the design the magistrates were accordingly compelled to place the hand of the sundial in its former position and to regulate the hours by it as usual long established custom however ridiculous is apt to make so strong an impression upon vulgar minds as to become sometimes dangerous and always difficult to be abolished it was no inconsiderable length of time before we in england could be persuaded to reckon our years according to the general mode of computation received by the rest of europe  the bridge over the rhine is   0 common paces in length and makes a good appearance on the tower which stands toward france is a moors head crowned which every minute thrusts out its long red tongue this droll figure however does not disgust like that filthy representation which stands in a little cabin in the middle of the bridge before which the public prostitutes when banished from the town are found to undergo some ridiculous ceremonies this moors head was originally a piece of mechanical wit of the famous clockmaker who saved the town he made it in derision of the enemy he had so dexterously deceived it has been repaired and enabled to thrust out its tongue every minute for  00 years past at the expense of the magistrates who think as i have observed so excellent a joke cannot be too often repeated  st peters square with its rows of lime trees is the best walk in basle in      an oak was planted here which by the particular arrangement of its wide branches forms three distinct landing places or floors  not far from the cathedral is the hotel de ville an ancient building the great room in which the council assembled in      remains seemingly in its original state  the sumptuary laws are very strict here the use of coaches in the town is not indeed prohibited as at zuric but what is more singular no citizen or inhabitant is allowed to have a servant behind his carriage laws of this kind may be carried in some instances to a scrupulous and even ridiculous minuteness upon the whole however they are excellent regulations and not only useful but necessary in a small republic  the lower rank of citizens are in general so strongly prejudiced in favor of this town as to seem convinced that true felicity is only to be found at basle every person boasts that he is free and is so in reality and as the citizens not only possess very considerable privileges and immunities but each individual may also indulge the hope of being one day chosen into the sovereign council he enjoys a certain degree of respect and consideration extremely flattering to his selfimportance  the inhabitants of basle says moore seem to be of a reserved and saturnine disposition whether natural or affected is not easy to tell but the few says this writer i conversed with had something uncommonly serious and formal in their manner how an unremitting gravity and solemnity of manner in the common affairs of life comes to be considered as an indication of wisdom or of extraordinary parts is not a little surprising so many ridiculous things occur every day in this world that men who are endowed with that degree of sensibility which usually accompanies genius find it very difficult to maintain a continued gravity this difficulty is abundantly felt even in the grave and learned professions and the individuals who have been most successful in surmounting it and who never deviate from the solemnity of established forms have not always been the most distinguished for real knowledge or genius though they are generally most admired by the multitude who are very apt to mistake that gravity for wisdom which proceeds from a literal weight of the brain and muddiness of understanding mistakes of the same kind are frequently made in forming a judgment of books as well as of men those which profess a formal design to instruct and reform and carry on the work methodically till the reader is lulled into repose have passed for deep and useful performances while others replete with original observation and real instruction have been treated as frivolous because they are written in a familiar style and the precepts conveyed in a sprightly and indirect manner  works composed with the laborious desire of being thought profound have so very often the misfortune to be dull that some people have considered the two terms as synonimous and the men who receive it as a rule that one set of books are profound because they are dull may naturally conclude that others are superficial because they are entertaining with respect to books however matters are soon set to rights those of puffed and false pretensions die neglected while those of real merit live and flourish but with regard to the men the catastrophe is often different we daily see formal assuming blockheads flourish and enjoy the fruits of their pompous impositions while many men of talents who disdain such arts live in obscurity and die neglected  moore here gives a curious anecdote of this saturnine disposition in a dutchman whom he supped with at a tabledhote in this city there were ten or a dozen people at table i sat next to a genteel looking man from strasburgh with whom i conversed a good deal during supper he had for his companion a round faced rosy plump gentleman from amsterdam who did not speak french but the strasburgher addressed him from time to time in low dutch to which the other replied by nods  when the retreat of the greater part of the company had contracted the little circle which remained i expressed some regret to my strasburgh acquaintance that my friend and i could not speak a little dutch or that his friend could not speak french that we might enjoy the pleasure of his conversation this was immediately translated to the dutchman who heard it with great composure and then took the pipe from his mouth and made an answer which with some difficulty i got our interpreter to explain it was to this effect that we ought to console ourselves for the accident of not understanding each other for as we had no connection or dealing in trade together our conversation could not possibly answer any useful purpose my friend made a low bow to this compliment saying that the justness and good sense of that remark had certainly escaped my observation as he acknowledged it had hitherto done his  the supreme legislative power of this canton resides in the great and little councils consisting of about  00 members and the authority of these two councils combined is without control they enact laws declare war and peace contract alliances and impose laws they elect the several magistrates appoint their own members nominate to all employments and confer the right of burghership the general administration of government is committed by the great council to the senate or little council that is to a part of its own body this senate composed of  0 members is divided into two bodies which act by rotation the acting division continues in office one year decides finally in all criminal causes superintends the police and exercises several other powers subordinate to the sovereign council the collective body of the citizens assemble once every year when the magistrates publicly take an oath to maintain the constitution and preserve the liberties and immunities of the people inviolate the reciprocal oath of obedience to the laws is also administered to the citizens  notwithstanding the great and boundless prerogative of the great council yet the meanest citizen is capable of being admitted into that body for the vacancies in the two councils are supplied from all ranks of citizens one class only excepted the members of the university formerly these elections were determined by a plurality of voices but as by these means the richest person was always certain of being chosen a ternaire was established in      which was afterward changed into a senaire that is six candidates are nominated and from these the successor is appointed by lot  but the principal magistrates are not the only persons chosen by lot even the professors in the university are elected in the same manner hence nothing is more common than for a candidate to offer himself for the professorship of a science which he has never made the peculiar object of his studies if the chair of that particular science in which he excels is already occupied for under these circumstances the respective unqualified professors change place with each other  near basle are the ruins of augusta rauricorum formerly a large town under the dominion of the romans now a small village in the canton of basle close to the rhine its ancient remains are very inconsiderable consisting of a few columns of marble still standing and some scattered fragments of pillars together with a semicircular range of walls upon a rising ground the greatest part of which is fallen and is almost entirely overgrown with underwood from the present appearance of these ruins it would scarce be conjectured that they once composed part of a theater capable of containing about twelve thousand spectators  the peasants in turning up the ground where these ruins are situated frequently find medals of the roman emperors from augustus to constantine and are become by repeated experience able to distinguish with some degree of precision those that are rare from the more common coins  m kochlins commercial school at mulhausen about fifteen miles from basle deserves to be mentioned it is a private academy for about thirty scholars who are instructed in the german french and latin languages in fencing dancing and all polite accomplishments and more particularly in accounts and bookkeeping the expense including a uniform amounts to  0l per annum the plan is very judicious and the whole appears to be well conducted  at bellelay about  0 miles from basle in a rich abbey of benedictines has been instituted a military academy for the young nobility and gentry they are instructed in the various branches of polite literature wear uniforms and are trained to military maneuvers and exercises the cheapness of this school and its distance from the dissipation of large towns renders it of great public utility the whole expense of each scholar for his board lodging instruction and various lessons scarcely exceeds  0l per annum it is curious to find a military academy established in the midst of rocks and forests and within the walls of a convent and to observe benedictine friars instead of wasting their time in monkish ignorance and superstition rendering themselves beneficial to society  at arlesheim about four miles from basle is a curiosity of another kind a hermitage that has been made at considerable expense with a view to employ the poor in a time of great scarcity and to provide walks for the inhabitants of the town the grounds are very extensive and pleasant the walks are carried along the sides of the rocks which are richly wooded and through a delightful semicircular plain bounded by fertile hills and watered by a small lake the borders of which are peculiarly wild and picturesque several caverns hollowed and arched by the hand of nature add to the romantic singularity of the scenery while many transparent streams conveyed from a considerable distance fall in small cascades or bubble from the ground like real springs  chap x town and canton of schaffhausen schaffhausen is the most northern of all the cantons of switzerland and for the most part surrounded by swabia it is the twelfth canton in rank and the least of them all being only five leagues in length and three in breadth the number of inhabitants is estimated at about  0000 the rhine the course of which has been described is the only river of note here this canton produces a great deal of corn though not in sufficient quantity for the inhabitants who are farther supplied from swabia it is abundant in hay and fruit and of good red wine there is a considerable quantity furnished for exportation  schaffhausen is a neat and tolerably well built town situated upon the northern shore of the rhine it is the capital of the canton and owes its origin to the interruption of that river by the cataract at lauffen huts being at first constructed for the convenience of unloading the merchandise from the boats by degrees increased to a large town its present population is supposed to be about  000 inhabitants it was formerly an imperial city and governed by an aristocracy and in   0  was admitted a member of the helvetic confederacy it is slightly fortified and has a kind of citadel but no garrison though a frontier town the buildings are old fashioned and indifferent most of them have the name of the inhabitant the date of the building and some device over the door and some have the front painted all over here and at basle they are fond of salient windows and mirrors to enable them to look up and down the streets these are not very narrow but they are ill paved with middle and cross kennels there are two considerable churches the munsters and st johns in the latter is a library and there is a second in the town for the use of the citizens at the reformation a school or academy was established where the sacred languages and sciences proper for ecclesiasties are taught  the only thing that can really excite the attention of the judicious stranger in this canton is the wooden bridge thrown across the rhine and which is totally disregarded by the inhabitants this bridge which is     feet long is entirely covered with a roof from one extremity to the other and is so contrived that there is no necessity for any arches to support it every time that a carriage travels along it yields to the pressure swings from one side to the other and seems ready to give way it is however remarkably safe and has remained in the same situation for many years  this singular erection is the work of a simple carpenter of the canton of appenzel called grubbenmann it is asserted that the whole bridge consists entirely of one arch and the pier which is placed in the middle of the river was added at the particular desire of the magistrates of schaffhausen who were at once astonished and affrighted at the boldness of the undertaking  the river here says coxe is extremely rapid and had already destroyed several bridges of stone built upon arches of the strongest construction when this carpenter undertook to throw a wooden one of a single arch across it the magistrates however insisted that it should consist of two arches and that he should make use for that purpose of the middle pier of the old bridge which remained entire accordingly the architect was obliged to obey but he has contrived it in such a manner that the bridge is not at all supported by the middle pier and it would certainly have been equally safe and considerably more beautiful had it consisted solely of one arch it is a wooden bridge of which the sides and top are covered and the road over it is almost perfectly level it is what the germans call a hoengewerk or hanging bridge the road not being carried as usual over the top of the arch but is let down into the middle of it and there suspended a man of the slightest weight walking upon it feels it tremble under him and yet wagons heavily laden pass over it without danger and although in the latter instance the bridge seems almost to crack with the pressure it does not appear to have ever suffered the least damage it has been compared and very justly to a tight rope which trembles when it is struck but still preserves its firm and equal tension  when we observe the greatness of the plan and the boldness of the construction we are astonished that the architect was a common carpenter without the least proficiency in learning totally ignorant of mathematics and not at all versed in the theory of mechanics possessed of uncommon natural abilities and a surprising turn for the practical part of mechanics he raised himself to great eminence in his profession and may justly be considered as one of the most ingenious architects of the present century this bridge was finished in less than three years and cost  0000 florins or about  000l  this same carpenter had agreed to throw a bridge of a single arch and of the same construction over the river derry in ireland the river is  00 feet wide which by means of abutments was to have been reduced to  00 it was to have cost  0000l but the plan was not carried into execution for want of proper encouragement  the whole number of citizens or burgesses in whom the supreme power ultimately resides are computed at about  000 the arsenal is far from being considerable yet on an emergency sufficient to arm the townsmen and other subjects who besides are not without necessary arms every common inhabitant or peasant going to church with his sword by his side and whoever appears before the magistrates without that weapon and his cloak incurs a severe penalty the sword besides being an ornament is a mark of their freedom over all the district of mount jura as far as it is dependant on the canton of berne the men go to church not only with their swords but their bayonets and firelocks which during the service they either keep by them or hang up in a particular corner of the church an usage not improbably derived from the frequent commotions of former times and the wars with the burgundians against whom as an adjacent and dangerous enemy it behoved them to be continually upon their guard  this custom seems to indicate that the blood of the old germans runs in the veins of these gallant swiss the most ancient historians relating that they used to assist at their religious ceremonies with their swords by their sides and though says keysler herodotus luccan and ammianus marcellinus betray an absurd credulity in advancing that our ancestors used to pray to their weapons yet it is too apparent that even in later times they attributed a kind of sacredness to their swords but this is in some sort excusable in a people who maintain the reputation of intrepidity as an inherent hereditary quality and therefore called war oerlogh i e the oldest law according to cromers account of poland the nobility of that kingdom ever since the more enlightened times of christianity long retained the custom of half drawing their swords when the priest read the gospel to testify their readiness to defend the truths of the sacred books with their lives and fortunes  the revenues of the state arise partly from the tithes and other articles of the like nature but principally from the duties laid upon the merchandise which passes from germany these customs are nearly sufficient to defray all the public expenses  sumptuary laws are in force here as well as in most parts of switzerland and no dancing is allowed except upon particular occasions silk lace and several other articles of luxury are prohibited even the ladies headdresses are regulated but what is of still greater importance all games of chance are strictly prohibited and in other games the party who loses above six florins which make nine shillings of our money incurs a considerable fine an excellent regulation and further these laws are not like ours mere ciphers but are well observed the principal article of exportation is wine of which a large quantity is made the country abounding in vineyards and as the canton furnishes but little corn it is procured from suabia in exchange for wine in the town there are some but not very considerable manufactures of linen cotton and silk their commerce however is very flourishing  the people of this canton like those of berne are divided into regular companies of militia which are exercised yearly and are always ready and prepared to take up arms in defense of their country this canton has some troops in the service of france sardinia and holland the only foreign service into which the subjects of the protestant cantons enlist  the great convenience of the rhine to the commerce of schaffhausen is twice interrupted between this town and basle by violent falls of the river which occasion an absolute necessity at each of these places to take out the whole lading and put it on board other vessels one of these falls is near rheinfelden and though called hellhaken is not of any remarkable height and nothing near so tremendous as the other at about a quarter of a league from schaffhausen near the little fort of lausfen which stands on the other side lauffen was formerly in the possession of austria and from it the fall derives its name i had not an opportunity says keysler of taking with any precision the height of the rock from which the river here precipitates itself so must rely on the information of the people who make the height  0 feet and the breadth about  0 paces even before the rhine reaches this cataract the ground is very rocky and at the fall divides itself into three streams of which the greenbeds and silver vortices make an agreeable contrast to the beholder but at the same time his mind cannot help being filled with a mixture of dread and amazement at the roar of the waters on the south or zuric side is the most impetuous breach the violence of the fall altering the water as it were to a white dust part of which like a light cloud or mist hovers in the air and with the intercepted sunbeams forms a variety of most brilliant rainbows on the rocks which thus divide the rhine into three streams grow pines and other trees and close by them on the schaffhausen side near the village of neuhausen is an iron manufacture which turns to very good account in the iron ore of which there is great plenty are frequently found petrified muscles and cockles  from the castle of lauffen this scene presents the most picturesque and beautiful view that the human fancy ever formed or the human eye ever dwelt upon  after the melting of the snow when the river has attained its proper majesty and grandeur the fall seems to be about  0 feet perpendicular  it is remarkable that the rhine formerly fell from a much greater height than at present and that the river which is daily wearing away the surface of the rocks will some time or other present a plain level glassy superficies to the view of the astonished stranger who will scarce credit those tales of his ancestors by which he was taught to believe that this was once a cataract  chap xi of the grisons the country of the grisons is divided into three leagues which unite and form one republic the gray league the house of god and the ten jurisdictions the respective communities of these three leagues have their peculiar constitution enjoy their municipal laws and customs and are independent commonwealths in all concerns which do not interfere with the general policy of the whole republic or the articles of the particular league of which they form a part the connection between the three leagues is maintained by means of an annual diet composed of    deputies and the three chiefs  this country borders to the east on the territories of venice and milan west it joins the canton of uri and to the north the canton of glarus its greatest length from east to west is from  0 to  0 miles and from  0 to  0 in breadth their country is very populous and it is said they can bring   000 fighting men into the field  the greatest part of the country is mountainous but the levels and valleys produce almost all sorts of grain with pulse plenty of hay fruits of several kinds and wines its hills which are of a middling height and enjoy a mild air yield not only good fodder and hay but also rye and barley and in some parts cherries and even on the highest and most barren parts are good pasture grounds besides many kinds of palatable and wholesome berries which grow there the principal occupation of the inhabitants is feeding horned cattle sheep goats and swine besides poultry it also affords wild fowl but of beasts the continual demand for them necessarily occasions a scarcity the principal rivers are the rhine the ina and the adda all of which have their source in this country here are also several lakes most of which lie on the summit of the hills where they have their issue from fine springs  the marmot likewise which is to be found in most of the mountains of switzerland is particularly common in that part of the grisons called the league of godshouse  in the whole country of the grisons there are but three towns and those not of any note the german language is mostly used but in many places the inhabitants also speak italian in engadina they speak a kind of latin  the principal food of the inhabitants in these mountains is saltmeat ryebread milk cheese polenta and chestnuts which are so plentiful at this season of the year that they make a principal ingredient in all their meals the most common methods of dressing them are to boil and serve them up with crumbs of bread or to grind them to a paste and then eat them with milk  the peasants are well clothed they manufacture linen and coarse cloth at home every family having a loom which is worked in the winter season but the finer cloth which they wear only on sundays and festivals is procured from germany  the revenues of the three leagues arise from the following articles from duties upon merchandise passing through the grisons the valteline and chiavenna which are farmed at the annual rate of about l      from a third of the fines laid upon delinquents in the subject countries  from a small tribute likewise paid by them  and lastly from a fund the principal part of which is l 000 vested in the english funds  the public expenditure is very trifling being chiefly confined to the expenses incurred by the the sittings of diet and the salaries assigned to the deputies for their attendance  the commerce of the grisons is extremely contracted the only exports are cheese and cattle as most of the grison peasants weave cloth and linen for the use of their families it would be no difficult undertaking to introduce manufactures in different parts but it is remarkable that in these little republics a strange prejudice prevails against commerce and that the project of establishing manufactures is opposed by many leading men of the country it is difficult to discover the reason of these illiberal principles it has been imputed to a suspicion that if the people should become opulent by commerce they would be less open to influence and the powerful families who now direct the public affairs would lose their ascendency besides these reasons which are of too delicate a nature to be openly acknowledged other motives of a more generous complexion having been assigned  the advocates against extending commerce assert that as the true riches of every country consists in the products of agriculture all occupations which turn the attention of the people from that one great object are detrimental to the general good of society and that in free states manufactures tend to enervate the inhabitants to introduce the baneful effects of luxury to depress the spirit of freedom and to destroy the general simplicity of manners  these reasons however specious in appearance will prove fallacious upon mature consideration if in a country says coxe which subsists chiefly by agriculture manufactures are pursued to the total neglect of husbandry they then become detrimental but this is seldom the case as by adding to the general consumption manufacturers usually tend to increase instead of diminishing the products of the earth such have been the effects in the mountains of neuchatel where the forests have been cleared and the country converted into pasture or sown with grain manufactures and commerce are still further serviceable in augmenting the number of inhabitants which form the true riches of a country  the religion of the grisons is divided into catholic and reformed by the reformed is meant what we call calvinism although it is not the same as was established at geneva among the grisons the protestants are more numerous than the catholics in spiritual concerns the catholics are generally under the jurisdiction of the bishop of coire for the affairs of the reformed churches the supreme authority is vested in the synod which is composed of three deans one for each league and the clergy this synod assembles every year alternately in each of the three leagues candidates for holy orders are examined before the synod the necessary qualification for admission into the church ought to be the knowledge of hebrew greek and latin but this rule is not strictly adhered to many being ordained without the least acquaintance with either of those tongues formerly latin was solely used as well in the debates of the synod as for the purpose of examining the candidates but at present that tongue grows more and more into disuse and german is employed in its stead  the number of reformed parishes in the whole three leagues amounts to     the ministers of these churches enjoy but very small salaries the richest benefices do not perhaps yield more than l 0 or at most l   per annum and the poorest sometimes scarcely l   this scanty income is attended with many inconveniences it obliges the clergy who have families to follow some branch of traffic to the neglect of their ecclesiastical studies and to the degradation of the professional character it was harvesttime says coxe when he visited this country and i observed several clergymen employed in reaping the corn  it may easily be conjectured that the general state of literature among the grisons must be at a very low ebb the protestants who receive a liberal education repair chiefly to zuric or basle and the catholics to milan pavia or vienna  each community has a small school in which the children are taught to read write and cast accounts but which is only open in winter from the  th of november to the  th of march  there is a latin seminary at coire for the children of the burghers and another instituted in      for the education of persons intended for the church and although these establishments are poorly endowed yet they have been productive of some literary advantages to the country  the diet of the three leagues which we have already said to be composed of    deputies and the three chiefs of each league assemble annually about the beginning of september at ilants coire and davos by rotation the three principal places in each district and continue sitting about three weeks or a month the chief of that league in whose district the diet is held is president for that turn and has the casting voice in case of equal suffrages the supreme authority is not absolutely and finally vested in the diet but in the communities at large for in all affairs of importance such as declaring war making peace enacting laws contracting alliances and imposing taxes the deputies either bring positive instructions from their constituents or refer those points concerning which they have no instructions to the decision of the several communities so that in effect the supreme power constitutionally resides in the body of the people and not in their representatives at the diet the deputies receive for their attendance a small salary from the public treasury which never exceeds five shillings a day extraordinary diets are convoked at the request of any foreign court who will discharge the expense of its sittings and upon other important emergencies  the three leagues are in close alliance with the cantons of berne and zuric to whose mediation they have frequently had recourse in points of disagreement they have also alliances with several of the other cantons and in case of invasion or rebellion would be supplied with succors from all the swiss republics  the king of france maintains an envoy in this country and has two grison regiments in his service our court formerly had a minister here but for some time the english envoy to the swiss cantons resident at berne has transacted business with this republic  near the borders of the torrent tamina which runs into the rhine are some warm baths which have been so much renowned for their efficacy in curing the gout rheumatism and cutaneous disorders according to the general opinion they contain a small portion of gold as if that metal would render them more salutary for the cure of diseases the waters are transparent perfectly free from smell or taste and about the warmth of milk immediately drawn from the cow persons who have analyzed them say they deposit no diment are as light and pure as rainwater are mpregnated with a small quantity of volatile alali and iron but contain no sulphur these waers are conveyed by pipes into commodious baths and the house which is not only commodious but superb hangs in a most romantic situation on the side of a mountain amidst the gloom of the forest close to the lively tamina  chap xii vassals of the grisons these consist of three countries which are able to bring into the field about   000 fighting men among them is  the valteline called by the inhabitants valletelina and which extends from the confines of bornio to the lake of chiavenna about the length of  0 miles it is entirely enclosed between two chains of high mountains the northern chain separates it from the grisons the southern from the venetian territories on the east it borders on the county of bormio and on the west on the duchy of milan  the geographical division of the valteline is divided into three principal districts and the political into five governments each of the five governments is subject to a magistrate appointed by the grisons who is changed every two years the magistrate over the middle district is called governor of the valteline and possesses in some respect a superior degree of authority to the others who are styled podestas he is also captain general of the valteline  this country is exceedingly fruitful and throughout its whole extent watered by the adda which after receiving all the streams issuing from the forest discharges itself into the como lake the sunbeams shine in every part of this country and from the northern blasts it is fenced by high mountains in some parts however the heat is intense but in others more moderate and on the hills and the greatest part of the adjacent valleys the air is mostly cool of this variation in the temperature the necessary consequence is a variation in the products of the earth the levels in this valley through which the adda pursues its meandering course and the breadth of which in some parts is not less than a mile exhibit a delightful variety of cornfieldsd meadows vineyards and orchards of chestnuts and other fruits and in one and the same year successively produce two three or even four kinds of the latter the vineyards on the mountains toward the north produce the best wine in the whole country and above them are cornfieldsd meadows and pasturelands the hills on the south side are covered with fine woods of chestnuts fields meadows and rich pastures in which graze numerous breeds of cattle this country also abounds in excellent red wine of a most delicious flavor and of so good a body that it will keep for a whole century improving both in taste and wholesomeness and gradually turning paler till at length its redness totally disappears great quantities of this wine are exported  the apples and pears in most places here are not very desirable but its peaches apricots figs and melons are exquisite here are likewise plenty of lemons citrons almonds pomegranates chestnuts and other delicious fruits its soil also would produce all kinds of grain and pulse but the levels being interspersed with swamps which have remained without culture and the winetrade chiefly engrossing the attention of the inhabitants it does not yield a sufficiency of corn for so populous a country and they are under the necessity of having recourse to importation some parts grow hemp and in the levels particularly on the higher grounds and the mountains are fine pastures notwithstanding which graziery is but little followed bees and silkworms are bred here in vast numbers their game is much reduced by the avidity of the hunters the adda yields plenty of fish and is noted for its trout which are very fat and delicious and so large as to weigh from  0 to  0 lbs the whole of their mineworks consists in a few ironfounderies  this country is without so much as one town but has some considerable burghs with many thriving villages its language is a corrupt kind of italian the population according to coxe amounts to   000 souls  there are no manufactures in the valteline and almost all the menial trades are exercised by foreigners its chief commerce which consists of wine and silk is carried on with milan and the grisons these two articles turn the balance of trade in its favor and enable the inhabitants to exist without any manufacture  upon a rough calculation   000 horseloads of wine are annually exported each of which may be estimated at a pound sterling three thousand lbs of the finest sort of silk which is esteemed as good as that procured from piedmont is sent annually to england by way of ostend the greatest part of the silk is wound in the valteline for which purpose there are silkmills in the principal districts  the tenants who take farms in this country do not pay their rent in money but in kind a strong proof of general poverty the peasant is at all the costs of cultivation and delivers near half the produce to the landholders  the valteline from its neighborhood to italy has imbibed a taste for the fine arts and there are many collections of pictures which are not unworthy of notice this country however has produced few artists of any eminence pietro ligario is almost the only painter who deserves to be mentioned and his name is scarcely known beyond the limits of the valteline  the romantic beauties of the valteline are greatly heightened by the numerous remains of ancient fortresses and castles scattered throughout the country they were all dismantled soon after the capitulation of milan in      from a recent experience that the inability of the grisons to provide them with sufficient garrisons exposed them to the enemy and rendered them for the most part a source of annoyance rather than of protection it might be imagined that some of these fortresses ought to have been retained to awe the inhabitants but such an absolute confidence is reposed by the grisons in the guaranty of the country by the house of austria that they do not maintain a single soldier throughout the whole valteline  this country bormio subject to the grisons lies at the foot and in the midst of the rhetian alps and borders upon engadina the valteline tyrol trent and the venetian territories it is on all sides environed by steep mountains of such a stupendous height that their summits are very seldom free from snow except a narrow opening which connects it with the valteline it was once a part of the milanese and became subject to the grisons in      the inhabitants pay a fixed contribution to them which is very moderate and cannot be increased  the air here is rather cold than warm but yet pure and healthy no wine is produced in this country and but little fruit of corn it has more than sufficient for homeconsumption and such is the richness of its pastures that the inhabitants keep between   and  000 cows besides a great number of sheep and goats the honey too of this country is particularly exquisite and it abounds in iron ore but its other metals and minerals are inconsiderable the adda has its source in these parts  the inhabitants who amount to about   000 are papists and the exercise of every other worship is prohibited the priests here have peculiar privileges which extend even to those who wear a clerical dress  most of the peasants possess a small portion of land and in consequence of the freedom of the government are much happier than the people of the valteline and chiavenna  the town of bormio the capital is not unpleasantly situated at the foot of the mountains close to the torrent fredolfo which falls at a small distance into the adda it contains about  000 inhabitants but has a desolate appearance the houses are of stone plastered a few make a tolerable figure amidst many with paper windows several like the italian cottages have only wooden shutters the palazzo or townhouse contains a suit of wretched apartments for the residence of the podesta a chamber for the courts of judicature and an apartment where the representatives of the people assemble in one of the rooms is an engine of torture which in defiance of common sense as well as humanity is still used in these countries to force confession  the county of chiavenna came under the sovereignty of the grisons in the same manner and at the same time with the valteline it lies among high and steep mountains notwithstanding which some of its valleys are of considerable extent the summerheats are frequently excessive both the mountains and valleys are well peopled and the country in most parts besides pastures abounds in all kinds of fruits and wines and the culture of silk is a very important article the inhabitants are papists  chiavenna the capital of the county is situated at the foot and upon the side of a mountain and contains about  000 souls the inhabitants carry on but little commerce the principal article of exportation is rawsilk the great support of this town is the transport of merchandise between the milanese and germany  the principal object of curiosity in the environs of chiavenna is the fortress in ruins seated upon the summit of a rock which overlooks the town and is celebrated in the history of the grisons for its almost impregnable strength the only road which leads up to it is steep and craggy the walls occupy a large space of ground and are now partly covered with vines the strongest part of the fortress was constructed upon an insulated rock it is on all sides absolutely perpendicular and its only communication with the castle was by a drawbridge thrown across the intervening chasm its length is above   0 feet its height above  00 and its greatest distance from the adjoining rock about  0 feet  this fortification though always deemed impregnable was taken at different periods sometimes by assault but more frequently by famine or stratagem it was finally demolished by the grisons themselves  close to chiavenna is a rock of asbestos a kind of mineral substance of a greyish silver color which can be drawn out into longitudinal fibers as fine as thread and is supposed to be indestructible by fire the ancients manufactured it into a species of cloth resembling linen this species of cloth is frequently mentioned by pliny it was principally used for shrouds in which the bodies of the great were enveloped before they were placed upon the funeral pile and which not being liable to be consumed by fire preserved the ashes of the body separate from those of the wood the art of weaving the asbestos into linen is not lost as some authors have asserted but as it is very troublesome and expensive and as the custom of burning bodies which gave it a value is no longer in use the manufacture is discontinued besides the rock of asbestos just mentioned near chiavenna several mountains in these parts yield the same substance the best sort is found in the valley of malenco  about four miles from chiavenna is the spot formerly occupied by the town of piuro or plurs which met with a fate something similar to that of herculaneum having been totally overwhelmed by the fall of mount conto under which it was built this terrible catastrophe happened august          plurs was a large and flourishing town subject as well as chiavenna to the grisons contemporary writers mention that it contained three churches many large houses and a stone bridge over the maira and that its population amounted to at least   00 inhabitants who carried on no inconsiderable commerce the valley in which it was situated is very narrow and the whole town was buried in one undistinguished ruin a contemporary account relates that the cloud of dust and rubbish was so great as to cover the heavens like smoke and even to extend as far as chiavenna the inhabitants of chiavenna alarmed at this uncommon phenomena were still more terrified at the disappearance of the torrent maira which suddenly ceased to flow by that town for near an hour its course being stopped by the fallen fragments of rock until it forced its way over the ruins this event spread such an universal alarm among the inhabitants from an apprehension that the torrent had undermined chiavenna and would burst out with such fury as to deluge the whole place that great numbers fled precipitately into the mountains  i walked over the spot says coxe where pluro was built part of the ancient walls and the ruins of a country house which belonged to the franci the richest family in the place are the only remains of its former existence and these would not be noticed by a passenger a peasant who has a cottage close to the ruins pointed out to me every place as it had been explained to him by his grandfather he showed me where stood the churches and principal houses the channel through which the river then flowed and where the bridge was constructed he informed me that in digging several dead bodies had been found and particularly the bones of a priest covered with shreds of garment which indicated that he was employed in divine service when the rock overwhelmed the town household utensils are frequently dug up the other day several corpses were discovered and on the fingerbone of one were a silver and two gold rings vineyards chesnuttrees and houses cover the spot where this unfortunate town was once situated  chap xiii vallais this tract of country called the vallais stretches from east to west about  00 miles and contains about  00000 inhabitants who all profess the roman catholic religion the country is enclosed within high alps and consisting of plain elevated valleys and lofty mountains must necessarily exhibit a great variety of situations climates and productions accordingly the vallais presents to the curious traveller a quick succession of prospects as beautiful as they are diversified vineyards rich pastures covered with cattle corn flax fruit trees and forests occasionally bordered by naked rocks the summits of which are crowned with everlasting snow  as to the productions of the vallais they must evidently vary according to the great diversity of climates by which this country is so peculiarly distinguished it supplies more than sufficient wine and corn for interior consumption and indeed a considerable quantity of both are yearly exported the soil in the midland and lower districts being exceedingly rich and fertile in the plain where the heat is collected and confined between the mountains the harvest is usually finished in july but in the more elevated parts barley is the only grain that can be cultivated with any success and the crop is seldom cut before november about sion the fig the melon and all the other fruits of italy come to perfection in consequence of this singular variety says coxe i tasted in the same day strawberries cherries plums pears and grapes each of them the natural growth of the country  this country is divided into upper and lower vallais the upper vallais is sovereign of the lower vallais and comprizes seven independent commonwealths the bishop of sion was formerly absolute sovereign over the greatest part of the vallais but his authority is at present very much limited  the republic of the vallais is an ally of the thirteen cantons and has formed a particular league with the seven catholic cantons for the defense of their common religion  with respect to manufactures there are none of any of consequence and indeed the general ignorance of the people is no less remarkable than their indolence so that they may be considered in regard to knowledge and improvements as some centuries behind the swiss who are certainly a very enlightened nation the peasants seldom endeavor to meliorate those lands where the soil is originally bad nor to draw the most advantage from those which are uncommonly fertile having few wants and being satisfied with the spontaneous gifts of nature they enjoy her blessings without considering much in what manner to improve them  the inhabitants of the vallais are very much subject to goiters or large excressences of flesh that grow from the throat and often increase to a most enormous size but what is more extraordinary idiocy also remarkably abounds among them i saw many instances of both kinds says coxe as i passed through sion capital of vallais some idiots even basking in the sun with their tongues out and their heads hanging down exhibiting the most affecting spectacle of intellectual imbecility that can possibly be conceived  it is said that the common people very much respect these idiots and even consider them as blessings they call them souls of god without sin and many parents prefer these idiot children to those whose understandings are perfect because as they are incapable of intentional criminality they consider them as certain of happiness in a future state nor is this opinion entirely without its good effect as it disposes the parents to pay greater attention to such helpless beings thus idiots are suffered to marry as well among themselves as with others  the notion that snowwater occasions goiters is certainly void of foundation these guttural rumors are to be found in the environs of naples in the island of sumatra and at patna and purnea in the east indies where snow is unknown the primary cause of these excrescences are the springs that supply drink to the natives and which are impregnated with a calcareous matter called in switzerland tuf nearly similar to the incrustations of matlock in derbyshire where may be seen goitrous persons as well as in switzerland  the pipes which convey water to the public fountain at berne are extremely clogged with this calcareous sediment and a gentleman says coxe on whose sincerity i can depend assured me that he is subject to a small swelling in the throat which usually increases in winter when he is chiefly resident at berne and diminishes in summer on his removal to other places where the waters are not loaded with tuf  i was also informed by general biffer says he that at lucerne all waters excepting one spring are impregnated with tuf and that the natives who dwell near that spring are much less subject to goiters than the other inhabitants that the same difference is observed among the members of the same family between those who drink no water but what is drawn from that spring and others who do not use that precaution the general showed me also the tin vessel in which water was every morning boiled for his use and which was so speedily and thickly incrustated as to render it necessary to have it cleared twice a week the water which yields this deposition is as transparent as crystal  but a still stronger proof in favor of this opinion is derived from the following facts a surgeon whom i met at the baths of leuk informed me that he had not unfrequently extracted concretions of tufstone from several goiters and that from one in particular which suppurated he had taken several flat pieces each about half an inch long he added that the same substance is found in the stomachs of cows and in the goitrous tumors to which even the dogs of the country are subject the same gentleman says coxe assured me that in the course of his extensive practice he had diminished and cured the goiters of many young persons by emollient liquors and external applications that his principal method in order to prevent them in future consisted in removing the patients from the places where the springs are impregnated with tuf and if that could not be contrived by forbidding the use of water which was not purified he remarked that one of his own children had at its birth a goiter as large as an egg although neither he nor his wife who were both foreigners were afflicted with that malady he had dissipated it by external remedies and since that period had invariably prohibited his family from tasting the springwaters unless they were distilled or mixed with wine and vinegar by which means he was able to preserve them from those tumors in the throat that were extremely common among the natives of the town which he inhabited  m de saussure whose accurate researches and profound investigation on philosophical subjects deserves to be weighed with great attention attributes the production of goiters not to the waters but principally to the concentrated heat of the climate and the stagnation of the air he informs us that in all his travels through the alpine countries he never observed goiters in any places which are elevated more than between   or  000 feet above the level of the sea that he noticed them in those valleys where the heat is concentrated and the air stagnated and that they usually cease wherever the valley terminates and the country expands into a large plain with great defference to his opinion it may however be remarked that in places considerably elevated above the level of the sea the springs are too near their sources to have dissolved a sufficient quantity of calcareous matter as may be requisite for the generation of goiters  the same causes which generate goiters probably operate in the case of idiots for whenever the former prevails to a considerable degree the latter invariably abound such being the nice and inexplicable connection between our bodies and our minds that the one ever sympathises with the other it is by no means an illgrounded conjecture that the same causes which affect the body should also affect the mind or in other words that the same waters which create obstructions and goiters should also occasion mental imbecility and disarrangement  it is to be presumed that a people accustomed to these excrescences will not be shocked at their deformity but i do not find adds coxe as some writers assert that they consider them as beauties to judge from the accounts of many travelers it might be supposed that the natives without exception were either idiots or goiters but in fact the vallaisans in general are a robust race and all that with truth can be affirmed is that goitrous persons and idiots are more abundant in some districts of the vallais than perhaps in any other part of the globe  sion is the principal town in this canton and that not of any note it was formerly the capital of the seduni who inhabited this part of the country in the time of julius caesar it is here that the diet assembles on seeing the apartments where they meet i was greatly struck with their plainness says coxe and could not avoid reflecting with pleasure on the simplicity of manners which must necessarily prevail in this country when the rooms inhabited by the sovereign instead of bespeaking the magnificence of a court are scarcely superior to the dwelling of a peasant  leuk is another small town or rather village in this canton built upon an eminence near the rhone and famous for its hot medicinal springs it is much frequented during the summer by invalids of various kinds the patients either bathe or drink the waters  the accommodations for company are very inconvenient each person having for his own use a small apartment not more than a few feet square in which there is just room for a bed a table and two chairs the public dining room is upon rather a larger scale as is also an apartment where the company occasionally assemble formerly the accommodations were tolerably good but unfortunately in      an avalanche fell with such impetuosity from a neighboring glacier upon the village as to overwhelm the greatest part of the houses and the baths and to destroy a considerable number of the inhabitants the avalanche is a large body of snow which precipitates itself from the top of a mountain with a noise like the sound of thunder and in its descent has the appearance of a torrent of water reduced almost into spray the avalanches as they are called are sometimes attended with the most fatal consequences for where they consist of enormous masses they destroy every thing in their course and not unfrequently as in the case of leuk overwhelm even whole villages the best preservative against their effects being the forests with which the alps abound there is scarcely a village if situated at the foot of a mountain that is not sheltered by trees which the inhabitants preserve with uncommon reverence thus what constitutes one of the principal beauties in the country affords also security to the people  as far as i can judge says coxe speaking of these waters from the accounts which i have received concerning their warmth their analysis the method of using them and their efficacy in curing the gout rheumatism obstructions and cutaneous disorders they seem nearly to resemble those of bath  the situation is much more romantic and the waters perhaps not less efficacious and yet this village contains only a few miserable houses whilst bath is one of the finest towns in europe i had a conversation on this topic with a very ingenious and wellinformed gentleman of the vallais and observed to him that considering the great credit and efficacy of these waters i could not forbear wondering that the chiefs of the republic had not considered the improvement of the accommodations an object worthy of their attention for if they were rendered more convenient for the reception of invalids it would be the means of drawing a great number of strangers and must be highly beneficial to the country he assured me that it had been more than once in contemplation that some persons of great credit and authority opposed all improvements upon a principle similar to the policy of lycurgus conceiving that a concourse of strangers would only serve to introduce luxury among the inhabitants and insensibly destroy that simplicity of manners for which the vallaisans are so remarkably distinguished  plan of the city of geneva a general hospital b  church c st peter church d the magdalen church e st germain church f

chaudon mill   map of geneva  chap xiv geneva this city placed in the confines of france of savoy and of switzerland and properly belonging to none of these ought not to be omitted its territory is inconsiderable for the space within its walls forms the most considerable part of the republic  the situation of this little capital on the borders of the lake leman is delightful the prospects around it are rich and variegated the country is admirably cultivated and the horizon is bounded by the majestic scenery of the alps mount blanc and the chain of jura  the greatest part of the town stands upon a hill and has its views bounded on all sides by several ranges of mountains which are however at so great a distance that they leave open a wonderful variety of fine prospects the situation of these mountains has some particular effects on the country which they enclose at first they cover it from all winds except the north and south it is to the last of these winds that the inhabitants of geneva ascribe the healthfulness of the air for as the alps surround them on all sides they form a vast kind of basin where there would be a constant stagnation of vapors the country being so well watered did not the north wind put them in motion and scatter them from time to time another effect the alps have on geneva is that the sun here rises later and sets sooner than it does in other places of the same latitude i have often observed says addison that the top of the neighboring mountains have been covered with light above half an hour after the sun is down visible to those who live at geneva these mountains likewise very much increase their summer heats and make up an horizon that has something in it very singular and agreeable on one side is the long tract of hills that goes under the name of mount jura and covered with vineyards and pasturage and on the other huge precipices of naked rocks rising up in a thousand odd figures and cleft in some places so as to discover high mountains of snow that lie several leagues behind them toward the south the hills rise more insensibly and leave the eye a vast uninterrupted prospect for many miles but the most beautiful view of all is the lake and the borders that lie north of the town  this city says grossley is remarkable for its situation independence religion and commerce formerly it stood only on that hill which is the key of lake leman at the part where the rhone issues out of that lake and this river was its principal defense like all ancient towns built on mountains it has gradually sunk down into the level so that the afflux of the rhone is now within its circuit in its primitive situation it enjoyed a very healthy air with a view of the whole lake which it commanded and at the same time all the advantages arising from the lake either for the necessaries of life or the convenience of trade but by removing into the level it has lost the defense of the rhone and plunged itself amidst the continual fogs and vapors of the lake  geneva is by far the most populous town in switzerland and contains   000 souls this superiority of numbers is undoubtedly owing to the great industry and activity of the inhabitants to its more extensive commerce to the facility of purchasing the burghership and to the privileges which government allows to all foreigners  the liberal policy of this government in receiving strangers and conferring the burghership on them is the more remarkable as it is contrary to the spirit and usage of the swiss it is here indeed more necessary the territory of the state being so exceedingly small that its very existence depends upon the number and industry of the people for exclusive of the city there are scarcely   000 souls in the whole district of the genevois  to a man of letters says coxe geneva is particularly interesting learning is diverted of pedantry and philosophy and united with a knowledge of the world the pleasures of society are mixed with the pursuits of literature and elegance and urbanity give a zest to the profoundest disquisitions nor are letters confined in this city merely to those who engage in them as a profession or to those whose fortune and leisure enable them to follow where genius leads even the lower class of people are exceedingly well informed and there is perhaps no city in europe where luxury is more universally diffused we are at first astonished adds the above writer to find in this class of men so uncommon a share of knowledge but the wonder ceases when we are told that all of them were educated at the public academy where the children of the citizens are taught under the inspection of the magistrates and at the expense of government  the citizens enjoy also the advantage of having access to the public library and by this privilege they not only retain but improve that general tincture of learning which they imbibe in their early youth  this library contains   000 volumes of many curious manuscripts of which an accurate and learned catalogue has been lately published by the rev m sennebier the librarian he has attempted to determine the ages of the several manuscripts he describes their form and size the materials on which they are written the ornaments the characteristic phrases and mentions the proofs on which he grounds the opinion he adds also the notes and distinguishes those which have never been printed  the streets are in general wide clean and well paved the principal street however is encumbered with a row of shops on each side between the carriage and footway which last is very wide and protected from the weather by great wooden penthouses projecting from the roofs these are very convenient but give the street a dark and dull appearance the houses are generally built of freestone with lime stone basements the gutters spouts ridges and outward ornaments are of fer blanc which we improperly call tin  the maison de ville or townhouse is a large plain ancient building with great rooms for the council to assemble in and for public entertainments in one of them there is a weekly concert by subscription during the winter seaso the ascent to the upper story is not by steps but by a paved slope so gentle that horses and mules easily go up and down  there are five churches here besides french italian and german chapels none of them however have any thing to attract attention except s peters formerly the cathedral this is an ancient gothic building with a modern portico of seven large columns of red and white marble and of the corinthian order the inside is plain and the only thing observable is the tomb of henry duke of rohan  the arsenal is in good order and furnished with arms for   000 men here are also many ancient suits of armor and the scaling ladders lanthorns hatchets standards etc recall to the friends of liberty the abortive attempt of the savoyards upon the city in the year   0  in the magazine they they have   0 cannons and mortars  the hospital is a large handsome building near  000 poor are maintained by this and the french purse  the public fountains are supplied by an hydraulic machine which raises the water from the river above  00 paris feet  the treille or public walks consists of limetrees and being on an eminence affords a charming prospect of the large gardens beneath it and of the fields and meadows toward the mountains one of the most stately houses of which there are several very magnificent fronting these walls formerly belonged to an ecclesiastic and is said to have cost him near  0000 pounds  the fortifications are in the modern style on the side of savoy but are commanded by some of the neighboring ground on the side of france they are old fashioned they are calculated rather to prevent a surprise than to sustain a regular siege they have three gates toward france savoy and switzerland all access by the lake is barred by a double jettee and chain the garrison consists of   0 men swiss or germans a guard of four companies is changed every day at noon one of the syndics giving the word of command one company does duty at each gate and the fourth mounts guard at the town hall  we must not omit observing that geneva has partly realized swifts project in his great mystery or art of meditating in a house of office on that part of the lake which faces the upper town very large easements have been lately built divided into seats with slight partitions on each side most of them about elbow high as doctor swift directs for the convenience of conversation i went there says grossley one morning and taking my seat in the center shared in a very sprightly conversation among several women some of whom were busy and others waiting their turn  since the late troubles a theater has been built within the city the only public diversions besides this are two concerts private balls are not unfrequent and plays are sometimes performed by gentlemen and ladies the chief amusement is cards at which the women constantly play in their societies and assemblies in fine weather there is a great resort to the treille and other public walks  the dress of the men at geneva is chiefly broad cloth without lace or trimmings except frogs that of the women is silk in winter and printed cotton which they call indiennes in summer  the revenues of government are about  00000 french livres or little more than  0000 pounds sterling this is raised from the domains of the state tenths quitrents fines or alienations a tax on personaal effects a polltax customs and duties on goods entering or passing through the city tols at bridges etc the salaries of the syndics are between  0 and  0 pounds members of the little council have    pounds the garrison costs   0000 livres repairs of the public buildings fortifications and roads charges of the police etc make up the rest of the annual expenses  the government is of a mixed kind the legislative power resides in the general assembly of the citizens consisting of about   00 the executive in the magistrates who consist of a council of    which nominates the moiety of the grandcouncil out of which four syndics are annually chosen by the general assembly  the law of the state is the roman law with some modifications they have not titles of nobility or hereditary dignities  for the support of credit it is enacted by an express law that no son who does not discharge his fathers debts shall be capable of any office  geneva also has some peculiar ordinances concerning matrimony no marriage is allowed of unless both parties be of the protestant religion all previous promises or engagements of a reformed with a roman catholic are declared void and of none effect and the agents of those who have given their consent to it are punishable according to the nature of the circumstances a woman of  0 years of age cannot marry a man who is ten years younger than herself if above  0 her choice is confined to five years younger a man of  0 is not to marry a woman who is not at least half that age a widow must remain such at least six months before she can alter her condition in this point a man is not limited to any particular time but however he is enjoined to wait a reasonable time with this singular addition which is not found in other laws both to obviate scandal and to show that he has felt the hand of god  the maintenance of a good police and the suppression of luxury is the province of a particular court but a very extraordinary fund here is that arising from the dirt of the streets in other places money is paid for carrying it away whereas here it is farmed for  00 livres paid to the city for the exclusive privilege of taking it away for manuring land  it is the custom in geneva and switzerland for men to divide their estates equally among all their children by which means every one lives at his ease without growing dangerous to the republic for as soon as an overgrown estate falls into the hands of one that has many children it is broken into so many portions as render the shares of it rich enough without raising them too much above the level of the rest this is absolutely necessary in these little republics where the rich merchants live very much within their estates and by heaping up vast sums from year to year might become formidable to their fellowcitizens and break the equality which is so necessary in these kinds of governments were there not means found out to distribute their wealth among several members of their republic at geneva for instance are merchants worth  00000 pounds though perhaps there is not one of them who spends to the value of  00 pounds a year  geneva has but little land belonging to it so that the corn it yields not being sufficient for supplying the inhabitants of the republic and the regular importation of it from the neighboring countries being liable to be interrupted by bad harvests contagious distempers or wars for preventing a scarcity large granaries have been built at the public expense in these are continually kept  0000 quintals of corn which is computed to suffice for two years but no person is obliged to purchase their corn from this storehouse as at rome where every one must repair to his holinesss granary who sells the corn at double the price it cost and whoever has corn to dispose of must deliver it in at a very unreasonable low rate bakers innkeepers the garrison the cityartificers and laborers employed by the city are the only persons under any obligation to provide themselves with corn from the republic of genevas granary this consumption takes off yearly about   000 quintals and the intent of it is not so much the small gain which accrues to the city from a very moderate advance of the price but thus by regularly giving out the corn every six years the entire stock is removed  chap xv of the character manners and customs of the citizens of geneva they told me here says sherlock that all the girls were chaste and i believed them for i am naturally a very credulous man there are some reasons which might tempt a traveller less simple than myself to suspect the contrary there is no playhouse nor any public amusement in the city of geneva and reading is the only resource against ennui in consequence of this a number of booksellers lend books by the month at a very low price the first acquaintance i generally make in a town is that of a bookseller and during half an hour that i was talking with one the day after my arrival there in came three girls one after another to hire the new heloise pray said i to the bookseller what is the general reading of this country young people says he like books with fine sentiments women a little mature prefer those which are light and brilliant he appeared to me to have unfolded his nation by this trait the girls all enamoured of rousseau the women all admirers of voltaire yes thought i the thing is clear they begin by imitating eloisa and when their s preux forsakes them or the devil begins to frighten them they read voltaire to give them courage and spirits by no means  i guessed like a fool the girls are all virtuous there never was one suspected and what makes this miracle still more astonishing is that they have leave to go out by themselves in the morning and they avail themselves of it every day  the genevese thinks that he is somewhat like the ancient romans as a petty prince in germany thinks he resembles lewis the fourteenth the tradesman of this country is of all men he who imposed upon me most and he cheats with an insolence equal to his baseness i saw few people of the first class but those i did see appeared to me amiable sensible and well informed the men in general wish to pass for wits the women for freethinkers such are sherlocks concise remarks on the manners of the inhabitants in this little republic  the conversation of the genevese in general says grossley has more of the german in it than of the french among men it is carried on in clubs who hire a chamber where they resort in an evening to smoke talk politics and chat about their private concerns and the news of the city the italian reserve and german phlegm prevail in their conversation not only among themselves but with foreigners if some few have any tincture of french manners it is by imitating the politeness of the inhabitants of dauphine but how ill they succeed in their attempts to imitate the manners of the french or even the english the following humourous dialogue which moore had with a french hairdresser at geneva will sufficiently show a very genteel young man a genevois happened t call on me says this writer while a french friseur was with me the young gentleman had passed some time at paris and was dressed exactly in the parisian taste he has much the air of one of your countrymen said i to the frenchman as soon as the other had left the room  mon dieu quelle difference cried the friseur for my part i can see none said i monsieur resumed he soyez persuade quaucun genevois ne sera jamais pris pour un francois there are certainly some petit maitres to be found in this town said i pardonez moi replied he ils ne sont que petit maitres manques  did you ever see an englishman said i who might pass for a frenchman jamais de la vie replied he with an accent of astonishment  suppose him said i a man of quality nimporte  but continued i suppose he had lived several years at paris that he was naturally very handsome and well made that he had been educated by the best french dancing master his clothes made by the best french tailor and his hair dressed by the most eminent friseur in paris cest beaucoup monsieur mais ce nest pas assez  what exclaimed i would you still know him to be an englishman assurement monsieur  what before he spoke au premier coup doeil monsieur  the devil you would but how cest que messieurs les anglois ont un air  une maniere de se presenter  un que sais  je moi  vous mentendez bien monsieur  un certain air si gau   quel air maraud enfin un air qui est charmant si vous voulez monsieur said he rapidly mais que le diable memporte si cest lair francois  as education here says moore in his account of their customs and manners is equally cheap and liberal the citizens of geneva of both sexes are remarkably well instructed no country in the world can perhaps produce an equal number of persons taken collectively from all classes and professions with minds so much cultivated as the inhabitants of geneva possess  it is not uncommon to find mechanics in the intervals of their labor amusing themselves with the works of lock montesquieu and other productions of the same kind the clergy of geneva in general are men of sense learning and moderation impressing upon the minds of their hearers the tenets of christianity with all the grace of pulpiteloquence and illustrating the efficacy of the doctrine by their conduct in life the people of every station in this place attend sermons and the public worship with remarkable punctuality the sunday is honored with the most respectful decorum during the hours of divine service but as soon as that is over all the usual amusements commence  the public walks are crowded by all degrees of people in their best dresses the different societies and what they call circles assemble in the houses and gardens of individuals they play at cards and at bowls and have parties upon the lake with music  there is one custom universal here which perhaps is peculiar to this town the parents form societies for their children at a very early period of their lives these societies consist of  0    or more children of the same age and situation in life they assemble once a week in the houses of the different parents who entertain the company by turns with tea coffee biscuits and fruit and then leave the young assembly to the freedom of their own conversation this connection is strictly kept up through life whatever alterations may take place in the situations or circumstances of the individuals and although they should afterward form new or preferable intimacies they never entirely abandon this society but to the latest periods of their lives continue to pass a few evenings every year with the companions of their youth and their earliest friends  the richer class of the citizens have countryhouses adjacent to the town where they pass one half of the year these houses are all of them neat and some of them splendid one piece of magnificence they possess in greater perfection than the most superb villa of the greatest lord in any other part of the world can boast that is the prospect which almost all of them command the gardens and vineyards of the republic  the pays de vaud  geneva with its lake  innumerable countryseats castles and little towns round the lake  the valleys of savoy and the loftiest mountains of the alps all within one sweep of the eye  those whose fortunes or employments do not permit them to pass the summer in the country make frequent parties of pleasure upon the lake and dine and spend the evening at some of the villages in the environs where they amuse themselves with music and dancing  sometimes they form themselves into circles consisting of  0 or  0 persons and purchase or hire a house and gardens near the town where they assemble every afternoon during the summer drink coffee lemonade and other refreshing liquors and amuse themselves with cards conversation and playing at bowls a game very different from that which goes by the same name in england for here instead of a smooth level green they often choose the roughest and most unequal piece of ground the player instead of rolling the bowl throws it in such a manner that it rests in the place where it first touches the ground and if that be a fortunate situation the next player pitches his bowl directly on his adversarys so as to make that spring away while his own fixes itself in the spot from which the other has been dislodged some of the citizens are astonishingly dexterous at this game which is more complicated and interesting than the english manner of playing they generally continue their circle till the dusk of the evening and the sound of the drum from the ramparts calls to the town and at that time the gates are shut after which no person can enter or go out the officer of the guard not having the power to open them without an order from the syndics which is not to be attained but on some great emergency  this custom had its rise ever since the year   0  when the duke of savoy made an attempt to seize upon the town he marched an army in the middle of a dark night in the time of peace to the gates applied scalingladders to the ramparts and walls and having surprised the sentinels several hundred of the savoyard soldiers had actually got into the town and the rest were following when they were at length discovered by a woman who gave the alarm  the genevoise started from their sleep seized the readiest arms they could find attacked the assailants with spirit and energy killed numbers in the streets drove them out of the gates or tumbled them over the ramparts and the few who were taken prisoners they beheaded next morning without further process or ceremony  the genevese annually distinguish the day on which this memorable exploit was performed as a day of public thanksgiving and rejoicing  it is called le jour de lescalade there is divine worship in all the churches the clergymen on this occasion after sermon recapitulate all the circumstances of this interesting event put the audience in mind of the gratitude they owe to divine providence and to the valor of their ancestors which saved them in so remarkable a manner from civil and religious bondage enumerate the peculiar blessings which they enjoy and exhort them in the most pathetic strain to watch over their liberties remain steady in their religion and transmit these and all their other advantages unimpaired to posterity  the evening of this day is spent in visiting feasting dancing and all kinds of diversions  though the state keeps in pay a body of mercenaries they do not trust the safety of the republic to these alone all citizens of geneva are soldiers they are exercised several hours daily for two months every summer during which time they wear their uniforms and at the end of that period are reviewed by the syndics  geneva like all free states is exposed to partyrage and the public harmony is frequently interrupted by political squabbles one part of the citizens are accused of wishing to throw all the power into the hands of a few families and of establishing a complete aristocracy the other opposes every measure which is supposed to have that tendency and by their adversaries are accused of seditious designs  it is difficult for strangers who reside any considerable time at geneva to observe a strict neutrality the english in particular are exceedingly disposed to take part with one side or other among the citizens themselves political altercations are carried on with great fire and spirit a worthy old gentleman says moore in whose house i had been often entertained with great hospitality declaiming warmly against certain measures of the council asserted that all those who had promoted them merited death and if it depended on him they should all be hanged without loss of time his brother who was in that predicament interrupted him and said in a tone of voice which seemed to beg for mercy good brother surely you would not push your resentment so far  you would not actually hang them yes certainly replied the patriot with a determined countenance and you my dear brother should be hung first to show my impartiality  although this republic has long continued in a profound peace and there is no probability of its being soon engaged in any bloody conflict yet the citizens of geneva are not the less fond of the pomp of war  this appears in what they call their military feasts which are their most favorite amusements and which they take every opportunity of enjoying i was present says moore at a very grand entertainment of this kind which was given by the king of of the arquebusiers upon his accession to the royal dignity this envied rank is neither transmitted by hereditary right nor obtained by election but gained by skill and real merit  a war with this state like the war of troy must necessarily consist of a siege the skilful use of the cannon and arquebuse is therefore thought to be of the greatest importance during several months every year a considerable number of the citizens are almost constantly employed in firing at a mark placed at a proper distance any citizen has a right at a small expense to make trial of his skill in this way and after a due number of trials the most expert marksman is declared king  there has not been a coronation of this kind these ten years his late majesty having kept peaceable possession of the throne during that period but at last another person was found to excel in skill every competitor and was raised to the throne by the unanimous voice of the judges he was attended to his own house from the field of contest by the syndics amidst the acclamation of the people some time after this on the day of his feast a camp was formed on a plain without the gates of the city here the whole forces of the republic both horse and foot were assembled and divided into two distinct armies they were to perform a battle in honor of his majesty all the combatants having previously studied their parts this very ingenious warlike drama had been composed by one of the reverend ministers who is said to possess a very extensive military genius that the ladies and people of distinction who were not actually engaged might view the action with the greater ease and safety a large amphitheatre of seats was prepared for them at a convenient distance from the field of battle  every thing being in readiness the syndics the council strangers of distinction and relations and favorites of the king assembled at his majestys palace a little snug house situated in a narrow lane in the lower part of the city from the palace they marched in procession through the city with his majesty at their head and preceded by a band of music who played as may be supposed the most martial tunes they could possibly think of when this company came to the field where the troops were drawn up they were saluted by the officers and having made a complete circuit of both armies the king and all his attendants took their seats at the amphitheatre which had been prepared for the purpose  the impatience of the troops had been very visible for some time when the king was seated their ardour could no longer be restrained they called loudly to their officers to lead them to glory the signal was given they advanced to the attack in the most undaunted manner conscious that they fought under the eyes of their king the syndics their wives children mothers and grandmothers they disdained the thoughts of retreat they stood undisturbed by the thickest fire and smiled at the roaring of the cannon  the ingenious author of the battle had taken care to diversify it with several entertaining incidents an ambuscade was placed by one of the armies behind some trees to surprise the enemy this succeeded to a miracle although the ambuscade was posted in the sight of both armies and all the spectators  a convoy with provision advancing toward one of the armies was attacked by a detachment from the other and after a smart skirmish one half of the wagons was carried away by the assailants the other remained with the troops for whom they seemed to have been originally intended  a wooden bridge was briskly attacked and as resolutely defended but at length was trodden to pieces by both armies for in the fury of the fight the combatants forgot whether this poor bridge was their friend or their foe by what means it got into the midst of the battle is not easy to conceive for there was neither river brook nor ditch in the whole field  the cavalry on both sides performed wonders it was difficult to determine which of the generals distinguished himself most they were both dressed in clothes exuberantly covered with lace for the sumptuary laws were suspended for this day that the battle might be as magnificent as possible as neither of these gallant commanders would consent to the being defeated the reverend author of the engagement could not make the catastrophe so decisive and affecting as he intended  while victory with equipoised wings hovered over both armies a messenger arrived from the town hall with intelligence that dinner was ready this news quickly spread among the combatants and had an effect similar to that which the sabine women produced when they rushed between their ravishers and their relations the warriors of geneva relented at once and both armies suspended their animosity in the contemplation of that which they both loved they threw down their arms shook hands and were friends  thus ended the battle the same company which had attended the king to the field of battle marched with him in procession from thence to the maison de ville where a sumptuous entertainment was prefered this was exactly the reverse of a fete champetre being held in the townhouse and in the middle of the streets adjacent where tables were covered and dinner provided for several hundreds of the officers and soldiers  the king the syndics most of the members of the council and all the strangers dined in the town hall the other rooms as well as the outward court were likewise full of company there was much greater havoc at dinner than had been at the battle and the entertainment in other respects was nearly as warlike a kettledrum was placed in the middle of the hall upon which a martial flourish was performed at every toast this was immediately answered by the drums and trumpets without the hall and the cannon of the bastion prosperity to the republic is a favorite toast  when this was announced by the first syndic all the company stood up with their swords drawn in one hand and glasses filled with wine in the other having drank the toast they clashed their swords a ceremony always in every circle or club where there is a public dinner as often as this particular toast is named it is an old custom and implies that every man is ready to fight in defense of the republic  after we had been about two hours at table a new ceremony took place an hundred grenadiers with their swords drawn marched with great solemnity into the middle of the hall for the tables being placed in the form of a horseshoe there was vacant space in the middle sufficient to admit them they desired permission to give a toast this being granted each of the grenadiers by a welltimed movement like a motion in the exercise pulled from his pocket a large waterglass which being immediately filled with wine one of the soldiers in the name of all drank a health to king moses the first moses was the christian name of the new king his example was followed by his companions and all the company and was instantly honored by the sound of drums trumpets and artillery when the grenadiers had drank this and a toast or two more they wheeled about and marched out of the hall with the same solemnity with which they had entered resuming their places at the tables in the streets soon after this a man fantastically dressed entered the hall and distributed among the company some printed sheets which seemed to have come directly from the press this proved to be a song made for the occasion replete with gaiety wit and good sense pointing out in a humourous strain the advantages which the citizens of geneva possessed and exhorting them to unanimity industry and public spirit this ditty was sung by the man who brought it while many of the company joined in the chorus  when we descended from the town hall we found the soldiers intermingled with their officers still seated at the table in the streets and encircled by their wives and children they all arose soon after and dividing into different companies repaired to the ramparts the fields and the gardens where with music and dancing they continued in high glee during the rest of the evening  the whole exhibition of the day though no very just representation of the maneuvers of war or the elegance of a court entertainment formed the most lively picture of jollity mirth good humor and cordiality that could possibly be seen the inhabitants of a whole city  nay of a whole state united in one scene of good fellowship like a single family is surely no common sight  there are some of the citizens of geneva who deride the little military establishment of the republic and declare it to be highly ridiculous in such a feeble state to presume that they could defend themselves the very idea of resistance against savoy or france they hold as absurd they seem to take pleasure in mortifying their countrymen assuring them that in case of an attack all their efforts would be fruitless and their garrison unable to stand a siege of ten days  these politicians declaim against the needless expense of keeping the fortifications in repair and they calculate the money lost by so many manufacturers being employed in wielding useless firelocks instead of the tools of their respective professions were i a member of this republic i should have no patience with these discouraging malcontents who endeavor to depress the minds of their countrymen and embitter a source of real enjoyment  the garrison small as it is aided by the zeal of the inhabitants and regulated by that share of discipline which their situation admits would be sufficient to secure them from a coup de main or any immediate insult and might enable them to defend the town from the attempts of any one of the neighboring states till they should receive succor from some of the others independent of these considerations the ramparts are most agreeable walks convenient for the inhabitants and ornamental to the city the exercising and reviewing the militia form an innocent and agreeable spectacle to the women and children contribute to the health and amusement of the troops themselves and inspire the inhabitants in general with the pleasing ideas of security and of their own importance upon the whole the fortifications and the militia of geneva produce more happiness in these various ways taken together than could be purchased by all the money they cost expended in any other manner  this is more than can be said in favor of the greater part of the standing armies on the continent of europe whose numbers secure the despotism of the prince whose maintenance is a most severe burden upon the countries which support them and whose discipline instead of exciting pleasing emotions impresses the mind with horror  but it will be said they defend the nation from foreign enemies alas could a foreign conqueror occasion more wretchedness than such defenders when he who calls himself my protector has stripped me of my property and deprived me of my freedom i cannot return him very cordial thanks when he tells me that he will defend me from any other robber  the most solid security which this little republic has for its independence is founded on the mutual jealousy of its neighbors there is no danger of its meeting with the misfortune which befell poland geneva being such an atom of a state as not to be divisible it seems however as a kind of barrier or alarmpost to the swiss cantons particularly that of berne which certainly would not like to see it in the hands either of the king of france or of sardinia the acquisition is not worth the attention of the first and it is better for the second that the republic should remain in its present free and independent situation than that it should revert to his possession and be subjected to the same government with his other dominions for no sooner would geneva be in the possession of sardinia than the wealthiest of the citizens would abandon it and carry their families and riches to switzerland holland or england trade and manufactures would dwindle with the spirit and independence of the inhabitants and the flourishing enlightened happy city of geneva like other towns of piedmont and savoy would become the residence of oppression superstition and poverty in this situation it could add but little to the kings revenue while at present the peasants of his dominions resort every market day in great numbers to geneva where they find a ready sale for all the productions of their farms the land is on this account more valuable and the peasants are more at their ease though the rents are very high more so than in any other part of savoy the republic therefore in its present independent state is of more use to the king of sardinia than if it were his property  from this it may be perceived that the stability of this little fabric of freedom does not depend on the justice and moderation of the neighboring powers or on any equivocal support but is founded on the solid lasting pillars of their mutual interest  chap xvi commerce trade at geneva instead of waiting at home for customers travels in search of them and where it can be promoted the genevese always resort its principal branches are clocks watches articles of jewelry muslins and the finer sort of linens  great part of the clock and watch pieces are made in the mountains of switzerland this being the occupation of the inhabitants during the snowy season most of them work for watchmakers in geneva who purchase these pieces of them half wrought and work them up into watches which with incredible industry they vend all over france spain and germany they also export great quantities to the commercial houses which several of these geneva traders have in paris or to watchmakers of that city who get their name inscribed on them and sell them for their own work  london was formerly a great customer to them in the article of watches but we having increased this manufacture among ourselves furnish a sufficient quantity for our own consumption without the assistance of the genevese or if we take any of their goods it must be at our own price this proceeding has so far cooled the great fondness which the genevese pretended formerly to have for us that they now openly declare us to be a pack of jews who would have others take every thing from them without their taking any thing from others from england however it is that they still import the greater part of their cloth both for home consumption and for sending into italy and likewise that which they smuggle into france owning at the same time that french cloths at least the finer sort are preserable to the english  the two last wars in france having been very detrimental to their jewelry trade had driven a great number of workmen and dealers to emigrate from paris the genevese received them kindly and set them to work so that the jewelry trade at present fully repairs the loss which the industry of the english had occasioned them to sustain in that of their watches they seem even in a fair way to supplant france in this considerable branch of commerce the standard of the gold and silver which they work up is left to themselves but the standard is what a fine lady or fopling who must have a snuff box or a tweezer never trouble themselves about besides here is no duty to be paid and as to the duties of import into france and spain their manner of eluding them is thus the genevese merchant and his servant set out from geneva well mounted with two portmanteaus filled with watches and trinkets the master is in a swiss half uniform and at every pass and gate of a town claps on a cockade to every qui va la his answer is officier swiss and he goes on without further ceremony  the geneva trade consists chiefly in muslins callicoes lawns and flowered linens the greater part of the muslins worn in france come from hence and geneva has them from switzerland in the last war in france geneva even supplied the sale at port lorient with these goods which otherwise must have failed by the delay of the india companys return as to these matters all switzerland may be looked on as one vast manufacture in which every advantage concentrates entire freedom exemption from all duties plenty of raw materials cheapness of labor and the incessant industry of a very laborious people it must have been by means more efficacious than schemes memoirs and dissertations that geneva and basle have contrived to put off from time to time the prohibition of printed cottons in france a pretty nice conjecture of the advantages of such a prohibition to that kingdom might have been formed only from the bustle and consternation of these two cities  the result of this account shows that the balance of a very considerable trade between france switzerland and the genevese is entirely in favor of the latter who take nothing from france but corn making but a very slender deduction from the sums which the payment of the swiss troops draws from france and this trade is always carried on to their advantage whether part of the corn be remitted into germany or as is sometimes done reimported into france which is attended with considerable profit  chap xvii mount blanc and glaciers various attempts having been made to reach the summit of mount blanc situated near geneva on the borders of switzerland which is not only the highest mountain in the whole world but one of the most remarkable objects in it a chronological account of the principal expeditions which at length terminated successfully will not perhaps be uninteresting  the first enterprise was formed in      by m couterau and three guides of chamouny these adventurers set out from thence on the   th of july about eleven oclock in the evening and after having employed about    hours in mounting rugged and dangerous ascents in crossing several valleys of ice and large plains of snow they found themselves on the top next to mount blanc at first sight it appeared scarcely a league distance but they soon discovered that the clearness of the air the whiteness of the snow and its great height made it seem nearer than it was in reality and they perceived with regret that it would require four hours more to reach the summit even supposing it practicable the day being far spent and the vapors having begun to collect into clouds on the summit of the mountain they were obliged to desist from their enterprise as they were returning in great haste one of the party slipped in attempting to leap over a chasm of ice he held in his hand a long pole spiked with iron which he struck into the ice and upon this he hung dreadfully suspended for a few minutes until he was released by his companions many of these chasms are several hundred fathoms in depth and from one to five or six feet in breadth the danger this man had just escaped made such an impression upon him that he fainted away and continued for some time in that situation he was at length brought to himself and though considerably bruised sufficiently recovered to be able to continue his journey they arrived at chamauny that evening after having employed    hours in this expedition as some sort of recompense they enjoyed the satisfaction at least of having approached nearer to mount blanc than any former adventurers  the failure of this expedition seemed for some time to repress all future attempts to attain the top of mount blanc until the indefatigable mr bourrit infused a new spirit into the inhabitants of chamouny after reiterated though unsuccessful attempts on the   th of september      mr bourrit accompanied by six guides attempted to scale as he expresses himself the rampart of mount blanc when he suddenly found himself so extremely affected by the intense cold as to be unable to proceed  on the  th of august      dr paccard a physician of chamouny accompanied by james balma a guide sallied from thence on this memorable expedition and reached before dark the mountain of la cote which overhangs the upper part of the glacier of bosson here they passed the night and at three in the morning pursued their route over the ice ascended the dome of gout passed under the middle dome and at the last pyramid of rock turned to the east and continued along the ridge which is seen from geneva and lies on the left of the summit here they first began to feel such intense cold and such extreme fatigue that the dr was almost induced to relinquish the enterprise being however encouraged by the guide more accustomed to such fatiguing and dangerous expeditions he followed his companion the wind was so violent that in order to avoid its blowing in their faces they were obliged to walk sideways for a considerable time about six in the afternoon they at length attained the summit of mount blanc and stood triumphantly on a spot of ground which no one had reached before and at the elevation of       feet above the sea which is three times higher than snowdon and undoubtedly the highest point in the ancient globe they remained on the summit no more than half an hour the cold being so intense that the provision was frozen in their pockets and the ink congealed in their inkhorns  they had employed    hours in ascending and though they again reached the mountain of la cote in five hours yet they found great difficulty in descending their sight being debilitated by the reflection of the snow they arrived at ea cote about midnight after  0 hours unremitting fatigue having reposed themselves two hours they again sallied forth and returned to chamouny at eight in the morning their faces were excoriated and their lips exceedingly swelled dr pacard was almost blind and his eyes continued to be affected for a considerable time  we cannot expect any accurate experiments from these two persons to whom the glory of having first ascended the summit of mount blanc is undoubtedly due but they prepared the way for the observations and discoveries of future naturalists and particularly of m de saussure whose indefatigable zeal did not permit him to rest until he had reached the top of mount blanc and made those experiments which cannot fail greatly to elucidate the theory of the atmosphere  that able naturalist sat out on this successful expedition from the valley of chamouny on the   th of august      he was accompanied by    guides who carried a tent matrasses all necessary accommodations and instruments of experimental philosophy they passed the first night on the top of the mountain la cote in a hut previously constructed for that purpose at four oclock in the following afternoon they reached an elevation of nearly   000 feet above the level of the sea here they encamped and formed an excavation in the congealed snow which they covered with a tent in this icy habitation instead of suffering from the cold m de saussure felt such a suffocating heat from the closeness of the tent and the number of persons crowded in so small a compass that he was frequently obliged to go into the open air in order to breathe  the next morning the whole company departed at seven and found the ascent in some places so steep that they who preceded were obliged to hew out steps with a hatchet at eleven they reached the summit of mount blanc here they continued three hours and a half during which time m de saussure enjoyed with rapture and astonishment a view the most extensive as well as the most rugged and sublime in nature and made those observations which will render this expedition no longer a matter of mere curiosity  he did not find the cold so extremely piercing as was experienced by dr paccard and james balma on estimating the height of mount blanc from barometrical experiments he found it almost exactly correspond with that given by sir george shuckborough or       english feet above the level of the sea and which reflects the highest honor on the accuracy of the english observer by experiments with the hygrometer the air on the top of mount blanc contained six times less humidity than that of geneva and to this extreme dryness of the atmosphere he imputes the burning thirst which he and hs companions experienced it requires half an hour to boil water on the top of mount blanc    or    minutes are sufficient at geneva and    or    by the seaside by experiments on the electrometer the balls diverged only three lines the electricity was positive on the summit he noticed two butterflies on the wing and observed at the elevation of   000 feet above the sea the mosscampion in flower  he adds that the summits of mount blanc and the adjacent mountains were composed of granite and that after mount blanc the sereckhorn and mount rosa in piedmont appeared the most elevated points  m de saussure as well as many of his party found themselves extremely affected by the rarefaction of the air and at two began returning they defended a little lower than the place in which they passed the preceding night and arrived the next morning at the valley of chamouny without the least accident and as they had taken the precaution to cover their faces with crape their skins were not excoriated nor their sight debilitated  on the eighth of august a few days after m de saussures expedition mr beaufoy an english gentleman succeeded in a similar attempt though it was attended with greater difficulty arising from the enlargement of the chasms in the ice  no subject is more curious in natural history than the origin of these glaciers extending into fields of corn and pasture and lying without being melted in a situation where the sun is sufficient to bring the earth to maturity for it is almost literally true that with one hand a person may touch ice and with the other ripe corn  if a person could be conveyed to such an elevation as to embrace at one view the alps of switzerland savoy and dauphine he would behold a vast chain of mountains interscepted by numerous valleys and composed of many parallel chains the highest occupying the center and the others gradually diminishing in proportion to their distance from that center the most elevated or central chain would appear bristled with pointed rocks and covered even in summer with ice and snow in all parts not absolutely perpendicular on each side of this chain he would discover deep valleys clothed with verdure peopled with numerous villages and watered by many rivers in considering these objects with greater attention he would remark that the central chain is composed of elevated peaks whose summits are overspread with snow that the declivities excepting those parts extremely steep are covered with snow and ice and the intermediate depths and spaces are filled with immense fields of ice terminating in those cultivated valleys which border the great chain the branches most contiguous to the central chain would present the same phenomena only in a lesser degree at greater distances no ice would be observed and scarcely any snow but upon some of the most elevated summits and the mountains diminishing in height and ruggedness would appear covered with herbage and gradually sink into hills and plains  in this general survey the glaciers may be divided into two sorts the first occupying the deep valleys situated in the bosom of the alps distinguished by the name of lower glaciers the second which clothe the summits and sides of the mountains called upper glaciers the lower glaciers are by far the most considerable in extent and depth some stretch several leagues in length one in particular is more than    miles long and above three in its greatest breadth the thickness of the ice varies in different parts m de saussure found its general depth from  0 to  00 feet but questions not the information of those who assert that in some places its thickness exceeds even  00 feet  these immense fields of ice usually rest on an inclined plain being pushed forwards by the pressure of their own weight and but weakly supported by the rugged rocks beneath are intersected by large transverse crevices and present the appearance of walls pyramids and other fantastic shapes observed at all heights and in all situations wherever the declivity is beyond  0 or  0 degrees where the plain on which they rest is horizontal or only gently inclined the surface of the ice is nearly uniform and the traveller crosses them without much difficulty the ice is not so slippery as that of frozen ponds and rivers it is rough and granulated and is only dangerous to the passenger where there is a steep descent it is not transparent but extremely porous and full of small bubbles which seldom exceed the size of a pea and consequently is not so compact as common ice its perfect resemblance to the congelation of snow impregnated with water led m de saussure to conceive the following simple and natural theory on the formation of the glaciers  an immense quantity of snow is continually accumulating in the elevated valleys which are enclosed within the alps as well from that which falls from the clouds during nine months in the year as from the masses which are incessantly rolling from the steep sides of the circumjacent mountains part of this snow which is not dissolved during summer being impregnated with rain and snowwater is frozen during winter and forms that opaque and porous ice of which the lower glaciers are composed  the upper glaciers may be subdivided into those which cover the summits and those which extend along the sides of the alps those which cover the summits of the alps owe their origin to the snow that falls at all seasons of the year and which remains nearly in its original state being congealed into a hard substance and not converted into ice the substance which clothes the sides of the alps is neither pure snow like that of the summits nor ice which forms the lower glaciers but is an assemblage of both  the ascent of mount blanc being a work of so much danger and difficulty ordinary travelers content themselves in their tour through switzerland with going to take a view of the glaciers and of mount blanc from some of the mountains adjacent to the vale of chamouny there are five or six of these which all terminate upon one side of the valley of chamouny  the glacier des bois is not only the most accessible but one of the most curious it is not the widest but it descends without interruption from mount blanc itself and affords all the variety of objects we meet with in the glacier the lofty walls and towers the waving seas and the tremendous fissures  one of the most interesting objects here is the magnificent vault of ice at the foot of the glacier from whence the river arveron takes its source the access to it seems blocked up by hugh masses of rock wildly thrown about within immense blocks of transparent ice are scattered about the floor warning the traveller to trust himself with caution to the brittle arch over his head from the further part of the cavern boils forth melted ice forming rivulets that meander all about it in different years it puts on very different appearances it exposes itself to view only a short time for till the end of july or the beginning of august nothing appears but a rude mass of ice walling up the cavern at length this falls and all at once opens to view this beautiful vault which has not been unaptly termed the temple of the god of frost  what renders the passage over the glaciers so difficult and dangerous is the rents in the ice which are to be met with in every direction these rents says moore are from two to  00 feet wide and of an amazing depth reaching from the surface of the valley through a body of ice many hundred fathoms thick on throwing down a stone or any other solid substance we could hear the hollow murmur of its descent for a very long time sounding like far distant waves breaking upon rocks  chap xviii neuchatel the principality of neuchatel and vallengin stretches from the lake to the limits of franche comte containing in length from north to south about    leagues and about six in its greatest breadth the principality of neuchatel occupies all the plain together with the lower parts of the mountains while vallengin is totally enclosed within the jura parallel chains of the jura run from east to west and form in the most elevated part several valleys the lower grounds are laid out in arable lands and vineyards the higher consists of a large tract of forest intermixed with fields of barley and oats but what particularly deserves the attention of every curious traveller is the singular genius and industry of the very populous inhabitants of these valleys of which after having spoken of neuchatel we shall treat more fully  neuchatel and vallengin once formed two distinct principalities each having a separate and independent government but for some time past they have been united into one by the death of the duchess of nemours in   0  the sovereignty of these two countries became vacant to which as heir to the prince of orange frederic the first king of prussia amongst many others put in his claim and his right was acknowledged by the states of the country after his death it descended to his son frederic william who transmitted it with his other dominions to the late king of prussia and is now possessed by the present monarch  the whole principality contains near  0000 inhabitants of which there are  000 in the capital it is there the governor resides and the general administration of public affairs is carried on  the town of neuchatel is small it lies partly upon the little plain between the lake of neuchatel and mount jura and partly upon the declivity of that mountain in consequence of which situation some of its streets are rather steep at the commencement of the present century commerce was almost wholly a stranger here as the ridiculous pride of its being deemed degrading generally prevailed among them this senseless prejudice however is now nearly worn out and a considerable trade is carried on the chief article of their exportation is wine produced from the neighboring vineyards and much esteemed several manufactures also of cotton and muslin have been established with success and within these few years the merchants of this town have raised large fortunes  the mildness of the government and the general wellbeing of the inhabitants are visibly demonstrated from the increase of population among the natives and the prodigious influx of settlers the facility of acquiring the burghership of neuchatel has also prevented any decrease of the inhabitants  several public buildings have been lately erected at neuchatel at an expense far exceeding the revenues or even wants of this little state amongst others are a superb causeway leading toward the valley of s imici and a townhouse built of such solid materials as if it was intended to survive to the most distant posterity and to rival the duration of the much famed roman capital  the person to whom the burghers of neuchatel principally owe the embellishment of their town is m david perry late banker of the court at lisbon he was a citizen of neuchatel and was born in   0  he died on the   st of may      and the fortune he bequeathed to his country amounts to   0000 l which with the contributions in his life time renders his benefactions equal to almost  00000 l  his grateful country obtained from the king of prussia the title of baron in his favor a title which through his singular modesty he neither bore nor used in the signature of his letters the citizens of neuchatel have also placed the portrait of this generous benefactor in one of the apartments in which government assembles  the town consists of four large streets and an old castle in which the governor resides with two churches and a gymnasium around the town on all sides are vineyards gardens and pleasant seats  its regency consists of the lesser and greater council the former of which is composed of twentyfour members and the latter of forty these attend to the police and other public concerns  in the district of vallengin among the valleys of mount jura are the two celebrated villages of la chaux de fond and locle the inhabitants of which are so remarkably distinguished for their genius industry and skill in the mechanical arts and which flourish here in their greatest perfection the inhabitants who are computed to be about  000 carry on an extensive commerce in lace stockings cutlery and other different kinds of merchandise of their own manufactures but watches and every branch of clock making are the articles in which they particularly and eminently excel they not only make every utensil employed in those arts but have invented several and all sorts of workmen necessary for the completion of that branch of business such as painters enamellers engravers gilders etc are found in their villages where it is supposed that upon an average about forty thousand watches are annually made the genius and industry observable upon these mountains exhibit a scene uncommonly pleasing and no where perhaps except in geneva are there such a number apparently so much at their ease accordingly as every individual is sure not only of obtaining a comfortable maintenance for himself but of soon placing his children also in a way of getting their livelihood they all marry very early for women and children are employed in some of the branches of watchmaking and a child of but ten years old may earn ten pence a day by giving the last polish to steel instruments with the hand and as to the men there are few who do not get half a crown a day and some nine shillings  not many years ago the greatest part of these valleys was almost one continued forest but the wonderworking powers of industry have happily changed the scene into flourishing villages and fertile pastures population has increased of course and the following fact will give some idea how much it has increased formerly the produce of the country was more than sufficient for the consumption of its inhabitants at present although it is considerably more cultivated they draw seveneighths of their provision from franche comte and no wonder for besides the natural effect of their frequent and early marriages every stranger who brings a certificate of his good behavior is at liberty to settle here and to carry on any trade he thinks proper without the least restriction here no apprenticeship is necessary nothing is contraband and industry exerts herself untaxed  besides those particular arts already mentioned some of the inhabitants are well skilled in other branches of mechanical science and have invented several useful mathematical and agronomical instruments among those who have eminently distinguished themselves in this way is the famous jaquet dro whose son exhibited in england several automatical figures of a very singular and surprising construction one of these plays upon the harpsichord another draws landscapes and what is still more extraordinary a third copies any word presented to it or writes down whatever the company shall please to dictate  the origin of watchmaking in this part of switzerland is extremely curious in      one of the inhabitants brought with him a watch from england the first that had been seen in those parts which happening to be out of order he ventured to trust it in the hands of one daniel john richard of la sagne richard after examining the mechanism with great attention conceived himself capable and was determined to attempt to make a watch from the model before him but to this end he was destitute of every other assistance than the powers of his own native genius accordingly he employed a whole year in inventing and finishing the several instruments previously necessary for executing his purpose and in six months from that period by the sole force of his own penetrating and persevering talents he produced a complete watch but his ambition and industry did not stop here besides applying himself successfully to the invention of several new instruments useful for the perfection of his work he took a journey to geneva where he gained considerable information in the art he continued for some time the only man in those parts who could make a watch but business increasing he took in and instructed several associates by whose assistance he was enabled to supply from his single shop all the demands of the neighboring country toward the beginning of the present century he removed to locle where he died in      leaving five sons who all followed their fathers occupation from these the knowledge and practice of the art gradually spread itself till it at length became almost the universal business of the inhabitants and the principal cause of the populousness of these mountains  but it is not merely in these articles that the genius of the mechanical people is observable it discovers itself on all occasions when it can be applied to the purposes of their convenience and accommodation to give an instance the rocks in most parts of the alps being exceedingly hard and solid the water can only make its way along their sides and rush down in perpetual torrents but the strata which compose the jura being less firm and compact the rains and melted snow penetrate with impetuosity into the crevices and only discover themselves by breaking out into rivulets at the bottom of the mountains  now the peasants in order to avail themselves of this peculiarity have erected mills at a great expense and with incredible labor some yards under the rocks which are turned by those internal torrents of water that force their way through the crevices abovementioned for this purpose the builders have constructed wheels where it seemed scarcely practicable and have invented new modes of scaffolding and a great variety of other ingenious contrivances in order to facilitate their work  the inhabitants of these several districts are exceedingly courteous and ready to give every assistance in their power to strangers who visit their country they are in general very well informed in several branches of knowledge and as they usually employ their leisure hours in reading there are circulating libraries to be found in many of the villages  their houses are in general small but handsome and well built many of them are furnished with a degree of neatness and even elegance peculiarly striking indeed luxury or what according to the simplicity of manners is here so called has made no inconsiderable progress in these mountains of this one of the inhabitants of locle gave a curious proof who seriously complained that it was now no unusual circumstance for the master of a family to carry his wife to besancon to see a play and that there were now at least ten hairdressers settled at locle whereas some few years ago there was but one to be found in the town and its whole district  the constitution of neuchatel is a limited monarchy the machine of this government is indeed actuated by such nice springs that it is very difficult for a stranger to distinguish with any degree of accuracy the prerogative of the sovereign and the franchises of the people particularly as some even of their most important privileges depend upon mutual acquiescence and immemorial custom and not upon written laws upon the accession of frederic the first certain general articles which in a great measure established the prerogatives of the prince and the liberties of the subject were signed and ratified by the king  the prince confers nobility nominates to the principal offices of state both civil and military and appoints the chatelains and mayors who precide in the court of justice his revenues which are very moderate and scarcely amount to  000 l a year arises from certain demesnes from a small land tax from the tithes of wine and corn and from the tenth of the value on the sale of immoveables with regard to commerce no subjects pays any duties either on importation or exportation except for foreign wines imported into the town of neuchatel  during the absence of the prince he is represented by a governor of his own appointing who enjoys considerable honors but is extremely limited in his authority he convokes the three estate precedes in that assembly and has the casting vote if the suffrages happen to be equal he enjoys the power also in criminal cases of pardoning or of mitigating the sentence in the governors absence his place is supplied by the senior counselor of state  the people of vallengin assemble every three years in an open plain in order to elect their three masterburghers their function is to watch over the general interest of the people they are also in some cases deputed to neuchatel by the people whenever they are summoned by the governor and council of state in relation to any affair which particularly concerns their county  such are the general outlines of this remarkable constitution by which the liberties of the people are as well and perhaps better secured than even in the democratic cantons for although the most despotic prince in germany is their sovereign his power is exceedingly limited among the striking circumstances which characterise this government must be mentioned the very liberal encouragement given to strangers who settle in this country they enjoy every possible privilege of trade and commerce and in no state are fewer essential distinctions made between them and the nations the good effects of this enlarged policy has already been shown in the increased population of neuchatel and vallengin whereas a narrower and more contracted principle in some of the adjoining cantons has occasioned and continues to occasion a very manifest decrease of inhabitants  chap xix review of switzerland having now laid before our readers a pretty full and comprehensive account of the laws government state of literature and a situation of the principal towns and cantons of switzerland separately we shall conclude with some further remarks in relation to the customs and manners and political aspect of that country in general  what is very singular in the first place no part of europe contains within the same compass so many independent commonwealths and such a variety of different governments as are collected together in this remarkable and delightful country and yet with such wisdom has the helvetic union been composed and so little have the swiss of late years been actuated by a spirit of conquest that since the firm and complete establishment of their general confederacy they have seldom found occasion to employ their army against a foreign enemy nor have they been troubled with any civil commotions that were not soon happily terminated perhaps there is not a similar instance in ancient or modern history of a warlike people divided into little independent republics closely bordering upon each other and occasionally interfering in their respective interests having continued during so long a period in an almost uninterrupted state of tranquillity and thus while the several neighboring kingdoms suffer by turns all of horrors of war this favored nation enjoys the felicity of looking down with security upon the various tempests that shake the world around them  the happiness of a long peace however has neither broken the spirit nor enervated the arm of the swiss the youths are diligently trained to martial exercises such as running wrestling and shooting both with the crossbow and musket a considerable number of welldisciplined troops are always employed in foreign service and the whole people are enrolled and regularly exercised in their respective militias by these means they are capable of collecting a very respectable body of forces which would prove formidable to any enemy who should invade their country or attack their liberties thus whilst most of the other states on the continent are tending toward a military government switzerland alone has no standing armies and yet from the nature of its situation from its particular alliances and from the policy of its internal government is more secure from invasion than any other european power  the felicity of switzerland however does not consist merely in this peculiar exemption from the burdens and miseries of war as there is no country in which happiness and content more universally prevail among the people for whether the government is aristocratical democratical or mixed a general spirit of liberty pervades and actuates the several constitutions so that even the oligarchical states which are usually the most tyrannical are here peculiarly mild and the property of the subject is in general securely guarded against every kind of violation  this says addison must be chiefly ascribed to the nature of the people and the constitution of their governments were the swiss animated by zeal or ambition some or other of their states would immediately break in upon the rest or were the states so many principalities they might often have an ambitious sovereign at the head of them that would embroil his neighbors and sacrifice the repose of his subjects to his own glory but as the inhabitants of these countries are naturally of a heavy phlegmatic temper if any of their leading members have more fire and spirit than comes to their share it is quickly tempered by the coldness and moderation of the rest who sit at the helm with them to this we may add that the alps is the worst spot of ground in the world to make conquests a great part of its governments being so naturally entrenched among woods and mountains however we find no such disorders among them as we would expect in such a multitude of states for as soon as any public rupture happens it is immediately closed up by the moderation and good offices of the rest who interfere  as all the considerable governments among the alps are commonwealths so indeed it is a constitution the most adapted of any other to the poverty and barrenness of these countries we may see only in a neighboring government the ill consequences of having a despotic prince in a state that is most of it composed of rocks and mountains for notwithstanding there is a vast extent of lands and many of them better than those of the swiss and grisons the common people among the latter are much more at their ease and in a greater affluence of all the conveniences of life a princes court generally introduces a kind of luxury and magnificence that sets every particular person upon making a higher figure in his station than is generally consistent with his revenue  it is the great endeavor of the several cantons of switzerland to banish from among them every thing that looks like pomp or superfluity to this end the ministers are always preaching and the governors putting out edicts against gaming entertainments and fine clothes this is become more necessary in some of the governments since there have been so many refugees settled among them for though the protestants in france affect ordinarily a greater plainness and simplicity of manners than those of the same quality who are of the roman catholic communion they have however too much of their countrygallantry for the genius and constitution of switzerland should dressing feasting and balls once get among the cantons their military roughness would be quickly lost their tempers would grow too soft for their climate and their expenses outrun their income besides the materials for their luxury must be brought from other nations which would immediately ruin a country that has few commodities of its own to export and is not overstocked with money luxury indeed wounds a republic in its very vitals as its natural consequences are rapine avarice and injustice for the more money a man spends the more must he endeavor to augment his stock which at last sets the liberty and votes of a commonwealth to sale if they find any foreign power that is able to pay the price of them we see no where the pernicious effects of luxury on a republic more than in that of the ancient romans who immediately found itself poor as soon as this vice got footing among them though they were possessed of all the riches in the world we find in the beginnings and increases of their commonwealth strange instances of the contempt of money because indeed they were utter strangers to the pleasures that might be procured by it or in other words because they were wholly ignorant of the acts of luxury but as soon as they once entered into a taste for pleasure politeness and magnificence they fell into a thousand violencies conspiracies and divisions that threw them into all the disorders imaginable and terminated in the utter subversion of the commonwealth it is no wonder therefore the poor commonwealths of switzerland are ever laboring at the suppression and prohibition of every thing that may introduce variety and luxury besides the several fines that are set upon plays games balls and feastings they have many customs among them which very much contribute to the keeping up of their ancient simplicity the bourgeois who are at the head of the governments are obliged to appear at all their public assemblies in a black cloak and a band the womens dress is very plain those of the best quality wearing nothing on their heads generally but furs which are to be met with in their own country the persons of different qualities in both sexes are indeed allowed their different ornaments but these are generally such as are by no means costly being rather designed as marks of distinction than to make a figure the chief officers of berne for example are known by the crown of their hats which are much deeper than those of an inferior character the peasants are generally clothed in a coarse kind of canvas the manufacture of their own country their holy day clothes go from father to son and are seldom worn out till the second or third generation so that it is common enough to see a countryman in the doublet and breeches of his great grandfather  geneva is much politer than switzerland or any of its allies and is therefore looked upon as the court of the alps whither the protestant cantons often send their children to improve themselves in language and education the genevois have been very much refined or as others will have it very much corrupted by the conversation of the french protestants who make up almost a third of their people it is certain they have very much forgotten the advice that calvin formerly gave them in a great council a little before his death when he recommended to them above all things an exemplary modesty and humility and as great a simplicity in their manners as in their religion  in the times even of cato the censor the appian law was not better observed at rome than the sumptuary laws are at present in switzerland one is astonished says de langle how sumptuary laws can be established without driving the fairest part of the human race into rebellion against tyranny it is difficult to conceive how it has happened that the ladies have submitted to those cruel and childish prohibitions and by what means it came about that in switzerland as elsewhere the fair sex do not make the lash  feathers and artificial flowers are strictly forbidden it is in vain that the women complain murmur and make a horrible noise there is no gallant senator who will ever elevate his voice in their favor and imitating the example of the tribune valerius plead as proxy for the ladies in behalf of trinkets feathers and new fashions  were it not for those cruel prohibitions french baubles would find a ready market in switzerland the young women seem to devour them with their eyes and speak with raptures of france and more particularly of paris for paris is the capital of women it is there that the female swedes spaniards and italian run to learn how to govern men with ribbands and laces it is there that the female parisians reign in the midst of foolish fashions by means of charms ever varying ever new  and it is there that the english kneel and throw away their money and their melancholy  to those who have resided for any considerable time in switzerland it is quickly perceptible adds de langle how much the republican spirit of its inhabitants has universally degenerated the athenians the romans the spartans spent their time in public places  they listened to the orators of their country  they attended the senate they frequented the campus martius the place where the youths performed their military exercises  or served with the armies and fleets by sea or land  but the republicans of the cantons of switzerland who prefer tobacco to politics ninepins to orations and the bottle to news spend their lives in an alehouse where they smoke drink play and gaze at the passengers who are going by the women are entirely banished from their clubs or assemblies a society without women  there is nothing there but wine brandy and other spirituous liquors calculated to chase away care but the remedy is worse than the disease  it is especially in the little cantons that this custom is the most observable the two sexes have there almost become utter strangers and entirely unacquainted with each other if the husband speaks to his wife five or six times in the course of the year it is the most that is expected the women there live like so many queen bees  they vegetate among themselves and have not yet contrived how to sign and write a billet doux  the luxury of switzerland consists in the pleasures of the table the people look upon good cheer as the greatest of all blessings  the reports indeed do not resemble those of lafare and chaulieu the guests however neither eat nor drink less than they did sylvius the celebrated physician of paris who recommended to his patients to get drunk four times a week would have made his fortune in this part of the world next to germany switzerland is the country where they drink most the character of a harddrinker is actually a recommendation there in a great number of the cantons they still repeat with admiration the story of an ambassador from france who on returning home to his own court prepared to take leave of the deputies  your excellency said their magistrate must not depart without drinking some of the wine of etrier the wine of etrier replies the ambassador ought to be drunk out of a boot and immediately pulling off one of his own he fills and empties it in an instant springs into his saddle and rides away with the swiftness of an arrow  we perhaps condemn without sufficient reflection the too liberal use of wine among the swiss it may be to the juice of the grape that they are indebted for many of their best qualities it is commonly remarked that drunkards are very good sort of people  that they are incapable of hatred  that their hearts are very seldom corrupt or vicious  that they are open and candid and consequently very easy to be known  in the juice of this berry from which coffee is made says de langle consists the luxury of the people of switzerland on the top of their mountains  on the sides of their steep rocks  where the most common refinement has not yet penetrated and where the inhabitants have still preserved the simplicity of their ancient manners the custom of drinking coffee is carried to excess and it is not uncommon to see maidservants and female peasants pawning their petticoats and their stays to purchase sugar to render it palatable if the rage for this beverage is attended with some inconveniences it cannot on the other hand be doubted but that the people are become much more sober by its use that drunkenness has become infinitely more uncommon since its introduction and that it has effected what neither the fine harangues of socrates the epigrams of martial the discourses of seneca in former times or the best moral treatises and the finest declamations on temperance in our own days have been able to accomplish although coffee is familiar to most of the inhabitants of the globe and its use almost universal were it still more common the taverns would have less company and the artizans and laborers in great cities might by little and little leave off the custom of spending in two or three hours the price of fifteen or twenty pounds of breads which would maintain a whole family for a week  a friend of socrates complained that provisions were exceedingly dear at athens the wine of chio was fifty livres a bottle honey in proportion a fish twenty deniers and as to cinnamon it was sold at a most extravagant price socrates on this conducted his friend to the place where hydromel and cummin were sold these might be procured for a trifle it is just the same in switzerland the necessaries of life may be had cheap luxuries alone are expensive one may live there on a very small nnuity and the man of forty crowns per annum an imaginary character drawn by the masterly pen of voltaire could very easily have enjoyed his four meals a day in that country  a real misanthrope is a monster unknown to nature for nature never made one and yet notwithstanding this the swiss with a few exceptions are melancholy taciturn fond of sequestered and peaceable retreats and seem not to indulge in the gay sallies of wit and enjoyment it is undoubtedly the awful appearance of the mountains the precipices and the avalanches that they have continually before their eyes which intimidates and prevents them from laughing their women are more courageous neither the glaciers the rocks nor the mountains make any impression on them almost all the women in switzerland are lively and are as playful as kittens a little ball will amuse them even a butterfly will divert and make them laugh the men in switzerland in general exhibit a certain degree of melancholy in all their motions even in their dancing they are leaden heeled and have no ear  the women on the contrary dance with great vivacity are quick in all their motions light lively and always in the air it seems as if the earth burnt their feet it is improper however remarks de langle that they should dance with downcast eyes without ever looking at their partners  this modesty and reserve so commendable at church at table or in any other assembly ought to be entirely banished from the ballroom amorous looks friendly squeezes of the hand even kisses themselves animate a ball render it more agreeable and never give occasion for scandal  the violin the clarinet the tamborine and the flagelet purify every thing  those who preside over this part of education ought to command their pupils to smile at every step there is nothing in the world more unnatural than to see an englishman put on a serious and sulky appearance amidst the quick tunes of an allemande black and white night and day form less outrageous contrasts  the frivolity however which we have noticed among the swiss ladies is only in appearance switzerland is the country of all others where the women in general converse most naturally most judiciously and know on proper occasions how to give the best advice they are well educated and are endowed with uncommon accomplishments poetry history philosophy even politics are within the sphere of their knowledge and indeed nothing appears difficult to their comprehension they are also fond of the fine arts and excel the acquirements adapted to the fair sex most of them play upon some instrument dance ride on horseback and sing like so many larks  the passions are very violent in switzerland but the ladies are so savagely virtuous adds de langle that one may write on almost all their doors what dante says in his poem is inscribed over the entrance into the infernal regions from this place is banished all hope  the courtezans of berne are the handsomest women in all europe i doubt if rhodope who out of the profits of her profession erected one of the egyptian pyramids or phryne who by the same means rebuilt the walls of thebes were more beautiful or more seductive  with respect to the men it must be acknowledged that notwithstanding the sombre appearance of their aspect it is easy to discern among the swiss a degree of simplicity and integrity that renders all intercourse with them safe estimable on account of a thousand good qualities the people of switzerland will be found to possess a more pure system of morals than any where else discretion is their favorite quality  as much to be trusted as silence itself  though they have been calumniated by those who on account of a few uncommon instances of parsimony have not been ashamed to accuse the whole nation of a sordid avarice and of making use of unjustifiable means of procuring wealth yet no nation is in general more generous and more hospitable than they are there are a great number of charitable asylums to be found in every part of switzerland a prodigious multitude of almshouses for the maintenance of the aged many foundations for the accommodation of the unfortunate and more especially for the reception of pregnant women  among those charitable institutions a more reputable one never existed in any part of the globe since mankind abjuring the state of nature have united together than that of the society of emulation and compassion at basle no where do they better observe or exercise with more boundless charity that delicate regard and tenderness so necessary to be exerted toward those bashful poor who are ashamed to declare their wants all the members who compose this amiable confraternity are citizens distinguished by their humanity by the purity of their manners and by never having incurred the censure of the public genteel families who have fallen into indigence  young women whom misfortunes might have led to dishonor  the shopkeeper  the mechanic burdened with a numerous family of children  widows  orphans and more particularly the inhabitants of the adjoining country are the objects of their paternal solicitude it is from these circumstances that the appearance of misery never shocks the eye of a stranger in the cantons of switzerland  if the traveller does not like the poets in their flowery descriptions hear the pipe of the shepherd the song of the labourer and the laughter of the shepherdess if he does not perceive pan at a distance crowned with flowers and his reed in his mouth if he does not see fauns sylvans groves bowers and rivulets if he has not constantly before his eyes landscapes animated by groves by dances and by songs he does not however as in france in italy and in germany see the most hideous rags and the most disgusting nakedness he is not pursued along the road by skeletons in want of food and by a crowd of little unhappy wretches who tell him of the number of their brothers and sisters exposed to famine and of their sick mother who is dying in bed  the inhabitants of one half of switzerland profess the protestant religion it was zinglius bucer and brilinger who may be reckoned the authors of the reformation in switzerland it was they who first dared to deny the infallibility of the pope to brave his anathemas his keys and his triple crown the desire of shaking off the yoke of the roman pontiff inflamed every bosom berne zurie and basle embraced the opinions of calvin concerning grace free will and predestination and without respect for holy imposture in a moment the altars were demolished the crosses the chalices the images were trampled upon the missals were torn in pieces the plaster saints were reduced to powder and the wooden ones given to the poor people to light their fires with  it was about this period that the protestant canton by an edict prohibited every one from saying any thing of god either good bad or indifferent and it was in the midst of these troubles occasioned by the reformation that the inhabitants of basle in their fury precipitated the legate of pope xxii from the top of a terrace  these times are no more europe has assumed a new appearance  fanaticism no longer occasions the death of any one  although the reformed is the national and prevailing religion in the protestant cantons yet all sects are tolerated all communions admitted and all kinds of worship are allowed at berne at zuric and at neuchatel there are a great number of papists of anabaptists and moravians the preadamites also have made a great progress there and have already acquired a number of proselytes they boldly affirm that the world has existed from all eternity that warmth cold dry and wit have never been confounded and yet the words chaos matter etc are only poetical terms for night and day  though the government of switzerland allows to all sects the liberty of thinking of praying and of worshipping god after their own particular fancy yet the catholics have not any churches in the protestant cantons besides the enigmatical and mysterious foundation of the roman faith has always appeared to them to be whimsical and beyond the reach of human belief the priests and monks have been the cause of most of the insurrections in switzerland the remembrance of their rapacity of their lust and their depraved manners is still so fresh and as it were yet bleeding in their memory in fine crimes of every species have so often profaned the sanctuary and sullied the priesthood in this country that the reformed still continue to regard the roman faith as a rotten branch of christianity  the churches of the reformed religion are entirely destitute of ornament as to the cathedrals they are models of gothic architecture the buildings in no country better demonstrate how much the artists of the   th the   th and the   th centuries excelled in carving in design in general and in majesty and grandeur in particular within the protestant church all is simplicity one neither sees gold nor rubies there are only a few benches and chairs and a pulpit and communion table  this kind of worship is too naked religion stands in need of drapery and machinery  the reformed should admit ornaments and pictures into their temples and above all music to inflame the imagination and raise the soul to the divinity the people ought to be soothed with the majesty of ceremonies the vapor of incense and the melody of instruments and of the human voice sumptuous as was the temple of solomon it might perhaps have remained empty had it not reechoed night and day with the songs and instruments of the daughter of sion  while speaking of the holy place  while speaking of the sacred ceremonies  in the midst of the cares that surrounded his throne  in the midst even of his most brilliant victories david always thinks on concerts of harmony and of music and demands continually that his songs may be accompanied by the harp the cymbal the organ and the trumpet  montagne whom we may look upon as the author who has spoken most merrily of death and who repeatedly says with his usual gaity and frankness that he would rather meet death on horseback than in his bed to avoid the blubbering retinue that surrounds the dying ought to have inhabited and dwelt in switzerland there they have no clergymen who menace the expiring patient with bellflames no monks who make death a hideous affair and paint the avenging angel in black and hideous colors the protestants sustained by their considence in a god full of bounties die conversing and smiling with their family no where are those languishing on a sick bed so composed and so serene one may almost exclaim vive la mort in these protestant countries  it is the strong belief of a resurrection  it is the certainty of being more happy  it is the solacing idea that their friends and relations are still in existence and that they shall enjoy hereafter the pleasure of their intercourse and society that softens the horrors of death among these people  that enables them to look it in the face without trembling and without growing pale and makes them play as it were with it in the same manner as the peasants of bohemia and the tyrol do with serpents notwithstanding their enormous thickness their frightful hisses and their flamecoloured eyes  nothing can be more simple than the funerals in this country are the swiss more reasonable than any other nation think it is ridiculous to escort with pomp and to inter with idle and useless ceremony a mass of flesh without life stranger to all that passes concerning it and ignorant whether they laugh or cry around his coffin there is neither wax tapers nor coffin the dead corpse being covered with straw is thrown into a cart and the driver whips on to the churchyard the obsequies of the magistrates are performed rather a little less cavalierly their bodies are carried by bearers their brother magistrates and their relations follow in precession a large cloak covers the corpse from head to foot a streamer of crape floats behind it in the air and a huge flapped hat shades the face from the light of heaven all the burial places are without the gates of the cities and towns the most absolute democracy reigns in them the rich man and the beggar the servant and the master confounded one with the other rot in conjunction  after the example of the greeks and romans the swiss choose to live among the dead  like them they make the churchyards their favorite walks like them they plant these spots with sycamores with cypresses and other melancholy trees which recall the idea of death and invite affliction to repose under their shade  the swiss says de langle do not pay obedience to that wise precept of moses keep your dead for three days at zuric at berne and among the little cantons if you happen to sleep a little longer than usual they think you dead and inter you immediately in the canton of berne more especially a sick man scarcely appears to utter his last sigh when the people begin to strip him they are contented with simply feeling his pulse with applying their hand to his breast or presenting a glass to his lips to discover if he yet breathes  among other unfortunate people who have been heard to cry from within their coffin where are you carrying me i am not dead the people there still recollect and repeat with great commiseration the story of madame langhans who was actually buried alive the tomb of this lady remarks de langle as well as coxe is worthy of inspection the monument is placed on the ground as we observed when speaking of berne and represents a grave covered with a broken tombstone madame langhans is supposed to have heard the trumpet that is to proclaim the day of judgment to have awoke at its sound to have torn her winding sheet and to have arisen from her grave to take her place in the celestial mansions  this composition at once warm and original in this conception equally simple and sublime and for the idea of which we shall in vain search homer pindar and all the poets both ancient and modern electrifies and excites our attention in an uncommon degree  this monument remarks de langle is the production of m nahl a young sculptor of sweden who after having traveled throughout europe and displayed every where the most astonishing proofs of the warmth and originality of his genius went to london where he died a prisoner for debt  how often in his life time may not the man of genius exclaim my kingdom is not of this world he who possesses a mediocrity of talents is the man who is beloved we fly from and hate the man of penetration and the man of abilities we dread his piercing eye we would willingly destroy him he resembles a troublesome neighbor whose windows overlook our own apartments  the swedish artists remarks de langle are not fortunate when they leave their own country i esteemed living and i saw at genoa while dead a painter born at stockholm who was found lifeless before his lodgings and who had been so enfeebled by want that he had not sufficient strength to open his own door this young man was endowed with one quality equally amiable and interesting his humanity was such that he never put his money when he had any in his pocket he always held it in his hand that he might not hear a recapitulation of the miseries of those who addressed him for charity  the prisons in switzerland ought to serve as a model for all the prisons in europe they are large healthy well aired and each apartment contains a bed a little stove a window and a night chair the prisoners receive a pound and a half of bread and a certain quantity of flesh or of grains daily they have clean linen once a week and clothes when they are wanted the petty rogues are separate from the criminals committed for atrocious offenses and each prison has an hospital or infirmary attached to it the use of spirituous liquors is prohibited we never see in switzerland as elsewhere those barbarous gaolers who make the very air on which their prisoners respire venal and sell to them at an exorbitant price the stinking straw on which they are permitted to repose  the use of dungeons is unknown in switzerland and ought to be proscribed in every part of the globe when a prisoner is enclosed and chained when the doors are well locked and barred flight is impracticable and it is out of the power of fortune to contrive an escape  whoever does not intend to commit injustice or to make lawsuits immortal ought to give judgment in public says a king of macedonia the swiss who adhere to this maxim try all their criminals in the open air civil causes are canvassed privately but the parties never languish under the tortures of suspense for this people seem to have taken the prompt decisions of the athenians and the roman tribunals as their models  the punishment of death is almost fallen into disuse the people talk of an execution for ten years after it has taken place in switzerland they are economical of human blood the magistrates appear to be actuated by the maxim which inculcates that society ought not to cut off one of its members for a slight offense  instead of being subjected to capital punishments felons are imprisoned in the house of correction the regulations in these houses are so excellent and so mild criminals are so well fed and so well attended that if it were not for the iron ring about the leg the hook at the neck and the chain by which they are linked together many worthy people who are in poverty would be very happy in their situation  if the atrocity of a crime should oblige the judges to pronounce sentence of death the cord is the only instrument of punishment so humane are they that the culprit is first made drunk and then is hanged as it were without perceiving it he has no more idea of the death he is to suffer than an oak about to be cut down has of its destruction  the swiss says de langle carry on such an immense trade in printed calicoes and ribbands that they may be said to furnish half the world with topknots cloaks and petticoats sully the minister of henry iv looked on those men as fools who pretended to an uncommon share of intrepidity by having doubled the cape of good hope sully who assigned to manufactures the last rank in political economy who preferred the most common fruit and pulse to all the scarce and costly productions that the indies could boast has advised the swiss to abandon their looms and betake themselves to the plough for want of laborers one half of their country remains uncultivated they however despise the earth disdain its productions and think that agriculture would dishonor them  from hence proceeds the necessity of importing at a great expense from the milanese from france from alsace from the circle of swabia and the marquisate of baden corn eatables and provisions of all kinds which the delicate hands of the inhabitants disdain to procure for themselves from hence proceed those heaths which seem to have no end from hence those putrid and extensive marches which are to be met with particularly in the canton of berne which by means of their pestilential vapors and unhealthy fogs destroy a number of children annually  the cultivation of the earth has not always been despised in switzerland for their historians recite the following anecdote with no small share of pride  a duke of austria while traveling on horseback in the canton of zuric saw near to the high road four noble horses harnessed to a plough a youth who possessed a charming person directed their motions while an old man whose hair was whitened by age opened the furrows surprised at the superior air of the two laborers no less than at the beauty of the cattle the duke stopped and turning toward the grand master of his household said i have never seen such respectable peasants or such fine horses before be not astonished my lord replies this officer these are the baron de hugi and his son behold at the foot of yonder hill is the ancient castle belonging to their family and if you are still in doubt tomorrow you will see them come to do homage to you  accordingly on the next day the duke perceives the same laborers arrive on horseback at his court attended by a numerous retinue of their vassals after the baron had paid the usual homage to the sovereign he presented his son to him and entered into conversation the duke being unable to stifle his curiosity seized on this opportunity to satisfy his impatience was it you said he whom i saw near to the highway holding a plough superbly decorated yes my lord replies the baron next to a war undertaken for the defense of ones country i know of no occupation more honorable for a gentleman than that of cultivating his own estates i therefore do this as an example to my son  thus thought and thus acted the ancient swiss who equalling the romans in their courage resemble them also in their taste for agriculture and a country life the same hands that wielded the lance or carried the banner thought not themselves dishonored by using the spade and brightening the ploughshare more than once in the midst of the alps and at the foot of mount jura as well as on the banks of the tiber the general has been seen leaving his plough to repel at the head of his equals the enemies of his country and returning triumphant he has been known to follow his suspended labors with additional ardour one may see from hence that a state may be as much indebted for its prosperity to ceres as to bellona  but it is more especially in an age when agriculture appears to be honored and when economical societies are every where occupied in dissertations and observations that the people of switzerland should be so neglectful of their marshes there is no land however barren it is or however much it may be covered with briars and thorns but the spade or the hedging bill will make it wave with a golden harvest or bloom with roses  end of switzerland map of the island of corsica map of corsica  of the island of corsica from boswell and others chap i situation extent air soil productions and population corsica is an island of the mediterranean sea situated between the   st and   d degree of north latitude and between the  th and  0th degree of east longitude it has on the north the ligurian sea and gulf of genoa on the east the tuscan sea on the south a strait of ten miles which separates it from sardinia and on the west the mediterranean it is about  00 miles south of genoa and  0 southwest of leghorn from whence it can plainly be seen when the weather is clear it is   0 miles in length and from  0 to  0 in breadth being broadest about the middle it is reckoned  00 miles in circumference but an exact measurement around it would extend to  00 miles as it is edged with many promontories and with a variety of bays  pliny the elder has given us a short but very accurate account of the geography of corsica it extends from north to south and is about   0 miles in length for the most part  0 in breadth and     in circumference it has    states and two colonies mariana founded by marius and aleria founded by the dictator sylla of these    states not above five or six can now be traced and the colonies are only to be marked by their ruins  seneca the philosopher has left us two most horrid pictures of corsica very false indeed but executed with uncommon strength of fancy and expression stoic as he was of a grave and severe demeanor he did not escape the emperors jealousy but being accused as one of the many gallants with whom the profligate julia had been guilty of adultery he was banished to corsica where he remained for seven years and when in the province of cape corso they still show an old ruin called senecas tower here he composed his book de consolatione to polybius and his mother helvia with several other works and here he indulged his fretted imagination in epigrams full of spleen against the place of his exile he has also vented his spleen in the same extravagant manner in his books de consolatione but we must consider that notwithstanding all the firmness of seneca his mind was then clouded with melancholy and every object around him appeared in rueful colors  corsica is in reality a most agreeable island it had from the ancient greeks the name of kallista on account of its beauty and we may believe it was held in considerable estimation since callimachus places it next to his favorite delus  it is charmingly situated in the mediterranean from whence continual breezes fan and cool it in summer and the surrounding body of water keeps it warm in winter so that it is one of the most temperate countries in that part of the globe its air is fresh and healthful except in one or two places which are moist and where the air especially in summer is suffocating and sickly but in general the corsicans breathe a pure atmosphere which is also keen enough to brace their fibers more than one would expect under so warm a sun  this island was anciently a small kingdom and in the year  0  was conquered by the genoese who drove the saracens out of it in the eleventh century the island was taken from them by the pisanese in the   th century the genoese again got possession of it they have since been dispossessed of it at different times by other powers but this island has always been ceded to them again till within these few years when genoa finding the corsicans discontented with their government surrendered its right to the king of france under whose dominions it continued during the french monarch but on the revolution of this country the corsicans in a formal manner requested the protection of england and surrendered its crown to the king of britain and it is now governed by a viceroy  corsica has indeed been pretty generally represented as unwholesome which perhaps has been owing to the bad report given of it by the romans who established their colonies at aleria and mariana which from their damp situation occasioned a great death among the inhabitants and accordingly these colonies soon went to ruin but all the interior parts of the island have very good air  this island is remarkably well furnished with good harbors so that we may apply to it what florus says of the campania nihil hospitalius mari nothing more hospitable to the sea it has on the north centuri on the west san fiorenzo isola rossa calvi and ajaccio on the south it has bonifaccio and on the east portobeccio bastia and macinajo  diodorus siculus celebrates corsica for the excellence of its harbors the island being of very easy access says this writer has a most beautiful port called the syracusian this which was anciently called the syracusian has now the name of porto vecchio of which it is proper to take particular notice  porto vecchio is a spacious haven capable of containing a very large fleet it is five miles long above a mile and a half broad has a great depth of water and a good bottom and being landlocked on every side is well sheltered from storms nature has also placed a high and rocky mountain like a stately column to point it out at a great distance in short porto vecchio may vie with the most distinguished harbors in europe  the only objection to it is the badness of the air occasioned by the marshy grounds which lie in the neighborhood but this disadvantage may be remedied as has been done at leghorn  from this account of the harbor of corsica it will appear of how great consequence an alliance with this island might be to any of the maritime powers of europe for a fleet stationed there might command the navigation of genoa tuscany and the ecclesiastical state that between spain and naples and a good share of that to the levant not to mention its influence over that of sardinia and it may be material to observe that vessels stationed in the ports of corsica might be formidable to france as the western side of the island is directly opposite to the extensive coast of province on which a descent might be made with cruisers in a very short time  diodorus siculus describes corsica as an extensive island very mountainous abounding in large forests and watered with many rivulets indeed the interior parts of the island are in general mountainous though interspersed with fruitful valleys but have a peculiar grand appearance and inspire one with the genius of the place with that undaunted and inflexible spirit which will not bow to oppression  the great division of corsica is into the di qua and the di la dei monti the country on this side and the country on the other side of the mountains reckoning from bastia by the mountains is understood that great range of them which rises beyond aleria and stretches across the island intersecting it however by no means equally for the country di qua is a third more than that of di la  another division is into provinces of which there are nine for although a great part of this country long went under the denomination of feudos and is still called so in the maps the jurisdiction of the signors is now gradually wearing out and will soon be sunk into the general power of the state  the next division of corsica is into pieves a pieve is properly an ecclesiastical appointment containing a great number of parishes over which is placed a pievano who superintends the priests and draws a certain part of the tithes but this division is as much used for civil affairs as for those of the church  there are large tracts of uninhabited land in corsica mostly covered with woods to some parts of which the peasants resort in summer to feed their flocks and to gather chestnuts making little sheds for themselves to lie under there is hardly such a thing as a detached farmhouse to be seen in the island like what are scattered every where over great britain for the corsicans gather together in little villages which they call by corruption paeses countries i remember says boswell when i was first told that i should travel a great many miles without seeing a country i could not conceive what they meant the corsicans are in greater safety and have more society with each other by their living in villages which is still the custom in the canton of switzerland and some parts of germany as it was anciently among all nations  the corsican villages are frequently built on the very summit of their mountains on craggy cliffs of so stupendous a height that the houses can hardly be distinguished during the day but at night when the shepherds kindle their fires the reflection of such a variety of lights makes these aerial villages have a most picturesque and pleasing appearance  corsica is extremely well watered its principal lakes are those of ino and crena about two miles from each other both situated on the highest mountain in the island called by the ancients mons aureus and now monte rotondo it is of an amazing height and may equal any of the alps from the top of it there is a most extensive view of all corsica of the seas and of sardinia with distant prospects of italy and france while the mediterranean and many of its little isles are also under the eye but people seldom go to take this view for the upper part of the mountain is almost a perpendicular rock so that a man must climb two miles with the help of his hands and knees and for the greatest part of the year this immense mountain is covered with snow these two lakes of ino and crena are both of considerable extent  the rivers of corsica are the gola a large and beautiful river which takes its rise from the lake of ino traverses several provinces and after a course of above  0 miles empties itself into the sea just by the ancient city of mariana the tavignano is also a considerable river which takes its rise from the lake of crena and after traversing a long tract of rude country empties itself into the sea just by the ancient city of aleria the restonica which though but a small river is famous in corsica on account of its particular qualities its water is clear as crystal and most agreeable to drink so that seneca certainly never saw the restonica otherwise he would not have said that corsica had not haustus aquae a draught of water the rectonica is said to be of a mineral nature and very wholesome it has a virtue of whitening every thing the stones in its channel are like as many pieces of chalk it will make iron look almost like silver and never rust the corsicans frequently dip the barrels and locks of their guns in it  there are several other rivers of which we shall not give a particular description there are also a great many rivulets which serve to enrich the country and keep it constantly fresh  it has been said that with proper care and expense some of the corsican rivers might be rendered navigable but this would be a very idle project for their courses are exceedingly rapid and when there has been a great deal of rain the torrents which tumble from the mountains often bring down large fragments of rock which would dash in pieces any vessels that they should encounter  thus are many mineral springs both of hot and cold kind in different parts of the island which the inhabitants of the country find to be very efficacious for the cure of most distempers  corsica is extremely well supplied with fish trout and eel are found in great plenty very fat and of an uncommon size but the rich treasure of fish for corsica is in its sea for on all its coasts there is the greatest variety of all the best kinds and in particular a sort of ton or sturgeon and the small fish called the sardinas which is of an exquisite taste and in several places the corsicans have beds of oysters remarkably large of which they have not only a sufficiency for their own consumption but export a great many to italy  from the earliest times corsica has been famous for its excellent fish juvenal when satyrising the excessive luxury of the romans in his time who brought every delicacy from the greatest distance says mullus erit domini quem misit corsica juv sat v l    a precious mullet from the corsick seas nor less the masters pampered taste can please   corsica has as great a variety of animals as most countries the horses here are in general of a very small breed procopius in his wars of the goths says they run about in herds and were little bigger than sheep they are however remarkably lively and very hardy somewhat of the nature of welsh ponies or of the little horses called shelties which are found in the high lands and islands of scotland the asses and mules here are also small but very strong and wonderfully agile in scrambling along the steep rocky mountains for there are hardly any made roads in the island had their country been open and accessible they had been easily subdued by regular troops it was in a good measure owing to her rugged hills that ancient scotland preserved her independence  the black cattle are larger in proportion than the horses but the greatest part of the island is not very proper pasture for them so in general they do not give much milk and their beef is lean and tough there is not so great occasion for milk in corsica as they make no butter oil supplying its place as in italy and most warm countries they however make a good deal of cheese in some pieves  there are here a vast number of goats which browse upon the wild hills and put one in mind of virgils bucolicks where mention is so often made of this animal sheep are also very plentiful and have fine feeding so that their mutton is very sweet and juicy and atones for the badness of the beef  the corsican sheep are generally black or of a dusky color a white sheep being here and there to be met with in a flock as black ones are amongst our sheep the wool is coarse and hairy which the people of the country impute to their sheep being of a mongrel race they have had thoughts of helping this by importing a good breed from england or spain but it is averred by the breeders of sheep that the quality of the wool is not so much owing to the kind of sheep as to the nature of their pasture for those sheep who bear very rough fleeces when upon one farm will when put upon another of a different soil bear fleeces exceedingly fine it is very common here for sheep to have more horns than two many of them have six  the forests of this island abound in deer and there is here a curious animal called the muffoli it resembles a stag and has horns like a ram and a skin uncommonly hard it is very wild and lives on the highest mountains where it can hardly be approached it is so nimble it will jump from rock to rock at the distance of many feet and if hard chaced to the extremity of a cliff from whence it can reach no other it will throw itself over and with surprising agility pitch upon its horns without receiving any hurt when these creatures are young they are very easily tamed  the corsican animals in general appear wild to strangers polybius gives us a reason for it all the animals in the island appear to be wild on this account that it is so rude and steep and so thick with trees that the shepherds are not able to follow their flocks the wild boar is found here in great plenty indeed their swine which are very numourous have all a mixture of the wild breed and being fed on chestnuts they are agreeable food  the corsicans are very fond of hunting the wild boar for which there is here a race of dogs particularly excellent they have smooth hair and are between a mastiff and a strong shepherds dog they are large and exceedingly fierce but when once they have taken an attachment they are very faithful to their master watch him night and day and are most undaunted in his defense  procopius tells us that there were in corsica apes wonderfully resembling men and indeed this island and all that quarter of europe before it was well inhabited must on account of its vicinity to africa have swarmed with apes of these however there are at present no remains which is a proof that different species of animals migrate from one country to another and when their race wears out in a particular part of the globe it may be numerous somewhere else certain it is that in many countries the race of several animals well known there in ancient times is totally extinguished  there are hares enough in corsica but no rabbits though polybius when talking of the animals of this island says there are rabbits and is very minute as to their form and qualities saying that at a distance they might be taken for little hares but when caught a great difference is perceived both in their appearance and taste there are here no wolves nor any of the larger wild beasts unless foxes can be reckoned so which are here indeed extremely large and ravenous it is said they not only destroy sheep but have been known to devour even foals  there is also a variety of birds in corsica eagles vultures woodpigeon turtle thrush blackbird and many of the smaller species and plenty of game as partridges woodcocks snipes and water fowl in the lakes the poor thrushes and blackbirds too must be reckoned as part of the game for they are very numerous and from there being a great quantity of the arbutus fruit in the island they are exceedingly fat and are esteemed a particular delicacy it is barbarous to destroy for the mere luxury of the table birds which make such fine music surely their melody affords more enjoyment than what can be had from eating them they are however a very common dish in the southern countries particularly in france  in general it may be observed that this island is so privileged by nature that there is no poisonous animal in it for though there are some scorpions their bite carries no venom the creature in corsica which approaches nearest to a poisonous animal is a spider of an extraordinary size its bite will irritate and inflame to a great degree and the swelling which it occasions is very alarming to one unacquainted with it but it soon goes away and no bad consequences follow more than from the stinging of our bees this spider has by some been mistaken for the famous tarantula of the kingdom of naples  trees grow remarkably well in corsica there is here almost every sort of fruit trees but it is principally adorned with pines of different kinds oaks and chestnuts all of these are to be found of a great size some of the pines in particular are exceeding lofty and the chestnut tree grows to a prodigious bigness  there are extensive forests in different places that of vico is most remarkable there is in corsica timber sufficient to maintain a very large fleet and the timber here is much harder than would be expected in so southern a latitude owing to the rocky soil of the country to the perpetual currents of fresh air through its valleys and to the temperature that proceeds from some of its mountains being half the year in snow and this is also one great cause of the salubrity of the climate in which corsica has much the advantage of sardinia  the ilex or evergreen oak is very common here and gives the country a cheerful look even in the depth of winter the lemon the orange the fig and the almond trees are also frequent there are however few walnut trees and the apple pear plum and cherry are not remarkably good which is probably owing to no care being taken of them corsica has the pomegranate in great perfection also the india fig and the aloe which last is said to flower here as well as in the east  the corsican mountains are covered with the arbutus or strawberry tree which gives a rich glowing appearance as far as the eye can reach indeed the island is very like the country which virgil in his third book of georgics describes as the seat of rural felicity  the mulberry grows well here and is not so much in danger from blights and thunder storms as in italy and the south of france so that corsica is capable of producing abundance of silk we must not omit the laurel to which corsica has surely a very good claim the box tree is a very common plant here in most countries it is dwarfish and generally used only for hedges but it grows to a good size in corsica and may be reckoned a timber tree bochart has very ingeniously shown that the benches of the tyrian ships which according to the common translation of ezechiel are said to have been made of ivory brought out of the isles of chittim were most probably made of corsican wood  theophrastus in his history of plants expatiates on the wonderful size of corsican trees to which he says the pines of latium were nothing to be compared he also says the trees were immensely thick here his expression is very strong the whole island seemed crowded and savage with woods he relates a strange tradition that the romans who were struck with the vastness of these woods built here a prodigious large ship which carried no less than  0 sails but was lost in the ocean this author gives another testimony to the goodness of the climate soil and air of the island corsica therefore says he whether in respect of its temperate climate or in respect of its soil or of its air greatly excels other countries  the different kinds of grain in corsica are wheat barley rye and millet all of which grow extremely well in several parts of the country there are no oats here as indeed hardly ever in any of the southern countries they give their horses and mules barley the millet is excellent in corsica and when mixed with rye makes a wholesome bread of which the peasants are very fond chestnuts may be reckoned a sort of grain in corsica for they answer all the purposes of it the corsicans eat them when roasted by way of bread they even have them ground into flour and of that they make very good cakes  there is a vast quantity of honey produced in corsica for the island has from the earliest times been remarkable for its swarms of bees when it was subject to the romans a tribute was imposed upon it of no less than  00000 pounds of wax yearly indeed the laurel the almond tree and the myrtle in the flowers of which the bees find so much sweetness are very common here and the hills are all covered with wild thyme and other fragrant herbs yet its honey has always been accounted bitter by reason of the boxwood and yew as diodorus and pliny observe  many people think the bitterness which is in the corsican honey very agreeable the reason which pliny assigns for the bitterness of the honey he also assigns for the excellence of the wax having mentioned the punic the pontic and the cretan he says after these the corsican wax because it is made from the boxtree is said to have a certain medicinal virtue they keep their bees in long wooden cases or trunks of trees with a covering of the back of the cork tree when they want honey they burn a little juniper wood the smoke of which makes the bees retire they then take an iron instrument with a sharp edged crook at the end of it and bring out the greatest part of the honeycomb leaving only a little for the bees who work the case full again by taking the honey in this way they never kill a be  there are in corsica a great many mines of lead copper iron and silver near to san florenzo is a very rich silver mine yielding about the value of five pounds sterling for every hundred pounds weight of ore the corsican iron is remarkably good having a toughness nearly equal to that of the prepared iron of spain famous over all the world it is said that the true spanish barrels are made of iron which has been worn and beaten for a long time in heads of nails in the shoes of the mule who travel with a flow and incessant pace along the hard roads but a very small proportion of the great quantity of spanish barrels which are sold in all parts of europe can have this advantage the metal of the corsican barrels is little inferior to that of the generality of spanish ones and they begin to make them very well  an allusion has been drawn from the iron mines and the name of corsica to the character of its inhabitants hieronymus de marinis a genoese who writes on the dominion and government of the republic says of this island that the bowels of the earth abound in mines of iron nature conspiring by a sort of prejudice to form a similarity between the name and the nature of the people for the corsicans have hearts of iron and are therefore prone to arms and the sword there are also mines of alum and of saltpetre in several parts of corsica  there is here a kind of granate extremely hard some of it approaching in quality to the oriental granate which was so famous in rome and of which such noble columns are remaining said to have been brought from egypt there is here likewise porphyry and a great variety of jasper the magnificent chapel of the grand duke of tuscany at florence is finished with corsican jasper with which its inside as we have remarked is elegantly incrusted and has a most beautiful appearance  on the borders of the lake of ino they find pieces of rock crystal very clear and with five sides as if they had been cut with a lapidary they find some of it too in the mountains of istria it is so hard that it strikes fire and the corsicans frequently use it for flints to their fusils  near to bastia there is found a sort of mineral called by the country people petra quadrata because it is always found in little square bits it has much about the hardness of marble a color like iron ore and weight like lead the corsicans ascribe certain mystical virtues to this stone as appears from an old monkish distich made in its praise petrae quadratae duro de marmore natae innumeras doles quis numerare potest i e of the square stone of marble grown the virtues fell what man can tell   from the description of corsica now given it will appear to be a country of considerable importance according to templemans tables it contains    0 square miles  the number of inhabitants in corsica has not been exactly taken of late but they may be reckoned   0000 souls the number however is much less than it was in ancient times it is well observed by an able writer that the depopulation of many countries seem to have been first occasioned by the havoc which the romans made among the smaller states and cities before they could fully establish the sovereign power in no state could this cause of depopulation take place more than in corsica for in no state were the nations harder to be subdued when to the roman havoc we add the reiterated tumults which during a course of ages have shaken this island we need be at no loss to account why the number of its inhabitants is diminished  the principal cities of this island are bastia and corte of which we shall treat in the succeeding chapter as also of the general characters customs and manners of the inhabitants of corsica  chap ii of the cities etc bastia situated on the eastern coast of the island has for a long time been reckoned the capital of corsica it was here that the genoese held the seat of their sovereigns power and indeed bastia is still the largest town in the island it has a stately appearance from the sea being built on the declivity of a hill though upon entering the town a stranger is a good deal disappointed for the houses are in general ill built and the streets narrow and from the situation of the town necessarily very steep there are however several pretty good buildings here it has a castle which commands the town and harbor which though but a sorry fortification at present is capable of being made a place of considerable strength as it has a range of hills behind it on which little redoubts might be erected and with these and a few substantial outworks toward the sea it might stand a pretty long siege  the church of s john in this city by no means an inelegant building belongs to the jesuits who have here a college their garden is finely situated large and well laid out this they owe in a great measure to the french who have been stationed in corsica at different times from them the inhabitants have learned much of what they know of the arts and conveniences of life there is here a convent of lagarists or missionaries a vast and magnificent house almost overhanging the sea the convent of the franciscans and that of the capuchins are situated on the rising ground behind bastia the last stands in a beautiful exposure and has really a very pretty front the number of inhabitants in this town are estimated at  0000  from bastia south to beyond aleria is one continued plain between  0 and  0 miles in length proper for raising all sorts of grain as well as pasturage  in the center of the island stands corte which is properly its capital and will one day be a city of eminence here is the generals palace and here is the supreme seat of justice where the executive power constantly resides and where the legislature is annually assembled and here also is the university which in time may become a distinguished seat of learning  corte is situated part at the foot and part on the declivity of a rock in a plain surrounded with prodigious high mountains and at the conflux of two rivers the tavignano and restonica it has a great deal of rich country about it and a wonderful natural strength being hemmed in by almost impassable mountains and narrow defiles which may be defended by a handful of men against very large armies  upon a point of the rock prominent above the rest and on every side perpendicular stands the castle or citadel it is at the back of the town and is almost impregnable there being only one winding passage to climb up to it and that not capable of admitting more than two persons abreast in the plain on the north of corte is a convent of capuchi and n the side of the hill to the south of the city there is a convent of franciscans here the general lived while his palace was repairing and ere all  of respect are lodged from this convent is the best view of the city of corte   situated on the bay of the same name and on the western coast of the island says boswell is the prettiest town in corsica it has many very handsome streets and beautiful walks a citadel and a palace for the genoese governor the inhabitants of this town are the genteelest people in the island having had a good deal of intercourse with the french  such is the only information we have been able to procure respecting their cities we now proceed to treat of their character customs and manners  the genius and character of the inhabitants of corsica deserve to be particularly considered because some authors in ancient times and the genoese in modern times have represented them in the most unfavourable light it is indeed strange to find two such authors as strabo and diodorus differing so widely respecting the character of the people of this island and seemingly contradicting each other strabo says those who dwell on the mountains of cyrnus as it was called by the romans and live by robberies are wilder than even wild beasts therefore when the roman generals make irruptions into their country and falling upon their strong holds carry off numbers of these people and bring them to rome it is wonderful to see what wildness and brutality the creatures discover for they either are impatient of life and lay violent hands on themselves or if they do live it is in such a state of stupefaction and insensibility that those who purchase them for slaves have a very bad bargain though they pay very little money for them and solely regret their happening to fall into their hands diodorus on the other hand says the corsican slaves seem to differ from all others in their utility for the offices of life for which they are fitted by a peculiar gift of nature these islanders live among themselves with a humanity and justice beyond all other barbarians in every part of the economy of life they show a remarkable regard to equity  m burnaby who visited this island thinks these very different accounts may be reconciled by supposing the authors to speak of the corsicans under different points of view strabo as of enemies diodorus as of friends and then they will not only be found reconcilable but will exactly correspond with the character of the corsicans at present in war they are furious as lions death is esteemed nothing nor is any power sufficient to make them yield against their inclination they become irritated and will not brook restraint but in peace and civil life they are mild and just to the greatest degree and have all those amiable qualities which diodorus ascribes to them where their service is voluntary or they are attached to their masters by kind and gentle treatment they have the other perfections which he allows them  the following instances are related by paoli of the spirit and patriotism of the corsicans in their conflicts with the genoese for recovering their liberties a sergeant said he who fell in one of our desperate actions when just a dying wrote to me thus i salute you take care of my aged father in two hours i shall be with the rest who have bravely died for their country  a corsican gentleman who had been taken prisoner by the genoese was thrown into a dungeon where he was chained to the ground while he was in this dismal situation the genoese sent a message to him that if he would accept a commission in their service he might have it no said he were i to accept your offer it would be with a determined purpose to take the first opportunity of returning to the service of my country but i will not accept it for i would not have my countrymen suspect even for one moment that i could be unfaithful though the affection between relations is very strong in the corsicans they will give up those who are the nearest allied to them for the good of their country and would sacrifice such as deserted to the genoese  paoli says boswell gave me a noble instance of a corsicans feeling and greatness of mind a criminal said he was condemned to die his nephew came to me with a lady of distinction that she might solicit his pardon the nephews anxiety made him think that the lady did not speak with sufficient force and earnestness he therefore advanced and addressed himself to me sir is it proper for me to speak as if he felt that it was unlawful to make such an application i bid him go on sir said he with the deepest concern may i beg the life of my uncle if it is granted his relations will make a gift to the state of  000 zechins we we will furnish  0 soldiers in pay during the war we will agree that my uncle shall be banished and engage he shall never return to the island i knew the nephew to be a man of worth and i answered him you are acquainted with the circumstances of this case such is my confidence in you that if you will say that giving your uncle a pardon would be just useful or honorable for corsica i promise you it shall be granted he turned about burst into tears and left me saying i would not have the hnour of my country sold for  000 zechins and his uncle suffered  the following remarkable anecdote related by paoli in favor of the heroism of the irish deserves likewise to be recorded at the siege of tortona the commander of the army which lay before the town ordered carew an irish officer in the service of naples to advance with a detachment to a particular post having given his orders he whispered to carew sir i know you to be a gallant man i have therefore put you upon this duty i tell you in confidence it is certain death for you all i place you there to make the enemy spring a mine below you carew made a bow to the general and led his men in silence to the dreadful post he there stood with an undaunted countenance and having called to one of the soldiers for a draught of wine here said he i drink to all those who bravely fall in battle fortunately at that instant tortona capitulated and carew escaped but he had thus a full opportunity of displaying a rare instance of determined intrepidity it is with pleasure we record this anecdote so much to the honor of a gentleman of that nation on which illiberal reflections are too often thrown by those of whom it little deserves them whatever may be the rough jokes of wealthy insolence or the envious sarcasms of needy jealousy the irish have ever been and will continue to be most highly respected on the continent  the corsicans are naturally quick and lively and have a particular turn for eloquence hieronymus de marinis gives them this character their mountains abound in swarms of bees and flow with milk and honey like the genius of the corsicans who while they have milk and honey under their tongues have also a sting and are therefore born for the forum they have all a turn for the arts painting indeed has not yet flourished among them but they succeed well in music and poetry there are few of them who do not play upon the citra an old moorish instrument which they are pleased to think the ancient cythara it has a sweet and romantic sound and many of their airs are tender and beautiful  they have not yet produced any large and finished poem but they have many little pieces exceedingly pretty most of them on war or on love they have also many little ballads and madrigals full of drollery and keen satire against the genoese and they have their essays of grave humor and various allegories respecting themselves and their enemies they have in particular a curious paraphrase of the lords prayer where all the petitions are strangely turned into severe accusations against the genoese  the corsicans are in general of small statue and rather hard favored much like the scotch highlanders though as we find among these so we also find among the corsicans many of a good size and comely countenance  the manners of the corsicans have a great similarity with those of the ancient germans as described by tacitus they have not however the same habit of drinking for they are extremely temperate their morals are strict and chaste to an uncommon degree owing in part to good principles unhurt by luxury and partly to the exercise of private revenge against such as violate the honor of their women  what tacitus says of ancient germany we may say of corsica nobody there laughs at vice nor is corrupting and being corrupted called the way of the world  the corsicans like the germans of old are extremely indolent the women do the greatest part of the drudgery work as is also the custom among the scots highlanders yet they are very active in war like the same germans of whom tacitus says by a wonderful variety of nature the same men are fond of indolence and impatient of rest notwithstanding all that paoli their favorite general has done the corsicans are still indolent and averse to labor every year  00 or  000 sardinians and luccese are employed as artificers and day laborers in the island  the corsicans love much to be round a fire this practice seems peculiar to rude nations the indians in north america do it and the ancient germans did it the scythians too had this custom  there have been many strange customs in corsica  tll us that after the women were brought to  the man immediately took care of the children laying themselves down as if they were sick and ndling the infants so that the mothers had no frher trouble than to give them suck so great  to a woman after she has suffered so much for the  of society had really something humane in it though we must smile at such simplicity we may say that it has never been paralleled  all the complaisance of modern gallantry but this equitable custom is no longer in use  petrus cyrnecus says that in his time marriage was so much honored among the corsicans that if any young woman was so poor that nobody asked her the neighbors raised a contribution to help her to a husband generosity could never be more properly exercised epaminondas used to exercise his generosity in that way  there are some very extraordinary customs which still subsist in corsica in particular they have several strange ceremonies at the death of their relations when a man dies especially if he has been assassinated his widow with all the married women in the village accompany the corpse to the grave where after various howlings and other expressions of sorrow the women fall upon the widow and beat and tear her in a most miserable manner having thus satisfied their grief and passion they lead her back again covered with blood and bruises to her own habitation  the corsican peasants and soldiers are very fond of baiting cattle with the large mountain dogs this keeps up a ferocity among them which totally extinguishes fear i have seen a corsican says boswell in the very heat of a baiting run in drive off the dogs seize the half frantic animal by the horns and lead it away the common people did not seem much given to diversions i observed some of them in the great hall of the house of colonna where i was lodged amusing themselves with playing at a sort of draughts in a very curious manner they drew upon the floor with chalk a sufficient number of squares chalking one all over and leaving one open alternately and instead of black men and white they had bits of stone and bits of wood it was an admirable burlesque on gaming  the chief satisfaction of these islanders when not engaged in war or hunting seemed to be that of lying at their ease in the open air recounting tales of the bravery of their countrymen and singing songs in honor of the corsicans and against the genoese even in the night they would continue this pastime in the open air unless rain forced them to retire into their houses  it is remarkable that no corsican would upon any account consent to be a hangman not the greatest criminals who might have had their lives upon this condition even a wretch who for a paltry hire had strangled a woman would rather submit to death than do the same action as the executioner of the law  the hangman of corsica says boswell was a great curiosity i went up and looked at him during my residence at corte and a more dirty rueful spectacle i never beheld being held in the utmost detestation he durst not live like another inhabitant of the island he was obliged to take refuge in the castle and there he was kept in a little corner turret where he had just room for a miserable bed and a little bit of fire to dress such victuals for himself as was sufficient to keep him alive for nobody would have any intercourse with him but all turned their backs upon him he seemed sensible of his situation and held down his head like an abhorred outcast  it was a long time before they could get a hangman in corsica so that the punishment of the gallows was hardly known all their criminals being shot at last this creature whom i saw who was a sicilian came with a message to paoli the general who has a wonderful talent for physiognomy on seeing the man said immediately to some of his people about him ecco il boia behold our hangman he gave orders to ask the man if he would accept the office and his answer was my grandfather was a hangman my father was a hangman i have been a hangman myself and am willing to continue so he was therefore immediately put into office and the ignominious death dispensed by his hands has had more effect than  0 executions by fire arms  the following entertaining anecdote related by boswell in his tour through the island to visit the famous general paoli will tend further to show the great simplicity of ancient manners in this people  when i had seen every thing about corte says this writer i prepared for my journey to the mountains that i might be with paoli the night before i set our i recollected that i had forgotten to get a passport which i found to be a necessary precaution after supper therefore the prior with whom i had taken up my quarters walked with me to corte to the house of the great chancellor who ordered the passport to be made out immediately and while his secretary was writing it entertained me by reading some of the minutes of the general consulta when the passport was finished and ready to have the seal put to it i was much pleased with a beautiful simple incident the chancellor desired a little boy who was playing in the room by us to run to his mother and bring the great seal of the kingdom i thought myself sitting in the house of a cincinnatus  next morning i set out in very good order having excellent  and clever corsican guides the worthy  of the convent who treated me in the kindest manner whilst i was their guest would also give me some provisions for my journey so they put up a gourd of their best wine and some delicious pomegranates my corsican guides appeared so hearty that i often got down and walked along with them doing just as i saw them do when we grew hungry we threw stones among the thick branches of the chestnut trees which overshadowed us and in that manner we brought down a shower of chestnuts with which we filled our pockets and went on eating them with great relish and when this made us thirsty we lay down by the side of the first brook put our mouths to the stream and drank sufficiently it was just like being for a little while one of the prisca gens mortalium the primitive race of men who run about in the woods eating acorns and drinking water  while i stopped to refresh my mules at a little village the inhabitants came crowding about me as an ambassador going to their general when they were informed of my country a strong black fellow said english they are barbarians they dont believe in the great god i replied excuse me sir we do believe in god and in jesus christ too um said he and in the pope no and why this was a puzzling question in these circumstances for there was a great audience to the controversy i thought i would try a method of my own and very gravely replied because we are too far off a very new argument against the universal infallibility of the pope it took however for my opponent mused awhile and then said too far off why sicily is as far off as england yet in sicily they believe in the pope o said i we are ten times farther off than sicily ah said he and seemed quite satisfied in this manner i got off very well i question much whether any of the learned reasons of our protestant divines would have had so good an effect  chap iii trade commerce and manufactures we have seen how rich corsica is in natural productions so that there is no question but this island might carry on a pretty extensive commerce in oil wine honey beeswax salt chestnuts silk rosin boxwood oak pine porphyry marble of various kinds lead iron copper silver and coral at present commerce is but beginning to flourish among them they find in their seas considerable quantities of coral of all the three kinds red white and black the jews of leghorn who have established there a coral manufactory have a sort of exclusive privilege from the corsicans for this trade and in return are very serviceable to the nation by advancing them money and supplying them with cannon  the corsicans may make plenty of admirable wines for their grapes are excellent in some villages they make a rich sweet wine much resembling tokay in others they make wine very much like burgundy and over the whole island there are wines of different sorts it is indeed wonderful what a difference a little variation of soil or exposure will make in the taste of wine the juice of corsican grapes is so generous that although unskilfully manufactured it will always please by its natural flavor the corsicans have been so harrassed for a number of years that they have had no leisure to improve themselves in any art or manufacture it is asserted however that the exportation of oil has amounted in one year to two millions and a half of livres and that of chestnuts to   000 pounds sterling  agriculture is as yet in a very imperfect state in corsica their instruments of husbandry are ill made and they do not make the best use of what they have their ploughing is but scratching the surface of the earth and they hardly know any thing of the advantages of manure though they can be at no loss for sufficient quantities of it  the supreme council appoints two or more persons in each province to superintend the cultivation of lands and to take the most effectual methods for promoting it and in particular to encourage the planting of mulberry trees it being certain that corsica may be made to produce a great deal of silk as gardening has been almost totally neglected there is a late ordinance by which every man who possesses a garden or other enclosure is obliged to sow every year pease beans and all sorts of garden stuff and not less than a pound of each under the penalty of four livres to be exacted by the podestas  the supreme council also appoints two consuls to inspect the kind and the price of the various sorts of the merchandise in the island and to watch over every thing that can tend toward the advancement of commerce  provisions are not dear in corsica their prices on a medium are as follows a laboring ox about  0 livres a cow from  0 to  0 livres a horse of the best quality from  00 to   0 livres a sheep about four livres a partridge   sous beef two sous a pound mutton two thirds of a sou a pound fish from one to two sous a pound wine four sous a flask of   lb weight  oil is sold in barrels valued from  0 to  0 livres a barrel contains  0 pints a pint contains four quarts wine is sold in barrels of    zuchas the zucha contains nine large florence casks grain is sold by the bushel the bushel contains    bacine the bacino weighs about  0 pounds the sack or bushel sells at    livres  the wages of a tradesman or of a day labourer are a livre a day and victuals and drink if a tradesman is particularly ingenious in his profession he has something more reapers have no wages in money but besides their victuals each gets a bacino of the grain which he cuts down  the manufactures of corsica are as yet very rude their wool is exceedingly coarse and generally black of this they make a thick heavy cloth the pure black is the most valuable when a little white is mixed with it the cloth is not so much esteemed being of a russet gray or brown dusky color they import all their fine cloth for besides that there is not a sufficient quantity of wool for the service of the island the corsicans have not learned to make any thing else of it but the coarse cloth abovementioned  a good deal of flax grows in corsica and no doubt a good deal of it might be raised but in reality the corsicans areas yet so backward that they hardly make any linen at all which occasions a very heavy importation  the corsicans have plenty of oil for their lamps which is the light they generally use they also make wax candles and a few tallow ones their cattle not yielding much fat  there is plenty of leather in the island many of the peasants just harden the hides in the air particularly the wild boar skins and have their shoes made of them without being tanned this they are under no temptation of doing but that of poverty and laziness for the art of tanning is very well understood in corsica and the materials for it are in such abundance that a great deal of bark is carried over into italy the corsicans have a method of tanning with the leaves of wild laurel dried in the sun and beaten into a powder this gives a sort of a greenish color to the leather  chap iv ancient history and government together with anecdotes relative to the history of the island of the famous king theodore and of paoli the earliest accounts we have of corsica are to be found in herodotus he tells us that its first inhabitants were phenicians and that eight generations after theras brought a colony to the island from lacedemon his account of the first peopling of corsica is a very curious piece of ancient history it afterward got the name of cyrnus from the number of its promontories and isiodorus relates the manner in which it got the name of corsica according to him corsa a ligurian woman having often observed a bull swim over to the island and return much fatter she had the curiosity to follow him in a little vessel and so discovered the island with all its beauty and fertility upon which the ligurians sent thither a colony and from corsa who had made the discovery they called the island corsica this is ludicrous enough but we may trace what has given rise to so extraordinary a fiction when we consider that very probably a people from the opposite coast of italy took possession of corsica  its next masters were the carthiginians aristotle relates a most extraordinary piece of punic policy with respect to corsica finding it was difficult to keep the inhabitants in subjection they ordered the whole of the vines and olives in the island to be pulled up and forbad the corsicans under pain of death to sow their fields with any kind of grain that they might be kept in the most absolute dependence so early was the cowardly and barbarous policy of a trading republic exercised against this people  corsica next passed under the dominion of rome it appears however that the corsicans could not bear subjection with patience for they were continually attempting to get free under the romans it was made to serve for a place of exile on the irruption of the barbarous nations corsica shared the same sat with the other dominions of the ruined empire it fell a prey to the goths who established there the feudal system as they did in every other country to which their arms penetrated  from this period the history of corsica is for many ages a continued series of wars ravage and destruction by a variety of contending powers about the beginning of the   th century the corsicans were for the first time brought under the power of the genoese with whom they have since had such struggles for that freedom which they appear to have at all times attempted to recover  the genoese were the worst nation to whom corsica could have fallen the corsicans were a people impetuous violent and brave who had weathered many a storm and who could not have been governed but by a state of which they stood somewhat in awe and which by humanity and proper encouragement might have conciliated their affection whereas the genoese were a nation of republicans and it has been always remarked that the foreign subjects of a little republic are much worse used than those of a great kingdom accordingly the genoese did not treat the corsicans with that gentleness and confidence which alone could have secured their attachment and obedience  they even took a direct contrary course and although they did not use such desperate means as the carthiginians their oppression was heavy their system was not to render the corsicans happier and better but by keeping them in ignorance and oppressed to prevent their endeavoring to get free  in this unhappy situation was corsica often did the natives rise in arms but having no leader to direct them they was immediately quelled so apprehensive were the genoese that they burnt   0 of the best villages in corsica while  000 people left the island what showed the genoese policy in the worst light was that many of these islanders who had gone over to the continent made a distinguished figure in most of the european states both in learning and in arms  about the year    0 corsica revived under the conduct of a great hero who arose for the deliverance of his country this was sampiero di bastelica he was however stopped in his career by the treachery of the genoese who had him basely assassinated in the year       long despised plundered and oppressed the corsicans again revived in      when the war commenced which with some intervals continued till they had finally rescued themselves from the slavery of their inveterate masters the genoese  it is wonderful to see how great wants are produced by little causes the rise of the corsicans in      was occasioned by a single paolo a piece worth about fivepence english a genoese collector went to the house of a poor old woman and demanded this trifling sum as the money for which she was assessed being in extreme penury she had not wherewithal to satisfy the demand upon which the collector began to abuse her and to seize some of her furniture she begged him to have patience and said she hoped in a few days to be be able to pay him he persisted in his severity and the poor woman made a great lamentation two or three people hearing the noise entered the house took the part of the woman and exclaimed against the barbarity of the collector he threatened them with punishment for having hindered him in the execution of his office this provoked the villagers and they drove him away with stones the genoese sent troops to support their collector and the corsicans assembled in large bodies to defend themselves the tumult increased a spark was sufficient to kindle the flame in a people who so often glowed with the enthusiasm of liberty and in a very short time the whole island was in motion  the corsicans immediately rushed upon the capital which they took almost without resistance and they would have been matters of the castle had they been a little better regulated  the genoese at first endeavored to overawe the corsicans by the sole force of the republic but finding themselves unable they applied to the emperor charles vi who sent a strong army of germans there with the prince of wertemberg at their head the corsicans were not in a condition to resist such a force they laid down their arms upon condition that a treaty should be made between them and the genoese having the emperor for guarantee  this treaty having been broken by the latter there was a very short suspension of hostilities and in      the corsicans rose anew  the genoese had paid very dear for their victory in their struggles it was computed that it had cost them above  0000000 of livres besides costly presents to the prince of wirtemberg and to the other general officers  corsicans   the marquis dargens very pleasantly applies to the genoese the french fable of a gardener who complained to a gentleman in the neighborhood that a hare came every day into his garden and eat his cabbages and begged the gentleman would be so good to drive her out for him the gentleman comes with a pack of hounds and half a dozen huntsmen and does more mischief in five minutes than the hare could have done in seven years after a prodigious chase the hare made her escape through a hole in the wall upon which the gentleman congratulated the gardener on getting rid of his enemy and advised him to stop up the hole so the genoese after having expended a great deal more upon foreign auxiliaries than they could ever derive from corsica had the mortification on the departure of these auxiliaries to find themselves just as they were  whilst the genoese and the corsicans were keenly engaged again and the politicians of europe forming various conjectures a most extraordinary circumstance occurred to the amazement of every one this was the appearance of the famous king theodore whose singular history made so much noise as many inconsistent reports were circulated with regard to this man who now lies in this country the following authentic accounts concerning him will perhaps not be unacceptable to our readers  theodore baron newhoff in the county of la marc in westphalia was the personage who aspired to the sovereignty of corsica he had his education in the french service he afterward went to spain but being of a strange unsettled projecting disposition he quitted spain and went and traveled into italy england and holland always in search of some new adventure he at last fixed his attention on corsica and formed a scheme of making himself king  he was a man of abilities and address and after having fully informed himself of every thing relating to the island he went to tunis where he fell upon means to procure some money and arms and then came to leghorn from whence he wrote a letter to the corsican chiefs offering considerable advantage to the nation if they would elect him as their sovereign this letter was consigned to the corsican plenipotentiary in tuscany and he gave for answer that if theodore brought the assistance he promised to the corsicans they would very willingly make him king  upon this without loss of time he set sail and landed in corsica in spring      he was a man of very stately appearance and the turkish dress he wore added to the dignity of his mien he had a few attendants with him his manners were so engaging and his offers so plausible that he was proclaimed king of corsica before the ambassadors dispatches arrived to inform the chiefs of the terms upon which he had agreed he brought with him about  000 zechins besides some arms and ammunition and made magnificent promises of foreign assistance  theodore assumed every mark of royal dignity he had his guards and his officers of state he conferred titles of honor and he struck money both of silver and copper the silver pieces were few in number and can hardly now be met with it was such a curiosity over all europe to have king theodores coins that the silver pieces were sold at four zechins each and when the genuine ones were exhausted imitations of them were made at naples and like the imitations of antiques were bought up at a high price and carefully preservedin the cabinets of the virtuosi  theodore immediately blocked up the genoese fortified towns and he used to be sometimes at one siege and sometimes at another standing with a telescope in his hand as if he spied the assistance which he said he expected he used also the artifice of making large packets be continually brought to him from the continent which he gave out to be from the different sovereigns of europe acknowledging his authority and promising to befriend him  the genoese were not a little confounded with this unexpected adventure they published a violent manifesto against theodore treating him with great contempt but at the same time showing they were alarmed at his appearance theodore replied in a manifesto with all the calmness and dignity of a monarch expressed his indifference as to the injurious treatment of the republic and appeared firm in the hopes of victory  after having been about eight months in corsica theodore perceived that the people began to cool in their affections toward him and did not act with the same resolution as before he therefore wisely determined to leave them for a little and try his fortune again upon the continent he accordingly after laying down a plan of administration to be observed in his absence went to holland and there he was successful enough to get credit to a great extent from several rich merchants particularly jews who trusted him with cannon and other warlike stores to a great value under the charge of a supercargo with these he returned to corsica in      and on his arrival put to death his supercargo that he might not have any trouble from demands being made upon him  by this time the french had become so powerful in the island that although theodore threw in his supply of warlike stores he did not incline to venture his person the genoese having set a high price upon his head he therefore chose to relinquish his throne and give up his views of ambition for safety having furnished a remarkable example how far a daring and desperate spirit may go had he had a little more prudence and better fortune theodore and his posterity might have worn the crown of corsica upon the generous title of having delivered the island from oppression  it has been often said that he was secretly supported by some of the european powers but it does not appear there was any foundation for the conjecture it is indeed something singular to find a private gentleman embarking in his own bottom in an enterprise of such a nature but the truth is theodore was a most singular man and had been so beaten about by change of fortune that he had lost the common sentiments of mankind and viewed things as one who is mad or drunk or in a high fever he had nothing to lose and a great deal to win his scheme was to amuse the corsicans with the hopes of foreign aid and by the force of hope to carry them forward this might have succeeded in which case he could very easily have said that the foreign aid would have come had there been occasion for it but they had behaved with such spirit as to require no help and had he been fortunate it is probable some of the european powers might have in reality stood by him  the corsicans who had most faith in his fine speeches still extol him to the skies others who looked upon him as an imposter and never joined heartily in his measures represent him as a kind of wat tyler king of a rabble but the most knowing and judicious consider him in the moderate light in which he has been now represented and own he was of great service in reviving the spirit of the nation which after a good many years of constant war was beginning to droop  they indeed are sensible that his wretched fate has thrown a sort of ridicule on the nation since their king was confined in a goal at london which was actually the case with poor theodore who who after experiencing the most extraordinary vicissitudes of fortune chose to end his days in our island of liberty but was reduced to the wretched state of a prisoner for debt  horace walpole the present earl of orford generously exerted himself for theodore he wrote a paper in the world with great elegance and humor soliciting a contribution for the monarch in distress to be paid to mr robert dodsley bookseller as lord high treasurer this brought him a very handsome sum he was allowed to get out of prison the earl of orford has the original deed by which theodore made over the kingdom of corsica in security to his creditors he has also the great seal of the kingdom he died very soon after he got out of prison and was buried in st annes churchyard westminster where a simple unadorned monument is erected to him with the following inscription near this place is interred theodore king of corsica who died in this parish december         immediately after leaving the kings bench prison by the benefit of the act of insolvency in consequence of which he registered his kingdom of corsica for the use of his creditors  death to one common level all things brings heroes and beggars galleyslaves and kings but theodore this lesson learnt ere dead fate poured its lessons over his living head bestowed a kingdom but denied him bread we have seen that theodore durst not land the succors he left were not of much avail such unprecedented and terrible slaughter as now took place with the dread of still greater vengeance from so formidable a nation as france obliged the corsicans to lay down their arms in this manner was corsica totally vanquished by france of which the genoese were as proud as if it had been their own achievement  france being engaged with more important objects than corsica thought proper to recall her troops from that island the french knew the corsicans too well to believe that they would submit to genoa when left to themselves the event happened accordingly for the french were hardly gone before the corsicans were again as much in motion as ever from having been long depressed like a bow recovering its elasticity they rose with renewed vigor man woman and child may be said to have engaged for very young boys took the field and even some of the women like those of sparta showed their valor in battle  gaffori and matra now obtained the government of the island under the title of protectors of the kingdoms gaffori was a man of distinguished talents his eloquence was most remarkable he heard once that a band of assassins was coming against him he went out and met them with a serene dignity which astonished them he begged they would only hear him a little and he gave them so pathetic a picture of the distresses of corsica and roused their spirits to such a degree against those who caused the oppression that the assassins threw themselves at his feet entreated his forgiveness and instantly joined his banners  soon after this the celebrated paschal paoli was elected general of the kingdom he was the son of one of their old chiefs he had been educated with great care by his father who formed his taste for letters and inspired him with every worthy and noble sentiment he was born in corsica but taken by his father to naples during the troubles where he got a commission in that service and was much about court  here he lived    or    years cultivating the great powers with which nature had endowed him and laying the foundation of those grand designs which he had early formed for the deliverance of his country his reputation became so great among the corsicans that he received the strongest invitations to come over and take the command he embarked in the glorious enterprise stimulated by generous ambition and undismayed by a consideration of the dangers cares and uncertainty he was about to encounter  paoli no sooner appeared on the island than he attracted the attention of every body his carriage and deportment prejudiced them in his favor and his superior judgment and patriotism displayed with all the force of eloquence charmed their understandings  all ranks now exerted themselves in providing what was necessary for carrying on the war with spirit whereby in a short time the genoese were driven to the remotest corners of the island paoli had well nigh finished his great scheme of freeing every part of the island from the genoese when a treaty was concluded between france and the republic by which the former engaged to send six battallions of troops to garrison the fortified towns in corsica for the space of four years  when this treaty was first known in europe every noble heart was afflicted for every one believed that france was determined to carry fire and sword into corsica and blast the hopes of the brave islanders but it turned out to be a prudent and politic scheme on the part of france she owed the genoese some millions of livres her finances were not such as made it very convenient for her to pay the french ministers who were never at a loss to conclude an advantageous treaty for their monarch told the genoese we cannot yet let you have your money but we will send you six battallions of auxiliaries to corsica and let that be a sinking fund for the discharge of our debt the genoese who recalled with barbarous satisfaction what france had formerly done against the corsicans were extremely pleased with the scheme  the french however took care to engage to act only on the defensive and to fix the treaty for four years that they might be sure of having time to sink their debt the french general was an officer of temper and experience and no doubt had his instructions to conduct himself mildly toward the corsicans all his duty was to take care that things should not become worse for genoa but that she should still retain the garrison towns on the coast  the corsicans conducted themselves on this occasion with the greatest propriety a general council was held and determinations published from which it appears that they showed no distrust of the french who they trusted would not begin hostilities against them the warlike operations of corsica were now suspended and in a short time after all right and title to the sovereignty of the island was ceded by the genoese to the french under whose protection the corsicans were but in the troubles of france it was taken by the english and the corsican people made a formal surrender of the island to the king of england  the government of corsica exhibits a complete and well ordered democracy from the lowest magistrate up to the supreme council  every village elects by majority of votes a podesta and other two magistrates who have the respectable name of fathers of the community these magistrates are chosen annually they may be continued in office for several years at the will of the community but there must be a new election every year the podesta by himself may determine causes to the value of ten livres and united with the padri del commune or fathers of the country may finally determine causes to the value of  0 livres the podesta is the representative of the government and to him are addressed all the orders of the supreme council the padri del commune superintend the economy and police of the village call the people together and consult with them on every thing that concerns their interest sometimes the people choose two podestas and one padri del commune and sometimes more and sometimes fewer counselors these irregularities are permitted to humor the caprice of different villages in an infant state and are of no consequence for the same degree of power remains to each office whether it be held by a lesser or a greater number as in the states of holland those who send two or three representatives have but an equal voice with those who send only one  once a year the inhabitants of each village assemble themselves and choose a procurator to represent them in the general consulta or parliament of the nation which is held annually in the month of may at the city of corte this procurator is elected by a majority of voices each of them have from their community a livre a day to bear his charges from the time of his sitting out till his return home  sometimes the procurators of all the villages contained in the same pieve choose from among themselves one who goes as representative from the pieve which saves some expense to the villages but this is abuse and when matters of any consequence are deliberating it renders the number of those who are to consult too small a little expense should be despised in comparison of having a voice in making the laws and settling the most serious concerns of the country and the greater the number of voices the more does the assembly approach to the idea of a roman comitia  the general consulta is indeed a numerous assembly for besides the ordinary procurators it is usual to call in those who have been formerly members of the supreme council and several of those who have lost their fathers or near relations in the service of their country that the blood of heroes may be distinguished by public honors  when all the procurators are assembled at corte they proceed to the election of the president and orator of the general consulta the president governs during the sitting of the assembly the orator reads the different papers subjected to deliberation those from the people are addressed to the orator if a proposition from the government or supreme council of state answering to our privy council is approved by a majority of voices it is immediately passed into a law but a proposition from the people though approved of may be suspended by the government without assigning their reasons which however they are strictly obliged to do the next general consulta  each province of which as we have already said there are nine appoints its representative in the supreme council for the ensuing year and one of these is elected into the office of great chancellor the supreme council of the time being with the general of the kingdom form the executive government of the whole nation the general consulta devolving upon them that high commission  the general holds his office for life he is perpetual president of the supreme council of nine he votes in all questions and in case of an equality he has a casting vote he is absolute commander of the troops or militia of the island his office much resembles that of stadtholder in holland  in the general consulta are also chosen some persons of high credit and respect as syndicatori these make a tour through the different provinces as our judges in england go the circuits they hear complaints against the different magistrates and if any of them have transgressed their duty they are properly censured these syndicators are extremely beneficial the general himself is almost always one of them they save poor people the trouble and expense of going to corte to lay their grievances before the supreme council they examine into every thing concerning the provinces reconcile the people to the wholesome severity of law encourage industry and diffuse a spirit of order and civilization through the island  chap v military learning language and religion the warlike force of corsica principally consists in a bold and resolute militia every corsican has a musket put into his hand as soon as he is able to carry it and as there is a constant emulation in shooting they become excellent marksmen and will hit with a single bullet a very small mark at a very great distance  there is in every village a capitano darme and in every pieve a commissario darme who has the command over all the capitani darme in his district these officers are chosen by the general with the approbation of the people they are ever ready to receive his orders and to call out such a number of men as he shall at any time require for the public service  there are in corsica but  00 soldiers who have pay  00 for a guard to the general and  00 to furnish guards for the magistrates of the several provinces and to garrison a few small sorts at particular places in the island  the state of learning in corsica may well be imagined at a low ebb since it was the determined purpose of genoa to keep the inhabitants of this island in the grossest ignorance and the confusions and distresses of war have left them no leisure to attend to any kind of study that laws are silent amidst the din of arms is an old observation and it may be justly applied to the muses whom war frightens away from every country a university was established at corte in the year      and a manifesto published recalling to the people of corsica the barbarous policy of genoa in keeping them in ignorance and informing them of the establishment which the parental care of the government had formed for their instruction  the professors in the university of corte are mostly fathers of different religious orders they are indefatigable in their labors and the youth of corsica discover the same keenness of spirit in their studies which characterises them in arms there are at corte some pretty good halls where the professors give their lectures but it cannot be expected that they should as yet have any thing like the regular building of a college the students are boarded in the town  under the head of learning it must be observed that there is a printing house at corte and a booksellers shop here are printed however nothing more than the public manifestoes calendars of feast days and little practical devotional pieces as also the corsican gazette which is published by authority from time to time just as news are collected for it contains nothing but the news of the island it admits no foreign intelligence nor private anecdotes so that there will sometimes be an interval of three months during which no newspapers are published  there are in corsica several treatises of political controversy said in the title to be printed at corte but they are in reality printed at lucca or leghorn in some of these treatises which are pretty numerous the authors with much ease and thought labor to prove to a demonstration that the corsicans must be free their writings are a good deal in the style of the profound tracts for and against the hereditary and indefeasible right of kings with which all the libraries in this country were filled in the last age authorities are heaped upon authorities to establish the plainnest propositions and as the poet says they quote the stagyrite to prove that smoke ascends and snow is white  the language of the corsicans is remarkable good italian tinctured a little with some remains of the dialects of the barbarous nations and with a few genoese corruptions but much purer than in many of the italian states their pronunciation however is somewhat coarse  the religion of corsica is the roman catholic faith in which these islanders are very zealous perhaps they have a degree of superstition which is the best extreme no nation can prosper without piety for when that fails public spirit and every noble sentiment will decay the doctrine of looking up to an allruling providence and that of a future state of rewards and punishments rendered the roman people virtuous and great in proportion as these doctrines were weakened by the false philosophy of epicurus the minds of the romans were impoverished and their manly patriotism was succeeded by effeminate selfishness which quickly brought them to contempt and ruin  although firmly attached to their religion as the revelation sent from god the corsicans preserve in ecclesiastical matters the same spirit of boldness and freedom for which they are distinguished in civil affairs they are sworn enemies to the temporal power of the church  the corsican bishops who are five in number and suffragans of the archbishop of pisa were warmly attached to genoa during their last commotions with that state for on genoa they depended for promotion they thought fit to preach up the most slavish doctrines of submission and stigmatized the patriots as rebels government desired that they might reside in the territories of the nation and promised them a guard to protect them from any insult but the bishops knew well that in the territories of the nation they could not preach the doctrines of tyranny and therefore refused to reside there upon which the government sequestered their revenues and prohibited the patriots from having any intercourse with the bishops with which they most readily complied  the clergy of corsica in general are not as yet very learned as the barbarous policy of genoa to keep the island in ignorance and the many years of confusion and war have prevented the cultivation of letters there are however here and there some priests who have had an education upon the continent and are very well instructed and they are all very pious and of irreproachable morals  there are in corsica    convents of mendicant friars viz    of observants    of reformed of the order of s francis and    of capuchins every one of these convents has only a wood for retired walks a garden and a small vineyard they depend altogether on the charity of the people there are two colleges of jesuits two convents of dominicans five of servites and one of missionaries all of whom have very good possessions there are also some lands belonging to other religious orders particularly to the carthusians of pisa the severe sanctity of whom must secure them the veneration of every body and preserve their rights inviolated even in times of the greatest distraction  it would be expected that in this island the monasteries for women should bear some proportion to the convents for men yet in fact there is not a single nunnery in all corsica to account for this it must be considered that the monastic institution has been frequently perverted to secular purposes so that the nobility in catholic countries who are desirous to aggrandize their families make their daughters take the veil that their portions may be saved to the eldest son the genoese who wanted to keep the corsicans in continual subjection devised every method to prevent any of the nobles in the island from becoming considerable they therefore prohibited manufactories in order to cut them off from one method of growing richer friars they rather encouraged in order to lessen population and to leave upon families a number of unmarried women than which nothing can be a greater burden as is sadly experienced in protestant countries  convents should be laid under such restrictions that what is intended as a solemn religious institution may not become so common as to lose its effect and be reckoned a profession for the dull or the indolent  end of corsica map of spain and portugal map of spain and portugal  a description of spain from swinburne townshend twiss and others chap i general history situation climate and productions mountains rivers etc spain is bounded on the north by the pyrenees which separate it from france on the east by the mediterranean on the south by the streights of gibraltar and on the west by portugal and the atlantic ocean it is upwards of   0 leagues in length from the southwest to the northeast and   0 leagues in breadth  spain from its position climate and fertility has been the victim of hostile nations the phenicians are the first of which we find traces in history this people to whom commerce taught philosophy landed upon the coasts of spain and their first settlement was it is said at cadiz the carthaginians not less desirous of profit and plunder thought proper to dispute with them a soil less scorched and more fertile than that of africa they also founded colonies but not without having first shed much blood the ancient inhabitants having but few other wants than those of nature and not discovering their future tyrants in the new colonists amused themselves with hunting fishing and peacefully drinking the milk of their flocks possessing but little knowledge of commerce and navigation they left the care and profits of these and with them all disputes to the phenicians and carthaginians  but the wars between these people were not of long duration because commerce loves tranquillity and endeavors to repel violence without aiming at military fame all their quarrels would have been terminated by a solid pence had rome seen without envy the aggrandizement and success of her rival the romans took the first opportunity of driving the carthaginians from spain this kingdom became the theater of two of the most famous wars of antiquity by the first which lasted    years rome obliged carthage to cede to her a part of her conquests and by the second which continued but for    years carthage was entirely stripped of her possessions and her power  the phenicians greeks and carthaginians had only gone as it may be said to spain the romans established themselves there and became absolate masters of the kingdom under them spain was divided into baetica lusitania and tarraconensis the first comprehended grenada upper and lower andalusia and a part of new castile lusitania extended from the river guadiana to the douro and tarraconensis as extensive as the other two divisions comprehended the east of the kingdom the ancients have left very animated accounts of this monarchy strabo is the author who describes it with the greatest truth he says it is a mountainous and difficult country and that the mountains by which it is divided are for the most part barren he does justice however to the fertility of andalusia all his third book is peculiarly interesting for such persons as desire to have a perfect knowledge of that part of europe  the romans possessed this rich and extensive peninsula about  00 years toward the fifth century a swarm of barbarians fell upon the fine provinces of the roman empire the goths in part invaded and conquered spain they reigned there   0 years roderic was the last of their kings the famous battle of xerxes in     put the moors in possession of the greatest and finest part of spain the history of roderic is enveloped in an infinity of fables he is said to have entered a grotto at toledo where he found a sheet upon which was painted a man of gigantic stature in an african habit and holding an inscription signifying that spain should one day be subjugated by such a race of men another fable repeated by several historians is that roderic having ill treated cara a young and beautiful lady of his court and likewise treated her father count julian with great indignity who demanded satisfaction for her injured honor the latter invited the moors into spain to be revenged on his sovereign  these becoming quiet possessors of their rapid and brilliant conquests the dawn of the resplendent reigns of the sovereigns of cordova seville and granada began to appear the court of abdalrahman was the center of arts sciences pleasures and gallantry tournaments the image of war in which love and address were substituted for valor and courage continued for several centuries the amusements of a rich and fortunate people the women were constantly present at games the only end of which was to please them and excited a tender emulation the voluptuous arabs aimed at splendid achievements to render themselves more worthy of their mistresses to them are we indebted for plaintive romance in which seductive love assumes the air of melancholy the better to interest our affections poetry and music were favorite arts with the moors the number of academies and universities increased in cordova and granada even women gave public lectures on poetry and philosophy and literary resources abounded in proportion to the progress of science at that time there were  0 academies public in spain toledo seville granada and cordova which now present nothing but ruins and depopulation certainly contained from three to  00000 inhabitants granada is the only place in which vestiges of the splendid reign of the moors are to be found nothing however can be more confused than the dynasties of the moors or arabs who reigned in spain that of the christian monarchs who disputed with them the kingdom and taking advantage of their divisions drove them out is not less so long accustomed to conquer the moors thus divided they had within little more than a century taken from them toledo cordova seville and murcia granada still flourished and was become their only strong hold when castille and arragon united in the persons of ferdinand and isabella formed too great a power to be resisted by a kingdom enfeebled by intestine commotions granada was reduced in      after a siege of two years the moors had reigned in spain eight centuries and were totally ruined by this defeat persecuted despoiled burned or converted and baptized by thousands they were at length driven from the kingdom in the reign of philip iii about the   th century  spain is at present divided into    provinces which are navarre biscay and the asturias to the north to the west are galicia and estramadura to the south upper and lower andalusia and the kingdom of murcia to the east that of valencia arragon and catalonia and in the middle of the monarchy the kingdom of leon and the two castiles  as the character customs and manners of the inhabitants of these provinces which were formerly so many distinct kingdoms or independent sovereignties are in many of them very different we shall treat of the principal ones apart  but first it will be proper to observe that this division of spain into kingdoms and provinces as described in maps and geographical treatises has scarcely any place in fact the government knows but one division the province of the crown of castile and those of the crown of arragon the two parts of the monarchy differ from each other with respect to the administration form and collection of taxes a distinction which had its origin at the time when castile and arragon were united by the marriage of isabella and ferdinand the catholic and which since that time has undergone but few alterations the crown of arragon possessed only arragon catalonia and the kingdom of valencia besides some islands in the mediterranean the crown of castile possessed the rest of the spanish monarchy  the air in most of the provinces is pure and dry but in june july and august the days are insufferably hot especially in the middle of the country in the night a traveller shivers with cold toward the north and in the mountainous parts of the kingdom the air is cooler than toward the south and near the sea contracts a considerable moisture it seldom rains and the winter frosts are never such as to bind up the ground want of temperature in the heat and coolness of the air is the cause that seed lies a long time in the ground before it shoots up the country in general labors under a great scarcity of corn which is owing in a great measure to the neglect of agriculture for though the soil is in places extremely dry and the growth of grain and other fruits very much obstructed in the day by the excessive heats and in the night by intense cold yet it appears from ancient geographers and historians that spain formerly produced great plenty of corn so that the present scarcity of that commodity must proceed from the neglect of tillage on the other hand the most delicious fruits are to be met with in great abundance such as pears peaches olives figs grapes almonds chestnuts lemons oranges and pomegranates it produces also very good saffron the spanish wines particularly sack are greedily bought up by foreign nations the value of the wine and grapes annually exported from the country round malaga alone amounts to one million and an half of piastres  the grapes or raisins says twiss are of two sorts those which are called sun raisins are thus made when the grapes are almost ripe the stalk is cut half through so that the sap may not penetrate farther but yet that the bunch of grapes may remain suspended by the stalk the sun by darting on them candies them and when they are dry they are packed up in boxes the second sort is made after the following manner when the vines are pruned the tendrils are preserved till the time of vintage a great fire is then made wherein those tendrils are burnt and in the lie made from their ashes the newly gathered grapes are dipped after which they are exposed to the sun to dry which renders them fit for use  the indian fig too is very common in the eastern and southern parts of spain and although this shrub be originally from the indies it grows every where without cultivation its flower is almost the size of a common carnation the fruit which succeeds the flower resembles the common fig it stains with red the urine of such as eat of it it was by chance discovered in england that the bones of a pig kept in the house of a dyer and which had been fed with madder were stained with red the experiment was repeated and confirmed by the academy of sciences at paris  the great palm tree grows in all the southern provinces of spain but is found in the greatest abundance in the kingdom of valencia in the environs of the elche when the plain is covered with them as far as the eye can reach it is said there are upwards of  0000 trees two thirds of which are at least   0 feet high and form a magnificent forest the dates they produce hang in clusters of from    to    pounds weight at the top of the tree  andalusia abounds with olive trees those of lucena and the environ produce a round little olive of a good quality for making of oil the olives of seville are as large as a pigeons egg and are excellent for preserving  several parts of the country also produce rice and sugar canes spain enjoys likewise great plenty of exquisite honey and silk in abundance salt is procured in such abundance that there are considerable quantities exported a great deal of sea salt is made on the coasts and in the island of majorca where the sun serves instead of fire in this country are to be seen innumerable flocks of very fine sheep part of which during winter feed in the plains and in the summer are driven up again in the mountains the number of shepherds in spain are computed to be  0000 the wool most in esteem is that of old castile though the spanish wool in general is very fine and valuable andalusia and asturia are particularly famous for their horses there are also great numbers of mules but few horned cattle from andalusia are brought the wild bulls for the bullfights  the maritime parts abound in fish among other kinds in tunny sturgeon salmon lampreys haddock etc but for want of improving these advantages spain annually purchases stock and salt fish to the amount of three million of piastres  tunny says twiss are caught in great abundance near conil on the andalusian coast these fish are from   to  0 feet in length and weigh about an hundred and an half the duke of medina sidonia is proprietor of this fishery which brings him in annually upwards of  0000l the fish is eaten fresh and salted it is exported to italy where it serves for food to the equipage of the galleys which cruise in the mediterranean this fish is very firm and nourishing and much resembles veal  among the many mountains in spain the pyrenees are the most remarkable these separate spain from france and from the mediterranean to the atlantic make a length of near  00 english miles being in their greatest breadth not less than  0 over these pyrenean mountains there are scarce five passages from spain into france and these very narrow the very valleys between these mountains are covered with thick and lofty woods mount idubada is a chain of mountains extending from the pyrenees to tortosa a chain of these mountains separates the kingdom of granada and extends to the streights of gibraltar where the celebrated mountain anciently called mount calpe stands opposite to those of ceuta in africa  these mountains yield great quantities of timber for shipping according to ancient writers the mountains of spain are very rich in gold and silver but the spaniards prefer importing these metals from america to searching for them in their own country but their iron mines are worked with great industry and skill spain wants not also other minerals such as lead tin cinnabar alum quicksilver vitriol copperas lapis calaminaris and likewise crystal diamonds amethysts and other gems  this peninsula is watered by many very considerable rivers these are upwards of   0 in number but the most distinguished by their extent depth and breadth in a word those which in their course swallow up the others and afterward empty their waters into the sea are the elmo the guadalquiver the tagus the guadiana the douro the guadalaviar and the segura in giving a description of each province we shall have occasion to speak of the rivers by which they are watered and to fix the place of their source and that where they disembogue into the ocean  having now given a general view of the climate productions and face of the country at large we shall begin to treat of the different provinces beginning with catalonia which at the time of the union was comprehended under the kingdom of arragon  chap ii province of catalonia this province is about  0 leagues in length from east to west and from  0 to    in breadth it derives its name from that of the goths and alans united in the word gothalonia easily changed into catalonia it is bounded on the north by the pyrenees to the east and south by the mediterranean and to the west by the kingdom of valencia and by part of that of arragon it was formerly larger than at present but france has at different times curtailed it of the counties of roussillon and conflans with a good part of cardagne and long since of foix this fine country is watered by several rivers some of which intermix whilst others discharge themselves separately into the sea  the air of catalonia is healthy and the climate upon the coast temperate but the northern part is cold on account of the mountains these are numerous in this province but they are not so barren as those in other parts of the kingdom the mountains of catalonia are covered with wood and verdure the fine and well cultivated plains of tarragona cardagna vic and urgel produce abundance of corn wine and vegetables of every kind  the two wonders of catalonia are mountserrat and the mountain near candona called the saltmountain these equally attract the attention of the devotee and the naturalist nothing can be more picturesque than montserrat it is so lofty that from the top the neighboring mountains appear to be sunk to a level with the plain it is composed of steep rocks which at a distance seem indented whence it is said it receives the name montserrat from the latin word serras a saw it is impossible to describe the beauty richness and variety of the landscapes discovered from the most elevated point they fatigue the eye and must undoubtedly humble every thinking man it is sufficient to observe that the islands of majorca and minorca which are at the distance of  0 leagues are discovered from this elevation  the monastery in which  0 monks live according to the rule of st benedict is at the bottom of a steep rock it was there st ignatius devoted himself to penitence and formed the idea of founding the celebrated society of jesus in      an anecdote but little known  the most interesting part of the mountain to a foreigner is the desert in which are several hermitages that are excellent asylums for true philosophy and contemplation each of these solitary retreats which at a distance seem destitute of every thing has a chapel a cell or wall in the rock and a little garden the hermits who inhabit them are for the most part persons of fortune and family disgusted with the world who have retired thither to devote themselves to meditation and silence  people of every condition are continually going from all parts of the catholic world but more particularly from the several provinces in spain to visit them as well as the monastery which is reported to contain as great if not a greater treasure than that of loretto the monks show great hospitality to every one who goes there having a large income for the purpose it is however customary for persons of fortune who visit them to make some return in money to the monks for their entertainment the poor only are permitted to live there gratis during three days  the other great natural curiosity the mountain of cardona is an inexhaustible quarry of salt this mineral is found there of almost every color so that when shone upon by the rays of the sun the mountains resemble those of diamonds rubies and emeralds which we read of in the fanciful description of fairy land vases urns and many valuable productions are made from this salt imitations of every kind of preserved fruit are so perfectly wrought in it that the eye aids the hand to deceive there is no form that cannot be given to the salt which is easily cut though it has sufficient solidity but productions which can receive no injury from the hand of time would quickly be dissolved in water the principal colors of the salt are orange violet green and blue one of the particularities and not the least important of this mountain is that it is in part covered with shrubs and plants the top is shaded by a forest of pines and the environs produce excellent wine  with respect to the general fair of this province all through catalonia says townsend we admire at every step the industry of the inhabitants who working early and late give fertility to a soil which naturally except for vines is most improductive but when we come to mataro a large town on the seacoast we are perfectly enchanted the farms are so many gardens divided every where into beds of about four feet wide with a channel for the passage of the water to each bed every farm has its noria a species of chain pump which from its extreme simplity seems to have been the invention of the most remote antiquity by means of this machine they every morning draw a sufficient quantity of water from the well for the service of the day and in the evening distribute it to every quarter according to the nature of their crops the reservoirs into which they raise the water are about  0  0 or even  0 feet square and three feet high above the surface of the ground with a stone cope on the wall declining to the water for the women to wash and beat their clothes upon the soil is so light being nothing but sand from the decomposition of the granate that they plough with two oxen or one horse or even with a mule yet by the assistance of the water it is made fertile and produces on the same spot of ground corn vine oranges and olives  chap iii of the cities etc the principal city in this province is barcelona and this city says peyron is the only one in spain which at a distance announces its grandeur and population the traveller when half a league from madrid would scarcely suspect he was approaching a great city much less the capital of the kingdom were it not for the high and numerous steeples which seem to rise from the midst of a barren soil whereas in the environs of barcelona an immense number of country houses carriages and passengers prepare us for a rich and commercial city  the building of barcelona according to historians was about   0 years prior to the christian era and  00 subsequent to the first establishment of the carthaginians in spain it is said to have been called barkino by its founder in honor of his family and to have derived from the jews the commercial spirit which it has constantly retained  it was early delivered from the dominion of the moors and raised into a county paying homage to the kings of france till they unable to protect it resigned their claims leaving the citizens to their own exertions for the vindication of their freedom toward the close of the   th century it was annexed by the marriage of its count to the crown of arragon and at a subsequent period by the union of ferdinand and isabella it became a part of the spanish monarchy  whilst the succession was disputed in   00 between the two houses of austria and bourbon on the death of charles ii of spain this city was of too much importance to the two contending parties to remain long in the quiet possession of either the french were masters of the city when the earl of peterborough arrived upon the coast with his little army a force too inconsiderable to attempt a siege with any prospect of success but as this gallant officer had that which supplies the want of more numerous armies an imagination fertile in resources his friends never despaired of success till they saw him reembark his troops and prepare for sailing the moment of despair to them was to the besieged the revival of their confidence and the signal of futurity he sailed but in the night disembarked his troops and before morning got possession of monjuich after a few days more he was master of the city  tarragon tortosa and lerida followed the example of the capital and declared for charles wherever the earl of peterborough carried his arms victory declared for him it was sufficient to show himself and every city offered him its keys when he was superceded a series of misfortunes too well known hastened the fall of the archdukes dominions and the citizens of barcelona after an obstinate resistance opening their gates to philip submitted though reluctantly to bear the yoke  a spacious and airy walk round the walls with the enclosed gardens contributes toward making barcelona one of the most delightful cities in the world no one who has been there in the spring will be ever weary in expatiating on the pleasures he enjoyed  this city says swinburne is situated in a sweet spot the air equal in purity and much excels in mildness the boasted climate of montpellier except in the dog days there are green pease all the year round the situation is beautiful the appearance both from land and water highly picturesque a great extent of fruitful plains bounded by an amphitheatre of hills backs it on the west side the mountain of montjuich defends it on the south from the unwholesome winds that blow over the marshes at the mouth of the llobregat to the northward the coast projecting into the sea forms a noble bay and it has the mediterranean to close the prospect of the east the environs are in a state of high cultivation studded with villages country houses and gardens  barcelona as a residence is not only delightful but healthy there are indeed some days when all the inhabitants but more especially strangers are inclined to think it both unpleasant and unhealthy that is when the east wind brings in the fog which for many days before had been observed standing off at sea as if watching and waiting for an opportunity to land the pores are then locked up and the temper becomes so irritable that the best friends must be careful how they meet but no sooner does the land breeze spring up than the fog retires the sun breaks out and all nature wears a smile in barcelonetta and the citadel in which a garrison of   00 men is quartered intermittents never cease to rage and bring on in winter dropsies and jaundices and in summer malignant fevers the same diseases reign beyond montjuich in the low country watered by the llobregat but although the prevailing wind in its passage becomes loaded with noxious vapors yet being diverted from its course by that high mountain it has no baleful influence on barcelona  the fortifications of monjuich a high mountain which bound the city to the west are reckoned perfect in their kind they are highly finished and for beauty do credit to the nation these in addition to the strong works round the city and the citadel must render barcelona untenable by an enemy  if my conjecture says townsend be well founded monjuich must not merely have been covered with the sea and this fact is beyond a doubt but it must have been relatively lower and much lower than the granite mountains by whose spoils it was conposd being accumulated at the conflux of two or more currents as we see in miniature in torrents or at the junction of two streams whoever is well acquainted with the external appearance and internal structure of the country round southampton will see a striking example of this accumulation not from matter brought by either of its rivers for their beds are too low for such an operation but by the action of currents when the surrounding hills of sussex wiltshire dorsetshire and the isle of wight were under the surface of the sea as we must conclude from the fossile shells found in the chalk on every one of these hills  the appellation of monjuich has never been properly explained they anciently wrote monjouy but the pronunciation is monjuique which may possibly mean mountain of the jews certain it is that the jews were numerous in this part of spain and that on the hill looking toward the city there are monumental inscriptions in hebrew characters on large hewn rocks many of the words are scarcely legible but by those which can be read that spot appears to have been the burial place of the jews this mountain commands a view over the coast plain and harbor not a single house in barcelona but lies exposed to the sight  the form of barcelona is almost circular the roman town being on the highest ground in the center of the new one the ancient walls are still visible in several places but the sea has retired many hundreds of yards from the port gates one of the principal gothic churches and a whole quarter of the city stands upon the sands that were once the bottom of the harbor  the port is handsome and the mole all of hewn stone being a master piece of solidity and convenience above is a platform for carriages and below vast magazines with a broad key reaching from the city gates to the light house this grand improvement was planned and executed by the late marquis de la minas great are the obligations barcelona has to him he cleansed and beautified its streets built useful edifices and forwarded its trade and manufactures without much extraordinary expense to the province for he had more resources and made money go farther than most other governors either could or even wish to do on the neck of land running into the sea and forming the port he pulled down some fishermens huts and in      began to build barceloneta a regular town consisting of about  000 brick houses quarters for a regiment and a church in which his ashes are deposited as the land was given gratis the houses were soon run up on a regular plan a ground floor and one story above with three windows in front and a pediment over them the whole consisting of about  0 streets etc containing near  0000 inhabitants  it gives pleasure says baretti to see the pleasing uniformity of all the houses running parallel to each other from the beginning to the end of every street no house has more than one story besides the ground floor and the streets are wide enough to admit of two and even three carriages abreast the front of every house is covered with white plaster which as it is laid on very smooth shines like marble half polished yet the glare proves not offensive to the eye as the intercolumniations are colored with a pale red and the window shutters painted green  on conditions they conform to this plan and provided they are catholics strangers are admitted indiscriminately with the natives to build as many houses as they please and to have equally with the natives the soil for nothing  to this advantage are added two others that of being naturalized without any other formality and having the faith of government pledged to them that they shall never pay any groundrent nor other tax whatever on account of any building they may erect  another of la minass improvements is the rampart or great walk upon the walls extending the whole length of the harbor the whole is built upon arches with magazines below and a broad coach road and foot path above raised to the level of the first floor of the houses in the adjoining street  the citadel has six strong bastions calculated to overawe the inhabitants as much as to defend them from a foreign enemy the lowness of its situation renders it damp unwholesome and swarming with mosquitos the major of this fortress owes his promotion to a singular circumstance when the late king arrived at madrid in      a magnificent bull feast was given in honor of that event it being necessary upon such occasions that those who fight on horseback should be gentlemen the managers of the exhibition were greatly at a loss till this man who was a poor starving officer presented himself though utterly ignorant both of bullfighting and horsemanship by dint of resolution and the particular favor of fortune he kept his seat and performed his part so much to the public satisfaction that he was rewarded with a pension and a majority  the streets of barcelona are narrow and crooked like those of all ancient cities but they are well paved a covered drain in the middle of each street carries off the filth and rain water at night they are tolerably well lighted up but long before daybreak every lamp is out the houses are lofty and plain to each kind of trade a particular district is allotted  of the four gates that the town has there are two on the sea side at one of which people go out but must come in at the other a good contrivance to facilitate the inspection of whatever is not to be introduced without the previous payment of custom duties  within the town and just by the playhouse there is a large square called la rambla where on summer evenings people of both sexes resort to walk and converse until supper time and often during the best part of the night as is the general custom in spain where every town has a square or at least a street dedicated to such evening conversations  the old roman town may still be distinctly traced with one of its gates and some of its towers well preserved in this are many sarcophagi altars images and inscriptions with a temple of neptune there are also the remains of a palace of the praetor or roman governor in the court yard of which is a beautiful cistern or rather sarcophagus which now serves as a watering trough for mules they call it the coffin of pompeys father and it may as well be his as that of any other person as we have no proof to the contrary a large basrelief runs round it of hunters dogs and wild beasts the chief person is on horseback bareheaded in a military dress the figures and animals are executed in a masterly style and the whole is a fine monument of antiquity  it was in this city that ferdinand and isabella received columbus returning from america and from hence that navigator sailed on his second expedition in       in viewing the churches of barcelona says townsend an observation is confirmed which had occurred even in the most contemptible of the country villages south of the pyrenees namely that all their decorations were invented about the beginning of the   th century after the gold and silver of america had been brought to spain and every altar piece with every column shows that their improvement in taste did not keep pace with their increase of wealth riches came upon them by surprise and found them unprepared to make a proper use of the abundant treasure hence even the composite and corinthian pillars are loaded with new ornaments and whether fluted or contorted they are entwined by ivy and by vines and are almost hid by the multitude of angels fluttering round them or by cherubs climbing up the branches and the whole of this preposterous assemblage is covered with one glare of gold  the principal edifices are the cathedral santa maria the generals palace and the exchange the architecture of the cathedral is a light gothic which in the ornaments of the cloisters is inimitably airy the stalls of the choir are neatly carved and hung with escutcheons of princes and noblemen among which are the arms of our henry viii in the cloisters various kinds of foreign birds are kept upon funds bequeathed for that purpose by a wealthy canon i could not learn says swinburne what motives induced him to make so whimsical a devise santa maria is also a gothic pile the palace is square and low without outcourts or gardens and contains nothing worthy of remark but a noble ballroom in which are the portraits of all the ancient counts of barcelona  the exchange which is not yet finished is opposite the governors palace and will be one of the finest monuments in the city some of the halls or chambers are occupied by the junto of commerce and others serve for drawingschools like those of paris where the art of drawing is taught gratis this academy of the noble arts says townsend is open to all the world and all those who choose to attend are gratuitously taught drawing architecture and sculpture under the direction of able masters for this purpose there are seven spacious halls finished at the kings expense with tables benches lights paper pencils drawings models clay and living subjects the students assemble in the morning from  0 to    and in the evening from six to eight in winter and from eight to ten in summer  i counted says the above author one night upwards of  00 boys many of whom were finishing designs which showed either superior genius or more than common application it is not to be imagined that all these boys or perhaps any of them were destined to be painters this was not the intention of government much less of the nobleman who suggested the institution most if not all these youths are apprenticed to trades and it is well imagined that every other art may receive some assistance from this whose peculiar property it is to excel in imitation such institutions are much wanted in england not only the sculptor the architect and the engineer but the coachmaker the cabinetmaker the weaver and even the tailor and the haberdasher may derive great advantages from that accuracy of sight and that fertility of invention which are acquired by the practice of drawing and designing  one of the seven halls is fitted up for a nautical school and provided with every thing needful to teach the art of navigation the students assemble every morning from eight to ten and every evening from three to five since the first establishment of this useful seminary they have sent more than  00 pilots qualified to navigate a vessel to any quarter of the globe  equally well furnished with the preceding and equally well conducted is the military academy in which are three magnificent apartments for the students to pursue their studies from the first elements of the mathematics to the higher branches of their profession this and similar academies established by the reigning monarch are of vast importance to the nation as furnishing a sufficient supply of engineers in time of war without the necessity of depending as in former periods wholly on its allies these seminaries in spain are the only schools in which the mathematics can be studied to advantage for although in all the universities professors are appointed they are said to be wholly ignorant of this science which they profess to teach  besides these institutions for the instruction of such as are devoted to arts or arms there are not wanting some of more general utility accessible to all the citizens without distinction these are a cabinet of natural history and the public libraries of which there are four three general and the other confined to medicine and surgery in short whatever studies a person may be desirous of pursuing he will find in one or other of these libraries the best books to which he may have access six hours every day excepting holidays in the convent of the dominicans there is one apartment filled entirely with books prohibited by the inquisition and in order that no one may be tempted to peruse them all the vacant spaces are filled with devils cracking human bones it is to be supposed of heretics these books however are under strict lock and key  in the cloister of this convent may likewise be seen more than  00 records of sentences passed on heretics containing their names their ages their occupations their places of abode the time when they were condemned and the event whether the party were burnt in prison or in effigy most of these were women the first date is in      and the last      under each inscription there is a portrait of the heretic some half others more than three parts devoured by devils  visiting the churches at all hours says townsend whenever any service was to be performed i made a party with some friends to hear a penitential service which is so singular i cannot help relating it the first part of the miserere was no sooner ended than the doors were shut the lights extinguished and we remained in perfect darkness at this moment when the eye could no longer find an object to distract the mind the attention was awakened by the voice of harmony the whole congregation joining in the miserere which they sung with pleasing solemnity at first with soft and plaintive notes but having laid bare their naked backs and prepared them for the scourge they all began nearly at the same instant to use the discipline raising their voices and quickening the time increasing by degrees both in velocity and violence and scourging themselves with greater vehemence as they proceeded then singing louder and harsher till at the end of about  0 minutes all distinction of sound was lost and the whole ended in one deep groan this discipline is repeated every friday in the year oftener in lent and is their daily practice during the holy week  the hospicio or house of industry next merits being noticed there are in this hospital generally about    0 paupers the expense is estimated about  000l a year the women and children are employed in knitting spinning and making lace the men card comb spin and weave cotton flax and wool although no paupers can be either better clad better fed better attended or better lodged or can meet with greater tenderness when sick yet they cannot readily forget their loss of liberty and few besides the most decrepit would remain within those walls if they could be permitted to beg their bread from door to door this principle however is productive of much good for most of the young men of barcelona of any worth or spirit form themselves into clubs for mutual relief in the same manner and nearly upon the same plan adopted by our friendly societies in england these fraternities have each its firm taken from the name of the saint to whose protection it is recommended they are upon the most respectable footing and being well conducted leave none but the most improvident and most worthless subjects to be disgraced by confinement among fools and madmen of the    0 paupers it should have been observed there are  00 idiots  there is likewise a house of correction too remarkable to be passed over in silence it embraces two objects the first is the reformation of prostitutes and female thieves the second the correction of such women as fail in their obligation to their husbands and of those who either neglect or disgrace their families the house for these purposes is divided into distinct portions without any communication between them the ladies who deserve more severe correction than their husbands fathers or other relations can properly administer are confined by the magistrates for a term proportioned to their offense in this royal mansion of correction the relation at whose suit they are taken into custody pay three sueldos or fourpence halfpenny per day for their maintenance and with this scanty provision they must be contented here they are compelled to work and the produce of their labor is deposited for them till the time of their confinement is expired the whole building will contain  000 women but when townsend was there there were only     among these are some ladies of condition who are supposed to be visiting some distant friends when it is judged necessary they receive bodily correction for their reformation among other particulars says townsend the governor who conducted me through the several apartments informed me they had then under discipline a lady of fashion accused of drunkenness and of being imprudent in her conduct as she was a widow the party accusing was her brother in law the marquis  no hospital that i have seen upon the continent says townsend is so well administered as the general hospital of this city it is peculiar in its attention to convalescents for whom a separate habitation is provided that after they are dismissed from the sick wards as cured of their diseases they may have time to recruit their strength before they are turned out to endure their accustomed hardships and to get their bread by labor nothing can be more useful nothing more humane than this appendage the numbers received into this hospital were in the year      upwards of  000 and in      upwards of  000 in the former year they buried upwards of  00 in the latter upwards of  00 which upon the average is nearly a ninth of those who enter but then it must be considered that many are put into public hospitals merely to save the expense of funerals  with this hospital is united under the same administration an establishment for foundlings sufficiently capacious for the city and its environs the deserted children were above  00 on the average of      and      and of these two thirds were buried a proportion shocking to humanity but the inevitable consequence of taking children from their mothers and crowding them in a city more especially if as in barcelona five children hang upon one nurse it is much to be lamented that they have not like the french recourse to the milk of goats or like the nurses of the orphan hospital in dublin learnt the use of sucking bottles  the boys on this foundation are bound apprentice when of a proper age the girls when marriageable are conducted in procession through the streets and any young man who sees one whom he would like for a wife is at liberty to mark her which he does by throwing his handkerchief to her  barcelona may be considered as divided either into districts or into parishes the former being five the latter eight including the cathedral in a circumference of four miles it contains at present  0000 houses  0000 families and about  00000 inhabitants  the wealth which flows into barcelona is not confined within its walls but helps to increase the population of all the surrounding villages which in the compass of five leagues are  0  all subject to its jurisdiction and all partaking of that tranquillity which arises from energy in a well constituted government  the industry which every where appears in catalonia seems to act with concentrated force in barcelona early and late not only is the hammer heard upon the anvil but every artist is seen busily employed the two chief trades here are tailors and shoemakers who are employed in clothing the army not only in spain but over the whole empire  amongst the more considerable trades are the silkweavers cutlers gunsmiths armourers braziers carpenters cabinetmakers turners with fringemakers and embroiderers here is also a foundery for cannon the ingenuity of the spanish artists is allowed to exceed that of most other countries  the manufactures have increased with such rapidity that the wages of labor for all kinds of articles in the city and environs have advanced to one shilling and eightpence a day for which they work only seven hours these gains however are not out of proportion to the value of provisions as regulated by the magistrates mutton is sold for  0 pence the pound of    ounces beef for sevenpence and bread at present for seven farthings the pound of    ounces lodging for a small family costs about two guineas a year  the commerce of barcelona is considerable it has no navigable river and seems to have been built in its present situation only for the sake of deriving protection from the high mountain which commands it the basin is formed by a mole and is sufficiently capacious but there is only    feet water on the bar  brandy wine nuts almonds raisins and cork are shipped at different places on the coast for the merchants who reside in barcelona the price of the wines varies according to the season these are of several sorts the average price of which including the spanish duties is about  0 shillings the hogshead when brandy is dearest it is sold duty free on board hollands proof at one shilling and fourpence halfpenny the gallon but sometimes as low as tenpence swinburne makes the annual exports of brandy from one town in catalonia near tarragon reus to amount to  0000 pipes five pipes of wine makes one of strong brandy catalonia furnishes   000 pipes of brandy and  000 of wine besides  0000 bags of nuts containing three bushels each at  0 shillings the bag of the above says townsend about  000 pipes of brandy and some silk go to guernsey and alderney and the rest to france all to be smuggled into england  about  000 vessels enter the port of barcelona yearly of which one half are spanish  00 english   0 french and  0 are danes  the imports besides corn are about  000000 weight of newfoundland cod sold at one guinea per hundred weight beans from holland for the poor people and an inferior sort from africa for the mules salted conger eel from cornwall and britany sold at  0 or  0 shillings per quintal this is an unwholesome luscious food which they cook up with garlic and spice there are likewise imported english bale goods and many other articles of luxury  there are two other cities in this province which on account of their antiquity it may not be amiss just to notice tarragon and lerida  tarragon is one of the most ancient cities in spain and said to have been built by the phenicians who gave it the name of tarcon of which the latins made tarraco it gave its name to one of the most considerable parts of spain called by the romans tarraconensis the city was fortified by scipio who made it a place of defense against the carthaginians  this city says peyron is the metropolis of catalonia and disputes with toledo the primacy of spain the establishment of the sea is said to have been in the first ages of the church the succession of archbishops was interrupted by the moors and remained suspended till the   th century  tarragon of all the cities in spain says townsend would give the most agreeable employment to the antiquarian here he would admire the remains of an amphitheatre of a theater of a circus of the palace of augustus of temples and of an extensive aqueduct with fortifications which although of a more recent date are ancient  the cathedral is worthy of attention for its vast dimensions the elegance of its gothic architecture and a magnificent chapel built with rich marble and jasper in honor of s thecla tutelar saint of the church  this city contains about  000 inhabitants but whenever the canal of arragon shall be navigable the whole country will feel the influence of reviving commerce and among other cities this may regain its ancient population  trade is now confined to wine and brandy but for home consumption they carry on a considerable fishery  to protect the inhabitants from the incursions of the moors they have erected batteries these are the more needful because the ancient fortifications are gone to ruin and the algerines have committed frequent depredations on the coast  near this city in a wood of pines and shrubs is a monument that tradition has named the tomb of the scipios they were the father and uncle of scipio africanus both killed in spain this building is small being about    feet square and    high in the front facing the sea are the statues of two warriors in a mournful posture roughly cut out of the stones of the sepulcher and much worn away by the sea air the inscription is now so much defaced that it is difficult to trace it out  the situation of lerida is delightful and the country in which it stands is one continued garden covered with corn with olive trees and vines for beauty few places can exceed it but from the abundance of water it is far from being healthy this city called ilerda by the romans was rendered famous by the distress to which julius caesar was reduced when encamped in its neighborhood he had taken possession of a plain shut in between the rivers cinga and sicoris and defended by a deep entrenchment whilst petreius and afranius pompeys generals were encamped on a hill between him and ilerda between the hill and the city is a plain with an eminence which if seized might be quickly fortified and would cut off all communication with the city for this during five hours they maintained a doubtful conflict but in the end fortune declared in favor of afranius and caesar retreated to his camp whilst revolving in his mind how he should cover this disgrace word was brought that by the melting of the snow upon the mountains his two bridges were broken down that the country was laid under water and that all communication was cut off with the provinces by which his army had been fed the immediate consequence was famine it was upon the news of this distress that cicero left the city and joined pompey at dyrrachium  caesar without loss of time set his men to work and having made a sufficient number of little boats light and portable like those he had seen in britain after a few days sent a party up the river in the night who with these boats made good their landing and having fortified a camp secured his retreat  chap iv character manners dress etc of catalonia this province is almost throughout extremely mountainous the nature of the country appears to have great influence on that of the inhabitants who are a hardy active industrious race of a middle size brown complexion and strong features their limbs well knit together and by education and practice inured to the greatest fatigues there are few lame or distorted persons or beggars to be met with among them their mocos or muleboys are stout walkers some of them have been known to go from barcelona to madrid and back again in nine days which by the high road is  00 miles  the catalonians are excellent for light infantry on the forlorn hope or for a coup de main but though brave and indefatigable they are averse to the strictness of regular discipline unless it be in their own national regiments they cannot brook the thoughts of being menial servants in their own country but will rather trudge it all over with a pedlars pack on their shoulders or run about upon errands than be chief domestic in a catalonian family far from home they make excellent servants and most of the principal houses in madrid have catalonians at the head of their affairs they are the general muleteers and calessieros of spain are to be met with in every part of the kingdom their honesty steadiness and sobriety entitle them to the confidence of travelers and their thirst after lucre makes them bear with any hardships with good words they are always docile but will not bear hard usage or opprobrious language  the rigid parfimony of this people appears in their scanty provision for the day when they carry their little basket to the market together with their beef and garden stuff they bring home two deniers worth of charcoal this circumstance is so characteristic that when they would reproach the rich miser for his penury they say that notwithstanding his opulence he continues to send to market for dos dineros de carbon twelve deniers making a penny  the loss of all their immunities the ignominious prohibition of every weapon even a knife and an enormous load of taxes have not been able to stifle their independent spirit which breaks out upon the least stretch of arbitrary power but within these four years many of their ancient privileges have been gradually restored their taxation is still very high all trade is assessed according to the business supposed to be transacted in the course of the year without regard either to loss or gain  till of late the inhabitants of catalonia durst not carry any knife but in each public house there was one chained to the table for the use of all comers the good order maintained by the police and vigilance of the thieftakers supply the place of defensive weapons robberies and murders being seldom heard of the streets of barcelona may be walked over at all hours provided the passenger carries a light with him without it he is liable to be carried to prison by the patrol  the minones or thieftakers are men of trust and consideration and of approved courage their dress is that of the miquelets or mountaineers who so cruelly harassed the french armies in the wars at the beginning of the present century they wear their hair in a net a broad silverlaced hat squeezed flat like those of the english sailors hung on one spanish mulateer and thief taker side of their head an handkerchief loosely tied round the neck a short striped waistcoat and over it a red jacket with large silver buttons like bells dangling from it a blue shirt bound with yellow tape rolled several times round their waist in which they carry their knife handkerchief etc over this jacket they wear two cross belts one for an ammunition pouch the other for their broad sword and pistols on the left shoulder hangs a blue great coat embroidered with white thread their breeches are blue and white striped their stockings rolled below their knee and gartered with an enormous buckle and bunch of black ribbons reach only down to the ankle where they tie several rounds of blue fillet very tight to keep on their packthread sandals that seem scarce to cover their toes  the common dress of a catalonian sailor or muleteer is brown and the distinction mark by which they are known in spain is a red woolen cap falling forwards like that of the ancient phrygians the middling sort of people and artificers wear hats and dark clothes with a loose coat carelessly tossed over the shoulders their breeches are commonly black velvet they have seldom any stockings and sandals supply the place of shoes  the dress of the women in general is a black silk petticoat over a little hoop shoes without heels bare shoulders and a black veil stiffened out with wire so as to arch out on each side of the head something resembling the hooded serpent and in spain italy and africa all the inhabitants bind themselves up with sashes as a preventative of ruptures  the mode of drinking in catalonia is singular they hold a broad bottomed glass bottle at arms length and let the liquor spout out of a long neck upon their tongue  the devotion of the catalonians seems to be pretty much upon a par with that of their neighbors in the southern provinces of france and much less ardent than in the other parts of spain but they still abound with strange practices of religion and local worship one very odd idea of theirs is that on the first of november the eve of all souls they run about from house to house to eat chestnuts believing that for every chestnut they swallow with proper faith and unction they shall deliver a soul out of purgatory  there are now but one or two churches at most in each city that are allowed the privilege of protecting offenders and murderers are excluded from the benefit of the sanctuary the proceedings of the inquisition are grown very mild if any person leads a scandalous life or allows his tongue unwarrantable liberties he is summoned by the holy office and privately admonished in case of nonamendment he is committed to prison once a year every family must answer to that tribunal for their orthodoxy and that of every servant they have or they must quit the country hut the foreign protestant houses are passed over unnoticed and peovided a foreigner does not make religion the subject of his discourse he may live at barcelona in what manner he pleases  every jew that lands in spain must declare himself to be such at the inquisition which immediately appoints a familiar to attend him all the time he stays on shore to whom he pays a pistole a day were he to neglect giving this information he would be liable to be seized yet says swinburne i have been assured by persons of undoubted credit that a jew may travel incognito from perpignan to lisbon and sleep every night at the house of a jew being recommended from one to another and that wherever a house is remarkably decked out with images relics and lamps and the owner noted for being the most enthusiastic devotee of the parish it is ten to one but the family are israelites at heart  if a stranger is desirous of becoming acquainted with spanish customs and manners he must proceed further for this province bears so little resemblance to the rest of the kingdom that he will derive no real knowledge on that score from traveling in catalonia here it is not uncommon for them to talk of a journey into spain as they would of one into france and their language is not understood by the spaniards being a dialect of the ancient limosine tongue a kind of gascon  in catalonia the traveller is under the protection of the magistrate who settles the price of every thing he may want and annually publishes his arancel that is a table of assize which must be hung up in some conspicuous place of every inn according to this every guest occupying a bedroom with one bed must pay for that and his light three sueldos and nine deniers or something less than fivepence but if there are several beds in one room then each pays twopencehalfpenny nearly if he does not occupy a bed he must pay for shelter six deniers or nine fourteenths of a penny every carriage pays one sueldo per night for standing the ordinary is regulated as to the number and nature of the dishes both for dinner and supper and for these the prices are including bread and wine for dinner    sueldos or one shilling and sevenpencefarthing and for supper    sueldos three deniers  chap v of the kingdom of valencia which made part of the ancient kingdom of arragon the kingdom of valencia is about  0 leagues in extent from north to south its greatest breadth however does not exceed    it is bounded on the south and east by the mediterranean on the west by new castile and the kingdom of murcia and on the north by catalonia and arragon it was formerly inhabited by the celtiberians the turdetani the lusoni etc etc  this is one of the best watered provinces in spain there are no fewer than    rivers all of which run east or southeast into the mediterranean it is also in proportion to its extent one of the best peopled provinces it contains seven principal cities    great towns and upwards of  000 villages has four seaports the most considerable of which is that of alicant  the air and climate of valencia would be highly beneficial to the english in a variety of cases more especially for nervous and hypocondriac disorders shattered constitutions and for those who suffer either by a redundancy or suppression of bile they would find the oranges and grapes most powerful detergents and every article of food whether animal or vegetable being light and easy of digestion the most delicate stomach would never feel oppressed in our island these patients suffer by humidity but in valencia such is the dryness of the air that sugar and salt may constantly be exposed without contracting the least sign of moisture  among the natural curiosities in this province the most remarkable are the baths of buzot in the vicinity of alicant their temperature is about  0  degrees of fahrenheits thermometer two or three small tumblers of this water prove speedily and pleasantly cathartic this part of the country is frequently shaken by strong earthquakes  silk is certainly the most considerable article produced in the province of valencia being nearly equal to all the rest together the land in this fertile valley never rests for no sooner is one crop removed than the farmer begins to prepare it for another in september he sows barley which having reaped about the latter end of april he immediately puts in maize which comes off about the middle of september in november he sows wheat and in june reaps it the produce both of wheat and barley is from    to    for one having sown of the former nearly two bushels and of the latter between three and four to an acre flax is put into the ground about september and comes off in may but hemp sowed in april continues till august these with cucumbers melons peace french beans lettuce form a rich variety of crops which cherished by a bright sun and fed by abundant streams prove a never failing source of plenty  in the spring they abound with oranges and lemons in summer they have plums cherries figs apricots and nectarines in autumn they gather grapes and in winter a rich variety of fruits supplies their tables thus ceres and pomona appear to be enjoyed in a never ceasing contest which shall most contribute to the wealth and prosperity of this favored valley  one of the most valuable productions of the country is the barilla this is a vegetable peculiar to the kingdoms of valencia and murcia it is essential in the making of glass about   0000 quintals are gathered of it every year most of which is sent to france and england and a small quantity to genoa and venice  there is another species of barilla called in english potash employed in the soap manufactures of france and england a considerable quantity of which is exported from the kingdom of valencia  those voracious insects the locusts occasionally commit great devastations in this part of spain and this proceeds not merely from the warmth of the climate but for want of cultivation because the females never deposit their eggs in arable land but always in deserts for this reason galicia where agriculture prevails is little infested with the locust  when the provincial governors are informed in spring that locusts have been seen they collect the soldiers and the peasants divide them into companies and surround the district every man is furnished with a long broom with which he strikes the ground and thus drives the young locusts toward a common center where a vast excavation with a quantity of brush wood is prepared for their reception and where the flame destroys them  in the year    0  000 men were thus employed at zamora for three weeks and it was reckoned that the quantity collected exceeded  0000 bushels  chap vi cities etc the principal cities in this fine province termed the garden of spain are valencia morviedro and alicant  valencia is one of the largest cities in spain its situation is delightful and the country round it a perfect garden watered by the guadalaviar on the banks of which the city stands at the distance of about half a league from the sea there are five handsome stone bridges built over the river three of which have each  0 arches another has nine and the last has    without the gates are the college of pope pius v and the palaces of the viceroy though this title is now altered to that of captain general the alameda or mall resembles that of st jamess park but is much more beautiful on account of the trees which are palms cypress elms and mulberry trees intermixed of which there are four double rows forming three walks or alleys there are many delightful walks along the river side faced with stone the better to resist the force of the water in winter this city is walled and has four gates the houses are all numbered as with us and the names of the streets painted on tiles on the corner houses its ancient name is unknown but it is said to have been taken and fortified by scipio destroyed by pompey and rebuilt by sertorius it was taken from the romans by the goths and from these latter by the moors who at two different periods possessed it   0 years but in      it was finally conquered by the king of arragon  the streets of valencia are narrow crooked unpaved and impassable after rain and in these there are but two or three houses built with taste and a few churches distinguished by their architecture in a word it is a city built by the moors who associating seldom with each other and shut up with their women considered streets as nothing more than necessary paths and gave their whole attention to the interior of their houses which were airy and spacious but in general inconvenient and badly distributed  the houses are filthy ill built and ruinous most of the churches are tawdry and loaded with barbarous ornaments both without and within in the multitude of sacred edifices some may be found that excel in particular parts as one may please the eye by the just proportion of its dimensions another strike by the richness of its marble and paintings but in all of them the judicious observer will be disgusted with loads of garlands pyramids broken pediments and monstrous cornices some churches have domes but the greater part of them tall and slender turrets painted and bedecked with all sorts of pilasters and whimsical devices every thing is likewise gilt and bedaubed with incredible profusion  priests nuns and friars of every dress and denomination swarm in this city where some convents have more than  00 monks all richly provided for  the university of valencia is a respectable community it was founded in      and soon after its institution alonso iii of arragon granted the privilege of nobility to all the students who should graduate in law it was lately much on the decline but they now reckon   00 students there are  0 professors  besides the library of the university which contains many thousand volumes mostly modern and well chosen four galleries in the archbishops palace are devoted to the use of the students and contain   000 volumes among which are many modern publications in every branch of science  in traversing the city says townsend to view whatever was most worthy of attention considering its flourishing condition and the opulence of its citizens whether merchants manufacturers ecclesiastics the military or gentlemen of landed property i was struck with the sight of poverty wretchedness and rags in every street the hospicio or general workhouse provides for   0 men   0 boys   0 women and  0 girls who are all well fed well clothed and well lodged yet the city swarms with sturdy beggars i suspected however what i found to be the case that the ecclesiastics distribute money and yet the convents give bread and broth every day to all those who make application at their gates this circumstance will sufficiently account for the multitude of miserable objects who in valencia as in all other places bear exact proportion to the undistinguishing benevolence of wealth  one establishment deserves the highest commendation it is a monte pio or bank for the assistance of farmers who are unable to purchase seed for this loan they pay no interest the funds being furnished from the effects of metropolitans deceased and from vacant benefices from the same funds in galicia fishermen are provided with boats and nets  no city in spain pays more attention to the arts than the city of valencia the public academy for painting statuary and architecture is well attended and many of the pupils seem rising to eminence to have good designers is of the greatest importance to their manufactures of silk porcelaine and painted tiles  the silk manufacture is the most important because the most natural to their soil and climate this trade is still increasing and they have now  000 silk looms and  00 stocking frames their silk is  0 per cent cheaper than it is in france yet they are not able to meet their rivals fairly in the market  at alcora in the neighborhood of valencia is a manufacture of porcelaine established by count daranda which deserves encouragement their imitation of gilding is very pleasing and natural and after many years trial has been found to be durable  but says townsend i was most delighted with the manufacture of painted tiles in valencia their best apartments are floored with these and are remarkable for neatness coolness and elegance they are stronger and much more beautiful than those we formerly received from holland  the commerce of valencia is considerable the abbe cavanilleo states the produce of this fertile province in    0 to have been near  000000 sterling in this account i am inclined to think says townshend the brandy is omitted of which there are commonly seven or  000 pipes exported annually most of which comes to us through guernsey as french brandy  the manufactures of silk are the cause of a population in this province that may be reckoned considerable if compared with the other provinces of spain it being computed that there are nearly  000000 of inhabitants resident in   0 towns and villages of which this province consists of this number the city of valencia alone is supposed to contain  00000  the road from valencia to xativa the ancient soetabis is bordered on each side with small canals of running water like those in the plains of lombardy the distance from valencia to this latter city is nine leagues the whole country has the appearance of one continued garden here are many rice fields which are always kept about three inches under water the mulberry trees in these fields are planted chequerwise this delightful country is surrounded partly by high mountains on which are many moorish castles and partly by the mediterranean sea the country is so populous that the towns and villages are not above half a league asunder where may be seen crowds of women and children sitting at the doors of their respective habitations occupied in spinning silk  morviedro which lies about four leagues north of valencia is the famous saguntum destroyed by hannibal for its fidelity to the romans the romans afterward rebuilt this city but never could restore it to its former splendour  the city of morviedro is full of the remains of its antiquity the walls of the houses the city gates and doors of the churches and inns are covered with roman inscriptions  at present it is a considerable city containing above  000 inhabitants who are strangers to manufactures and depend altogether for subsistence on the produce of the soil the commerce of this city is chiefly in oil raisins wine and brandy  its most curious monuments are the castle and the theater the former contains heaps of ruins the monuments of several centuries and are at present upwards of a quarter of a league in extent most of the towers and edifices of which the remains only are now to be seen appear to have been constructed by the moors with the materials left them by the romans  the theater vast in its dimension and capable of receiving near  0000 persons is hewn out of the rock and commands a most extensive prospect of the subjacent country which is bounded by the sea it is sufficiently well preserved plainly to distinguish the order in which the spectators were distributed at their dramatic representions at the bottom in the place of our orchestra are the seats for the magistrates next those for the equestrian order and last of all those for the body of the people as this theater is built on the declivity of a mountain the ground rises with the benches so that on which ever side the people entered they found themselves almost on a level with the place they were to occupy those of the lictors and courtezans are still in good preservation and the semicircular roof of the whole edifice is entire what seemed to me says peyron scarcely credible was that the actors should in the open air have been able to make themselves heard by so numerous an audience to assure myself of the fact i placed a boy where the stage formerly was and whilst i remained at the top of the amphitheatre made him repeat phrases of which i lost not a word the front of the ancient stage which in our modern theaters may be compared to the space in which the footlights are placed has been converted into an alley of mulberry trees and ropes are now made on that ground where formerly the verses of terence were recited to a roman audience  from the theater of saguntum we climb rather than walk up to the ancient fortresses of the moors upon the platform on a summit is a humble hermitage the inhabitants of which enjoys one of the finest prospects in spain  from hence to valencia is one perfect garden so thick with trees that there is no seeing at any distance on either side villages and monasteries every hundred yards and such crowds of people as are scarce to be met with but in the neighborhood of london all the grounds are divided into water channels the work of the moors who understood the art of watering land to the utmost perfection the ruinous state that these drains are now in prove the indolence and inferiority of the present proprietors what little skill they still show in agriculture being nothing but traditional remains of the instructions left by their great masters in husbandry the arabians  alicant is a seaport on the mediterranean of great trade protected by a strong castle situated on a rock about  0 leagues south of valencia and as many to the north of carthagena one of the circumstances which has most contributed to the riches and commerce of alicant is the duties of entry being less there than at either of the above cities  within four leagues of the city there is a kind of reservoir or cistern between two mountains called el pantano in which the water that falls from all the neighboring mountains is received and which in case of a want of rain serves to supply the whole district for a year the walls of the basin are  00 feet high and at the base upwards of  0 feet thick  the soil of the whole country between alicant and guardamar is entirely saline the salt pits here have been famous in history for these  000 years  the waters of boussot a village within a few leagues of alicant are said to be of use in obstructions and venereal cases people go to drink them in the month of may but they find there no kind of lodging and the sick who remain are obliged to have small tenements erected for their accommodation the rosemary plant thrives so well in this neighborhood that it frequently grows to the height of six feet  alicant is situated at the bottom of a bay formed by the capes la huerta and san pablo the streets are narrow and were exceedingly illpaved but now indebted to the indefatigable zeal of the governor don francisco pacheco few towns can boast of superior neatness and this city formerly in every sense a nest of vermin is become a delightful residence the inhabitants are in number about   000  neither the churches nor any of the convents are worthy to be noticed in the great church indeed says townsend i was much amused but not with the architecture nor yet with any of the altars for that which caught my attention was a grant from the college of cardinals of    0 days indulgence to any penitent who shall say before the altar of the virgin ave maria purissima and of as many to all who hearing this shall answer sin peceada concebida  on the summit of a rocky mountain rising just behind the town is the castle now fortified after the modern method and extended far beyond the limits of the old fortress great part of which was blown up with a fragment of the rock in the war with the allies in the reign of queen anne this fortress was then in possession of the english under the command of general richards when the spaniards had nearly finished their work they gave warning to the garrison and when they had lodged in it   00 barrels of powder they generously permitted the english general to send his engineers who viewed the mine with its contents these reported that the burden was too great for the quantity of powder and that the garrison was safe  on the day appointed for the springing of this mine people from every part of the country assembled on the opposite side to view the catastrophe and notice of the fatal moment was given to the garrison precisely at that moment the officers engaged in drinking and somewhat elated by their wine declared their resolution not to quit the battery till they had drank two bottles more for which they had sent a servant but no sooner had he turned his back than the battery together with general richards and  0 gallant officers mounted in the air  in this city there is an institution likely to be of extensive utility in providing for orphans and the sons of soldiers burdened with numerous families it is a military academy in which they are taught reading writing and accounts the manual exercise and every thing needful to qualify them for sergeants indeed the military establishments of every kind in this country appear respectable and mark at once wisdom and humanity in all their regulations the soldiers are enlisted for eight years during which they are indulged with frequent furloughs when they have served    years their pay goes on gradually increasing and after    years they retire with the rank of commissioned officers and a pension of about  0 pounds a year  in scrambling along the rocks says townsend i observed a track very strongly marked leading to a part of the fort where the walls are low this being at once the steepest and most rugged side of the mountain it surprised me much on my return i enquired into the nature and use of such a sequestered way and this was the result of my enquiries  the laws in many provinces of spain being peculiarly favorable to the fair sex if the wife complains of illtreatment from her husband he on her sole evidence is confined in prison and should she declare on oath that he had beaten her the punishment would be yet more severe he would be sent for many years to the presidios  when again a father is displeased with the conduct of his son if it be such as tends to bring either ruin or disgrace on his family the young man is sent to learn wisdom in retirement  it appears from the observations of the chief justice count compomanes in the appendix to his educacion popular that in spain many persons of quality are shut up in prison for these and similar offenses he states however not much to the honor of the spanish ladies that their accusations are not always just from him we may collect that a great number of these fair ones persuaded by their cortejos falsely charge their husbands with illtreatment whenever the good men show a disposition to be jealous  some young men of fashion at the request of their fathers or wives are as the governor informed me destined to pass their tedious hours in this castle yet by the connivance of the sentinels they are frequently in the dusk of the evening permitted to scale the walls when passing disguised into the city they amuse themselves among their friends till the company retires after which they return by the same solitary path to their destined habitations and this was precisely the path which had attracted my attention  in a conversation with the governor says the above writer on a mode of punishment long since inflicted in france and spain and lately adopted in our island that of employing criminals on public works he perfectly agreed with me that their labor is scarcely worth a tenth of what is expended on them and he further assured me that as far as his observation went this punishment rather tended to harden them in wickedness than produce a reformation in their manners he particularly mentioned that of about  000 convicts banished to the garrison of africa the major part on their discharge at the expiration of their terms returned to the eastern coast of the peninsula and to this circumstance he attributed the prevalence of the most atrocious crimes in that part of spain  the commerce of alicant consists in barilla antimony alum aniseed cummin and the wine so much esteemed in europe under the denomination of tent wine the fine alicant and tent wines are made in a very beautiful vale near this city studded with villages villas farms and plantations of all kinds of fruit trees only two of the great number of proprietors of vineyards make a practice of keeping their wines to a proper age as the value is enhanced manyfold by keeping the high price they get for their wines amply repays them for the time they are out of their money of the common sorts about  000 tuns may be the amount most of which is destined for the bourdeaux merchants  water is the great agent the primum mobile of all productions in this country every thing languishes and soon is parched up without an ample supply of it whenever a spring breaks out the kings people seize upon it and allot to each landholder a proper hour for letting the water into his grounds it is of so much consequence that a guinea has been paid for an hour extraordinary  chap vi of the people etc the lower class of men here wear while linen waistcoats trowsers which reach to the knees much resembling the highland fillebegs with net hair caps and sandals made of cord the women have no caps but plait their hair in a spiral figure and fasten it with a large silver pin in the same manner as those of bologna and naples  the inhabitants of this province says swinburne are said to have more of the filth sullen and unpolished manners of the old spaniards and to have adopted less of foreign improvements in civilization than most other parts of spain they strut about all day in monstrous hats and dark brown cloaks which give the crowd in the streets the appearance of a funeral procession scarce any society is kept up amongst them though the salubrity of the climate and reasons of economy induce several very considerable families to make this city speaking of alicant the place of their abode in some strange way or other they spend large incomes without doing themselves the least credit their chief expense lies in servants mules and equipages low obscene amors often consume the best part of their fortunes and they live in so pitiful a manner that most of them send to the wine vaults for a pint of wine to their meals  swinburnes interview with the old intendant of this province and the anecdote of his hardness of heart seem much of a piece with their general character our first morning at valencia says he passed very strangely in a visit to the intendant to whom we brought a letter of recommendation from his confrere in catalonia the old usurer whose figure resembled that of the bandy legged apothecary in hogarths marriage a la mode received us very ungraciously took our letter and flung it on the table without saying a single syllable to us or even offering us a seat having waited for some time we looked at each other and could not help smiling upon this the intendant looked up and asked if we were not catalonians no replied i we are english gentlemen on our travels this answer produced a wonderful effect oh oh you come from a better country can i be of any use to you bring these gentlemen chairs  do you choose to take any refreshment said he pulling off his hat and making us a profound bow we told him the only thing we stood in need of was protection against the people of the customs who were continually pestering us for money to drink or to buy tobacco with  the valencian says peyron is subtle false and mild in his manners he is the most idle and at the same time the most supple individual that exists all the tumblers and mountebanks of spain come from the kingdom of valencia  the lower class of people in this province are remarkable for their great superstition the coachmen and mule drivers carry constantly about with them the paw of a mole to secure their mules and horses against the mal de oios this says townsend i conceived at first to be the diseases of the eye but upon more accurate enquiry found myself mistaken and discovered that this expression meant the evil influence of witchcraft conveyed by looks in the southern provinces of spain as formerly throughout england and even now in cornwall children and common people universally agree in attributing necromantic powers to the female in each village who is the most deformed in person the most decrepit with old age and the most hagged in her looks in cornwall it is necessary for the witch to repeat thrice i wish but in spain one look conveys the fatal influence and the object unless relieved by a superior power may droop and die the proper amulets are the paw of a mole carried in the pocket a bit of scarlet cloth worn by men or the manesita fastened on the wrist of children the manesita is a little hand of jet ivory glass or stones set in silver with the thumb thrust out between the middle fingers but for want of these a person apprehending danger may immediately defend himself by the same position of his thumb for this reason whenever the fond mother observes an ugly hag looking steadfastly upon her child she screams out festa una siga that is thrust out the thumb in token of defiance this kind of superstition is by no means novel it may be traced as far back as the romans  the most prevalent disease in this part of spain is the intermittent fever arising here not from marsh miasmata but from the quantity of melons which the peasants eat and from their hard labor when exposed to the scorching sun  it is happy for the people they have another source of hope under the various diseases incident to the human frame besides the skill of their physicians a source of hope that never fails them at any season of distress thus for instance st anthony the abbot secures his votaries from fire and st anthony of padua delivers them from water st barbara is the refuge of the timid in times of thunder and war st blaso cures disorders of the throat st lucia heals all diseases of the eyes st nicholas is the patron of young women who desire to be married st ramon is their powerful protector during pregnancy and st lazaro assists them when in labor st polonia preserves the teeth st domingo cures the fever and st roque is the saint invoked under apprehensions of the plague and thus in all diseases under every pressure of affliction some saint is accessible by prayer whose peculiar province it is to relieve the object of distress  the physicians in this part of spain are disciples of their favorite doctor piquer who denied or at least doubted of the circulation of the blood they have labored under the greatest disadvantages in their education and want of encouragement when they entered upon practice receiving little money and less honor in the way of their profession in their medical classes they had no dissections no experiments in chemistry and for botany they were unacquainted with linnaeus these defects will now be remedied but even in the present day the fee of the physicians is very small being only twopence from the tradesman tenpence from the man of fashion and nothing from the poor some of the noble families agree with a physician by the year paying him annually fourscore reals that is    shillings for his attention on them and their families  one thing very singular required of surgeons and physicians in this country before they enter on their profession is that they are obliged to swear they will defend the immaculate conception of the virgin this requisition is the more extraordinary as that point is not universally agreed on even between catholics themselves to give weight to the sanction of an oath every country should purge away those which are become obsolete but more especially such as are universally looked upon as absurd  in traveling through this province says swinburne we are obliged to carry not only our beds but bread wine meat oil and even salt for nothing is to be met with in the inns but bare walls and perhaps a few eggs sold at an unconscionable price as much is asked for giving houseroom as would purchase a supper and good lodgings in the best inns of most parts of europe the mildness of the climate however obviates all inconveniences accruing from a total want of glass or even paper in the windows or of a door or shutter that can be fastened close enough to keep out the wind or rain  on arriving at one of these barns called ventas our first care is to set up our beds the kitchen is generally at one end the mules stand in the back part and our apartment is a partition run up against the wall to the street with a hole or two for lights  next our cook takes his stand at the hearth to warm our broth which we carry ready made together with the kettle that serves to heat it if he can procure fuel and elbow room he tosses up a hash or some such campaign dish sometimes we are lucky enough to have an opportunity of setting our spit or broiling a chop upon our gridiron but these are luxuries not to be expected above once or twice in the course of the week  in this province there is a new establishment taking place which does much honor to count florida blanca as contributing not only to the ease and comfort of the traveller but likewise to the safety of his person government is engaged in raising at the distance of every league a little cottage with a suitable garden as the habitation of a peon caminero who is to receive five reals a day for repairing the highways and protecting passengers and for this purpose he is furnished with all proper implements and with arms this institution is to be made general through all the provinces  the government of valencia is not distinguished from that of other provinces the captain general presides in the civil criminal and military courts and the intendant has the sole authority in matters of finance  taxes are heavy in valencia every thing entering the city even cloths made at madrid and silk for the manufacturers and all commodities without distinction pay eight per cent upon their value but the province at large is free from some oppressive contributions to which others continue subject paying about  0000 pounds as an equivalent for the provincial tents purveyance and forage for the army with the royal monopolies of brandy and salt to this commutation may in part be attributed the prosperous condition of the whole kingdom of valencia  chap vii province of arragon most of our modern travel writers seem to have passed by this province as not worthy of their notice townsend and baretti are the only travelers of late date who have given any account of it lying among the mountains other travelers have entered spain or taken their departure thence along the sea coasts either through the kingdom of navarre by the bay of biscay or by the province of catalonia on the mediterranean side indeed except the city of saragossa this province or kingdom appears to have little to attract the notice of a traveller  it is bounded on the west by navarre and castille to the south by valencia to the east by catalonia and to the north joins the pyrenean mountains its extent from north to south is about   0 miles but from east to west it does not measure above  00  the river ebro traverses the country from northwest to southeast so as to divide it into nearly two equal parts in its course it receives a number of lesser streams this province is notwithstanding dry and barren and some parts of it even uninhabited the soil is for the most part sandy and stony and the country mountainous so that where the rivers do not come or where water is not brought by art it produces nothing in those parts however that are well watered there is corn wine oil flax fruits and in some places saffron which constitute the whole riches of the country  the kingdom of arragon was reconquered from the moors by its own inhabitants before any of the other provinces as no prince in christendom then laid claim to it the arragonians chose a king for themselves instead however of making a noble present of their kingdom to the man whom they first raised to the throne the arragonians imposed such conditions on him as made it scarce worth his acceptance one of these conditions was that his authority should be controlled by a magistrate called el justicio who at his coronation was to address him in these words nos que valemos tanta como vos os hazemos necestro rey y senor con tal que guardeis nuestros fueros y libertades si no no i e we who think ourselves as good as you choose you for our king and lord on condition that you protect our laws and liberties if not we choose you not little was the acquaintance of the ancient arragonians with human nature in flattering themselves their kings would not show as much pride as they had done when it was in their power accordingly when the kings of arragon became more firmly seated in their throne they forced their subjects to forbear their irreverential coronation speech which exposed them to the laughter of their subjects in the very act of ascending the throne and made the will of the justicia subservient to their own for several ages this magistrate continued notwithstanding to have considerable sway but philip ii contrived to destroy it at one blow on the following occasion  philip who was one of the proudest and most cruel men that ever disgraced human nature had a secretary of state called antonio perez this perez was ordered by philip to put to death secretly an agent of his bastard brother john duke of austria not knowing how to evade complying with this cruel order perez caused the agent to be murdered by some ruffians in the streets of madrid  the relations of the deceased having discovered that perez was the perpetrator of this atrocious deed had him thrown into prison when his goods were confiscated and his arms dislocated by the rack without the king ever taking the least notice of his sufferings he often expostulated with his majesty by letters and had recourse to his confessor to prevail on the king to take pity of his torments and free him from his persecutors which he could have done with a single word but it was all in vain after many years imprisonment and torture he found means to escape from his prison and went to saragossa where the justicia well acquainted with his history took him under his protection the people of saragossa who knew that perez had acted by the kings express order approved of the protection granted him by their chief magistrate and resolved to stand by him at all events this exasperated the proud monarch who no longer dissembling the black transactions resolved on the death both of perez and the justicia together with an annihilation of all the ancient privileges of what he called his rebellious subjects  unfortunately he was able to carry his barbarous scheme immediately into execution he sent an army into arragon too powerful to be resisted by a tumultuous populace saragossa was soon taken and the justicia fell into the kings hands who had him executed instantly without any process together with a considerable number of the ringleaders  thus an end was put to the power of that magistrate and the arragonians deprived of their laws and liberties they have now been near two centuries as submissive to their kings as the rest of the spanish subjects and time which obliterates all things has at length utterly destroyed the remembrance of their fueros y libertades as to perez he had the good fortune to escape into france where he passed the remainder of his wretched life in that country he published some books from which the whole of that cruel transaction may be collected  saragossa is the capital of this province the phenicians who were the founders of this city called it salduba but a roman colony being sent thither by augustus gave it the name of caesarea or caesar augusta of which its present name is a manifest corruption this city stands in the midst of a very fertile and delightful plain on the river ebro the most considerable river in spain which has here two bridges one of stone the other of brick the town is large and handsome several of the streets are straight long and spacious especially the one called el cosso where the nobility and gentry resort in their coaches on fine evenings to take the air one coach following the other slowly up and down the street in procession no town in this kingdom except madrid abounds so much in nobility and rich gentry of whom about  00 it is said keep their coaches  there are    large churches with    splendid convents exclusive of lesser ones baretti remarks that it is the only city in europe which has two cathedrals here says townsend i forgot all the hardships and fatigues we had suffered on this long journey nay had i traveled all the way on foot i would have freely done it to enjoy the fight of these cathedrals that which is called el alseu is vast gloomy and magnificent it excites devotion inspires awe and inclines the worshipper to fall prostrate and adore in silence the god who seems to veil his glory the other called el pilar spacious lofty light elegant and cheerful inspires hope confidence complacency and makes the soul impatient to express its gratitude for benefits received  in the center of this cathedral there is an edifice strikingly beautiful the principal front is a chapel of our lady who appeared upon this pillar to st james and afterward gave him the image which is worshipped at her altar this image is very small but covered with a profusion of ornaments and costly jewels over this there is a dome corresponding to the great dome under which it stands serving by way of canopy to the image of the virgin the three other fronts of this elegant tabernacle are in like manner chapels besides the great dome there are many smaller domes surrounding it each with elegant paintings in compartments the subjects of which are historical taken from the sacred writings or from the legends of the saints to whom the chapels and altars are dedicated  the wealth of this cathedral is inestimable in silver gold precious stones and rich embroidery sent by all the catholic sovereigns of europe to deck its priests and to adorn its altars many of these presents being modern are worthy of attention for their elegance as well as for the value of their pearls diamonds emeralds and rubies in a word whatever wealth could command or human art could execute has been collected to excite the admiration of all who view the treasures of this church  the university contains near  000 students and for their instruction the doctors constantly residing are  0 in theology  0 for the canon law    for civil law    for medicine and eight for arts the foundation of this seminary was laid in      on the expulsion of the moors but it was not incorporated till      and from that period it has been constantly cherished and protected by the sovereigns of arragon  near this city passes the famous canal of arragon designed to form a communication by the ebro from sea to sea between st ander in the bay of biscay and tortosa on the borders of the mediterranean a distance considerably more than  00 spanish leagues or above  00 english miles this perhaps is one of the most arduous undertakings that ever was conceived to make the communication through this whole extent by water is hardly possible or if possible is by no means desirable because in passing the mountains of biscay which are a continuation of the pyrenees only from reinosa at the head of the ebro to the suanzes which flows into the bay near st ander in the space of three leagues the fall is  000 spanish feet the expense of this canal appears enormous townsend estimates it at between eleven and   000 pounds per mile about  0 miles appear to have been completed when he visited this country in      i must confess says he i never saw any so beautiful or so perfect in their kind as the locks and wharfs nor did i ever see men work with greater spirit or in a better manner the number of men employed was  000 of which  000 were soldiers the others peasants to the former they gave three reals a day in addition to their pay but they work mostly by the piece and receive what they earn the canals in spain are nine feet deep  0 feet wide at bottom and    at top  by means of the boats on the ebro there is at present an easy communication with the mediterranean the town of course carries on no very inconsiderable trade the number of inhabitants is said to amount to little short of  0000  the cities having nothing further to attract the attention of our readers we shall now give some idea of the character of this people as described by one of their ancient canons in saragossa as in all other great towns wicked people are not rare but they are much more rare than at madrid and the great seaports the air of the court is alas pestilential to many nor does that of the sea prove much better and the reason is evident but at court and at seaports men ride in a manner on the whirlwinds of interest and ambition which two passions are by our moralists aptly termed los dos cuernos mas grandes del demonio the devils two biggest horns but in our inland province the greatest part of the inhabitants are rustics employed in the innocent occupations of the field who living by the product of uninterrupted labor cannot be so vicious as those whom court favor or commerce often enriches with rapidity throughout this province life is passed in the greatest simplicity and uniformity people generally rise early and continue their work the day through with scarce any intermission but as soon as the sun is gone down both sexes join every where to dance and sing with such enthusiasm that they appear when beginning to grow warm as if bereft of their senses and this practice is so general not only in this but in most of our provinces that were it possible to see the whole kingdom at once when daylight has disappeared much the greater part of its inhabitants would be seen briskly shaking their heels to the sound of their instruments and voices old men and little children not excepted provided they have but sufficient vigor in their legs  i know says the venerable canon that the french have long reproached us with pride and enmity to labor they tell each other of the swords worn by our peasants even when following the plough and how solicitous they are to show them that they may be thought gentlemen we are laughed at for hanging even the walls of our cottages with our genealogies and that our most insignificant hidalgos should think themselves as nobly descended as the king but it is not true that our low people hang their walls with their pedigrees it is not true that our peasants wear swords nor is it true that our hidalgos of any class think themselves as noble as the king  as to our pretended aversion for labor all will work who can in the same proportion as the people of other countries should they cease to work they would soon starve as our rivers run not with milk and honey any more than the rivers of other countries it may be objected there are spacious tracts of desert land in this province but if those lands lie uncultivated the fault is not to be attributed to the inhabitants how can we cultivate land where there is no water water is the great parent of vegetation without it both sun and land become nearly useless for the purpose of agriculture but water cannot be created by men and where we have none the land must lie just as it is this province abounds more in streams than new castille it is therefore more fertile catalonia is still more so than this province is as the nearer we advance toward the sea the running streams become more numerous and have a sufficient declivity to facilitate branching them out artificially and spreading them wherever it may be judged proper will it be concluded from such accidental circumstances that the catalans are more industrious than the arragonians or the arragonians more addicted to labor than the new castillians  i repeat it again adds this venerable canon that the arragonians have as few vices as any people on the earth gluttony and ebriety are words to which they annex the most hateful ideas they are not idle when they can avoid it they are not such liars as the low people among the french they are not addicted to stealing and have the reputation throughout spain of making the best servants they are not quarrelsome but live in peace and affection with their neighbors one proof of their not being vicious is their early marriages nor do they swerve easily from conjugal fidelity when once bound in wedlock even the muledrivers who are incessantly traveling to madrid are true to their wives and it is their chief ambition to throw into their laps a piece of gold earned by their journey the moment they reenter their houses  i will not say that this character is applicable to all the lower classes throughout the kingdom and that some of the numberless arieros cannot get drunk swear profane oaths and have something to say to every wench in the posadas those of valencia and galicia are said to be very wicked and as such we see them often represented upon our stage but allowance must be always made for notions of this kind which often have their source in prejudice pique and other causes not easily traced to their origin  the galicians and valencians speak dialects sounding very disagreeably to the ears of the castillians and of us says the canon who speak nearly castillian and it has been remarked that the difference in speech is often sufficient to raise an antipathy between the several parts of a nation and induce one to depreciate censure and hate the other  having now pretty fully described the cities manners and customs of the different provinces which formed part of the ancient kingdom of arragon we shall enter upon those which formerly made part of the kingdom of castille beginning first with the province of new castille in which is madrid the present seat of government and the capital of the whole kingdom  chap viii of the province of new castille castille is the principal and most opulent kingdom in all spain it is generally divided into the old and new the former having been recovered from the moors long before the latter new castille of which in regard to the order of situation we shall speak first is by some called also the kingdom of toledo being the center of the monarchy and the residence of the monarch it is divided on the north by a chain of mountains from old castille and a like chain divides it also eastward from arragon and valencia on this side it borders upon murcia to the south it is likewise separated by a chain of hills from andalusia and westward bounded by estramadura its greatest extent from east to west is about   0 miles and its length from north to south above  00 the tagus guadiana and guadalquivir have already been said to receive their sources in this province the first two run from northeast to southwest quite through it and greatly improve its natural fertility the other rivers of note in this province are the xucar which makes its way through valencia into the mediterranean the xarama which falls into the tagus and the guadarama which likewise loses itself in the same river below toledo  there is a cinnabar mine in the southern part of this province which according to bowls in his natural history of spain is the richest of the kind yet found the most curious for its properties and one of the most ancient that has ever been worked the church and a great part of the village of almadan near which it is situated and containing upwards of  00 houses were built from the produce of the cinnabar and all the inhabitants subsist by the mine the exhalation of the mercury is not dangerous to men animals or plants as has generally been alleged the galleyslaves sent to work the mine are robust and healthy though several of them are wicked enough to feign being ill of the palsy each of these slaves costs the state  0 pence a day and there is not a labourer in almaden who has not offered to do more work for half the price five or  000 quintals of mercury are annually produced from this mine a part of which is used in extracting silver from the mines of mexico  new castille was formerly governed by earls the last of whom dying without male issue in  0   bequeathed his dominions to his sister married to the king of navarre who raised this province to a kingdom ferdinand king of leon succeeded to it on the demise of henry of castille and in      both kingdoms became united in his person but the last and permanent union of the kingdoms of castille and arragon was by the marriage of ferdinand prince of arragon with isabella queen of castille  having now given a general view of this province we shall treat of its principal cities which are madrid and toledo together with the royal palaces situated in the environs of the former as likewise of the private life manners and customs of the inhabitants and of whatever else we can find worthy of notice in the different writers who have visited spain  plan of the city of madrid references   b  palace   n t oven

the city of madrid madrid the capital of the kingdom was long only an obscure town belonging to the archbishops of toledo but while so many flourishing and illustrious cities enjoying every advantage of situation have sunk into deserted villages this town built in a sterile and ungrateful soil has become one of the finest cities in europe  on approaching madrid nothing announces to the traveller that he is near the capital of the spanish monarchy the inns within two leagues of this city are equally dirty and destitute of all conveniences with those in every other part of the kingdom the soil appears barren and without either trees or verdure but on arriving at the banks of the manzanares a magnificent stone bridge built by philip ii notifies the vicinity of the royal residence a french traveller has made himself very merry at the expense of this bridge and cracked some jests on its disproportion to the water that runs beneath but frenchmen like other people will easily catch at opportunities of being censorious in foreign countries the fact is that the manzanares becomes at times a considerable river by the sudden melting of the snow on the neighboring hills and is in winter often half a mile in breadth philip therefore acted very properly in building a spacious bridge over it and ridiculous are those who pretend to ridicule him on this account this small river the manzanares says bourgoanne runs at some distance under the heights upon which madrid is situated it is almost shallow enough for carriages to ford over it has however two great bridges that of segovia and that of toledo it was of this latter that among other witticisms it was pleasantly said that fine bridge only wanted a river in passing through spain several others are met with upon which the same observations may be made the reason of which is that spain is intersected in almost every direction by long chains of mountains whose summits notwithstanding the heat of the climate are frequently covered with snow the rivulets and little rivers descending from their sides have usually but a small stream of water because droughts are frequent in the provinces through which they run but when abundant rains or the melting of the snow increase their little streams their beds are more extended from their not being very deep and carrying with them a large quantity of sand and according to these circumstances although they do not often occur the dimensions of the bridges are calculated they are solidly constructed owing to the impetuous torrents that occasionally come down and their apparent disproportionate length is to obviate the evils which might arise from their overflowing  this city stands in the center of a large plain terminated on all sides by mountains it is situated in        0 longitude of the isle of ferro and       latitude the first king that made any long abode in madrid was henry iv before his reign this was but an insignificant place with a small castle for the convenience of princes that came to hunt in the environs which were then as woody as they are now naked its situation on a rising ground overlooking many leagues of country open on every side to a wholesome circulation of air and abundance of good water induced the emperor charles v to build an ample palace here which he intended to make his chief residence as he thought the climate best adapted to his constitution the sovereign once fixed at madrid the nobility soon abandoned their hereditary castles and houses in other cities to follow the court  if we except the royal palaces says swinburne there are few buildings worthy of attention nor do i believe there is in europe a capital that has so little to show as madrid having never been the sea of a bishop it has of course no cathedral nor indeed any church that distinguishes itself much from the common herd of parishes and convents allowing some few exceptions we may safely pronounce the outward architecture of them to be barbarous and their manner of ornamenting the inside as bad as that of the worst ages most of them were erected or retouched during the term of years that elapsed between the middle of the   th century and the year      a period in the history of spain when all arts and sciences were fallen to the lowest ebb of depravity the effects of a total degeneracy of manners and want of public spirit these vices in the political system of the three last princes of the austrian line could not be immediately removed on the accession of another family the wars that shook the very foundations of their throne during the first ten years of this century kept all polite arts grovelling in the dust and when they again raised their heads and ventured to court the favor of their sovereigns there seems to have been a total want of able professors to second their efforts no mad architect ever dreamed of a distortion of members so capricious of a twist of pillars cornices and pediments so wild and fantastic but what a real sample of it may be produced in some or other of the churches of madrid they are all small and as poor in marbles as they are in pictures their altars are piles of wooden ornaments heaped up to the cieling and stuck round with wax lights which more than once have set fire to their churches the convents which may be said to possess any good pictures are those of st pasqual and the barefooted carmelite nuns the former has a fine titian a capital guerchino and many other pictures by the most esteemed italian masters in the sacristy of the latter is a numerous collection of paintings by various hands many of which are of superior merit the tombs of ferdinand vi and his queen barbara in the church of the visitation are almost the only sepulchral monuments of any consequence  as to the churches in madrid says baretti they are not in general so magnificent as one might expect to find them in a country so much renowned for the piety of its inhabitants most of them are strangely decorated with ornaments not admitted into the churches of other countries their walls are frequently covered with small and trifling works of the pencil or chissel hung up without any order or symmetry in that which belongs to the padres de la merced there is a large drawer containing a variety of toys and baubles the gifts of persons repenting their attachment for trifles and presented as an offering to a small waxen image of our savior in the drawer amongst other singularities is a large fragment of a plumcake presented as they say by a lady who thought herself too fond of sweetmeats and a muslin apron given by another who caught herself in a fit of pride the first time she put it on these ladies fell upon this expedient to atone for their childish vanities  the most magnificent church in madrid is that of the salesian nuns this church with its fine convent was built by queen barbara remarkable for little else than her fondness for music and her devotion this passion for music caused her to bestow little short of  000 pounds a year on the celebrated farinelli who was her chief favorite for many years and to whom among other things she bequeathed all her musical instruments and one of the largest collections of music that was perhaps ever made this is the only church in madrid in which the ornaments are not overloaded and childish the altars here are not as in the other churches decked out with nosegays of natural and artificial flowers nor are they hung round with little cages of canary birds which keep singing all day long to the no small edification of those who go to hear masses in the morning or to receive their benedictions in the evening there are however many costly decorations in this church the most remarkable exclusive of the royal monument is a silver lamp hanging by three long silver chains which altogether are said to weigh above   0 pounds in the sacristy are some surplices of very fine flanders lace which are supposed to have cost near  000 pounds each  the churches in madrid have neither pews benches nor chairs their floors are covered with straw mats upon which the men and women kneel promiscuously without any distinction whether they be grandees or cobblers duchesses or washerwomen the men will often stand during the mass but the women sit negligently on their heels holding their rosaries in their hands and telling their beads in a whispering voice and with a most rapid motion of their lips  at intervals says townsend i walked about the town to obtain some general idea of it before i descended to particulars in my own mind i divided the whole into three portions corresponding to three periods easy to be distinguished the most ancient is nearest to the river manzananes with narrow and contracted streets crooked lanes and blind alleys like those still visible in london but more especially in paris where no extensive conflagration has consumed the rude monuments of art erected by the remote progenitor who inhabited the infant city to the north and to the east of this as we remove further from the river the streets are wider and the buildings affect some degree of symmetry this portion including the plaza mayor or square which in its day must have been a striking object terminates at the puerta del sol but when philip ii removed his court and madrid became the capital of his vast empire the great nobility erected palaces beyond the former limits and the puerta del sol is now the center of the whole  it is curious to trace the origin of cities the shepherd pitches his tent or builds his mudwall cottage by the river side because he cannot afford to sink a well but man being a gregarious animal others for the comfort of society or mutual protection resort to the same spot and build as near to him as possible cottages increase tillage succeeds manufactures follow and the inhabitants advancing in number and wealth wish to enlarge their habitations but the ground being occupied they have no other choice but to raise their houses higher whilst inhabiting the humble cottage they never complained of the want of light or of air but now that they shut out the light from each other they wonder their ancestors should have cramped themselves thus for want of room  madrid has    parishes between seven and  000 houses   0000 inhabitants    convents    colleges    hospitals five prisons and    gates built of granite most of which are elegant  almost all the streets in the court part of the town are straight wide clean and well paved in walking about the town says twiss i observed the names of the streets painted on the corner houses the houses numbered and lamps before them the same as in the streets of london the paving is as regular and neat as it is possible to conceive and the streets kept so clean that none are to be met with more so not even in the cities of holland whereas ten years ago madrid might have vied with edinburgh in its former state for filth  the principal street is the call de alcala which is broad enough for  0 coaches a breast and of a very considerable length there are also some very beautiful squares particularly the plaza mayor which deserves notice for its spaciousness and regularity and the elegant and lofty houses it contains it is      feet in circuit the houses of which there are in this square     are five stories high ornamented with balconies the first of which supported by pillars forms a piazza round the square where the inhabitants may walk under cover  there are  0 public fountains in this city most of them are magnificent though ornamented in an ill taste the water in all of them is excellent it was this purity of the air and excellence of the water which induced philip ii and his successors to fix their residence in this city it should have been premised that notwithstanding there are    gates this city has neither fortifications ditches nor even walls its form is rather circular and the circumference about six miles  the kings new palace is perhaps the grandest and most sumptuous of any in europe it is situated on an eminence commanding a delightful prospect of the river manzananes and the country beyond it at a distance from its standing alone and on an eminence without either terrace park or garden it has rather the appearance of a citadel than a place of residence for one of the most powerful monarchs in the universe but this first impression is soon dissipated as we approach nearer i have seen says twiss the palaces of the kings of england france sardinia naples prussia and portugal those of the pope the emperor and several german princes and indisputably give the preference to this it is impossible says townsend to view it without the most exquisite delight the palace presents four fronts each of   0 feet in length and  00 feet in height up to the cornice enclosing a quadrangle of   0 feet these fronts are relieved by numerous pillars and pilastres and over the cornice is a balustrade to hide the leaden roof the north front has five stories besides the entresolo and underground apartments  within the balustrade on pedestals are placed a series of the kings of spain from ataulfo to fernando vi the plan is somewhat singular on the principal floor is a suit of apartments large and elegant which communicate all round the palace receiving light from the fronts and enclosing rooms for the domestics which have light from a spacious gallery within this gallery runs all round the quadrangle over an open portico or piazza and is covered by a terrace  the foundation of this edifice which is all of white stone was laid in the year      three years after the old palace had been consumed by fire and to prevent the like accident in future the whole is upon arches  there is no palace in europe fitted up with so much true royal magnificence the beauty and grandeur of the upper apartments are astonishing the cielings are chef doeuvres of mengs corrado and tiepolo the richest marbles are employed with great taste in forming the cornices and socles of the rooms and the frames of the doors and windows what enhances the value of these marbles is their being all produced in the quarries of spain from whence it is the opinion of a learned writer that ancient rome was hence supplied with many of the precious materials that enriched her porticos and temples at least it is certain that the bowels of the earth in spain contain most of those species of marbles alabasters etc that are to be seen in the ruins of the mistress of the world porphyry is found near cordova the finest jasper near aracena the mountains of granada furnish a beautiful green those of tortosa a variety of brown marble leon and malaga send alabaster toledo and murviedro abound in marble of different colors and most parts of the kingdom afford some specimens of jasper besides the amethyst and its radix for which spain is celebrated above most countries  the leading feature in this palace is the audience chamber sallon de los reynos which is a double cube of  0 feet hung round with crimson velvet and which with its sumptuous canopy and painted roof makes a most magnificent appearance the ceiling painted by tiepolo represents the triumph of spain round the cornice the artist has placed allegorical figures of its different provinces distinguished by their productions and attended by their several inhabitants in their provincial habits these form a most uncommon picture and curious set of costumi the walls are incrustrated with beautiful marble and all around hung with large plates of lookingglass in rich frames  it is not possible to view the apotheosis of hercules in the hall of conversation and of trajan in the kings dining room without feeling the most singular pleasure and delight in the execution of these pieces mengs exerted all his powers and seems to have found no difficulty in uniting ease with elegance in these two delightful pictures we cannot readily determine which to admire most his designs his lights and shades his coloring his invention or his composition in the antichamber is a capital picture by velasquez representing philip iii philip iv their two wives and olivarez all on horseback i doubt says townsend whether five such horses so perfect and so full of animation were ever seen together the horse of philip iv rises from the canvas and seems so much like real life that if properly placed an acute eye might be easily deceived there is also in the audiencechamber a descent from the cross by mengs which according to connoisseurs is his best production the color of the dead body says bourgoanne has been frequently criticized this christ say they seems to be of stone i was induced adds the above writer to think the same until one day accompanying some foreigners who adopted the criticism i heard one of them exclaim with transport in commendation of the truth of the coloring surely said he in a low voice this painter must have seen many dead bodies to have been able to imitate them so well the author of the above reflection was an eminent surgeon who till that moment had not opened his lips on the subject the critics were silent and we recollected the ancient proverb ne sulor ultra crepidam  the greatest part of the large and capital collection of pictures in this palace which it would be tedious to enumerate have been successively brought over in former times by the spanish governors of naples flanders and milan which accounts for their surprising number these pictures afterward fell into the hands of the kings of spain and were they now collected and hung up the collections in the luxemburg and palais royal galleries would make no figure in comparison with them nor must we omit to the disgrace of our own country that there are in this kings possession some belonging to the unfortunate charles i which were vilely sold to spain by his rebellious subjects besides the above collections the emperor charles v invited over to spain the illustrious titian who has left both in madrid and the escurial more capital pictures than any of his at venice  the royal chapel belonging to this palace is said to be more magnificent than that of versailles in the organloft there are  0 different missals containing whatever is sung there throughout the year by a very numerous band of the kings musicians these missals are all as large as the largest atlas their leaves of vellum all nobly bound and rolling on brass pullies fixed to their bottoms that they may easily be taken from their shelves and replaced what contributes more particularly to the decoration of this chapel are    columns of black marble extending to the frieze  the courtyard of the palace is surrounded by a grand portico and so very spacious that  0 coaches might wheel round it at the same instant without much obstructing each other on the outside of the great gate and along the principal front of the edifice are placed on high pedestals eight pedestrian statues some of which represent those among the ancient roman emperors who were natives of spain these statues are of that size called heroical  at the end of the square is a large edifice not sufficiently seen which contains a curious collection of ancient and foreign arms arranged with great order and carefully preserved this is called the armeria or arsenal the most remarkable curiosities here are neither scymeters set with diamonds nor complete sets of armor but those of ancient american warriors the most conspicuously placed is the armor of montezuma some suits of spanish armor are embossed with great nicety the temper of the swordblades placed in this armory is quite wonderful for they may be lapped round the waist like a girdle the art of tempering steel in toledo was lost about  0 years ago and the project of reviving it was one of the favorite schemes of the late king who has erected proper works for it on the banks of the tagus  this palace was built by sacchetti an eleve of juvara the famous sicilian who left so many specimens of his art in and about turin the reason of its having been erected on sacchettis and not juvaras plan is an anecdote singular in its kind and not much known in the year      after the ancient palace was burnt down the king wanting another and being told juvara was the most esteemed architect of the age sent for him on juvaras arrival at madrid he was ordered to make a model while he was employed on it the kings second wife who managed her husband as she pleased began to think of a war that she might procure a settlement for her son charles in italy instead therefore of having the several millions destined for this purpose laid out in building she determined they should be applied to prosecuting her own plans  this scheme of the queens it may readily be imagined juvara was not to be made acquainted with nor was he politician enough to guess at it he hastened to compose his model the queen herself affecting to solicit the completion of it  the model took time in forming but when it was brought to the king for his approbation his minister who was entrusted with the secret represented to his majesty that juvara had contrived a habitation too small for a spanish monarch and insisted on the architect giving a plan more proportionate to the grandeur of its future inhabitants  philip was the dupe of patinos the ministers name flattering objection especially as the queen declared for the same opinions nor was juvara himself displeased to hear it was their majesties intention he should go to the utmost of his powers and plan a palace more proportionate to his own great abilities and the monarchs treasures  within three years juvara produced another model so very grand that he was sure no objection could be raised against it on account of its size or magnificence and he had the momentary satisfaction to hear himself praised by the whole court for the loftiness of his ideas but on calculating the expense which amounted to more than  0000000 sterling the queen and her confidant raised the obvious objection that the finances of the king could not compass so much a third plan was therefore to be thought of that kept equally distant from the littleness of the first and the greatness of the second  to remonstrate would have been useless but while he was thus busy the war that had been long hatching broke out the spanish doubloons began to flow into italy and juvara with his plans were neglected scarce was he suffered to open his lips about building when he appeared at court if he dared to show his drawings to the king patino raised so many difficulties that the poor architect at last died of a broken heart probably to the great joy of the crafty minister who had long spirited him up to be very grand in his second model  soon after juvaras death the king who was bent on having a palace enquired if he had left any disciples capable of making use of their masters designs the king of sardinia it was answered had two and sacchetti being reckoned the best he was sent for to spain where he made the model of the present palace which was approved and as the war was approaching to its end soon after begun  the finishing and fitting up of this palace has in all probability saved the capital from ruin by fixing the court to this spot the king intended to have removed it for ever to seville and the southern provinces after the sedition in madrid when the populace rose in consequence of the order for cleaning the streets and prohibiting slouched hats and large cloaks his surprise resentment and indignation would certainly have induced him to quit for ever so barbarous a metropolis had not his minister unwilling that so much money should be lavished to no purpose in improving the palaces in castille prevailed on his royal master to conquer his anger and alter his determination it is very remarkable that during the greatest ferment of the sedition all parties retired as if by mutual consent about dinnertime to take their usual nap or meridian after which they returned to the charge with fresh vigor and redoubled fury resumed their clamours and repeated their outrages the military force finally quelled the tumult and the king carried his point every blackguard now loiters about with his hat pinned up triangularly but the moment he gets out of town and beyond the bounds of the proclamation indulges himself in flapping it down on all sides  the palace of the buen retiro is a pleasant retreat situated upon an eminence at the extremity of the city is a vast pile of buildings very ancient and verging to decay it contains some spacious apartments in which there still remains a few good pictures but the three things says townsend which gave most satisfaction were the theater the grand saloon and the equestrian statue of philip iv this statue cast by pedro tacca from a painting of velasquez and said to weigh nine tons is supported by the hind legs alone i never saw nor can conceive any thing more perfect or which appears so animated as this prodigy of art the theater is vast and opens into the gardens so as to make them upon occasion a continuation of the scene here ferdinand vi frequently amused the public with operas with which his queen was so extravagantly fond  the great saloon called el salon with its antichamber painted in fresco by jordano remains a monument of his taste invention judgment and imitative powers in the principal compartment of the roof is represented hercules giving the golden fleece to philip the good duke of burgundy in a subordinate compartment pallas and the gods are seen subduing the titans answering to which the majesty of spain appears ruling the terrestrial globe the rest is filled up with allegorical figures finely expressed the antichamber contains the conquest of granada from the great saloon we go to the garden by a little oval cabinet covered entirely with lookingglass in the ceiling of which is represented the birth of the sun with people of all nations worshipping the rising deity whilst the priests are engaged in offering sacrifices this likewise is by jordano in one of the apartments seldom shown to foreigners are models of strong places among these the two most striking are cadiz and gibraltar  to a stranger the situation of buenretiro appears preferable for a royal residence to that in which the new palace stands but there may be perhaps objections which do not present themselves to the transient observer the gardens of this palace are extensive and have a pleasing variety of wood and water they are at present open to the public the late monarch established a china manufacture in them which as yet strangers have not been permitted to inspect its productions are to be seen no where but in the palace of the sovereign or in some italian courts to which they have been sent as presents some particular kinds of inlaid work not much known in europe are likewise carried on there  this ancient palace likewise commands a public walk which has long been famous in spanish comedy and romance at first indeed these alone gave it celebrity in the place itself there was nothing remarkable its reputation arose from what passed in it measures were then concerted to elude the vigilance of a mother or jealousy of a husband the courtiers escaped perhaps from the presence of a monarch came thither to watch a rival prepare a plot or disconcert an intrigue the proximity of the palace the obscurity and inequality of the ground were all favorable for these purposes the prado was a rendezvous equally convenient for ambition and malignity but more especially for love those who appeared there had generally some sinister design or were encountering some hazard but charles iii by levelling it planted it with trees admitting more light into the alleys ornamenting it with statues and vases and providing water to allay the dust has now made it a most elegant walk which may be frequented in all seasons with safety and pleasure it forms a part of the interior of the city and is in length nearly two miles several of the principal streets terminate here that of alcala the widest in europe crosses it runs by the side of the gardens of the retiro and terminates at the gate of the same name which as we have already observed is one of the finest pieces of architecture in the capital and built in the late reign in       the inhabitants from all quarters resort hither on foot or in carriages to meet and breathe beneath the shade of long alleys an air freshened by water spouted from the fountains and embalmed by exhalations from the fragrant flowers the concourse of people is frequently prodigious there may be sometimes seen between four and  00 carriages filing off in the greatest order amidst an innumeraable crowd of spectators a spectacle at once a proof of great opulence and population  townsend notices a very singular ceremony he saw practiced on the walk the coaches says he were numerous and the walls were crowded all was in motion when suddenly about eight in the evening on the tolling of a bell i was much surprised to see all motion cease every coach stood still every hat was off and every lip seemed to utter prayer this i afterward found to be the custom all over spain if the affections of the heart correspond with the external signs of piety in spain and if the moral conduct answers to the affections of the heart this people must be the most heavenly minded and the most virtuous upon earth but all is not gold that glitters and i had soon an opportunity of forming a conjecture that all who thus moved the lip were not among the warmest friends of piety and virtue when the prayer was over the coaches began to move slowly on once more but soon after this went briskly off and the multitude dispersing left a number of young women attended by young men who from that time seemed to be more at ease yet kept within the bounds of decency  swinburne in his account of this famous walk says it is situated in the shallow vale between the retiro and the town which has not the least suburb of any kind belonging to it its length and breadth are great the avenues drawn in an intelligent noble style the footpaths wide and neat the iron railing and stone seats done in a grand and expensive manner the view from this walk is as it should be confined for the winds are so sharp and boisterous and the landscape so horrid all round the city that no place of public resort like this could be comfortable unless it were shut in from all distant views and sheltered by hills from the blasts that sweep over the high lands of castille  to the west it has the town the three principal streets of which as we have already remarked terminate in the prado there are three noble openings excellently paved and clean even to a nicety indeed so are most of the streets since the edict for paving and cleaning them the foreigners residing here before that period shudder at the very recollection of its filth some of the natives indeed regret the old stinks and nastiness pretending that the air of madrid is so subtle as to require a proper mixture of grosser effluvia to prevent its pernicious effects upon the constitution  till of very late years there were no privies in madrid but the king determined to cleanse the place ordered that privies should be built in every house the physicians remonstrated against it saying that the smell softened the air and deprived it of those noxious vapors that would be injurious to health this however would not do but lest their food should imbibe these noxious vapors the people one and all placed their privies by the kitchen fireside  the extremes of heat and cold are astonishing in this place and the winds so searching that all the spaniards wear leather under waistcoats to preserve their chests for they pervade every other kind of clothing  the botannical garden adds not a little to the embellishment of the prado it was formerly on the road leading from madrid to the castle of pardo but the late king removed it a few years since to the side of the prado and surrounded it with a low enclosure by which it is ornamented without being hid this monarch endeavored to make it one of the most precious collections of the kind by laying under contribution all the vegetable kingdom of his dominions some part of which it has been long said is continually warmed by the rays of the sun which in such different soils and climates must alone produce every kind of tree shrub and plant which grows on the bosom of the earth  while viewing the prado says bourgoanne i have frequently given the greatest latitude possible to this idea i have even extended it to the animal kingdom i have allotted in imagination a space which the botanical garden leaves vacant by the side of the walk to a destination certainly singular in europe and which the monarch of spain only is capable of carrying into effect i divided it into as many parts as this sovereign has principal colonies under his dominions in these i settled in supposition a family of peruvians another of mexicans another from california another from louisiana another from paraguay from buenos aynes the coast of caracas from porto rico from cuba from the canaries and the philippines all to preserve their peculiar dress and manner of living to erect a simple habitation upon the model of the one they had quitted and to cultivate the plants brought from their own country so that surrounded by these pleasing illusions they might still suppose themselves in their native soil here the mexican would be seen beneath the shade of his own fig tree shaking it and gathering the precious spoils which color our european garments there the inhabitant of guatimala would cultivate his indigo and he of paraguay the herb which constitutes his principal riches the native of soconusco would attempt to naturalize his valuable cocoatree in a foreign soil the peruvian accompanied by the docile animal which partakes of his labors feeds and clothes him would in concert with the luconian endeavor to introduce the same cultivation they had been accustomed to at home thus the exulting inhabitant of the metropolis without going from the capital might pass in review as if delineated on a map all the colonies to which his sovereign gives laws the transported colonist would become accustomed to an exile which every thing would concur to render pleasing and his fellow citizens separated from him by immense sea on being informed of the benevolence and magnificence of their common monarch would form a higher idea of his power pride themselves upon being his subjects and become more attached to his government  such a project may be considered as romantic yet the king of spain has entered upon one of the same kind which proves his zeal for the advancement of the arts and sciences in the street of the alcala is a large building in which he has established a cabinet of natural history which already contains one of the completest collections in europe in metals minerals marble precious stones corals and marine plants the collection of the king of spain says townsend is truly magnificent but far from being well chosen or well arranged for intrinsic value in silver gold and precious stones perhaps no cabinet can equal it  the specimen which most attracted my attention says the above writer was a large rock containing  0 emeralds in the form of hexagonal prisms some near an inch diameter and one inch and an half in length and many of them of the finest water without the least appearance of a flaw  the animals are beautiful and in high preservation  the cabinet of natural history is accessible to all there is no need to wait for tickets but at the appointed hours any person who is decent in his appearance is admitted to walk round the rooms and examine what he pleases as long as the doors are open if he is peculiarly devoted to one branch of natural history he is not hurried away from that by the gaping multitude and compelled to spend the allotted portion of his time in apartments which contain nothing to his purpose  the foundation of this collection was laid by m davila but it is said that after he had published his much admired catalogue the best of the specimens were picked and culled and the refuse only carried to the king who made the purchase and appointed him first director of his cabinet  this science is almost new in europe sir hans sloane led the way in england buffon followed in france and davila has brought up the rear it is but of late years that the sovereigns of europe have taken it under their protection england set the example and spain has followed it  the same edifice that contains this cabinet and which with the customhouse built also by charles iii constitutes the principal ornament of the street of the alcala is the place of meeting for the academy of the fine arts a circumstance which occasioned the inscription on the front of the building a motto equally happy and just  carolus iii naturam and artem sub uno tecto consociavit  charles iii associated art and nature under one roof  the honor of instituting this academy is howeever due to philip v but it has received great encouragement from his two successors  this academy of the arts like that we have described at barcelona is open to the whole world and every thing provided at the kings expense there are three other academies the spanish academy founded in      in imitation of the french academy the first object of which was the compilation of a dictionary of the spanish language published in six volumes folio the academy of history which owes its origin to a society of individuals the object of whose meetings was to preserve and illustrate the historical monuments of the kingdom of spain the academy of medicine is held in no great esteem  if the pleasing arts are cultivated at madrid the most useful of all that of beneficence is not neglected charitable foundations worthy to be models to every nation are found in that city there are three hospitals which in the course of the year      received       patients the principal or general hospital for men as it is called has been lately rebuilt it contains no less than  000 iron beds distributed through several large rooms and long galleries it is a rule here to receive every one who comes at any hour of the day or night nor is any solicitation requested to obtain admittance there are even porters belonging to the hospital whose only business it is to go and fetch every sick person who sends for them and at the gate of the hospital there is always a physician in waiting to enquire into the complaint of every patient who comes and to order him immediately into the proper ward accordingly  as i stood at the gate says baretti an old man was brought there in a kind of covered sedan this physician lifted up the head of the chair and put this blunt question to him tiene usted gallico have you the foul disease it surprised me not a little to hear the shameless sexagenarian answer in the affirmative with the clearest tone of voice and the greatest tranquillity of countenance imaginable wandering about the different apartments i could not but take notice of their great cleanness i enquired of several sick men about the treatment they met with and was pleased with their answers among the several articles of diet each patient is allowed a large dish of chocolate every morning by way of breakfast with a slice of bread or a sweet biscuit this appears a remarkable singularity nor are they stinted in point of food when they begin to recover except the physicians are very positive in their orders to the contrary  it is not the custom here to support any hospital by voluntary contributions incessantly collected from the people as in england in this country each hospital has an income arising from lands and other kinds of property various confradias have an eye over them the principal nobility do not disdain to be members of these societies they visit the hospitals by turns audit the accounts and take care that no part of the income is embezzled or mismanaged the church grants some indulgencies for these pious deeds and this seems to be all the recompense they wish for their trouble  among these confradias there is one called la santa hermandad the holy brotherhood or more commonly la confradia de pan y huevos the brotherhood of bread and eggs a number of its members preceded generally by some considerable nobleman ramble about the streets of madrid every night in order to collect the houseless of both sexes who lay themselves down to sleep under the porches of churches or the entrances of houses the santa hermandad take up all those they find in this pitiable situation carry them to some hospital to sleep and give them the next morning a penny loaf with a couple of eggs for their breakfast from which practice is derived their appellation if these poor are in health they are dismissed if diseased they are kept till cured were something of the kind adopted in london where the houseless poor are very numerous it would be a most beneficent institution  it may easily be supposed that the abovementioned hospital is endowed with a very considerable revenue it is said to amount to  0000 doubloons or l 0000 sterling  there are neither hackney chairs nor hackney coaches in madrid a foreigner therefore cannot ride about the town upon the same easy terms as he may in london paris and many other great cities he who keeps no carriage must either walk or hire one for the day which may be had for about  0 reals all carriages are here drawn by mules and the coachmen might with more propriety be termed postillions as they ride on the mule instead of sitting on the coachbox a practice which certainly obstructs the sight less through the front glass of the carriage  the custom of driving with mules instead of horses is universal and for this reason because the horses in spain are not so well able to resist the parching heats in summer and the severe blasts in winter when the snow covers the hills on the sides of the escurial some of the ambassadors who would not conform to this custom have had reason to repent of this singularity as no one pair of horses would last them the year through whether they had spanish or foreign horses  no person is allowed to drive about madrid with more than four mules to his carriage the king only has six and sometimes eight but then he is seldom at madrid in the environs the nobility are allowed to travel with fix but very few are permitted to enter the gates with them the great officers of state and the foreign ministers only have this privilege and these are obliged to drive strait home from the gate at which they enter  there are few beggars in this city and those few do not wander about but remain fixed to one particular spot where however they do not much importune passengers with their supplications extending only their hands with a craving look if any thing is given them it is well if not they never open their lips  if a person wants to go a few leagues off he may hire a caleffin that is an open chaise drawn by a single horse the driver runs on foot by the side of the chaise and when tired gets up behind but on foot or behind he never ceases hooting and whipping the poor jade to make it trot in this manner they will make them go about six miles an hour  at madrid the hotels are good they have no abledhote but every one dines in his own apartment where he is served with two courses each of four or five dishes with a dessert and one such course for supper with plenty of good wine for which he pays seven livres and an half a day including lodging but if he eats no supper then his dinner and his two rooms will cost him only five livres or four and twopence english  like the french the spaniards drink their wine at dinner but when they have finished their dessert and taken coffee they retire to their couch  when they retire from the fiesta they get into their carriages to parade up and down the prado never going faster than a walk as they march slowly in one direction they look into the coaches which are returning in the other and bow to their acquaintances every time they pass  at the close of the day people say the usual prayer then wish each other a good evening and begin retiring to their houses when they take their refrescos of chocolate with biscuits and a glass of water  when properly introduced into a spanish family a stranger is told at parting now sir you are master of this house but the extent of the grant must be judged of by your own natural sagacity because such is the politeness of a spaniard that he makes use of this expression when nothing more is meant than that you are at liberty to call upon him accordingly you see many retire before each meal or drop in after it but when it is taken in the full extent the grant means dinner refresco supper any or all whenever it may suit you to partake of them  the people of fashion in this city are very obliging to strangers when once introduced to them nor do the common people give bad language or angry looks to strangers as is but too common in england as to the spanish grandees they seldom mix either with foreigners or natives who are not of the same rank with themselves the foreign ministers in particular scarce ever mix with any but the great officers of state from whence it may be concluded that it is not the custom for the spanish nobility to keep open houses like those of almost every other capital in europe yet some of them are very rich nor can they be taxed with avarice living in general with great splendor but the mode of spending their money is different from that of other countries and generally consists in keeping a numerous court within doors of chaplains secretaries pages and a great number of liveryservants together with a very considerable number of equipages besides very few of the grandees ever dismiss a servant once established in their families unless for some very enormous offenses he and his family remain pensioners as long as they live there are some who pay near l 0000 sterling a year in wages and annuities to servants  the grandees says swinburne are diminished by a series of distempered progenitors to a race of pigmies which dwindle away for want of heirs and tends gradually to a union of all the titles and estates upon the heads of one or two families there is one nobleman who has no less than    grandeeships centered in his person though they all style themselves de premiere class as it were by way of distinctive preeminence over others of a lower degree yet i believe says the above writer no second or third class exists and it would be a gross insult to suppose any of them of an inferior rank to the rest of the corpse some difference may perhaps be made in the degrees of popular respect paid to the descendants of heroes who made a figure in the spanish annals and such grandees as have been honored with that dignity in latter times there are several noble families who by their antiquity have a right to the honor of grandee but as the king has never ordered them to be covered they are styled casas agravias injured heroes  the king calls the grandees cousin when he writes to them when they receive audience of the pope they are allowed to sit they cannot be arrested for any crime whatsoever without an express order from his majesty they alone have the privilege to drive with four mules to their carriage within madrid whilst the king is there among them all titles are equal dukes marquisses or counts have no precedence the one before the other the grandees both in conversation and in writing to each other always use thee and thou but to their inferiors they make use of the ordinary style  in the folio book entitled creacion y privilegios de los tilulos de castilla printed in madrid         privileges are annexed to the dignity of grandee among which besides those abovementioned are the following they may never be put to the torture they may have four footmen and four torches behind their carriage as may also dukes earls and marquisses are allowed but two they are permitted to have a throne under a canopy in one room in their houses this privilege is however granted to various other dignities specified in the book  the spanish women are in general little and thin few are strikingly beautiful but almost all have sparkling black eyes full of expression it is not the fashion in spain as in france to heighten their eclat with paint they are endowed by nature with a great deal of wit and lively repartee but for want of the polish and succors of education their wit remains obscured by the rudest ignorance and most ridiculous prejudices their tempers having never been fashioned by polite intercourse nor softened by necessary contradiction are extremely pettish and violent they are continually pouting for something or other and put out of humor by trifles  most of the ladies about court are the reverse of handsome and do not seem to have any ambition of being thought clever or accomplished not one talent do they possess nor do they ever work read write or touch any musical instrument their cortejo or gallant seeming their only plaything the accounts given me says swinburne of their manner of living in their familyway as soon as they come out of the convent and before they have fixed on a lover to fill up their time more agreeably is as follows they rise late and loiter away the remainder of the morning among their attendants or wear it out at church in a long beadroll of habitual unmeaning prayers they dine sparingly sleep and then dress to saunter for a couple of hours on the prado they are never without some sort of sugarplum or highspiced comfit in their mouths as soon as it is dusk they run to the house of some elderly female relation where they all herd together over a pan of coals and would not for the world approach the company that may occasionally drop in it would throw them into the greatest confusion were they requested to join in the conversation the hour of the assembly passed they hurry home to their maids and with their help set about dressing their suppers by way of amusement  as people of fashion seldom assemble to eat at each others houses this is no doubt one of the circumstances which contributes to their reputation for sobriety they are likewise little acquainted with the innocent and healthful recreations of the country but few among them are fond of the chase of which the monarch and his family seem to possess the exclusive privilege country amusements in short seem to have no attractions for the spaniards their countryhouses might easily be numbered among the many rich individuals who inhabit the capital there are perhaps not ten who have a countryretreat  end of vol xix
