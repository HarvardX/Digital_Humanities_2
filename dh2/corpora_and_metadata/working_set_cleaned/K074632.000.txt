weightier arguments for them more strenuous more coercive she can bring to which perhaps selfinterested love will open their listening sense of mental joys and pure delight they would not understand or relish the description but if health they covet nor before the genial prime wish the stern fates to cut their vital thread those hearts may prove susceptible of fear which instinct love and duty could despise nor seek we fabled incidents to strike with superstitious dread the mind but truth plain honest truth inspires the homely song she who refuses to her young ones lip her swelling bosom each returning year conceives and each returning year sustains the pangs of childbirth harassed by fatigue the strongest constitution droops but soon the weaker system like a blighted flower falls underneath the shock the nursing time was meant by wisest nature as a stay a vacant interspace in which the nerves and threads of life unstrung might reassume their native tone endued again with strength and corresponding freedom to support the day of toil as a sure medicine to root out many an illness else untamed from the soft female frame tinvigorate the fragile texture and with grateful

custom rules despise thy sway thrice happy she by inclination led by naught withheld to add this pleasing link this heartendearing bond to the sweet ties of married love but should thou ever be doomed votaress of truth and virtue to resist the attractive warmth by their eternal hands implanted to resist the liberal call of duty and desire condemned by ails from causes unforeseen to tear the pledge from thy fond bosom while thy sickening heart bleeds at the thought condemned anothers care to invoke for him the babe thy straining eyes gaze on with nameless pleasure let my lay direct thy choice

investigate among the village tribe their neighbors mode of life heeds she the laws of matronlike sobriety her fame is it from all suspicion clear her soul to wedlock true feels she a parents love to her own offspring tenderly benign does she her husbands constant heart possess nor seeks he foreign pleasure every doubt extinguished here still curiously persist nor terminate thy search examine round her little mansion see if there in spite of poverty the step of cleanliness attractive nymph unhesitating treads her age too claims thy notice let not time on restless wing have stolen from her face the bloom of youth nor be she green in years for torpid or impaired by frequent use the flexile vessels which convolved in maze wrapped within maze secret the purer stream their office will more sparingly perform or less nutritious particles supply and if thy nurse be young the thoughtful mind of prudence would not to her charge confide what claims exactest assiduity and serious vigilance there are who think too subtle in their theory the nurse should with the mother aptly coincide in age and temperament but heeding well the precepts we have given thou may neglect such trivial niceness health from each extreme removed is not to color of the hair or to complexion tinged with red or brown consined excess thou should indeed avoid of plump or lean nor would i choose the adust and highly bilious or the sable hue of clouded melancholy be it then thy primal care to fix on vigorous health adorned with smiles the lovely progeny of constant cheerfulness and sweet content nor would i tho

throng the crowded town restrained by force within that court of death where every gale is tainted with pollution did the muse if some sad cause forbade thee to pursue the mothers genuine office to the fields serene and rural lares order forth thy tender infant not from needless fears and vain precaution did she dare to thwart the dictates of humanity she sees what do not to thy eye perhaps appear the dreadful train of ills which swarm within the unhallowed precincts well she knows how few out of the many myriads cityborn survive in just proportion scanned with those who bask in freer

each danger i review shuddring with fear i scarce would bid thee prove the nurses task tho naught should intervene of fatal accident and thou art bound by every tie of nature to the deed for can thou round thy infants brow entwine a magic wreath or cause an angel lift his shielding arm thou can not follow then the precepts of experience yet let often maternal fondness guide thee to the place where rests the little sojourner there view how cherished how improved and lingering chide the rapid step of stillprogressive time which hurries thee reluctantly away but can the mother change unblamed the town for some sequestered villa what denies her bed of sickness quitted to retreat and seek the haunts where peace on flowers reclined lists to the warbling songster of the grove or from the gentlyrising hill surveys the grazing herds and rivulet which winds meandring through the distant vale where health sports on the level green and young delight smiling attends where bounteous nature sheds her choicest blessings and with guardian wing protects her favorite progeny retire my fair disciple haste to scenes like these and underneath thy roof invite to dwell the fosterer of thy child

luxurious fare when him she suckled never did a draught stronger than water pass her thirsty lip pernicious ale she knew not when released from short confinement to her various wants no friend no

their dazzling colors spread and mock the eye she too shall bid the train of haughty ignorance for it is the curse of pride to be with ignorance conjoined keep far aloof nor read the hallowed lay yet not alone to women do we write the nurse or mother subjects such as these often have the sages old of greece or rome in studious mood employed full well they knew that from the birth those heroes must be formed whom athens might with future joy admire or hardy sparta heroes who might urge to their sublimest pitch the rights of men brave every danger for their countrys cause and make the persian

languor to connect his mind with vigorous organs it is impulsive will apt to perform and run with ease and strength the great and difficult career of life desirous to behold our british youth outrival ancient fame come then ye sires whom love of offspring or of country sways you will approve my verse the nurserys care from you will gain attention wisdoms voice and deep philosophy to you have taught it is consequence and worth oh aid the toil of a fond mother with your reason guide her gentler faculties invigorate her virtuous weakness to your wellknown voice she will she cannot but with pleasure yield and follow precepts sanctisied by you what aliment the tender babe requires how best sustained the muse proceeds to sing to nature then attend she has prepared no food but milk alone and if it flows in plenteous rills abundant is the store thus fed the lamb over the grassy turf sports frolicksome the patient ox who turns sweltering all day the stubborn glebe by this nourished at first his present strength acquired and will thy infant cease to thrive supplied with this nepenthe rather he will gain new vigor every hour and healthful smile tho sickness scoul around yet some there are who fill from morn to noon from noon to eve nay through the hours of night the suffering child with various cates heedless of natures lore cruelly kind unknowing that they thus fatten a victim for the hungry grave for from repletion every ill severe which threatens childhood armed with keener force invades the delicate frame how often twere sit the suckling should imbibe the milky stream from the first dawn of morning till the sun set in the west experience must evince all do not feed alike some greedily drain at a meal the lacteal beverage others more nice require the frequent treat yet when night spreads her mantle over the globe and leads on sleep and silence it is meet to obey her mandate rest thy careful head o mother let thy tender nurseling rest why will thou anxious to thyself create unnecessary pain at evening close forth from her den starts the fell lioness and through the gloomy desert urges on eager for prey her rapid step she leaves her sleeping young one nor expects he food till she return with mornings early beam yet this is he who shall hereafter reign lord of the forest and with kingly voice appal his listening subjects but thy heart is soft and cannot bear thy infants cries oh heaven forbid that i should wish thy breast steeled to his real misery but these are cries which evil custom has begot and blind indulgence unalarmd sustain a few short trials bear unmoved the shock at first indulged not he will fret no more believe me nor from hunger nor from pain these wailings spring how different is the shriek and agonizing groan from sobs like these transient and humorsome to cloth thy child with health some little violence endure nor to the dictates plain of candid truth thy ancient nurses doting saws prefer the stomach ever full is ever weak but from refreshing sleep and abstinence digestion thrives and kindliest nutriment the absorbent veins inhale wherewith the warm and plastic arteries by due degrees upbuild the human fabric or by which each slender thread and fiber is evolved gaining mysteriously their destined bulk and firm elastic motion robbed of sleep the warrior droops his head and longs no more to plunge amid the fight the rustic faints vigorous eerwhile nor strains his sinewy arms holding the plough but nerveless and unmannd presses his homely pallet sending forth vain wishes to the power who from him flies and can the gentle frame of woman bear constant disturbance and unrest her strength melts down apace the bloom forsakes her cheeks a peevish listlessness succeeds she pines and oversedulous is now unfit to fill that office which she most desires would thou thy child to pass the hours of night wrapped in sleeps downy plumage banish far the lazy cradle useless but to give relief to the indolent attendant race who fain would batten in perpetual sloth who shrink at slightest toil and ill deserve the viands they devour at first indeed during the circuit of a moon or twain it is fit thy charge should only eat and sleep nature demands it afterward contract the hours of sleep by day and in the embrace of carefulness let exercise divert the lively infant chiefly when his eye now looks around unknowing what he sees now when he springs and spreads his little arms and smiles and utters sounds which strike thine ear with wondrous pleasure tho we now permit some added food its quality regard as of important consequence we praise above the rest the farinaceous tribe bread wellfermented unadulterate with deleterious alum this with milk and with the limpid element decoct yet always mindful of the golden mean be even this with moderation used nor ever glut the stomach till it loathes and the superfluous aliment rejects the wrinkled sibyl laugh to scorn and all her dreams fallacious when pronouncing this a sign of health nature indeed is kind and various her attempts to evacuate what would be noxious and it is well thy child has still sufficing strength but he poor babe had he the sense to guide his appetite would shun this consequence of mere excess no proof of health disgustful to the eye we blame thee not for yielding to the voice of error if beneath the solemn garb of old experience hid and selfconvinced not meaning to deceive how should thy young untutored mind resist her lore but when truth meets thy sight and pointing shows the way to natures bower thy blind associate quit enter the hallowed shade converse with her pure nymph peruse her lineaments divine and to her voice impartial open thy heart it is not strange that prejudice should gain access to thy soft bosom who can boast his freedom wide and potent is her sway no fiend in stronger bonds has held enslaved the groaning nations in cimmerian gloom where light never penetrates but darkness sits in fixed essential majesty enthroned unconscious sloth by ignorance compressed brought forth this monster to the haunts of men taking her way the stars grew pale her wings she spread incumbent over the subject world nor suffered men to view what slender bounds divided them from brutes in torpid state plunged deep they lay supine for many an age till egypt first rebelled mother of arts and boasted fount of wisdom yet tho bold the adventure she to burst the galling chain strove unsuccessful mid the twilight groves of sacred memphis on the banks of nile prolific wondrous stream or round the walls of hundredgated thebes in union close with superstition dwelt the pest abhorred and underneath her hieroglyphic veil incongruous forms commingled nor in greece reigned she less absolute her sages hence built their fallacious systems airy shades and phantoms of the brain with wordy war fought in defense each of his waking dream and suffered truth with socrates to expire how long beneath her power did europe bend prompted by her ambition eaglewingd taught ancient rome amid the lust of sway intent on crimson conquest to neglect humanity and virtue till the pile by valor reared fell from it is giddy height shattered within by luxury without assailed by savage fierceness then what depth of native gloom of thickincircling night witnessed her presence every art was lost each effort of the mind or else sunk low grouchd to the yoke while over the puzzled schools exalted shook his worse than iron rod the tyrant stagyrite and physic awed by galens sullen genius dared not heal each lovelier grace each elegance unknown each genuine ornament till taste overwhelmed with deathlike sleep in leos age revived philosophy extinct till bacon rose the morning star of science by whose beams transfixt as erst the fabled python fell lay vanquished huge authority then first experiment with radiant lamp disclosed the stores of bigot time and taught with nice laborious hand from each fictious gem to separate the true hence day by day the rigid shackles fall selfloosed or brace mankind less strictly we for natures laws read nature only wisdom smiles serene with freedom blessed and fools alone are slaves and say will thou in this enlightened age o mother single stand and lend thine ear to hoar and quaint tradition will thou treat thy child by their opinion whose advice thou would not follow in one act beside judge by thyself what languor what fatigue attends the fuller meal what dire effects what tumults often from the crude surfeit rise and why is reason thine if not with care to govern him whose yet unripend frame of sense is vacant tho with greater ease his stomach may the superplus expel than older gluttony yet caution dreads events unfortunate the nerves convulsed fever and each ill symptom which attends the growing teeth unskilled to curb himself his appetite guide thou so duly fed each meal affording what may satisfy not burden nature on thy happy child hygeia shall with eye propitious look his shall be comely vigor winning smiles freedom from pain protection from disease and stamina wellknit to undergo each future change of evervarying life each toil each danger nay perhaps a base on which hereafter may be firmly reared each virtue social public warm resined each intellectual moral excellence for tho the child of weaker nerves may seem with quickest parts endowed yet should he rise through numerous perils to the height of man oppressed with listless torpor how can he brave the meridian ray of public life reflecting on himself how shall his mind expand tward others feelings nay too often those blossoms immature of sense on which we gaze with pleasure and astonishment spontaneous from the blighted stalk descend or yield harsh tasteless fruit this stroke severe thou shall avoid more rationally kind if formed by nature delicate thy love guided by judgment shall his strength improve at least his weakness or the effects it brings shall not proceed from errors of thy own thou will not gorge thy child and all night long he sleeps serene an interval of rest in which the stomach cleared of every load fortuitous its healthful state preserves he wakes alert prompted by hunger keen to imbibe the draught nutritious thee too sleep has charmed with opiate rod no froward cries no tortures of thy infant caused by crude unwholesome or accumulated fare have broke thy tranquil slumbers thou too see placid the break of morn and to thy babe the wellsecreted copious aliment preparest to give which sad anxiety and restless hours in her who idly fond and painfully solicitous has watched the night for other purposes designed rob of its balmy essence else derived sprightly and plenteous from the genial chyle a weak thin vapid unsubstantial juice whence to the tender organs of her babe a morbid irritation which destroys their natural and necessary tone till happily dire disease or death ensues is there a stronger principle infixd in human nature than the zealous warmth a mother tward her infant feels yet thin is the barrier dividing right from wrong virtue from vice the noblest qualities indulged to excess a different hue assume no longer noble courage may be changed to brutal force to prodigality the generous sentiment to license rude freedoms bright flame and tender nuptial love to mean uxoriousness what siner joys inspire the soul more exquisitely formed by vulgar minds unheeded but beware lest sensibility itself uncheckd extinguish it is delights lest pity bleed at every pore intolerable smart enduring lest the softer passion urge if unsuccessful to the wan abode of madness or despair lest taste exact turn to fastidious niceness coveting with vain desire among the works of men to find perfection thou too curb thy zeal o mother that impulsive ardour rule that love inordinate which urges on to weakness and perverts to criminal the sweetest best emotions of thy soul whence is this nameless energy this power so forcibly attractive who intwined it is subtle threads and round the willing heart braced firm the cord mysterious who but he the prime intelligence who first called forth from warring chaos this fair frame of things who bade each part with animation glow and what he willed to exist in order due not of continued but successive life willed to preserve who taught the winged race   0 among impervious shades with matchless skill to form their nests and guard their callow brood the natives of the fields and desert wilds a fit retreat to seek the rocky cave thicket or mountain high who gives them all a thousand wiles a thousand stratagems of crafty policy from hostile force to save their young and to defend them fills even the most timid with impetuous strength and sense of prowess never felt before instinct alone their tutoress and guide but instinct and superior reason thine thus while nine moons have known increase and wane taught to proceed the pleasing task of care is still unfinished much remains unsung now is the season by experience deemed most meet an arduous duty to attempt arduous to some but not to thee whose mind reason enlightens with a clearer ray showing the bounds between parental love and it is fond foolish mimic thou can look beyond the present no dull slave of sense and for a lasting good most willingly endure some transient pain thy child long time fed by thy vital fluid now requires dismission from the breast yet not at once as some have taught erroneous such our frame that every rash and sudden change may prove the source of harm more wise and cautious thou break through the tie of habit by degrees and ere the stream maternal be refused his taste to different nutriment incline besides the increase of food ere while allowed what diet do we grant some would defer to years more vigorous all that tyrant man the universal glutton from the race that grazes on the plain or skims the flood or cleaves with nimble wing the yielding air culls for his use and would not that the child should taste of aught but what the fruitful earth plant herb or grain produces with the stream the lowing kine afford there are no doubt who to the latest stage of life arrive thus always nourished on the shores of ind checked by religious fears whole tribes refuse to bathe their hands in blood lest through the wound a kindred soul should fly yet some pass through a century of years so fame reports by sickness unsubdued where high ascend our caledonian hills the hardy north a gallant offspring boasts whom fate denies to indulge except in vegetable meals yet when their country rouses them to arms waving her standard to their view they rush impetuous forth and terrible in war dread as the lion hurt in every clime they fight they conquer hearing but their name the distant foe grows pale yet prone to doubt the sage these fair examples will not trust implicitly believing he will judge not from a race of men by habit swayed by custom hardened not from every rare occurrence of longevity or those the minions of their clan who seek the fields where rages fell bellona he requires a strict impartial list to know if more of these compared with others ere the force of potent use has natures influence changed escape unhurt and reach lifes grateful prime active proportioned vigorous and here these distant facts still undetermined left the instructive muse shall teach from what her eyes have clearly seen though social not inclined to luxurys various table tho humane no follower of the samian sect however the infant formed perhaps with stronger nerves or of peculiar nature may escape the blasting hand of sickness or may thrive on vegetable fare yet often we view where poverty more generous food denies tottering rachitis seize it is helpless prey or flowconsuming tabes or within his mazy labyrinth the tortuous worm finding a sure asylum multiplies his noisome produce hence the unwieldy head distended joints limbs variously incurved hence the sunk cheek the hollow lifeless eye hence loss of balmy sleep and appetite convulsive motions agonizing spasms and symptoms which in order to describe had foiled the coan sage for maugre those who idly speculate by fancy ruled or superstition nature we assert formed us with mingled diet herb root seed and animal to gratify our taste or foster life a truth the anatomist plainly demonstrates nor will reasons mind admit a doubt the crude or sluggish juice which vegetables yield with toil perspired weakens the stomach whose contraction fails not justly stimulated while the skin it is pores blocked up or even it is texture changed is covered over with incrustations fou scarcely if ever by the abstersive wave of tepid bath removed but if by fate these viands are refused condemned to taste naught but bird fish or beast a putrid mass is genderd which pollutes the vital slood and taints each humor till the general frame dissolves as in a thaw these truths regard by nature heeded when with care she formed the lacteal fluid a peculiar mixed skilfully blended by digestion due or in it is winding passage through the glands animalized and rendered fit to tame the ferment of acidity to which childhood is prone whence we conclude that now when from the breast exiled as far as art her nicer laws can imitate it is right to adapt it is food and mingle aliment of

would deny ere yet we close the strain one error more the muse will combat tenderness may prompt whenever thy child shall ask thee to bestow the needless viand in his younger days we bound thee not to rules but now when over his head four annual suns have rolled advise that he be taught submission to the laws of social life which stated hours appoints for action and repast nor heed the voice of ignorance which talks of exercise and quick digestion often well we know the vicious taste of idle wantonness demands restraint but lest to thee it seem as real hunger from the coarser loaf a pure tho homely nutriment supply his craving thus with certainty detect fictitious appetite his other meals yet undirected both at morn and eve be fresh drawn broths and milk in various forms with rice or other farinaceous grain inspissated we would not stint thy child and know his growth requires a constant flux of plastic fluids nay it is best to err if err in quantity the flexile tubes of children will perhaps with ease transpire what is redundant but with heed observe add thy discretion to the muses lore and reason and experience be thy guides now duly taught by thy maternal care o never may he turn his vagrant steps aside to dwell mid the polluted tents of bestial luxury we would not wish a stoical indifference to fly forever those delights which sway mankind the exhilarating bowl which opes the heart and festive banquet where preside the powers of wit and decent mirth but may he live born for society no hermit sour or driveling moralist absurdly grave and singularly dull temperate by choice but not austerely abstinent by thee is the foundation in his primal years firm laid by which he need not sacrifice to rigid niceness but with health his friend will not start back from every little change which weaker habits must with caution shun or cannot with impunity indulge thine is the work and gratitude shall then repay the debt the filial debt he owes then shall thou feel tho strong the instinctive tie of blind affection what sublimer joys reason affords the generous mutual bond thy tender love his tribute of the soul thus far the muse didactic has assayed her purposed theme scattering before the steps of truth and science over their toilsome paths the not unfrequent flower the sweets which bloom on those delicious banks forever green fed by translucent rills which murmuring sweep over sands of gold where fancy loveliest nymph delighted strays or with the sylvan powers dryads and fauns disporting joins the dance and sings her wildest note or silent stands her roving eye her giddy step enthralled attentive to minervas heavenly voice enamored of her wisdom and from her receives the potent wand by judgment formed and waves it over her works which thence remain unfading and immortal rest not here o virgin still be infant man thy theme and what of clothing what of exercise he needs relate nor his diseases scorn with hand benign to paint and teach the cure thou will not if the sharp inclement air of cold neglect freeze not thy vital warmth and in the cave of solitude fast bind thy wings aspiring which shall shed their plumes of varied die or fold thee ever round in sullen indignation rather far from thee be thoughts like these stoop not thy soul to fears of vulgar nature high above this sordid earth direct thy piercing eye and view where reared beyond the gulf of death stands fames refulgent dome to living wight aye inaccessible still as of yore thou soughtst the ascrean or the mantuan bard thy visions spread before my raptured sight and soothe my ear with those celestial strains which on olympus lofty top reclined charm jove himself while virtue reason truth humanity and love each sound applaud and bless the unprostituted lyre oh hail ye pure ethereal bards who nobly stooped to teach mankind who round the flowing locks of fancy cast the sacred wreathe inwove by the fair fingers of utility which scorns caprice and whim amusive toys and trifles vain the unprofitable gawds which catch the light and airy mind of youth or vacant pleasure hail again ye bards nor only ye of greece and rome who first stole from the crowd profane my chastened thoughts and as i gazed upon your page inspired the holy frenzy of ambitious love aiming with ardent but successless toil to emulate your beauties ye too hail ye sons of britain masters of the song thou akenside late wept by every muse whose skilful hand unlocked the secret source of mental pleasure founded in the new the graceful and sublime nor blind to worth tho still upon this waveworn shore it stand of troublous life by envys blasts assailed be thou ungreeted armstrong in my verse thou parent of the prophylactic lay nor mason thou whose polisht taste instructs to form the english garden mingling art with rural wildness and simplicity nor beattie friend of truth whose gothic harp as if from magic touch emit such tones that even apollo might his lyre forget and wonder at the harmony while pleased in edwins ripening genius we behold the progress of thy own hail too ye friends of nature and the muse of soul refined of judgment unimpaird by slavish art unmanacled who feeling dare confess the pleasure which ye feel who mid the scenes of calm retirement from the genuine cup nectareous virtuecrownd drink true delight while the mad riotous crew at distance heard disturb not your pure ears nor aught inspire but pity and contempt to you alone these bards have sung to you alone i sing o let me mingle with the hallowed band by you exalted let me scorn with you the base luxurious dissipated great who to the yoke of every foreign vice bow down the neck disgraceful and retain only the name of britons strangers they to every wish each thought of nobler kind absorbed in selfish joys of public good of private virtue heedless skilled to game to waste their trifling hours beneath the shade of indolence to steer the fragile bark over the smooth wave of folly they applaud what taste condemns their highest excellence to deck with richest offerings the vain shrine of those musicians who distort the most the native elegance and most pollute each charm of melody or those who urge the human voice divine to heights which well madness might emulate while jacksons strains breathing in every note the soul of love of passion feeling sense and sentiment flow unrewarded save that nature stands listening and drinks in every thrilling sound delicious but unprofitable meed of elevated genius fond of show of pompous scenes of barren novelties of tortured incidents and poor finesse filchd from the gallic or italian stage they relish not while they pretend to admire our shakespeares matchless energy the voice of wisdom they despise the sacred lyre they trample in the dust a catch a glee a song obscene a libel which destroys some good mans peace of mind and blasts his fame strikes their weak souls with rapture wedded love they slout to scorn posterity with them is lighter than a shade a rapid whirl of vice fantastic hurries on their lives and even the flatterer whom they feed would blush to praise their memory is this the race o britain nurse sublime of heroes old of patriots sages who thy state have raised to it is allenvied height is this the race destined to guide thy counsels form thy laws crowd thy onceawful senate against these must public spirit idly strain the nerve to these must worth and modest merit yield the reptile spawn of insignificance corruptionfosterd then farewell to all thy boasted glories style thyself no more the queen of nations levelled with the mean and undistinguished kingdoms of the earth thou have been free the era will arrive thou shall be free no more over folly vice aristrocratic faction shall usurp or bold and enterprising monarchy with justice claim dominion it is most fit a mid the extensive records of mankind it never was found that freedom could survive where honor dwelt not where with careless eye or but intent on pleasure luxury sat and viewed her chain unmoved where love of fame where the keen hopes of future praise no more awoke the generous deed the grateful praise paid by posterity to liberal souls who plan the good of ages yet at once quit not this isle o virtue in the scenes the lower scenes of action linger still far from the plaguestruck capital inspire the honest individual in his soul cherish the warm affections let him feel the joys of unpolluted love and think his offspring worth his care still may thou walk on iscas banks where through the blooming vale it is lucid stream meanders and receive the orisons which there thy votaries pour from hearts unconscious of deceit untaught the false refinements of superior life blessed by the muse in nuptial friendship blessed forbid the external sight of things within illumed by goodness and the beams serene which taste which wisdom and contentment shed may blacklock still enfold thee may thou dwell from pride far distant from the tyrant sway and noontide glare of vanity with him and his compatriots drop the expressive tear over gregorys tomb in whom alive combined all that the sapient head or feeling heart proclaim and admiration and esteem and reverence move then cast thy eyes around and own thou never beheldst a soil more pure a soil where manly parts and sense acute spontaneous grow and every female grace adorns with innocence and chaste reserve the matrons bosom spite of southern pride the rancorous lie or partial ridicule it is sons and daughters perfect in their kind in bravery worth unquestioned strength of soul in modest tenderness domestic charms tho equaled never surpast thus may thou still preserve a few from the contagious air which luxury breathes a remnant whence to learn what britons erst have been preserve them heaven and when they cast the page of flattery by let them with kindred warmth these notes approve and say the strains are ours for us attuned and for the

her robe succinct a golden clasp upheld baring the knee not languishingly soft like venus in her gait nor rivalling majestic juno but in all her limbs dwelt symmetry divine activity and sparkling

give that sound unerring judgment which alone acquired by use and contemplation can insure the proper time of trial can advise with confidence and justify the deed yet what we may what nor the muse forbids nor our own sense condemns is freely thine if from the mothers bosom we remove those false opinions which her gentle soul unwittingly possess if we describe the limits of her care and when to invoke superior wisdoms aid if on her mind some duties we impress and tyrant fear and more tyrannic superstition drive far from her dwelling not in vain we write and many a fell disease overcome her sons her daughters shall hereafter bless the day which brought these wellmeant numbers to her ear because the child with reason unendowd and power of speech by words to express his grief nature permits not some believe the source of anguish and affliction is concealed from every eye and deem assistance vain or to the nurse or vaunting midwife trust who cases manifold and similar have often beheld and never failed to cure for each her nostrum boasts if harmless this and trifling it were well did not the wing of time speed fast the irrevocable hour of wished redress but frequently the

partially adopted often admit ingressive error children are presumed as fresh from natures hand with maladies of simpler kind to labor than the frame of grosser age say this belief were true a general rule if simpler than they are hence treated still we cannot but decry the unsound opinion which for all alike one favorite mode of practice recommends if just the notion aesculapius son might as a vain intruder be dismissed the mother could supply his place unblamed but nor with idle terrors do we seek to wound affection from experience taught we know what medicines different in effect and opposite the varying symptoms claim antiphlogistics which the vital heat increased depress and cardiacs which excite and opiate sedatives in vulgar hands pernicious as the deadly nightshades juice and

of this be sure o parent to thy children flow from numerous causes which would tire thy ear and pass the stated limits of our verse their diverse ails tho not perhaps like us subject to putrid ferments yet from them not wholly free nor from the power of cold of sultry heat of humid air and dry and fell contagion whose resistless aim if placed within it is reach no wight can shun of mortal mould nor ever escape the bane unless around her favorites nature cast impenetrable mail no work of art shall then by fear impeded none attempt to rescue childhood from distress and pain but those by long and toilsome study taught to investigate the cause the symptoms scan and judge what they portend the impartial heart unmoved by sordid lucre by the goad of mean selfinterest wishes to the race of infant innocence no worse a fate but not to combat what the muses nine and even the delian god with all his power could never vanquish and because the step of paeons votary is not always near attend our strains when the weak head declines and the eye droops when now the inconstant cheek is red now pale when fretful restless hot the stomach and intestines discomposed and in their office changed when the young springs of life more quick or tardy seem to move than nature wills we would not to thy child forbid thee tho we dare not recommend nor can approve the deed unless by fate widely sequestered from the experienced eye reasons sole plea to give a portion due of the indian root or taught the quantity with nice exactness which his age may claim some useful antimonial or that mild insipid light absorbent by it is name magnesia better known or joined with this more strengthening rheum from siberian wilds or turkeys regions brought here ends thy care for now the transient obstacles overcome alacrity returns or still he pines still his distemper gains increasing force and if the cause should thus be deeply fixed thy efforts would be vain perhaps unsafe at least engendring danger by delay and danger often marches close by death here let thy love thy conscience take the alarm love for thy child and terror at the guilt of dire infanticide perhaps the worst of ills impends convulsion lurks unseen fever already riots in his veins or suffocation threatens to destroy trust not thyself trust not the babbling hag let fondness all alive and lightning round detect her as ithuriels spear the toad couched at the ear of eve with poison filled yet shun despondence cherish warmest hope seize fleet occasion ere it passes by and call the ingenious leach his happy skill shall to it is pristine health thy babe restore if alloerruling providence permit if not to the indefatigable mind tho learning all it is mysteries has revealed tho judgment clear and long experience join their potent aid a warren will be foiled a heberden or baker cannot save but thou from every taint of guilt or blame art free thy duty is performed tho poor that solace is which counsels be resigned fetter the strong sensations rapidwingd and glean content from rectitude of thought who thus can lose the darling of the eye the little lively cherub who even now begins his voice to modulate and lisp the halfformd tale ah wherefore was he given so soon resumed and snatched from cheerful day that heaven best knows yet if thou will indulge thy just emotions give them ample scope recall each mimic gesture every sound each look when pleased or wayward in his mood he struck with inexpressive tenderness the soul parental with thy struggling heart the muse shall sympathise shall add to thine congenial notes sincere but time shall heal the rankling wound and soften by degrees nay quite overcome reflections sharpest pangs till memory tracing to the fount of grief views it at length unruffled and beholds through the calm lymph woes once detested form affectionately pensive yet serene the human soul with fortitude can bear or with elastic energy expel or slowly certain vanquish every ill but dread remorse the selfaccused descend low in the scale and abject or they pine afflicted or amid the blaze of noon perceive no change in the dark midnight gloom which reigns within despair stands scouling by and sullen madness crouches for his prey oh may thy mind whatever doomed to feel whatever of anguish pain or penury wounds of ingratitude or slighted love this worse than all that famine fire or steel this horrid fiend avoiding never shrink beneath his weight by conscious thought condemned nor may evadnes melancholy fate be ever thine what beauties could she boast how fair in virgin innocence her charms pierced deep for unaffected was the maid and justest education had improved not tortured nature melody had chose her voice for it is loved vehicle of sound tho mute she spoke her eye had magic fire her shape her gesture every action beamed expressive elegance could the young heart of polydore resist her wondrous power he strove not to resist he heard he saw and all his melting soul was here is alone nor did she view the enamored swain or hear scornful the tender vows he breathed for his was the smooth open front of candid truth the modest cheek the soft persuasive glance of true affection and the sigh sincere the lawns the meads beheld them and the groves of quivering alder and the willows green skirting the mazy brook nor ever beheld happier and purer mortals nor ever caught amid their shades or on their mossy banks notes more impassioned from the doric muse than polydore to his evadne sung thus fixed immutably thus rivetted by strong attraction not a fathers frown for his imagination had portrayed evadne in the higher rank of pride of wealth and pageantry not five long years of absence could from eithers heart erase the others image yet again they met auspicious was the meeting for the soul of age severe now moved resolved to bless the constant youth and to his arms resign the beauteous maid he blessed the constant youth and to his arms the beauteous maid resigned fair shone the morn of their espousals fair the coming morn and promised to the eye of raptured love a train of prosperous days oh happiness how exquisite  how brief affliction is the lot of man below and often misery when the soul of joy flushes with transport breathes a sudden air of chilling frost the genial warmth destroys and florid bloom one eve evadne sat alone in swift succession to her view rose many a fairy prospect but the light which gilded them was polydores the sun was he illuming animating all the forms of her creation even then she felt his warm embrace and pressed she thought his glowing cheek to here is for him prepared the table smiled for him brightbeaming shone the rosy wine the footsteps of his steed she heard in every gale but him alas the living polydore she never saw that steed had proved unfaithful to his trust with madning swiftness tward the gate he flew while far behind his breathless master lay the feelings of evadne to describe weak is the muse and nerveless are her strains what can support her where exists the power which can detain her from the grave that holds her lord in death what but the babe which smiles unconscious of his loss as on her breast her nurturing breast he hangs for him she lives for him sustains the load of grief and strives to tear the rooted anguish from her mind he is the charm which reconciles her thoughts to the loathed world for polydore in him she sees in the dear pledge of amity stamped with his image with his vital blood informed and breathing sweet his balmy breath has not misfortune spent her deadly shafts illstarrd evadne in thy child appear the symptoms of disease and onward hastes impetuous fever to a form like thine a temper blameless with emotions pure humane and amiable ah why did heaven refuse staid judgment firmness to resist error importunate and strength to shun credulity which hears the dotards tale and thinks it truth who taught thy grandam hoar the secrets of an art to which the mind of vigorous energy and years of toil are scarcely equal by what demon urged malicious with what evil spirit filled of selfconceit and folly dares she hope to accomplish what requires the searching eye of genius and the labored skill of deep and accurate attention on thy child she looks then proves her wisdom first the teeth are blamed and charms are tried and nostrums given next fits internal and her poisonous drugs she brews like circe then the noxious worm and anthelmintics various she procures and often repeats the drench each different cause she ever has heard suggested is accused and every remedy she ever knew administered while still the last her voice solemnly slow declares will banish pain and with miraculous and sudden force restore the suffering babe who lies meantime oppressed with double woe by his disease and that pernicious treatment which from plain and simple has converted it at length to mortal violence now nature yields reluctantly overcome evadne sees the victim of presumptuous ignorance conviction flashes on her mind she calls for aid too late he dies and with him dies her polydore again she raves she tears her flowing locks yet passionate excess may waste itself and peace once more return it might return as when she felt the pangs of absent love as when her heart was torn losing it is dearer portion but the sting of sharp reflection by herself impelled what hand shall ever extract her delicate and feeling mind imaginationstruck shrinks from existence while by day by night these sounds pervade her ear thy child is slain and thou were an accomplice horrid sounds inviting on his cloud the dreary shape of melancholy madness oh what notes what different notes utters evadne now enfrenzied and forlorn from those which erst amid their shades or on their mossy banks the groves responsive heard the joyous groves of quivering alder and the willows green skirting the mazy brook those doric notes which polydore to his evadne sung turn we from scenes like these which over the soul of weeping sympathy diffuse a gloom yet not unchastend by the milder ray of selfacquitting thought and firm intent to shun the latent rocks of deep distress by pious caution guided from our theme not thus abstracted it is preceptive notes yet unrelinquishing and sorrows mists dispelled which over the breast of innocence flit like a cloud across the summer sky to happier mansions objects of delight and joyful prospects turn to where thy child has by inoculation overcome the plague variolous as hercules the spotted snakes defeating transport flushed alcmenas glowing cheek so over thine i see the kindled radiance whether born in ethiopic wilds or mid the sands of parched arabia or where spread the shores girding the caspian from his natal place pursuing mahomets widewasting arms the monster rushed on europe pale dismay horror and death rapacious in his train for many a century without control when ragid his fury by pernicious skies aroused or propagated far and wide by fell contagion he destroyed mankind the cities groaned the matron over her babe in unavailing trance of anguish hung the lover offered up his fruitless vows and wearied heaven importunately fond to save the beauty which his soul adored the babe the mothers self became his prey the youth and virgin sunk into the tomb if life were granted beauty was effaced each decent feature tumid and enlarged roughend or dented with unseemly scars medicine was whelmed with shame the roman page was silent nor the grecian could afford an antidote for evils grecias sons had never imagined rhazes wrote in vain and even sydenhams efforts had their bounds for the cold lymph by prejudice was shunned and sydenham tho he often by freer air tamed the devouring heat and shook the throne of learned ignorance declaring war against it is regimen adverse to life and compounds teeming with destructive fire alexipharmic poisons could not change the rank malignant nature of the pest which still when favoring constitutions reigned and in peculiar habits all his art baffled invincible his art beyond all mortals else and only not divine the triumph was reserved for female hands thine was the deed accomplished montague what physic never conjectured what described by pylarini by timoni sketchd seemed to philosophy an idle tale or curious only she by patriot love inspired and england rising to her view proved as a truth and proved it on her son a manly mind where reason dwelt supreme was here is the little terrors of her sex despising by maternal fondness swayed yet bold where confidence had stable grounds how far superior to the turbannd race with whom she sojourned scrupulous and weak yet this is she whom popes illiberal verse has dared to censure with malicious spleen and meanlycoward soul redoubled bard what has thy satire tho it often flow happy and poignant with horatian ease what has thy moral lay tho pure and just and elegant of profit ever produced of high advantage to thy natal land compared with her bequest thy numbers charm the listening ear and with thy polisht style taste is enamored she has been the cause of heartfelt joy to thousands thousands live and still shall live through her thy song can please none but the sons of britain or the few of nice and studious leisure she unlocked the springs of satisfaction and delight and with perennial comfort blessed the world let me then urge this duty nor to fear or superstition yielding let thy child encounter in his native shape the fiend and brave his violence for whither say to what sequestered haunt can thou retreat where he will not pursue how vain thy flight how sure thy victory if as art direct and wise experience thou anticipate his threatened blow so when the patriarchs arm was stretched to wound his son an angel came and saved the victim from impending death gentle and almost harmless is the bane by skill communicated which regards the times and seasons nor infects the child if to dentitions wonted state arrived for ill the laboring frame can then endure an added stimulus nor yet before that period lest to epilepsy prone by the contagious vapor raised he quit sudden the precincts warm of light and life this too the cold of winter bids us shun potent the vessels to contract increase their tonic force and in the system stir fierce inflammation and the summer heat by which all putrid ferments are sublimed and rendered doubly fatal these extremes avoided in the temperate months alone let every prudent matron be resolved to obey the call of duty and of love unless the dread contagion thickening round impell them to neglect each guarded rule yielding by force to perils just alarm need we in this our era when mature and vigorous reason prospers groundless fears oppose by arguments the groundless fears of fondness or religion in thy mind no terror should or can with justice dwell but lest as naturally seen by art unmodified uncheckd the stern disease should thy young charge assault if he escape his lot is fortunate assaulted thus often from an hundred only many die from many hundreds none or one perchance of those inoculated why should thine be the poor solitary one if death follow a treatment which can soothe the pest and meliorate it is nature could his life be granted to thy fervent prayer when armed and with it is proper rage it took the field this be thy source of comfort nor believe that providence is tempted by the deed from providence flows reason to mankind and reason teaches us to fly from ill and covet good the invention the success is the true warrant of approving heaven who would not rather cross a shallow frith when first the rising tide begins than wait hemmed in a nook till with impetuous force it sweep him from his station who refuse by franklins pointed rod to draw the stream of lightning on their roofs because the cloud might harmless pass above thus safe conveyed in unterrific silence to the ground tho rare the examples now and scattered mark the unhappy beings who from idle dread or weak maternal love in childhoods state this boon received not and who sharing yet the hereditary feelings want themselves firmness of soul the omission to supply mark where they pine in solitude oppresst by anxious thought to whom mans cheerful race affords no joy the voice of music breathes it is choral notes unheard the stage displays the living manners and the assembly beams with sprightliness and elegance in vain

cursed in early life by thee from all these future horrors freed the mirthful crowd with innocence of heart joining wellpleased the gay the social hour nor shunning nor desiring but awhile to soften

the verse prepare and bring the harmonious strain why through the realms of europe are not votive statues placed honoring their benefactress from the straits of gades south to where the towers ascend of famed petropolis or crossing wide the atlantic foam why in the newfound world which more to her than it is discoverer owes appears no structure sacred to her praise yet shall imagination rear the dome and fix the expressive marble hither come ye nymphs and swains with flowery garlands decked your polisht foreheads on the shaven green which fronts the temple ply your nimble feet the jocund dance inweaving hither come ye fauns and dryads hither glowing love and spotless beauty youth with radiant eye and blooming health while underneath the beech or oak which waves it is consecrated shade humanity and wisdom smiling view the festive throng mid whom the graces play and quitting their proud bowers and lofty hill the muses utter notes divinely sweet such as of yore they sung when
