the various kinds of the heart or rather stomachpain considered by peter von sarn m d at northampton  nemo tam divos habuit faventes crastinum ut possit sibi polliceri seneca poeta     northampton  printed by cluer dicey and sold by j lacy stationer at northampton john gregory at leicester mess fletcher and hodson cambridge mrs e rogers and w green bury st edmunds w chase and berry norwich w eaton and p garr yarmouth etc  the preface to the reader being not a native of this country see the letter to the impartial judicious benovolent and candid reader concerning the practice of physic page   though i have for more than thirteen years past been in it i might have written the following treatise with greater propriety of style in latin but then i apprehend it would not have been so generally understood and therefore i hope the candid reader will overlook any impropriety in the language  a pain of the heart or rather stomach is a disorder to which many of the human race are liable and as it springs from such a variety of causes the greatest accuracy imaginable is required in the composition of those medicines that are designed for its cure  the various kinds of the heart or rather stomachpain section i a pain in the upperopening or mouth of the stomach where the oesophagus or gullet ends etc is generally called heartpain etc  section ii this disorder is easily known but hard to remove and consequently is none of the least evils incident to human bodies being of the nature of those diseases which affect both mind and body  sect iii the immediate cause of this pain as it may arise from different disorders in the stomach cannot so easily be ascertained  sect iv as the stomach is provided with a variety of sinews and nerves and so of exquisite sensation a pain here must greatly affect those orifices situated near the pit of the stomach therefore that the patient may not be injured by unskilful treatment i shall beg leave to offer the following observations drawn from a long practice  sect v when after taking any sort of poison a tormenting pain follows let it be drawn off the stomach as soon as possible by a gentle emetic drinking after the vomit a quantity of fat muttonbroth  sect vi if the stomach is overloaded it may be proper if vomiting does not follow to provoke it etc  sect vii an accurate distinction ought to be made whether this pain comes only after eating and drinking or whether it was felt before if the latter all vomiting either voluntary or by emetics is dangerous  sect viii if a person eats things of a soft digestion and drinks emollient liquors and yet afterward feels pain it is an evidence that the cause of that pain is in the stomach and therefore cannot be cured by an emetic  sect ix upon the whole it is very difficult to find out the immediate cause of this pain whether it proceeds from taking something of a poisonous kind or from worms or some defect in the stomach itself or through acrimonious particles prevailing in the parts thereabout etc  sect x if a pain in the stomach is occasioned by worms or if it proceeds from a weakness of the stomach itself or arises from an acid acrimony vomits cannot free but increase the pain and however exact and careful a practitioner may be yet he will find it difficult to distinguish them from each other and without a proper distinction his prescriptions will be not only ineffectual but hurtful  sect xi if after too highliving etc a person is troubled with corrupted sour risings followed with an acute pain which ceases for a time when the sharp corrupted matter is discharged then this matter the cause of it must first be carried off by a vomit the stomach strengthened by a continuation of corroborating medicines and to prevent a return things hard of digestion or overloading the stomach avoided  sect xii but if the pain is occasioned by an inflammation erysipelas ulcerations etc all vomits and medicines of a disturbing nature must by all means be omitted because they not only augment the pain but most certainly prove mortal as too often happens by an unskilful application  in the cases abovementioned there is a continual pain in the stomach whether it is empty or full which increases after eating etc and if it causes the person to vomit it then becomes so excessive that fainting away instantaneously ensues  how judicious and skilful then should the physician be to find out proper medicines for that pain which the patient then labors under  sect xiii though this pain may proceed from the above different causes yet it may likewise arise from others for example the unnatural motion of the stomach occasioned by a fever in the year      there was an epidemic or endemic sweatingfever first in england afterward in other kingdoms etc terminating within    hours either in life or death the common symptoms called hydropyretos of this disorder were sudden weakness anxiety palpitation of the heart headache swooningaway a weak unequal pulse profuse sweating also a heart or stomachpain as well as the matter of the fever itself brought to the upper orifice of it causes an intolerable pain there which pain is heightened or diminished according as the fever increases or abates and in regard to the pain itself at that juncture vomits and hot medicines too often unskilfully given are not only ineffectual but prejudicial augmenting instead of asswaging the pain by causing violent reachings in this case a few drops of the tinct thebaic or sir e meconio mixed in the febrifuge mixtures are only serviceable  sect xiv this pain is brought also upon persons of a delicate and weak constitution by fretting uneasiness etc attended with great anxiety loss of appetite and strength strainings to vomit difficulty of breathing trembling a coldness of the extreme parts restlessness etc when the stomach cannot then bear any kind of meat or drink nor even a common spoonful of soft medicines much less the calefacientia or hot kind etc  sect xv this pain may likewise arise from a flatulent and windy disorder in the stomach and continue there for a time till expelled by the carminatives mixed with the anodines and though thus expelled yet it may return after eating drinking or sitting in the draught of a door window etc this pain is not dangerous though a person be subject to it through the whole course of his life  sect xvi should the rheumatism which sometimes flies from one part of the body to another and sometimes takes its seat in the muscular or membranous parts of it fall upon the stomach it may for a time produce a continual but not a dangerous pain because by proper application it may be expelled thence to the adjacent extremes e g under the breast bone shoulderblades arms wrist etc  sect xvii when an arthritic or gouty pain changes its seat from the chinagra the hands gonagra the knees or podagra the feet etc to the stomach leaving then the extreme parts free from pain the patient is in immediate danger of death unless the pain can be removed back again from the stomach to the extremities of the body therefore it is requisite in this case to have something to give always ready at hand  sect xviii but the most uncommon pain is caused by convulsions or spasm which communicates its ill effects through the whole nervous system and is discovered by its well known symptoms the cure must be directed according to the disease medicines given in small quantities every quarter of an hour till the pain ceases and then proper means used to prevent a return  sect xix thus have i treated the above disorder in as concise a manner as possible as it may arise from the various and different causes here subjoined  different causes of the heart or stomachpain acrimonious particles   convulsions    delicate constitutions    drinking   eating   erysipelas    fault of the stomach itself   fever    flatulency    gout    highliving    inflammation    overloading the stomach   poison   rheumatism    soft  digested eatables   spasm    ulcerations    weak constitution    weakness of the stomach  0 wind    worms    0 sect xx i might have greatly enlarged on this subject and interspersed it with proper prescriptions but that would have been incompatible with my present design this if found necessary shall be done hereafter  finis
