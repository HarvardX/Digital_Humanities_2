an explanation of the duties of religion for the use of boldre school in new forest  n b the small paper prefixed which is the groundwork of this explanation is distributed in little books among the children of the parish before they come to school  lymington printed by j b rutter       would you know whether you believe and live as a christian ought to do ask yourself these questions of faith i do i believe in god  do i believe that he is a being of infinite justice power wisdom and goodness  that he made and preserves every thing  that he is present every where  and knows all the thoughts and intentions of my heart  ii do i believe the holy scriptures to be the word of god  and that they contain all things necessary to salvation  iii do i believe in jesus christ the son of god  do i believe in the history of him contained in the holy scriptures  and particularly in that great article that he suffered death for the sins of mankind  iv do i believe that god will assist me by his holy spirit  v do i believe in a future state  in the resurrection of the dead  and in a last judgment  of practice i is my life consistent with my faith  that is does my faith govern my practice  does my belief in the justice and power of god make me reverence his laws and afraid of offending him  does my belief in his wisdom make me satisfied with my station in life and give me patience and resignation in my distresses  does my belief in his goodness excite me to love him  and is my belief of his continual presence a check on the badness of my thoughts words and actions  if my faith in god produce these effects have i such a sense of my dependence on him that i pray daily to him  do i go regularly to church to pray to him in public as well as in private  and do i remember what i hear and endeavor to live up to it  ii as i believe the holy scriptures to be the word of god do i read them with an intention to improve my heart and obey the precepts which i find in them  do i learn from them in the first place to abstain from every wickedness  if i have been led into sin do i immediately repent of it and not suffer it to become habitual  do i likewise learn from the holy scriptures to do good as well as to avoid evil  do i love my neighbor as my self  and do i do to others as i might reasonably desire them to do to me  do i endeavor to do my duty faithfully whatever

baptized into the faith of christ by one sacrament do i always when i can attend the other at the lords table  iv have i such an humble sense of my own weakness that i endeavor to obtain the assistance of the holy spirit of god knowing that without his assistance i can do nothing  v lastly does my belief in a future state and in the resurrection of the dead raise my thoughts above this mortal life  and does my belief in a last judgment make me in earnest careful to prepare myself for it  morning and evening prayers for the children o lord who command me both to believe and to live as a christian ought to do assist me by thy blessed spirit in obtaining that steadfast faith in thee that may govern all my actions  that i may stand in fear of offending thee from the consideration of thy power and justice  that i may love and obey thee from the persuasion of thy goodness  and that i may put my trust n thee and bear with patience every thing that befalls me from a full assurance of thy wisdom that having thus endeavored through faith in thee to perform my duty in this world i may be removed in thy good time to a better through the merits and atonement of jesus christ our savior amen  o lord god in whom i live and move and have my being accept my praise and thanksgiving for all thy mercies to me from the first moment of my birth to this time pardon all my past offenses and grant that i my seek my happiness only in obeying thee through jesus christ our lord amen  explanation of the foregoing paper i of faith or what a christian should believe question you are required you see both to believe and live as a christian ought to do what are you then required first to believe  answer i must believe in god  that he is a being of infinite justice power wisdom and goodness  q when you say you believe god is a being of infinite justice what do you mean  a i mean that god is just to all his creatures and particularly that he will reward and punish us in the next world according to our behavior in this  q what do you mean when you say he is a being of infinite power  a i mean that god can do every thing and that every thing that is done is done by him  q but why do you believe that when you know many things are done by men  a because it is through god that men are enabled to do any thing besides god makes the stone the iron the wood and all other things which men use  q what do you mean when you say god is a being of infinite wisdom  a i mean that god knows every thing and particularly what is best for us all  q and when you say god is a being of infinite goodness what do you mean  a i mean that his goodness is unbounded and that all the good we receive of every kind comes from him  q but you receive good sometimes from men  a yes but god enables them to do it by putting it into their hearts  by affording them opportunities  and by giving them the means so that all the good men do may properly be said to come from god  q you say farther you believe that god created and preserves every thing why do you believe that god created every thing  a because i see every where the marks of design  q what do do you mean by the marks of design  a i mean that when one part answers to another in any thing and an end is produced there are the marks of design or contrivance in that thing  q but you see these marks of design and contrivance in the works of men  you see in a house for instance the roof the door the windows and all the other parts related to each other  and an end produced by its affording a convenient shelter from the weather but you do not believe in god because you see the marks of design in a house  a no but as the marks of design in a house show me that it has been made by the skill and contrivance of men and not by chance so when i see superior marks of design in things which men cannot make  as in the sun  in plants  in beasts  in birds  in fishes  and numberless other things i conclude they are created by god  q tell me then what relation there is between the sun and the earth for instance and what ends are produced by it  a the sun draws vapors or particles of water both from the sea and land just in the same way as particles of water are formed by heat on the lid of a boiling pot these vapors which the sun draws up become clouds and are driven about by winds to different parts of the earth and when they fall in rain the end they produce is food for man and beast  the sun also gives light to the earth and warms it so as to make it fruitful  q how do you observe this relation of parts and end produced in plants  a the root is related to the earth and draws nourishment from it  the stem is related to the root and carries that nourishment up to the flower from which the end produced is the seed or fruit  q what marks of design do you see in animals  a they are all fitted to their several stations and the end produced is to fill every part of the world with living creatures all of which have their use tho we cannot find out the use of all  q how is the bird fitted for its station  a it has wings to fly with  it is made light  and sharppointed so as to pass easily through the air  q how is the fish fitted for its station  a it has fins to swim with and when it wants to go to the top of the water or to the bottom it has a little bladder which it can fill with air and empty as it chooses when the bladder is filled the fish is lighter than the water and rises to the top when the bladder is emptied the fish is heavier and sinks to the bottom  some fish keep constantly at the bottom because they find their food there  q how is the mole fitted for its way of life  a it has short broad feet with which it scrapes away the earth and as it has no business out of the ground its eyes are very small and just serve to show it that it has lost its way when it gets into the light  q thus then in the same manner every creature is fitted for the station it lives in which shows they are all created by an almighty power and not by chance  but you say you believe god preserves the world as well as created it what do you mean by gods preserving the world  a i mean that he keeps it in the same order in which he at first created it  q why do you believe that  a because if god did not keep it in order it would fall to decay just as a house would fall to decay if it were not kept in order it is through a belief that god preserves the world that all the affairs of life are carried on we eat and drink because we believe the life of man will be nourished by food as it always has been we plant trees and sow corn because we believe they will grow as they have ever done for our use and sustenance if god did not preserve the world in its regular order corn might produce weeds  q you say you believe farther tha god is present every where but how do that differ from your being present every where you can be in this place and in tha place and in many different places  a i can only be in one place at one time but god is in all places at the same instant o time  q why do you believe that  a it follows from gods preserving the world as he preserves every part of it at once he must be present in every part at once  besides if god was not in all places at once h would order the people of one country to pray to him at one time and the people o another country to pray to him at another but as they may pray to him all at once it i plain he can hear them all at once  q you say you believe god knows a the thoughts and intentions of your hear why do you believe that  a because as god made me he mu know every part about me just as a man th makes a house must be acquainted with the inside as well as the outside and all the parts about it  ii q you next say you believe the holy scriptures to be the word of god what do you mean by the holy scriptures  a the bible and testament  q why are they called the word of god  a because holy men wrote them by gods order  q what do you mean when you say they contain all things necessary to salvation  a i mean that they contain all things necessary for us to know and do in order to gain gods avour and everlasting happiness  q but there are many difficulties in the scriptures both in the old and new testament and many things which we do not understand how then can they be of use to us  a there is enough in them which we do understand that is sufficient to lead us right  q but why should there be any difficulties in books meant to be of such use to us  a in the old testament many difficulties arise from our not considering that god acted in a different manner in the early ages of the world and particularly toward the jews from that in which he acts now  besides we make difficulties ourselves by supposing that many actions are allowable because they are done by good men whereas in fact many of these actions were never intended for our imitation some of them were bad in themselves and many things tho allowed under the law of moses are not permitted by the gospel  lastly as the bible is the oldest book that ever was written it may be supposed that many things may have become obscure and difficult through length of time  q but we find difficulties also in the new testament  a it is generally supposed there are much fewer than might have been expected from its ancient date and from the jewish ways of speaking and jewish customs which we find in it and which are so different from ours  q give me an instance of some way of speaking among the jews that is different from ours  a our savior says he that hates not his father and mother cannot be my disciple but he means only that we should love god better than we do our fathers and mothers  and the jews understood it in that sense  again where it is said jacob have i loved and esau have i hated nothing is meant but that god intended to raise the jewish nation from jacob  q what instances can you give me of difficulties arising from jewish customs  a we are told that a man was let down through the tiling of a house before jesus this would be difficult in our houses but was very easy in a jewish house which was often only one story high  had a flat roof  and sometimes a trap door through the roof into the chamber below with stairs on the outside so that nothing was easier than to carry the man to the top of the house and let him down through the roof  to such houses our savior alludes when he says he that is on the housetop let him not come down into the house and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye from the housetop which was the most convenient way of speaking to the people because the windows were high and latticed  when we are told also that new wine will burst old bottles it is easy to conceive it when we know that the jewish bottles were made of leather  again we read in the story of the good samaritan that he pulled out twopence and gave it to the host which appears to us a very trifling sum but the penny that passed in judea was somewhat more than seven pence of our money so that twopence was as much as fifteen or sixteen pence with us and as things were cheaper in judea than they are here fifteen or sixteen pence would buy as much as four or five shillings could buy now  q but still the scripture may be false what reason have you for believing it is true  a because there were people alive when it was written who could remember the miracles and other things mentioned and could compare the things done with the things that were written and if it had been found to mention things that had never been done it would not have been suffered to come down to us as true  learned men also can even trace up the new testament from its being mentioned in different books to the very time when it was written  iii q as you believe the scripture therefore to be true you believe next in jesus christ the son of god  and in the history of him as contained in the new testament let me hear you repeat the history of jesus christ as it is drawn up in the creed  a i believe that he was born of the virgin mary  suffered under pontius pilate  was crucified  dead  and buried  he descended into hell  the third day he rose again from the dead  he ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of god the father almighty from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead  q what do you mean by christs descending into hell  a only that his soul and body were separated  that is that he really died hell means only the grave  q what is the great article that you believe with regard to jesus christ  a that he suffered death for the sins of mankind  q but how came mankind to want a savior to suffer death for their sins  a because on adams transgression all his posterity became corrupt and subject to gods displeasure  q in what did adams transgression consist  a in eating the forbidden fruit  q but does it not appear very hard that god almighty should punish adam so much merely for eating an apple or whatever the forbidden fruit was  a the sin did not consist in eating the fruit but in disobeying god god placed adam in a state of trial as he places us but as it was before the world had any people in it his trial must have been in some very easy thing he could not be guilty of theft or envy or covetousness or bearing false witness or almost any of the crimes which are now forbidden because there were then no inhabitants in the world nor could he practice many of the duties which men now practice he could not be charitable nor forgive injuries nor honor his father and mother and as he lived in a garden nothing could be more natural than to put his obedience to the test of refraining from a certain tree  q but does it not seem hard that adams posterity should suffer through his fault  a it does not appear that he had any posterity at the time of the fall so that his children could not properly be said to lose what they never possessed  q as christ redeemed us then from the mischiefs of the fall of adam let me know in what way his sufferings atoned for the sins of mankind  a it is impossible for any body to answer that question but as i believe the scripture to be true i believe in the atonement of christ which is the plain doctrine of scripture tho i do not understand it i believe the fact tho i cannot explain it  q but why should not the scripture explain it  a because if they did we should not be able to understand them there are some things in the scriptures which relate to god and other things which relate to man secret things we are told belong unto the lord we may however believe these things tho we do not understand them it is enough if we have sufficient proof that the scriptures are true and that what relates to ourselves is plain and easy  q what then are the thoughts which the sufferings of jesus christ should raise in our minds  a we should reflect with the highest gratitude on his great kindness in laying down his life for our sake we should think with the deepest humility on our sinful nature which occasioned it and always have in our minds how ungrateful we are if we do not leave off our sins and lead good lives which is all the return he requires  iv q you say you next believe that god will assist you with his holy spirit what makes the assistance of gods holy spirit necessary  a mankinds corrupt and sinful nature since the fall of adam the scriptures tell us we can do no good thing without the assistance of the spirit of god  q if that be the case and we can do nothing good without the assistance of the spirit of god what good is there in any thing we can do for the spirit of god does it for us  a we have a choice either to listen to the holy spirit of god or to the temptations of the world and our goodness depends on little more than that choice god also gives us opportunities of being good and we may improve them or throw them behind us as we choose if we improve them his holy spirit will farther assist us  q but what reason have you to believe the holy spirit of god will assist you or acts within you as you cannot feel it  a my not feeling it is no more a reason for my disbelieving it than my not feeling my soul is a reason for my disbelieving i have one as the scriptures therefore assure me i shall be assisted by the holy spirit of god and as it is not in the least more difficult to believe than the union of my soul and body i believe it  v q you say you next believe in a future state what do you believe about a future state  a i believe that when i die i shall not perish but shall live hereafter in a state of happiness or of misery  q and when you say you believe in the resurrection of the dead what do you mean  a i mean that my body shall rise from the grave and be united again to my soul  q do you mean that the dust into which your body will be crumbled shall become again a living body  a yes there is no more reason for my disbelieving that god will raise my body again from the dust than that god created man at first out of dust so i believe the scripture account of both  besides i see many things in the world like such a resurrection i see trees dying in winter and reviving in summer i see corn buried in the earth and shooting up again in the spring  q do you believe it will be the same body  a what kind of body it will be i do not know we have reason to believe from scripture that in some way it will be the same body and yet that the blessed will in some way receive glorified bodies  q you say farther you believe in a last judgment what do you believe with regard to a last judgment  a i believe that at the end of this world we shall be called into judgment for what we have done while we lived upon earth and that we shall be rewarded or punished as we have obeyed or disobeyed the commandments of god  q by whom shall we be judged  a by jesus christ  q the scriptures no doubt speak frequently of a future judgment but are there any appearances in this world which tend to confirm the scripture account  a yes many this world has every where the appearance of a state of trial  rather than of a state of full reward and punishment we see many inequalities in it  virtue often afflicted  and vice in prosperity these things in a state of trial are easily accounted for but certainly show that some future state is to be expected when rewards and punishments shall in exact proportion be distributed  of practice or a good life i q thus far relates to your faith or to what you believe but is that all that is required of a christian  a no his faith is of no value if his life be not consistent with it his faith must govern his actions and produce good works as a good tree produces good fruit  q you say then you believe in the justice and power of god that is you believe he will render exact justice to you hereafter and treat you in the next world as you have lived in this and likewise that he has the power to reward you with the greatest happiness or punish you with the greatest misery  now if you really believe these things what effect should they have upon you  a they should make me reverence gods laws and afraid of offending him  q you say you believe in the infinite wisdom of god that is that god knows every thing and particularly what is best for us all if you really do believe this what effect should it have upon you  a it should make me satisfied with my station in life and give me patience and resignation in all the afflictions god is pleased to lay upon me  q you say you believe in the goodness of god that is that all the good you receive of every kind comes from god what is the good you receive from god  a my life  food  raiment  every thing i have yet as god lays no stress either on riches or poverty but considers them both as the means of trial only the great good i hope from god is the happiness of the next world in comparison with which the riches of this world are nothing  q in what does the happiness of the next world consist  a we can know only what the scriptures tell us they do not explain the happiness of the next world but just inform us that it will be very great and god almighty expects we should believe and trust in him for the completion of his promises  that is he expects we should rely upon his word  a if then you really believe you are indebted to god for all this goodness both here and hereafter what effect should it have upon you  a it should excite me to love him and to show that love by keeping his commandments and feeling my chief pleasure in obeying him it should lessen also my love for this world and increase my faith in the promises of the next  q you say farther that you believe god is every where present and knows all the thoughts and intentions of your heart if you really believe this what effect should it have upon you  a it should be a check on the badness of my thoughts words and actions if a bad thought should ever come into mind i should immediately turn it out when i consider that god sees it  q if then you truly and sincerely believe in the infinite power the wisdom and goodness of god  that every thing you have or hope for comes from him  that he is present every where and knows all your thoughts  your faith in this beneficent being will naturally give you such a dependence on him as will incline you to pray to him what ought to be the subject of your prayers  a i ought to praise god for his mercies  to beg his pardon for my sins through the atonement of christ  to pray for the assistance of his holy spirit in all my religious duties  and for his blessing on all my worldly concerns  q but is it sufficient to pray to god in private  a no family prayer is highly proper and may be used in most families but public worship at church should be omitted by none  q how does it appear to be a duty to go to church  a we have our saviors example who used on the sabbath day to go to the synagogue which was the jewish church  public worship also is frequently recommended in different parts of scripture indeed all people want either to have their duty explained or to be reminded of it  ii q the next thing you say you believe is that the holy scriptures are the word of god if you really believe they are the word of god how should you read them  a with an intention to improve my heart by believing the doctrines and obeying the precepts contained in them  q what do you mean by the doctrines of scripture  a i mean particularly the divinity of our blessed savior  his atonement for the sins of mankind  the assistance of the holy spirit  the resurrection of the dead  and a last judgment  q and what is the great end of the precepts you find in the scriptures  a to teach us to avoid wickedness and practice goodness  q as wickedness surrounds you on every side it is always right to have an eye upon such sins as most easily beset you what sins should you particularly avoid  a a disregard to god and religion  sabbathbreaking  swearing  lying  cheating  envy  malice  hatred  lewd discourse and actions the catechism comprehends all sin under the world  the flesh  and the devil  the world affords temptations  the flesh or our own bad desires are suited to those temptations  and the devil we are told is continually drawing us into them  q what does the scripture require if you have been unhappily drawn into sin  a it requires us to repent of it that it may not become habitual  q what do you mean by habitual sin  a a sin that is committed over and over without any check of conscience as some wicked people for instance have gotten so vile a custom of swearing that they will sometimes swear and hardly know when they swear  q and is their not knowing when they swear an excuse for them  a no because they have brought themselves into that condition through their own fault  q so again when people get drunk and commit mischief is their drunkenness an excuse for them  a no the same reason holds against them in this case also they were drunk through their own fault  q what do you mean by repenting  a i mean not only being sorry for what i have done amiss and changing my life but changing also my very thoughts and wishes  q suppose you had told a lie and had been punished for it and therefore were afraid of telling a lie again is that repenting of it  a no it is only being afraid of punishment  q but suppose you had told a lie and yet would not tell another tho you were sure nobody could find you out is that repenting of it  a yes because in that case i am not afraid of punishment but of doing a wrong thing  q and on a supposition that you truly repent of your sins what do you hope from god  a i humbly hope that my sins will be blotted out through the merits of christ  that my own endeavors will be assisted by gods holy spirit  and that i shall be reconciled to god and restored to his favor  q but you learn from the holy scriptures you say to practice goodness as well as to avoid wickedness  to love your neighbor in the first place as yourself what do you mean by loving your neighbor as yourself  a i mean being as ready to do good to him as to receive good from him  q whom do you mean by your neighbor  a all mankind as appears from many parts of scripture but especially from our saviors parable of the good samaritan the jews considered the samaritans as enemies and as we learn from the parable to do good to our enemies it surely follows that we should do good to all mankind  q how are you to act in order to do to others as you might reasonably desire them to do to you  a whenever i am going to do any thing to another and am doubtful whether it be right i should ask myself whether in the same case i should like to have it done to me and if i should not i may be sure it is not right that i should do it to another  q what do you mean by doing your duty faithfully whatever your station is as to the lord and not unto man  a i mean that i should consider myself as a part of gods great family which consists of all mankind in this great family god places some high and others low but every person has his station to fill which he should endeavor to fill faithfully and as god is our great master our first reason for doing our duty should be to please him  q how should the rich fill their stations  a they should consider them as trusts intended for the general good different stations are necessary for the good of all every one at sight must acknowledge that neither the government of a family a parish or a country could subsist if all were on an equality tho the rich therefore must live in a degree suitable to their several stations they must have an especial care not to suffer that notion to carry them into extravagance or the neglect of the great duty of distributing from their abundance among their poorer neighbors if they are so absurd as to conceive that god almighty has placed them in superior stations out of any particular regard which he has for them and so leaves them at liberty to spend all they have upon themselves they will in the end find themselves sadly mistaken and will have a strict account to give as our blessed savior tells them of the talents with which they have been entrusted  q how should the poor person fill his station so as to please god  a he should do all the good in his power with his little and be content also and satisfied with his station he may assure himself that if he be religious frugal and industrious he may enjoy all the real happiness which this world is capable of giving his industry and frugality will supply him with the necessaries of life and his religion will teach him that a mans life that is his happiness consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses  q on a supposition that she rich and poor fill their stations equally well how will god reward them  a just alike as appears from different parts of scripture but particularly from the widows mite she could do very little in comparison with the rich and yet christ says she did more than they all  that is she had a better disposition  q what do you mean by increasing in goodness  a getting more and more the better of my bad habits  q how are you to know you are in earnest  a when i feel more pleasure in obeying god than in committing sin  q why should a christian be advancing always toward perfection  a because if he do not always endeavor to be better than he is it is much to be feared he is growing worse true religion always makes a man wish to be better  iii q you say you next believe in jesus christ the son of god and particularly in that great article of his suffering death for the sins of mankind if you really believe this what do you trust in for salvation  a in the merits of jesus christ not in any thing i can do for myself  q will the merits then of jesus christ save you if you are wicked  a not unless i repent  q but if you are good can you be saved without the merits of jesus christ  a i can never be so good as to deserve the happiness of everlasting life my sins will deserve punishment and i shall still want something to save me from their effects  q how then do the merits of jesus christ save you  a i must endeavor sincerely to be good and then the merits of jesus christ will procure me pardon for my repented sins and make up what i cannot do myself  q but can you do any thing yourself toward obtaining salvation  a i am assured that after all i am an unprofitable servant but god is pleased to accept my imperfect services through the merits of jesus christ  q but now besides the religious duties which the gospel points out our blessed savior has ordained the two sacraments of baptism and the lords supper which in themselves are things indifferent but are rendered binding from their being appointed by him what is the intention of these two ceremonies  a in general they are the sigus of our receiving christianity and of gods giving us the privileges of it  q but what is the particular intention of each  a baptism is intended by our blessed savior as the introduction or entrance into his religion  and the lords supper is intended to preserve in our minds the devout remembrance of his death and atonement  q the sacraments you see then are not only the signs of our receiving the privileges of christianity but they hold out to us the two greatest truths of our religion what are those truths  a baptism holds out to us that we are fallen sinners by showing us through the sign of water that we must be purified by the grace of the gospel  and the lords supper shows us by the signs of bread and wine that we can only be pardoned through the atoneing blood of christ  q but now as christ has ordained both these sacraments why do not all christians think it as necessary to receive the sacrament of the lords supper as to bring their children to be baptized  a they ought but some neglect it as they do other good things and some are afraid of texts of scripture which they do not understand  q what texts of scripture are they afraid of  a chiefly of a passage in st paul where he says he that eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself  q to whom is the expression of eating and drinking unworthily applied  a it is applied chiefly to the corinthians who were guilty of drunkenness and other crimes when they received the lords supper which was administered then in private houses and often at the time of feasting whereas we who receive it in churches where there is no feasting cannot be guilty of the same wicked practices of which the corinthians were guilty tho at the same time we may receive the sacrament unworthily if we do not piously remember the death and atonement of christ when we receive it and resolve as far as we can to forsake our sins which were the cause of his death  q what do mean by eating and drinking damnation to yourself  a this is still applied to the unworthy manner in which the corinthians received the lords supper tho the word damnation means only that god will condemn us or be angry with us for eating and drinking unworthily as he is for all other wicked things but it does not mean that we shall certainly be damned for it  q what reason is there for your receiving the sacrament of baptism only once and the sacrament of the lords supper frequently  a because we can only once enter into the christian religion but we are required frequently to show that we are members of it by remembering the death and atonement of our blessed savior and by renewing the engagements which we made when we became members of his holy religion  iv q you said you believed that god would assist you by his holy spirit as you could do nothing to please god without his assistance how is the assistance of his holy spirit to be obtained  a i must first pray to god through the mediation of christ for this holy assistance and at the same time i must use my own best endeavors in doing what i can myself trusting in god that he will enable me to overcome such temptations as i could not overcome without his assistance  v q lastly you say you believe in a future state and in the resurrection of the dead  that is you say you believe you shall live in another world after you leave this and that even your body will not remain in the grave but will rise again and be joined to your soul if then you really and sincerely believe all this what effect should it have upon you  a it should raise my thoughts above this mortal life i should not think entirely about this world but consider that i am to live in another world after this and tho while i live in this world it is necessary for me to think about its concerns yet when i consider that in the next world i am to live for ever and in this world only a few years it is certainly right that i should think more about the next world than about this  q you say likewise that you believe in a last judgment  that is you say you believe that hereafter you shall be called to account for every thing you have done in this world and that you shall be rewarded or punished according to what you have done now if you really believe this great truth how should you be affected by it  a i should be in earnest careful to prepare my self for this awful judgment by sincerely endeavoring to do my duty to god and man or in other words by believing and living as a christian ought to do  the end a prayer almighty god who through thy good providence has added one day more to our lives graciously accept our praise and thanksgiving for this and all thy other mercies  for our creation  our constant preservation  and particularly for the hopes of future happiness which thou have given us through our lord jesus christ  that we may turn all thy mercies as thou intendest them into blessings grant us the assistance of thy holy spirit to make this and every day an improvement of the last may we always consider thou have created us to make us happy in heaven if it be not through our own fault grant therefore o lord that we may consider sin of every kind as the worst of all evils because it will destroy our souls  and if through the frailty of human nature we should be so unhappy as to displease thee by doing what we know is wrong grant us thy grace immediately to repent and forsake it from our hearts imploring thy forgiveness through the merits of jesus christ who died to redeem us from sin  let thy holy spirit o lord guide and direct us in all our affairs both spiritual and temporal to thee we commend ourselves this morning evening relying on thy holy protection and guarded against temptation by the knowledge of thy continual presence may we all humbly endeavor to please thee and having performed our duty faithfully in this world may we so pass through things temporal that we may finally obtain the things eternal through jesus christ our lord in whose words we farther call upon thee  our father etc
