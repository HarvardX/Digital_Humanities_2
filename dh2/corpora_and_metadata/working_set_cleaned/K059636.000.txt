some papers relating to the general draining of marshland in the county of norfolk  with mr bernerss objections and proposals  as also an answer to those objections and proposals etc  by peter bateson  favete adeste aequo animo and rem cognoscite vt pernoscatis ecquid spei sit reliquum ter prol andr printed in the year    0  a map of marshland in norfolk by sr wm dugdale with additions and amendments   some remarks concerning the outfals of the country of marshland presented to the court of sewers held at lyn october      0  to the worshipful commissioners of sewers gentlemen on monday last i humbly offered some remarks to the consideration of those gentlemen who in pursuance of your order met to view knightsgool accordingly my paper was read and laid upon the table but some there present privately conveyed it away and so suppressed it i shall therefore beg leave to contract those remarks and proofs into a narrower compass seeing my occasions would not permit me to transcribe the whole  the remarks with all submission were these   st that our ancestors intended knightsgool for an outlet to carry off the waters which annoyed marshland   dly that the said gool did in former days actually answer those their intentions   dly but that now it is impossible for a gool in that situation or string to be so serviceable as formerly   thly that nevertheless there is yet a way left to drain the country and consequently restore it to its ancient prosperity  the proof of the first i there intimated depended upon the proof of the second and for this reason because if the country was absolutely drained by means of knightsgool then no doubt our ancestors intended it should do so  the second i proved from what mr camden observed in his britannia viz that the smeth fed thirty thousand sheep which was impossible to be done if both the fenn and smeth had not been then as good and as dry as our best pastures are now i offered also to prove it by credible witnesses who have seen both fenn and smeth fed with all sorts of young cattle as well as sheep but this was before the sluices were erected  the third i proved from the rivers being silted up which plainly appeared a little before the lyncase was heard in parliament by plumming it on both sides of denversluces at which time it was found if i mistake not to be deeper by ten foot on the other side than on this i proved it also by an experiment of my own in may i plummd marshlandfenn in diverse places some were six foot but the ordinary level was between four and five foot deep i took the fall also of the sewerwaters into the river and it was but one and twenty inches so that this gool in this situation and during these obstructions can never it is plain carry off near six five or four foot  the last remark i made good from the following observations tuesday the   th of may last the height of the flood was taken both at lyn and at knightsgool the same morning it then flowed at lyn fourteen foot nine inches and at knightsgool eight foot five inches the   th the same was repeated at the same places and then it flowed at lyn thirteen foot four inches and at knightsgool seven foot the difference you may perceive is six foot four inches which is the fall from knightsgool to lyn from these observations i inferred that a new cut to lyn would effectually drain the whole country i also mentioned some advantages attending a new cut  which are these   st several thousands of acres would become as good lands for pasture and tillage as ever   dly upon a breach in the seabanks the waters would be conveyed to sea more speedily   dly a great part of the inhabitants would have the convenience of watercarriage in winter   thly and the country by evacuating the stagnated waters would be rendered much more healthful  here i urged the fatal consequences of another breach without a better outfal and then answered two objections against a new cut which were these   st that the charge would be very great and   dly that over and above the charge an act of parliament must be obtained for the doing it  in answer to the first i opposed the advantages which will abundantly recompense the costs and not only so but if things be equally adjusted there will be above forty thousand acres to bear the burden and lastly the work when finished will be effectual for ages  to the second i answered that a little more than an halfpenny acreshot would procure it and that the money so laid out would be to much better purpose than to lay out several hundreds of pounds upon the repair of this gool as was lately done without reaping any benefit thereby  this gentlemen was the sum and substance of the paper which i presented on monday the day of the view i have nothing more to add but only to desire that this court if it sees fit would please to appoint a surveyor to try these experiments after me and then perhaps you would be more fully informed and satisfied of the insufficiency of the present outfal and if carried into lynhaven of its future goodness and sufficiency to drain the country of marshland entirely  the case of the highlands and lowlands of marshland as to their common defense and preservation by drains and banks the cuts and drains belonging to the level of marshland were at first made and designed to carry off the fresh and salt waters which might at any time chance to annoy or surround the same  and for the voiding such nuisance both high and lowlands were formerly and are  argd to some drain or other  for the same purpose the greatest part of the said high and lowlands do maintain one common sewer leading to its outlet into the river of owse  so that when the outfal was good all those lands which paid to the same were laid dry and consequently they were then not only all equally charged but all equally benefited  but that now by the rivers being silted up the said outfal is and has been for several years past very much impaired and obstructed  from whence arise these inequalities  the highlands are charged to these sewers and gools and reap the sole benefit of em  the lowlands are charged to the said sewers and gools in proportion to the highlands and receive no manner of benefit thereby  the highlands when surcharged with sudden downfalls let go their stops and dams and so pour their waters upon the lowlands  the lowlands do naturally and must of necessity lodge all those waters which the outfal cannot carry off  it is plain therefore that the lowlands instead of being equally profited with the highlands by these common sewers and gools are most grievously oppressed by the highlands themselves  as to the banks incompassing marshland they are the old and new podikes together with the river and seabanks erected at first to defend and preserve the said country from fresh and salt waters  to this end all the high and lowlands within the said level are adjoysted as equally as may be in all the said banks  the highlands it is notorious receive great advantages by these banks  the lowlands it is as notorious receive none at all  to set this matter in a clearer light  some thousands of acres of land most of which when drained may vye with the richest natural soils in the queens dominions have been for sundry years past and now are continually overflown with waters some one some two some three and so on gradually to six foot deep  in this case it is evident if all the seabanks and podikebanks were thrown down that these lowlands could not be in a worse condition than now they are but surely under these miserable circumstances the highlands would suffer extremely  from the premises may be inferred  that either the surface of the lowlands should be raised to an equal level with the highlands that so all the lands may share alike in the advantages and charges of the public drains and banks  or else that the lowlands should be quite discharged of all banks and drains seeing they have no benefit by em  or lastly that there should be a new cut to lyn which will certainly carry off all the annoying waters and then all the lands both high and low will be not only equally charged but equally benefitted  the  st of these disjunctives may be looked upon as impracticable seeing these latter ages have not produced any pretenders to the old way of removing mountains  the  d though reasonable will hardly ever be complied with because the owners of those lands which alone receive safeguard preservation and profit from those banks and drains must in that case uphold them at their sole expense  the  d and last therefore being a method not only the most feasible and equitable but also the least liable to exceptions of any other seeing it is the very same that our ancestors took to preserve the country seems to have the best pretensions to the consideration of the commissioners of sewers but if they think it be not in their power to make a law for a new sewer and gool where never any were cut or erected before though several great in the    and    eliz the then two chief justices popham and anderson delivered their opinions that new works might be erected by virtue of the stat    hen   see the second edit of callis his reading upon the stat p    and the same point happened to be controverted in king j   reign whereupon his attorney general sir hen hobert plainly proved this power of the commissioners from an express clause in the commission it self see dugdales hist of imb and drain page     lawyers are of opinion nay one of our in the    jac upon an appeal to the king and council the same controversy still depending the order of council runs thus their lordships finding in their wisdoms that it can neither stand with law nor with common sense or reason that in a cause of so great consequence the law can be so void of providence as to restrain the commissioners of sewers from making new works  restrain  fury of the waters did order etc see callis page        00  0  and  0  kings and his privy council have in a solemn and judicial manner declared their commission warrants their so doing when the necessities and good of the country require such works i say if after all that has been said those worthy patriots still scruple their own authority in these matters yet it is hoped they will to the best of their knowledge and power endeavor the redress reformation and amendment of the grievances complained of by a due and impartial representation of em to the queen and her council  note the court immediately after the reading of these papers abovementioned voted nomine contradicente the order following which you may perceive is grounded upon a presentment of the jury to that purpose as also upon diverse petitions of numerous landowners norf ss at a general session of sewers holden at kings lyn for the said county on wednesday the   th day of may in the eighth year of the reign of our sovereign lady anne over great britain france and ireland queen defender of the faith etc ann dom   0  by and before henry chennery esquire mayor of kings lynn sir john turner knt hatton berners james host william cony samuel tailor charles turner henry bell robert awborne william stafford and william pierson esquires and henry towers gent commissioners of sewers amongst others assigned whereas it was presented by the jury of freebridge citra lynn cum partibus marshland in manner following viz we present the extreme bad condition of the country of marshland whose ancient outfal at knights gool after vast sums of money expended upon it is at this time and has been for a succession of years insufficient for the carrying off to sea the waters which infest the same by means of which waters so surrounding a large tract of land noted and highly esteemed by our predecessors and some now alive for their exceeding fruitfulness and goodness a great part of the said country is miserably wasted the common of the fen and some part of the smeth almost ruined private owners of particular levels excessively burdened by endeavoring in vain to keep up banks about them and by raising and maintaining new invented and artificial machines for their security and lastly the roads for heavy carriages are become unpassable we therefore humbly pray that this court will order some person or persons of probity and skill to find out a sufficient outfal if such an one may be had for the said country seeing the old one has been found by woeful experience to be insufficient for sundry years past to attain the ends which our ancestors when they chose that situation had in view and actually afterward attained viz the draining the country of marshland if this honorable court shall think fit and whereas several petitions of numerous landowners of the country of marshland were this day exhibited into this court to the same or the like effect humbly praying that a suitable remedy may be had to and for the deplorable condition of that country which has been of thirty seven years continuance this court taking the matters in the said presentment and petition contained into their consideration and being well satisfied that the same are of the greatest weight and importance to the said landowners and that there is a necessity for some speedy course and remedy to be taken for relief of the many sufferers under the great mischiefs and calamities therein complained of have thought fit to order and resolve and it is this day ordered by this court that it be referred to all the commissioners at this session present or any five or more of them to enquire into the premises and to consider such ways and means as may be most proper for the ease and relief of the said country in this behalf and for that purpose they are desired to meet from time to time as they shall appoint and to take to their assistance such able and experienced surveyors and other persons skilful in draining and other works of sewers as they shall think fit and to inform themselves of the necessity and reasonableness of the matters in the said presentment and petitions prayed and proposed and to make an estimate of the charge and expense of such or any other works that shall be thought necessary for those ends and to continue such their meetings from time to time as occasion may require and that the clerk of this court together with the expenditors of marshland do attend the said commissioners at such their meetings and that timely notice be given by the expenditors to all the commissioners of sewers to whom it is so referred and to the dikereeves of each township of the time and place of the first meeting to the end that such as shall think  may be present and attend the same  note this order was never duly executed in any part of it but on the contrary mr berners the eldest commissioner i suppose had prepared the following objections and proposals which were read in open court the sessions following  some objections against mr batesons paper presented to the court of sewers held at lyn com norff october  th   0 concerning the outfals of marshland and some proposals for a much more speedy and effectual way to drain the country humbly offered to the said court october      0  that a great quantity of marshland instead of being profitable to the owners has for diverse years last been very chargeable to them because their two great outfals upon foul weather at sea and at other times are choked up with the silt dropping all along in its course to the sluices at salters load and settling there for want of the length of the return of the tide to grind it off as formerly is a truth too well known not to seek a remedy but since art may be the help of this misfortune as well as it is of nature the dropsy in the common fen now affecting the vitals i mean drowning the adjacent lands of several persons i thought it worth the while of one whose interest is complicated with his duty to prescribe ways and means for its revovery  but that a new cut of eight miles long cross the hundred to lynhaven should in the least conduce thereunto will be judged most uncertain i believe and improbable when it is considered   st upon digging this new and long tract how various the sorts of earth will be here a stuborn clay there a spewing silt at another place a black moore and the red earth then reedroots and hassocks which will often founder and slip into the work   dly in so long a drain the sewer must have many elbows and crooked turns in it running much flower for its length and the obstacles of so many bridges which must necessarily be made over it for the intercourse of the inhabitants of the several towns of this country which is to be cut into halves since it is eight miles long and broad not to mention the difficulties of making the brink stand  so well sessd off   dly the time it will take to perfect this work with the  000 l it will cost as mr bateson says and an act of parliament to satisfy all interests upon cutting away their lands etc and making droves to their grounds not that i think the country would regret any reasonable charge upon the prospect of its doing service but grant it possible to level hills with valleys for so it is in many places that almost an insupportable charge will be entailed upon this age and posterity by this new channel eight miles long since lately the dyking out but a part of an old sewer cost eight shillings a rod besides the charge of throwing off the earth   thly the gauging at sea and the inland waters seems most doubtful since the height of the freshes is often succeeded by droughts and the outfals even at old lyn are deep or shallow according to the set of ebb and tide agitated by the winds besides the marshes where this new cut is designed as i am told and is visible are above three feet higher than the level so that the digging there must be nearer the antipodes than in other places or force the waters up hill  not to think of these difficulties and by a speedy much less chargeable and according to humane conjecture more certain way to restore this spot of earth to that flourishing condition it enjoyed most part of the last century and some ages before i would with all submission propose   st that it be the care of the officers of the country and that they be enjoined and encouraged by their winter circuits to keep out all foreign waters which run without any law into marshland which was constantly given in charge by our ancestors and to reinforce the law of this court of the  0th of king james for erecting two houses at distances upon the old podike for laborers to live in to prevent the cutting of it by which the downfall of  000 acres run into the fen continually when as we can run out but four hours in twelve at the river   dly that lords bridge be lengthened by those who have the privilege to set one net there being the first bridge through which the freshes in a strait line descend to the ouze and that the great letts stops and annoyances by laying gregs and fish trunks cross the great drain be removed and the netts with the diverse sorts of impediments upon islingtoncommon be taken away   dly that two substantial engines or mills be placed upon the great load which is very strait and but a mile and half from the neck of marshland fen to the two goats or gools which by the experience of our next neighbors and our friends abroad has been very successful to ride the waters at sea by raising and hastening the freshes thither for which a law of this court was to have been provided   thly that the sole of the old gool be sunk two foot being its old foundation and that the new jetty at islington shore be forthwith rooted up being set down for the particular interest of one town only and that by an order only it having been exclaimed against as the chief cause of silting the string and choking the mouth of the old gool and has made the new gool very sickly and chargeable at which passengers smile as well as the engineer from portsmouth when complaint was made to him of the outfals asking what it did there  these things being accomplished since by natural situation we have so good a current the south and southwest winds being the frequentest in the year blowing upon it and by the great prudence of our fore fathers the chief sewer being very strait less than two miles to sea and consequently more quick and rapid it is more than probable that for the expense of fewer hundred pounds than mr bateson says thousands for the new cut of eight miles long cross the country this angle may become as formerly the envy of some other places and by the soundness of their commons the profits of their severals the healthfulness of their climate the goodness of their highways and their ease of acreshots may attain to its former credit and prosperity  this is gratefully presented to the members of this court who have always received and countenanced overtures of this kind and never spared their pains upon views for the welfare of these parts which has encouraged me to show the impossibility of this eight mile project and to demonstrate in opposition to the proverb that in this case the farthest way about is not the nearest way home  an answer to some objecions of hatton berners esquire against a paper intitled some remarks concerning the outfals of the country of marshland etc  as also an answer to his proposals for a much more speedy and effectual way to drain the country than by a new cut and natural fall  by peter bateson  printed in the year    0  an answer to mr bernerss objections and proposals object   upon digging this new and long tract how various the sorts of earth will be here a stuborn clay there a spewing silt at another place a black moore and the red earth then reedroots and hassocks which will often founder and slip into the work  answ to which i answer if variety of earths be an obection of any force now a days then it was an objection of force in those days when our ancestors cut the old sewer out of the whole ground but it is plain that our ancestors either looked upon this objection as altogether trifling and frivolous or else it was never urged to em because the old sewer for all the objector knows was cut through all these several sorts of earth without foundring or slipping into the work in short the objection will equally hold against all undertakings of this nature and therefore cannot affect this in particular   d object in so long a drain the sewer must have many elbows and crooked turns in it running much slower for its length and the obstacles of so many bridges which must necessarily be made over it for the intercourse of the inhabitants of the several towns of this country which is to be cut into halves since it is eight miles long and broad not to mention the difficulties of making the brink stand though never so well sessd off  answ this is also an objection in generals only against all works of sewers of this kind yet because it seems to consist of several articles which may be thought to have some weight in them when altogether if not particularly answered i will therefore beg leave to consider them distinctly  and first it is objected this new cut must have many elbows and crooked turns in it to which i answer it may be made very near as strait as the old one as may be seen in the map of marshland hereunto annexed  the second particular contained in this article is that the length of this new cut it being designed to be eight miles long will make the waters in the sewer run much slower or as another gentleman has put this objection to me when the new cut has run off five foot or five foot and an half of water then it can carry off no more because there ought to be six inches fall in every mile to make the water draw i desire your patience whilst i answer both these objections as they are put for a full and clear answer to both will convince men how false their notion is who think that the longer the cut is the more prejudicial it is to draining whereas the quite contrary is really true  now the consideration of the nature and properties of water in reference to draining to express my self to every capacity will very much contribute to the true understanding of this matter and the properties of it in this respect are these two  first it naturally descends when it has vent and any fall though never so small insomuch that the least inclination though in a course of many miles will always bring the waters to the vent or outfal  secondly when penned in by stopping the vent it naturally comes to a level  that the first is true is plain both from experience and the natural reason of the thing for goolkeepers and those that live near to gools and sewers will inform you that nothing is more common than for the gools to run and vent water when there is but barely one inch fall nay i can prove that when the water in a drain has had no more than two inches fall into the river of owse yet that small draught was discernible to the eye near upon a mile from the outfal and in this case the reason of the thing is exactly agreeable to experience and observation for when the river gives way that is when the water in it is lower than the water in the sewer the gooldoors not otherwise hindered must of necessity fly open because there is a bigger weight of water on the landside than on the riverside and when the doors are thus opened the waters next those doors must necessarily descend to sea because it is the nature and property of water so to do and can any man imagine but that those waters next to these that marched off first must follow after and so the next to those last till the whole body of em be moved and this natural course of water is so constant and regular that it was never known to alter but by a miracle i am extremely desirous to make every thing plain gentlemen and therefore i hope it will not be taken amiss if to illustrate in some measure what i have already said though perhaps the parallel in strict criticism will not hold i repeat four lines out of hudibras which are these for hudibras wore but one spur as wisely knowing could he stir to active trot one side ofs horse the other would not hang an    the second thing we were to consider was that water pent up does naturally come to a level  though they as i said before who live near sewers and gools see this proposition verified almost every day yet for the sake of those and only those who are really ignorant of taking the fall of waters i shall describe it to em because it will give em a true insight into this affair at lowwatermark therefore we take a pole of sufficient length for our purpose and drive it down into the sewer on the landside of the gool but yet so as there shall be three or four foot of it above the superficies of the water then exactly level with the superficies we make a notch upon the pole immediately upon the shutting of the seadoors you shall perceive the fenwaters flow above the said notch and so they shall rise gradually till such time as they come to a perfect level in the sewer and so much as the waters rise above the notch in the pole so much is their fall it is observable too that at knightsgool the waters are above three quarters of an hour before they come to a level after the shutting of the seadoors so that it is plain though they have no vent all that while yet they are moving toward their outfal till they come to a perfect level be pleased to take notice that the drain leading to knightsgool is not much above a mile before the waters are expanded and yet they move three quarters of an hour and above to the very outfal after their stoppage there so that by parity of reason the waters in a drain of eight miles long between the expanded waters and the outfal must be moving forwards near upon six hours after the closing of the seadoors i conclude therefore that the great length of this intended cut will rather be advantageous than hurtful to us as to the business of draining because by that means the waters will be almost in continual motion to seaward in one part or other of it and so be more ready to discharge themselves as soon as the sea gives way  the third particular is the obstacles of so many bridges which must necessarily be made over this new cut for the intercourse of the inhabitants of the several towns of this country  to which i answer bridges may be made over the drain so as to have as much waterway under them as in any other part of the drain and therefore they can be no obstacles in draining and as for intercourse if i mistake not they always have been now are and hereafter will be built for that very end and purpose which is the reason we always praise the bridge we go over  the fourth particular is an insinuation of some injury from the countrys being cut into halves but this has nothing of argument in it it is certain we have already lost near one half of it and by cutting it into halves we shall certainly regain what is lost but if we do not cut it into halves then we are in danger of losing the whole and supposing the country should be thus halvd where is the harm of it are not two six pences as good as a shilling this therefore can be no grievance to any man provided bridges be made in proper places and the land cut through paid for  in the fifth particular is insinuated the difficulties of making the brinks stand which i humbly conceive may be made to stand by leaving shelves after the digging of three or four foot perpendicular the cut leading to wigenhallnewgool does plainly demonstrate that the brinks will stand if well sessd off and a table or shelf left as there is though the drain be cut through the highest silty lands   d object the time it will take to perfect this work with the  000 l it will cost as mr bateson says and an act of parliament to satisfy all interests upon cutting away their lands etc and making droves to their grounds not that i think the country would regret any reasonable charge upon the prospect of its doing service but grant it possible to level hills with valleys for so it is in many places that almost an insupportable charge will be entailed upon this age and posterity by this new channel eight miles long since lately the diking out but a part of an old sewer cost   s per rod besides the charge of throwing off the earth  as did the second so does this third objection contain a great many particulars drawn together i crave leave therefore to examine them separately  first it is intimated if i rightly understand this particular that it will take a long time to perfect this work to which i answer if it be once set about in good earnest and with the objectors approbation it may be finished in twelve months which is no great time considering the greatness of the undertaking  secondly it is intimated the charge will be very great seeing i have said it will cost  000 l in answer to this i have already said in my paper of remarks that the advantages will abundantly recompense the costs the truth of which will appear by giving you an estimate of the losses which the seven towns of marshland have sustained as to their commons only computing from that unfortunate era the last great irruption of the sea to this time it is thought there may be about six thousand acres drowned in the fen and smeth which if drained would i reckon be worth a noble an acre yearly this comes to  000 l per ann which multiplied by    the number of years from the date abovementioned would amount to   000 l and if i was to set the price as a great many commoners and farmers affirm they give for worse lands than most of the fen and smeth has been and may be again viz a mark an acre the sum would amount in the whole to    000 l too great a sum for the commoners of marshland to lose without doing the public any service and besides these immense sums the losses of private owners of lands are to be considered which it is impossible for me to recount in particular though it cannot be denied that there are several such who have been great sufferers during this calamity to my knowledge some persons have lost as much as would have purchased their estates were they now at this time to be as good as ever they were known to be these things considered gentlemen you will give me leave to say it is high time to look out for such means as may effectually put this country in statu quo shall we grudge to lay out  000 l prime cost when the commons alone at a mark an acre as some reckon will bring us in  000 l per ann and the private estates now lost near upon as much  thirdly it is objected again that an act of parliament must be had to satisfy all interests upon cutting away their lands and making droves to their grounds as to the charge of an act of parliament i have already answered that in my paper of remarks and as to private owners lands there will be but few of them to purchase either for the drain or droves because if my design be put in practice the cut is to run through tilneydrove which is a common that extends it self above half way and is also sufficiently wide for the purposes abovementioned i am entirely of the objectors opinion if he means that the generality of the country will not regret any reasonable charge upon the prospect of its doing service for i am very well assured from the great numbers that have already petitioned this court and are still ready with an addition to their numbers to petition again when and where relief may be had that the country in general will heartily fall in with this project having long enough tried the old way to their great costs without answering their expectations though at the same time i am very sensible there are and ever will be in cases of this nature some few who do regret a reasonable charge without any manner of reason equity or goodness on their sides as to the insinuation that hills must be levelled with valleys there is no manner of occasion for it only the drain must be dug to a level bottom both through hills and valleys if the objector will have those words applicable to one of the most level countries in the world  fourthly this new channel of eight miles long is charged with almost an insupportable charge to be entailed upon this age and posterity since lately the dikeing out of an old sewer cost eight shillings per rod besides the charge of throwing off the earth i suppose by this old sewer is meant the here mr berners stood up and said he did not mean the smethload but be it any other load or drain i conceive the objection will not mightily affect the case smethload which every one knows had not been dikd for a great many years past till that dry summer in which it was scowerd but who knows not that the long neglect of it was the occasion it was filled full of slough and dirt which proved worse by far to clear than if a new sewer of the same breadth and depth had been made out of the whole ground but when our new sewer is finished it will never come to that pass unless the whole country be swallowed up as now near half of it is with waters and i am really persuaded it will be a very easy charge to keep it in good order provided every town have its particular allotment in it to be done by their own proper officers i presume also to say that whenever this design shall be accomplished as i am in hopes it shortly will notwithstanding the unreasonable opposition of its adversaries our posterity if grateful will bless their fathers memories   th object the gauging at sea and the inlandwaters seems most doubtful since the height of the freshes is often succeeded by droughts and the outfals even at old lyn are deep or shallow according to the set of ebb and tide agitated by the winds besides the marshes where this new cut is designed as i am told and is visible are above three feet higher than the level so that the digging there must be nearer the antipodes than in other places or force the waters up hill  answ to the first part of this objection that my method of making the experiments by gauging the tides and the fennwaters seems to be most doubtful i answer it seems to be certain because i have tried it several times since i first offered my remarks to this court and both in the dry and wet seasons i found it to answer our purpose however since i first informed this court of my experiments this worthy gentlman has had sufficient time to disprove em if he could have done it by some of his own experiments i leave it to your judgments gentlemen whether this be a fair way of confuting experiments by objecting magisterially it seems most doubtful for at this rate a man may avoid the force of the strongest arguments and most glaring truths in the world  to the second that the outfal of old lyn is deeper or shallower according to the winds agitating the waters i answer let the winds agitate the waters never so much yet ever since captain wilshaw and my self made these trials at lyn and knightsgool they always answered expectation and besides where i have designed the outfal to be but always with submission to this court the ebb and tide both set continually which will be a very great advantage to the outfal by reason the gooldoors will always open as occasion serves without any trouble or charge extraordinary  to the last part of this objection which shows the objectors tenderness toward our antipodes i answer the cut is designed to be carried with a level bottom all the way through and i have already shown how the brinks may be made to stand through the highest parts of marshland and if so then i see no reason why we should be afraid of digging nearer the antipodes surely they will not hurt us and sure i am we shall not harm them and so pass we on to consider his proposals   st propos that it be the care of the officers of the country and that they be enjoined and encouraged by their winter circuits to keep out all foreign waters which run without any law into marshland which was constantly given in charge by our ancestors and to reinforce the law of this court of the  0th of king james for erecting two houses at distances upon the old podike for laborers to live in to prevent the cutting of it by which the downfall of five thousand acres run into the fen continually when as we can run out but four hours in twelve at the river  answ this proposal is consistent with my design only i must needs say that the dikereeves of the several towns of marshland have ruined the old podike by digging up the skirts of it to heighten it in the middle so that indeed it can no longer be called the old podikebank but the stinting or cradgen belonging to the old podike to remedy which abuse i humbly offer this method of repairing it viz that wigenhall be first obliged to make good that part of the old podike belonging to it if it be not already good enough for carts to carry silt from the river at slowbridge to the next charge which i think is tilney and so on to the other adjoystments in course this silt mixed with the moor has been experienced to make a better bank than any earth whatever nay it will be found to bind almost as hard as gravel it self then the two houses as here proposed may be built but till then sufficient foundations will hardly be found for em at due distances   d propos that lordsbridge be lengthened by those who have privilege to set one net there being the first bridge through which the freshes in a strait line descend to the owze and that the great letts stops and annoyances by laying gregs and fishtrunks cross the great drain be removed and the nets with the diverse sorts of impediments upon islingtoncommon be taken away  answ the former part of this proposal is not well grounded because it puts the lady the owner of the bridge upon an unnecessary charge seeing there is twenty foot waterway there and five foot waterway at waterlesuetunnel which is five and twenty foot of waterway in breadth at the very place complained of when at the very same time both the gools themselves do carry off no more than fifteen foot in breadth as to the removing the other letts stops annoyances gregs fishtrunks and nets the laws already in being are of force sufficient   d propos that two substantial engines or mills be placed upon the great load which is very strait and but a mile and half from the neck of marshlandfen to the two goats or gools which by the experience of our next neighbors and our friends abroad has been very successful to ride the waters at sea by raising and hastening the freshes thither for which a law of this court was to have been provided  answ to which i answer si populus vult decipi decipiatur but i shall make it appear that    engines of   0 l a piece cannot by far vent so much water as a cut of thirty foot wide at the bottom with a natural fall of eight foot an engine of   0 l price shall have a waterwheel of sixteen foot diameter it shall dip four foot and raise four foot but will scarce carry off three foot of water from the grounds surrounded and it is known that according to the rules of art the skuppets of such an engine dipping so deep ought to be a foot and an half broad place then sixteen of these engines upon the same height or level and then reckon what they will carry off and you will find    foot in breadth after this count what height they can raise the water which i told you was barely four foot now it must always be remembered that upon placing your engines to gain an artificial fall you put by your natural one by making your engines do the work of nature so that these sixteen engines will have but four foot fall and can carry off no more than three foot of water from the level to be drained because the skuppets when they have but one foot to dip in can throw no water at all what then must be done with the remaining three foot of water in the lowest parts of marshland why you must clap down sixteen engines more of the same bigness to raise it to the first sixteen but still you must consider the fall will be no more than you had before viz four foot it is true by this means you may carry off six foot of water but then let us compare this artificial and my natural fall together the artificial one will carry off a body of water of four foot in depth and    foot in breadth continually whilst the engines work and no longer but the natural one as proposed will carry off a body of  0 foot in breadth and more by reason of the sloping of the drain and   foot in depth till such time as the water shrinks in the low grounds and then the fall it is true must decrease as the water shrinks yet still for all that this natural fall shall be better than your forced one because the first will vent your waters sleeping and waking as they say whilst the last must sometimes wait a fortnight perhaps a month for a brisk gale of wind during which intermission the waters in a wet season must of necessity increase and here i would observe to you that all these engines thus disposed cannot possibly here mr berners said he did not mean the engines should ride the tide though it is plain he said the waters at sea ride the tide for sometimes the spring tides shall rise at knightsgool    or    foot and how will the engines be able to work against such a vast head of water no at such a time your engines cannot run the water out to sea above   hours supposing a wind and it is confessed even by this gentleman himself that the natural fall we already have runs four again when the gool doors are shut and there happens as it often will happen to be a wind sufficient for your engines you have not a receptacle sufficient for your waters so that the engines must be gentle spectators till the sea gives way and then perhaps there is a calm and we have but too much reason to fear the winds will not be commanded when we stand in the greatest need of em the sum of what i have said about engines gentlemen is this that two and thirty of em of   0 l a piece cannot possibly utter so much water as a cut of  0 foot wide at the bottom and i am sure so many engines will be much more chargeable than the cut as designed for the prime cost of these whirligiggs will amount to    00 l whereas the prime cost of a natural drain will not much exceed half the said sum i shall not need to tell you that such a number of machines will require a great many millwrights to repair em a great many millers to tend em a whole forest of wood to supply their daily wants abundance of iron sails without number all which clutter will cost the country above   00 l a year to maintain em and may be avoided by a natural drain before i dismiss this argument i cannot no more than the learned objector could pass by the experience of our next neighbors and our friends abroad which i think ought rather to induce us to accept of a natural fall and to look upon it as a peculiar happiness that we can have one to do our business effectually amongst our neighbors consider the engine at tidd st giles which cost   0 l has a vast receptacle for its waters and but   00 acres to drain and yet cannot do it effectually the landowners having since erected another for the same purpose what a wild fancy is it then think you to propose two engines to cope with  0000 acres be pleased to take notice further that both these engines are not to cost above  00 l according to the proposal for the sinking of the gool will swallow up the other  00 l i stand amazed to think that an ingenious gentleman and one who understands the affairs of marshland as well if not better than his neighbors should publish these following words in print to the world viz these things being accomplished i e the four proposals assisted by the south and southwest winds it is more than probable that for the expense of fewer hundred pounds than mr bateson says thousands for a new cut of   miles cross the country this angle may become as formerly the envy of some other places and by the soundness of their commons the profits of their severals the healthfulness of their climate the goodness of their highways and their ease of acreshots may attain to its former credit and prosperity these are fine specious and amusing things spoken yet such as may effectually be brought to pass by a natural drain but i think i have proved that the winds and two windmills etc can never accomplish em  now let us consider our friends abroad by whom as i take it are meant the dutch and can any man think that those industrious and thrifty people would have recourse to art if their country could be drained naturally dugdale says that within the space of these last fifty years reckoning to the time he writ in they had drained sundry lakes whereof    were most considerable by certain windmills devised and erected for that purpose the chiefest of which lakes called the beemster containing above   00 acres is made dry by the help of threescore and ten engines which expense we may be sure they would never have been at for   00 acres if they could have had a natural fall as we may have for the whole country   th propos that the sole of the old gool be sunk   foot being its old foundation and that the new jetty at islingtonshore be forthwith rooted up being set down for the particular interest of one town only and that by an order only it having been exclaimed against as the chief cause of silting the string and choking the mouth of the old gool and has made the new gool very sickly and chargeable at which passengers smile as well as the engineer from portsmouth when complaint was made to him of the outfals asking what it did there  to this i answer the sinking of the gool to the old foundation can be of no service to the country unless the ingenious proposer could find a way to scour the river to the old bottom i say it will be time enough in this case to undo what others upon due deliberation have done when the river has actually regained its ancient channel which it is impossible ever to do so long as denversluces are in being and jetties are wanting on each side of the river to straiten some parts of it between germansbridge and lynhaven surely the country will never yield to this part of the proposal whilst the river continues thus when it is plain not one single rood of land in the whole compass of marshland will be the better for so doing  the second part of this objection is that the new jetty at islingtonshore be forthwith rooted up by all means let us lose no time let us make all the have we can to our own destruction for this new jetty as the proposer is pleased to call a piece of the old seabank repaired is the safeguard of the whole country of marshland and it would be much more for the security of it if there were jetties all along that shore where the bank anciently stood any one that knows this present inbank must own the country to be but slenderly guarded seeing there is no back to the bank but all a very low country behind it in short this jetty seems to stand upon the same foundation with part of the old seabank and if the owners of the jetty insist upon it as such and it really proves to be so i can see no manner of reason we have forthwith to root it up but granting it to be no other than a new jetty i will demonstrate to this court with your leave gentlemen that long before the setting of it down knightsgool was liable to be often silted up an hundred years ago nay probably ever since it was a gool these are dugdales words transcribed verbatim after this says he at another session of sewers held on the   th day of april in the year of our lord    0   jac it being considered that this country of marshland was subject to surrounding as well by downfals of rain as by the overflowing of the sea and fresh waters and was therefore kept drained by sewers descending to knightsgool the common outfall of the great river of owse and that the said gool by the flowing and ebbing of the sea was then so silted up with sand at diverse times especially in summer that it obstructed the waters in the said sewers to the utter surrounding of all the fens and low grounds in the said country and moreover that the said gool in former time had been kept and perfected as also the fleet from the same unto the before specified river by a certain ancient pair of clows placed up higher in the sewer thereby one appointed for the taking in of the tides and so holding up the water between a pair of clows until the river of owse was run low and then forcibly let go for the scouring of sand out of the said gool so that gentlemen you perceive twas said at that time which was in    0 that the sewer the gool and the fleet were kept and perfected and scowrd from the sand by forcibly letting go the waters contained between a certain ancient pair of clows it is more than probable therefore that this misfortune of silting up has attended knightsgool ever since it was a gool or goat and therefore this jetty may stand seeing the pulling of it up will endanger the whole country of marshland and besides when it is rooted up as the term of art is the string of the gool will still be silted up as is evident from my authors words and the situation of that gool placed at too great a distance from the channel of the owse i hope no one can say that the jetty is the occasion of silting up the bottom of the river nay i dare say this gentleman himself will not give that as a reason for the rooting of it up forthwith consider therefore i beseech you what small grounds and reasons they had who have so long exclaimed against this jetty as for those smiling passengers and that smiling engineer from portsmouth i shall only say that if they laughed at the jetty they laughed at what they did not understand if they laughed at the poor old gool for being choked or the new gool for being very sickly they were not only very hardhearted but very uncivil seeing they have neither given us a receipt for their cure nor shown us some more effectual easy way for the draining of marshland which i humbly conceive i have since done  these following certificates sufficiently demonstrate that two substantial engines can be of no service for the effectual draining of the country of marshland the certificate of edward dampson of tidd st giles i do hereby certify that the first engine at tidd st giles cost to old colton   0 l and has been built about    or    years since the building of this engine it has cost the landowners which paid to it and the drains belonging to it seven and twenty shillings and ten pence halfpenny an acre there are about    0 acres which pay to it both in tidd st giles and newton but notwithstanding this great charge this mill was found to be insufficient for draining these lands and for keeping the outfal to sea open which every year was so silted up that though it raised   foot of water yet was insufficient to keep the said outfal open at all times though leverington old mill at the same time threw the same quantity of water with it into the same drain and outfal so that about   years ago the landowners of tidd st giles and newton were necessitated to erect another engine which has cost them near upon  00 l from that time and still the outfal to sea is often stopped up with silt as before so that they are obliged notwithstanding this extraordinary charge to make use of scavenmen and spademen to cleanse the string to seawards at certain times and upon the erecting of this last mill leverington also did last year build another engine to fling the water into the same drain  i reckon both these engines for tidd and newton lowlands being    0 acres or thereabouts will cost one year with another one shilling an acre which is  0  l  0 s a year witness my hand  december     0  edward dampson  december     0  the certificate of thomas gunthorp who has for many years lived near the goats or gools of buckworthsdrain and shiredrain the waters of the lowlands of leverington newton and tidd st giles are flung by   large engines into a drain called buckworthsdrain which has its sluice near to shiredrainsluce the string of buckworthsdrain to seaward is about  00 foot in length after which it joins with the string of shiredrain and so the united stream of both strings runs into wisbeechriver now i do certify that three of these engines have been set up for some years past the fourth being but lately erected and yet for all that a great number of spademen sometimes near  0 have been frequently employed to clear the string even of the united stream and i do further certify that the said sstring of 00 foot belonging to buckwortsdrain has been often silted up since the erection of the   abovementioned engines so that several workmen with their spades and scavens have actually several times thrown the silt out of the said  00 foot of string before the engines could run the least drop of water to sea witness my hand  thomas gunthorp    dampson was imployd by mr trafford for   or  0 years together in gathering the rates for the mill and gunthorp has lived for a great many years near shiredrainsluce and buckworthsdrainsluce    it is observable from dampsons certificate that one engine alone has in    years time cost very near  000 l and that what belongs to both of them as repairs and tendance etc will be a yearly charge of  0  l  0 s    it is observable from dampsons and gunthorps certificates that notwithstanding the great height which three of these engines raise the waters in the same drain yet they are forced to employ great numbers of men to open the string of the drain to seawards    it is observable from dampsons certificate that there are no more than    0 acres which pay to these mills and he told me that there might be about  00 acres of common droves etc which did not pay so that the whole extent of grounds to be drained by two of the engines is scare   00 acres  quaere whether these things considered it be worth the while for the country of marshland to lay out  00 or  000 l upon two engines and   or  00 l upon sinking the gool and to be at a yearly charge of  0  l  0 s besides sinking the interest of    or   00 l and all this expense to keep the said country in the same condition it is now in  quaere or whether it be better to lay out  000 l to drain the country effectually as the following certificate of the surveyors will make it appear a new cut will viz  november     0  i levelled from knightsgool down about half a mile below oldlyn and there was better than   foot fall at lowwatermark and the people there did affirm that the lowwatermark at a springtide is deeper by   foot and i do also certify that the water in marshlandfen was but   foot deep in the deepest part of it wit my hand will newling  to conclude all i do affirm and will demonstrate it to any man of common sense that the design of raising the water and so running to sea at the same time that the water shall naturally run to sea in the same drain is impracticable my meaning is that the water through the designed penned doors cannot naturally run to sea at the same time that the engines do run if the engines do raise the water above the level of the fen  finis
