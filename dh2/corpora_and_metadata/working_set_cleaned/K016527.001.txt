the history of sir charles grandison in a series of letters published from the originals by the editor of pamela and clarissa  in seven volumes  vol i  london printed by s richardson and dublin reprinted and sold by the booksellers mdccliii  preface the editor of the following letters takes leave to observe that he has now in this publication completed the plan that was the object of his wishes rather than of his hopes to accomplish  how such remarkable collections of private letters fell into his hands he hopes the reader will not think it very necessary to enquire  the first collection entitled pamela exhibited the beauty and superiority of virtue in an innocent and unpolished mind with the reward which often even in this life a protecting providence bestows on goodness a young woman of low degree relating to her honest parents the severe trials she met with from a master who ought to have been the protector not the assailer of her honor shows the character of a libertine in its truly contemptible light this libertine however from the foundation of good principles laid in his early years by an excellent mother by his passion for a virtuous young woman and by her amiable example and unwearied patience when she became his wife is after a length of time perfectly reclaimed  the second collection published under the title of clarissa displayed a more melancholy scene a young lady of higher fortune and born to happier hopes is seen involved in such variety of deep distresses as lead her to an untimely death affording a warning to parents against forcing the inclinations of their children in the most important article of their lives and to children against hoping too far from the fairest assurances of a man void of principle the heroine however as a truly christian heroine proves superior to her trials and her heart always excellent refined and exalted by every one of them rejoices in the approach of a happy eternity her cruel destroyer appears wretched and disappointed even in the boasted success of his vile machinations but still buoyed up with selfconceit and vain presumption he goes on after every short fit of imperfect yet terrifying conviction hardening himself more and more till unreclaimed by the most affecting warnings and repeated admonitions he perishes miserably in the bloom of life and sinks into the grave oppressed with guilt remorse and horror his letters it is hoped afford many useful lessons to the gay part of mankind against that misuse of wit and youth of rank and fortune and of every outward accomplishment which turns them into a curse to the miserable possessor as well as to all around them  here the editor apprehended he should be obliged to stop by reason of his precarious state of health and a variety of avocations which claimed his first attention but it was insisted on by several of his friends who were well assured he had the materials in his power that he should produce into public view the character and actions of a man of true honor  he has been enabled to obey these his friends and to complete his first design and now therefore presents to the public in sir charles grandison the example of a man acting uniformly well through a variety of trying scenes because all his actions are regulated by one steady principle a man of religion and virtue of liveliness and spirit accomplished and agreeable happy in himself and a blessing to others  from what has been premised it may be supposed that the present collection is not published ultimately nor even principally any more than the other two for the sake of entertainment only a much nobler end is in view yet it is hoped the variety of characters and conversations necessarily introduced into so large a correspondence as these volumes contain will enliven as well as instruct the rather as the principal correspondents are young ladies of polite education and of lively spirits  the nature of familiar letters written as it were to the moment while the heart is agitated by hopes and fears on events undecided must plead an excuse for the bulk of a collection of this kind mere facts and characters might be comprised in a much smaller compass but would they be equally interesting it happens fortunately that an account of the juvenile years of the principal person is narratively given in some of the letters as many however as could be spared have been omitted there is not one episode in the whole nor after sir charles grandison is introduced one letter inserted but what tends to illustrate the principal design those which precede his introduction will not it is hoped be judged unnecessary on the whole as they tend to make the reader acquainted with persons the history of whom is closely interwoven with that of sir charles  n b this edition is reprinted from mr richardsons octavo edition which has many corrections not in his small edition  names of the principal persons men george

january  0 your resolution to accompany mrs reeves to london has greatly alarmed your three lovers and two of them at least will let you know that it has such a lovely girl as my harriet must expect to be more accountable for her steps than one less excellent and less attractive  mr greville in his usual resolute way threatens to follow you to london and there he says he will watch the motions of every man who approaches you and if he find reason for it will early let such man know his pretensions and the danger he may run into if he pretend to be his competitor but let me not do him injustice though he talks of a rival thus harshly he speaks of you more highly than man ever spoke of woman angel and goddess are phrases you have been used to from him and though spoken in his humorous way yet i am sure he most sincerely admires you  mr fenwick in a less determined manner declares that he will follow you to town if you stay there above one fortnight  the gentle orme sighs his apprehensions and wishes you would change your purpose though hopeless he says it is some pleasure to him that he can think himself in the same county with you and much more that he can tread in your footsteps to and from church every sunday and behold you there he wonders how your grandmamma your aunt your uncle can spare you your cousin reevess surely he says are very happy in their influences over us all  each of the gentlemen is afraid that by increasing the number of your admirers you will increase his difficulties but what is that to them i asked when they already know that you are not inclined to favor any of the three  if you hold your resolution and my cousin reevess their time of setting out pray let me know and i will attend you at my uncle selbys to wish you a good journey much pleasure in town and a return with a safe and sound heart my sister who poor dear girl continues extremely weak and low will spare me for a purpose so indispensable i will not have you come to us i know it would grieve you to see her in the way she is in you too much take to heart the infirmities of your friends which you cannot cure and as your grandmamma lives upon your smiles and you rejoice all your friends by your cheerfulness it would be cruel to make you sad  mr greville has just left us he dropped in upon us as we were going to dinner my grandmother selby you know is always pleased with his rattling she prevailed on him to alight and sit down with us all his talk was of you he repeated his former threatenings as i called them to him on your going to town after dinner he read us a letter from lady frampton relating to you he read us also some passages from the copy of his answer with design i believe that i should ask him to leave it behind him he is a vain creature you know and seemed fond of what he had written i did ask him he pretended to make a scruple of your seeing it but it was a faint one however he called for pen and ink and when it was brought him scratched over two passages and that with so many little flourishes as you will see that he thought they could not be read but the ink i furnished him with happening to be paler than his you will find he was not cunning enough i promised to return it  send me a line by the bearer to tell me if your resolution holds as to the day  adieu my dearest harriet may angels protect and guide you whithersoever you go  lucy selby  letter ii mr greville to lady frampton enclosed in the preceding northampton january   your ladyship demands a description of the person of the celebrated miss byron in our neighborhood and to know whether as report tells you love has listed me in the number of her particular admirers  particular admirers you well distinguish since every one who beholds her admires her  your ladyship confines your enquiries to her person you tell me and you own that women are much more solicitous about the beauties of that than of the mind perhaps it may be so and that their envy is much sooner excited by the one than by the others but who madam can describe the person of miss harriet byron and her person only animated as every feature is by a mind that bespeaks all human excellence and dignifies her in every air in every look in every motion  no man living has a greater passion for beauty than i have till i knew miss byron i was one of those who regarded nothing else in the sex indeed i considered all intellectual seize as either useless or impertinent in women your ladyship knows what were my free notions on this head and has rebuked me for them a wise and learned lady i considered as a very unnatural character i wanted women to be all love and nothing else a very little prudence allowed i to enter into their composition just enough to distinguish the man of sense from the fool and that for my own sake you know i have vanity madam but lovely as miss byrons person is i defy the greatest sensualist on earth not to admire her mind more than her person what a triumph would the devil have as i have often thought when i have stood contemplating her perfections especially at church were he able to raise up a man that could lower this angel into woman  pardon me  your ladyship knows my mad way of saying every thing that rises to my thoughts  sweetness of temper must make plain featuresglow what an effect must it then have upon fine ones never was there a sweetertemperd woman indeed from sixteen to twenty all the sex kept in humor by their hopes and by their attractions are said to be goodtemperd but she is remarkably so she is just turned of twenty but looks not more than seventeen her beauty hardly yet in its full blow will last longer i imagine than in an earlier blossom yet the prudence visible in her whole aspect gave her a distinction even at twelve that promised what she would be at a riper age  yet with all this reigning goodnature visible in her face and manner there is such a native dignity in all she says in all she does though mingled with a frankness that shows her minds superiority to the minds of almost all other women that it damps and suppresses in the most audacious all imaginations of bold familiarity  i know not by my soul how she does this neither but so it is she jests she rallies but i cannot rally her again love it is said dignifies the adored object perhaps it is that which awes me  and now will your ladyship doubt of an affirmative answer to your second question whether love has listed me in the number of her particular admirers  he has and the devil take me if i can help myself and yet i have no encouragement  nor any body else that is my consolation fenwick is deeper in if possible than i we had at our first acquaintance as you have heard a tiltingbout on the occasion but are sworn friends now each having agreed to try his fortune by patience and perseverance and being assured that the one has no more of her favor to boast of than the other the passages in this letter thus marked  are those which in the preceding one are said to be scratched out and yet were legible by holding up the letter to the light  we have indeed blustered away between us half a scorce more of her admirers poor whining orme however perseveres but of him we make no account he has a watery head and though he finds a way by his sister who visits at mr selbys and is much esteemed there to let miss byron know his passion for her notwithstanding the negative he has received yet doubt we not that she is safe from a flame that he will quench with his tears before it can rise to an head to disturb us  you ladies love men should whine after you but never yet did i find that where a blustering fellow was a competitor the lady married the milksop  but let me in this particular do miss byron justice how she manages it i cannot tell but she is courteous to all nor could ever any man charge her either with pride or cruelty all i fear is that she has such an equality in her temper that she can hardly find room in her heart for a particular love nor will till she meets with one whose mind is near as faultless as her own and the general tenor of whose life and actions calls upon her discretion to give her leave to love this apprehension i owe to a conversation i had with her grandmother shirley a lady that is an ornament to old age and who hinted to me that her granddaughter had exceptions both to fenwick and me on the score of a few indulgences that perhaps have been too public but which all men of fashion and spirit give themselves and all women but this allow of or hate not men the worse for but then what is her objection to orme he is a sober dog  she was but eight years old when her mother died she also was an excellent woman her death was brought on by grief for that of her husband which happened but six months before  a rare instance  the grandmother and aunt to whom the girl is dutiful to a proverb will not interfere with her choice if they are applied to for their interest the answer is constantly this the approbation of their harriet must first be gained and then their consent is ready  there is a mr deane a man of an excellent character for a lawyer but indeed he left off practice on coming into possession of an handsome estate he was the girls godfather he is allowed to have great influence over them all harriet calls him papa to him i have applied but his answer is the very same his daughter harriet must choose for herself all motions of this kind must come first from her  and ought i to despair of succeeding with the girl herself i her greville not contemptible in person in air  free and easy at least having a good estate in possession fine expectances besides dressing well singing well dancing well and blessed with a moderate share of confidence which makes other women think me a clever fellow she a girl of twenty her fortune between ten and fifteen thousand pounds only for her fathers considerable estate on his demise for want of male heirs went with the name her grandmothers jointure not more than  00 l a year  and what though her uncle selby has no children and loves her yet has he nephews and nieces of his own whom he also loves for this harriet is his wifes niece  i will not despair if resolution if perseverance will do and if she be a woman she shall be mine  and so i have told her aunt selby and her uncle too and so i have told miss lucy selby her cousin as she calls her who is highly and deservedly in her favor and so indeed have i more than once told the girl herself  but now to the description of her person  let me die if i know where to begin she is all over loveliness does not every body else who has seen her tell you so her stature shall i begin with her stature she cannot be said to be tall but yet is something above the middling her shape  but what care i for her shape i who hope to love her still more though possession may make me admire her less when she has not that to boast of we young fellows who have been abroad are above regarding english shapes and prefer to them the french negligence by the way i think the foreign ladies in the right that they aim not at what they cannot attain whether we are so much in the right to come into their taste is another thing but be this as it will there is so much ease and dignity in the person in the dress and in every air and motion of miss harriet byron that fine shapes will ever be in fashion where she is be either native or foreigner the judge  her complexion is admirably fair and clear i have sat admiring her complexion till i have imagined i have seen the lifeblood slowing with equal course through her translucent veins  her forehead so nobly free and open shows dignity and modesty and strikes into one a kind of awe singly contemplated that from the delight which accompanies the awe i know not how to describe every single feature in short will bear the nicest examination and her whole face and her neck so admirably set on her finelyproportioned shoulders  let me perish if taking all together i do not hold her to be the most unexceptionable beauty i ever beheld but what still is her particular excellence and distinguishes her from all other english women for it must be acknowleged to be a characteristic of the french women of quality is the grace which that people call physiognomy and we may call expression had not her seatures and her complexion been so fine as they are that grace alone that soul shining out in her lovely aspect joined with the ease and gracefulness of her motion would have made her as many admirers as beholders  after this shall i descend to a more particular description  i will  her cheek  i never saw a cheek so beautifully turned illustrated as it is by a charming carmine flush which denotes sound health a most bewitching dimple takes place in each when she smiles and she has so much reason to be pleased with herself and with all about her for she is the idol of her relations that i believe from infancy she never frowned nor can a frown it is my opinion sit upon her face for a minute would to heaven i were considerable enough with her to prove the contrary  her mouth  there never was so lovely a mouth but no wonder since such rosy lips and such ivory and even teeth must give beauty to a mouth less charming than hers  her nose adds dignity to her other features her chin is sweetly turned and almost imperceptibly dimpled  her eyes  ay madam her eyes  good heaven what a luster yet not a fierce but a mild luster how have i despised the romancing poets for their unnatural descriptions of the eyes of their heroines but i have thought those descriptions though absurd enough in conscience less absurd allowing something for poetical license ever since i beheld those of miss harriet byron  her hair is a real and unlaboured ornament to her all natural its curls art has no share in the luster it gives to her other beauties  i mentioned her neck  here i dare not trust myself  inimitable creature allattracting loveliness  her arm  your ladyship knows my passion for a delicate arm  by my soul madam your own does not exceed it  her hands are extremely fine such fingers and they accustomed to the pen to the needle to the harpsichord excelling in all  o madam women have souls i am now convinced they have i dare own to your ladyship that once i doubted it on a supposition that they were given us for temporary purposes only  and have i not seen her dance have i not heard her sing  but indeed mind and person she is all harmony  then for reading for acquired knowledge what lady so young  but you know the character of her grandfather shirley he was a man of universal learning and from his public employments abroad as polite as learned this girl from seven years of age when he came to settle in england to fourteen when she lost him was his delight and her education and instruction the amusement of his vacant hours this is the period he used to say in which the foundations of all female goodness are to be laid since so soon after fourteen they leap into women  the dead languages he aimed not to teach her lest he should overload her young mind but in the italian and french he made her an adept  nor were the advantages common ones which she received from his lady her grandmother and from her aunt selby her fathers sister a woman of equal worthiness her grandmother particularly is one of the most pious yet most cheerful of women she will not permit her daughter byron she says to live with her for both their sakes  for the girls sake because there is a greater resort of company at mr selbys than at shirleymanor and she is afraid as her grandchild has a serious turn that her own contemplative life may make her more grave than she wishes so young a woman to be youth she says is the season for cheerfulness  for her own sake because she looks upon her harriets company as a cordial too rich to be always at hand and when she has a mind to regale she will either send for her fetch her or visit her at mrs selbys one of her letters to mrs selby i once saw it ran thus  you must spare me my harriet i am in pain my spirits are not high i would not have the undecayd mind yield for want of using the means to the decaying body one happy day with our child the true child of the united minds of her late excellent parents will i hope effect the cure if it do not you must spare her to me two  did i not tell you madam that it was very difficult to describe the person only of this admirable young lady  but i stop here an horrid apprehension comes across me how do i know but i am praising another mans future wife and not my own here is a cousin of hers a mrs reeves a fine lady from london come down under the cursed influence of my evil stars to carry this harriet away with her into the gay world woman woman  i beg your ladyships pardon but what angel of twenty is proof against vanity the first hour she appears she will be a toast stars and titles will crowd about her and who knows how far a paltry coronet may dazzle her who deserves an imperial crown but woe to the man whoever he be whose pretensions dare to interfere and have any assurance of success with those of  your ladyhips most obedient and faithful servant john greville  letter iii miss harritt byron to miss lucy selby selby house jan    i return you enclosed my lucy mr grevilles strange letter as you asked him for it he will have no doubt but you showed it to me it is better therefore if he make enquiry whether you did or not to own it in this case he will be curious to know my sentiments upon it he is sensible that my whole heart is open to you  tell him if you think proper in so many words that i am far more displeased with him for his impetuosity than gratified by his flattery  tell him that i think it very hard that when my nearest relations leave me so generously to my liberty a man to whom i never gave cause to treat me with disrespect should take upon himself to threaten and control me  ask him what are his pretenses for following me to london or elsewhere  if i had not had reasons before to avoid a more than neighbourly civility to him he has now furnished me with very strong ones the threatening lover must certainly make a tyrant husband dont you think so lucy  but make not supposals of lover or husband to him these bold men will turn shadows into substance in their own favor  a woman who is so much exalted above what she can deserve has reason to be terrified were she to marry the complimenter even could she suppose him so blinded by his passion as not to be absolutely insincere to think of the height she must fall from in his opinion when she has put it into his power to treat her but as what she is  indeed i both despise and fear a very high complimenter  despise him for his designing flattery supposing him not to believe himself or if he mean what he says for his injudiciousness i fear him lest he should as in the former case he must hope be able to raise a vanity in me that would sink me beneath his meanness and give him cause to triumph over my folly at the very time that i am full of my own wisdom  highstraind compliments in short always pull me down always make me shrink into myself have i not some vanity to guard against i have no doubt but mr greville wished i should see this letter and this gives me some little indignation against myself for does it not look as if from some faults in my conduct mr greville had formed hopes of succeeding by treating me like a fool  i hope these gentlemen will not follow me to town as they threaten if they do i will not see them if i can any way avoid it yet for me to appear to them solicitous on this head or to desire them not to go will be in some measure to lay myself under an obligation to their acquiescence it is not therefore for me to hope to influence them in this matter since they expect too much in return for it from me and since they will be ready to found a merit in their passion even for disobliging me  i cannot bear however to think of their dangling after me wherever i go these men my dear were we to give them importance with us would be greater infringers of our natural freedom than the most severe parents and for their own sakes whereas parents if ever so despotic if not unnatural ones indeed mean solely our good though headstrong girls do not always think so yet such even such can be teazed out of their wills at least out of their duty by the men who style themselves lovers when they are invincible to all the entreaties and commands of their parents  o that the next eight or ten years of my life if i find not in the interim a man on whom my whole undivided heart can fix were happily over as happily as the last alike important four years to be able to look down from the elevation of thirty years my principles fixed and to have no capital folly to reproach myself with what an happiness would that be  my cousin reevess time of setting out holds the indulgence of my dearest friends continues and my resolution holds but i will see my nancy before i set out what shall i enter upon a party of pleasure and leave in my heart room to reflect in the midst of it that there is a dear suffering friend who had reason to think i was afraid of giving myself pain when i might by the balm of true love and friendly soothings administer comfort to her wounded heart  no my lucy believe me if i have not generosity enough i have selfishness enough to make me avoid a sting so severe as this would be to  your harriet byron  letter iv miss byron to miss selby grosvenorstreet tuesday jan    we are just arrived we had a very agreeable journey  i need not tell you that mr greville and mr fenwick attended us to our first baiting and had a genteel dinner ready provided for us the gentlemen will tell you this and all particulars  they both renewed their menaces of following me to london if i stayed above one month they were so good as to stretch their fortnight to a month  mr fenwick in very pathetic terms as he found an opportunity to engage me alone for a few minutes besought me to love him mr greville was as earnest with me to declare that i hated him such a declaration he said was all he at present wished for it was strange he told me that he neither could prevail on me to encourage his love nor to declare my hatred he is a whimsical creature  i rallied him with my usual freedom and told him that if there was one person in the world that i was capable of hating i could make the less scruple to oblige him he thanked me for that  the two gentlemen would fain have proceeded farther but as they are never out of their way i dare say they would have gone to london and there have dangled on till we should not have got rid of them for my whole time of being in town  i was very gravely earnest with them to leave us when we stepped into the coach in order to proceed fenwick you dog said mr greville we must return miss byron looks grave gravity and a rising color in the finest face in the world indicates as much as the frowns of other beauties and in the most respectful manner they both took leave of me insisting however on my hand and that i would wish them well  i gave each my hand i wish you very well gentlemen said i and i am obliged to your civility in seeing me so far on my journey especially as you are so kind as to leave me here  why dear madam did you not spare your especially said mr greville  come fenwick let us retire and lay our two loggerheads together and live over again the past hour and then hang ourselves  poor mr orme the coach at our first setting out passed by his parkgate you know there was he  on the very ridge of the highway i saw him not till it was near him he bowed to the very ground with such an air of disconsolateness  poor mr orme  i wished to have said one word to him when we had passed him but the coach flew  why did the coach fly  but i waved my hand and leaned out of the coach as far as i could and bowed to him  o miss byron said mrs reeves so said mr reeves mr orme is the happy man did i think as you do said i i should not be so desirous to have spoken to him but methinks i should have been glad to have once said adieu mr orme for mr orme is a good man  but lucy my heart was softened at parting with my dear relations and friends and when the heart is softened light impressions will go deep  my cousins house is suitable to their fortune very handsome and furnished in taste mrs reeves knowing well what a scribbler i am and am expected to be has provided me with pen ink and paper in abundance she readily allowed me to take early possession of my apartment that i might pay punctual obedience to the commands of all my friends on setting out these you know were to write in the first hour of my arrival and it was allowed to be to you my dear but writing thus early what can have occurred  my apartment is extremely elegant a wellfurnishd bookcase is however to me the most attracting ornament in it  pardon me dear pen and ink i must not prefer any thing to you by whose means i hope to spend some part of every day at selbyhouse and even at this distance amuse with my prattle those friends that are always so partial to it  and now my dear my revered grandmamma i ask your blessing  yours my everindulgent aunt selby  and yours my honored and equally beloved uncle selby who knows but you will now in absence take less delight in teazing your everdutiful harriet but yet i unbespeak not my monitor  continue to love me my lucy as i shall endeavor to deserve your love and let me know how our dear nancy does  my heart bleeds for her i should have held myself utterly inexcusable had i accepted of your kindlyintended dispensation and come to town for three whole months without repeating to her by word of mouth my love and my sympathising concern for her what merit does her patience add to her other merits how has her calamity endeared her to me if ever i shall be heavily afflicted god give me her amiable her almost meritorious patience in sufferings  to my cousin holless and all my other relations friends companions make the affectionate compliments of  your harriet byron  letter v miss byron to miss selby jan    you rejoice me my dear in the hopes which you tell me dr mitchell from london gives you in relation to our nancy may our incessant prayers for the restoration of her health be answered  three things my aunt selby and you in the name of every one of my friends enjoined me at parting the first to write often very often were your words this injunction was not needful my heart is with you and the good news you give me of my grandmammas health and of our nancy enlarges that heart the second to give you a description of the persons and characters of the people i am likely to be conversant with in this great town and thirdly besides the general account which you all expected from me of the visits i made and received you enjoined me to accquaint you with the very beginnings of every address and even of every silent and respectful distinction were your words that the girl whom you all so greatly favor might receive on this excursion to town  dont you remember what my uncle selby answered to this  i do and will repeat it to show that his correcting cautions shall not be forgotten  the vanity of the sex said he will not suffer any thing of this sort to escape our harriet women continued he make themselves so cheap at the public places in and about town that new faces are more enquired after than even fine faces constantly seen harriet has an honest artless bloom in her cheeks she may attract notice as a novice but wherefore do you fill her head with an expectation of conquests women added he offer themselves at every public place in rows as at a market because three or four silly fellows here in the country like people at an auction who raise the price upon each other above its value have bid for her you think she will not be able to set her foot out of doors without increasing the number of her followers  and then my uncle would have it that my head would be unable to bear the consequence which the partiality of my other friends gave me  it is true my lucy that we young women are too apt to be pleased with the admiration pretended for us by the other sex but i have always endeavored to keep down any foolish pride of this sort by such considerations as these that flattery is the vice of men that they seek to raise us in order to lower us and in the end to exalt themselves on the ruins of the pride they either hope to find or inspire that humility as it shines brightest in an high condition best becomes a flattered woman of all women that she who is puffed up by the praises of men on the supposed advantages of person answers their end upon her and seems to own that she thinks it a principal part of hers to be admired by them and what can give more importance to them and less to herself than this for have not women souls as well as men and souls as capable of the noblest seize as theirs shall they not therefore be most solicitous to cultivate the beauties of the mind and to make those of person but of inferior consideration the bloom of beauty holds but a very few years and shall not a woman aim to make herself mistress of those perfections that will dignify her advanced age and then may she be as wise as venerable  as my grandmamma she is an example for us my dear who is so much respected who is so much beloved both by old and young as my grandmamma shirley  in pursuance of the second injunction i will now describe some young ladies and gentlemen who paid my cousins their compliments on their arrival in town  miss allestree daughter of sir john allestree was one she is very pretty and very genteel easy and free i believe i shall love her  miss bramber was the second not so pretty as miss allestree but agreeable in her person and air a little too talkative i think  it was one of my grandfathers rules to me not impertinently to start subjects as if i would make an ostentation of knowledge or as if i were fond of indulging a talking humor but frankness and complaisance required he used to say that we women should unlock our bosoms when we were called upon and were expected to give our sentiments upon any subject  miss bramber was eager to talk she seemed even when silent to look as if she was studying for something to say although she had exhausted two or three subjects this charge of volubility i am the rather inclined to fix upon her as neither mr nor mrs reeves took notice to me of it as a thing extraordinary which probably they would have done if she had exceeded her usual way and yet perhaps the joy of seeing her newlyarrived friends might have opened her lips if so your pardon sweet miss bramber  miss sally her younger sister is very amiable and very modest a little kept down as it seems by the vivacity of her elder sister between whose ages there are about six or seven years so that miss bramber seems to regard her sister as one whom she is willing to remember as the girl she was two or three years ago for miss sally is not above seventeen  what confirmed me in this was that the younger lady was a good deal more free when her sister was withdrawn than when she was present and again pursedup her really pretty mouth when she returned and her sister addressed her always by the word child with an air of eldership while the other called her sister with a look of observance  these were the ladies  the two gentlemen who came with them were mr barnet a nephew of lady allestree and mr somner  mr somner is a young gentleman lately married very affected and very opinionated i told mrs reeves after he was gone that i believed he was a dear lover of his person and she owned he was yet had he no great reason for it it is far from extraordinary though he was very gaily dressed his wife it seems was a young widow of great fortune and till she gave him consequence by falling in love with him he was thought to be a modest good sort of young man one that had not discovered any more perfections in himself than other people beheld in him and this gave her an excuse for liking him but now he is loquacious forward bold thinks meanly of the sex and what is worse not the higher of the lady for the preference she has given him  this gentleman took great notice of me and yet in such a way as to have me think that the approbation of so excellent a judge as himself did me no small honor  mr barnet is a young man that i imagine will be always young at first i thought him only a fop he affected to say some things that though trite were sententious and carried with them the air of observation there is some degree of merit in having such a memory as will help a person to repeat and apply other mens wit with some tolerable propriety but when he attempted to walk alone he said things that it was impossible a man of common sense could say i pronounce therefore boldly about him yet by his outward appearance he may pass for one of your pretty fellows for he dresses very gaily indeed if he has any taste it is in dress and this he has found out for he talked of little else when he led the talk and boasted of several parts of his what finished him with me was that as often as the conversation seemed to take a serious turn he arose from his seat and hummed an italian air of which however he knew nothing but the sound of his own voice seemed to please him  this fine gentleman recollected some highflown compliments and applying them to me looked as if he expected i should value myself upon them  no wonder that men in general think meanly of us women if they believe we have ears to hear and folly to be pleased with the frothy things that pass under the name of compliments from such randomshooters as these  miss stevens paid us a visit this afternoon she is daughter of colonel stevens a very worthy man she appears sensible and unaffected has read my cousin says a good deal and yet takes no pride in showing it  miss darlington came with her they are related  this young lady has i find a pretty taste in poetry mrs reeves prevailed on her to show us three of her performances and now as it was with some reluctance that she showed them is it fair to say any thing about them i say it only to you my friend  one was on the parting of two lovers very sensible and so tender that it showed the fair writer knew how to describe the pangs that may be innocently allowed to arise on such an occasion  one on the morningdawn and sunrise a subject that gave credit to herself for she is it seems a very early riser i petitioned for a copy of this for the sake of two or three of my dear cousins as well as to confirm my own practice but i was modestly refused  the third was on the death of a favorite linnet a little too pathetic for the occasion since were miss darlington to have lost her best and dearest friend i imagine that she had in this piece which is pretty long exhausted the subject and must borrow from it some of the images which she introduces to heighten her distress for the loss of the little songster it is a very difficult matter i believe for young persons of genius to reinin their imaginations a great flow of spirits and great store of images crouding in upon them carry them too frequently above their subject and they are apt rather to say all that may be said on their favorite topics than what is proper to be said but it is a pretty piece however  thursday morning lady betty williams supped with us the same evening she is an agreeable woman the widow of a very worthy man a near relation of mr reeves she has a great and just regard for my cousin and consults him in all affairs of importance she seems to be turned of forty has a son and a daughter but they are both abroad for education  it hurt me to hear her declare that she cared not for the trouble of education and that she had this pleasure which girls brought up at home seldom give their mothers that she and miss williams always saw each other and always parted as lovers  surely there must be some fault either in the temper of the mother or in the behavior of the daughter and if so i doubt it will not be amended by seeing each other but seldom do not lovers thus cheat and impose upon one another  the young gentleman is about seventeen his sister about fifteen and as i understand she is a very lively and it is feared a forward girl shall we wonder if in a few years time she should make such a choice for her husband as lady betty would least of all choose for a soninlaw what influence can a mother expect to have over a daughter from whom she so voluntarily estranges herself and from whose example the daughter can receive only hearsay benefits  but after all methinks i hear my correcting uncle ask may not lady betty have better reasons for her conduct in this particular than she gave you  she may my uncle and i hope she has but i wish she had condescended to give those better reasons since she gave any and then you had not been troubled with the impertinent remarks of your saucy kinswoman  lady betty was so kind as to take great notice of me she desired to be one in every party of pleasure that i am to be engaged in persons who were often at public places she observed took as much delight in accompanying strangers to them as if they were their own the apt comparisons she said the new remarks the pretty wonder the agreeable passions excited in such on the occasion always gave her high entertainment and she was sure from the observation of such a young lady civilly bowing to me she should be equally delighted and improved i bowed in silence i love not to make disqualifying speeches by such we seem to intimate that we believe the complimenter to be in earnest or perhaps that we think the compliment our due and want to hear it either repeated or confirmed and yet possibly we have not that pretty confusion and those transient blushes ready which mr greville archly says are always to be at hand when we affect to disclaim the praises given us  lady betty was so good as to stop there though the muscles of her agreeable face showed a polite promptitude had i by disclaiming her compliments provoked them to perform their office  am i not a saucy creature  i know i am but i dislike not lady betty for all that  i am to be carried by her to a masquerade to a ridotto when the season comes to ranelagh and vauxhall in the mean time to balls routes drums and soforth and to qualify me for these latter i am to be taught all the fashionable games did my dear grandmamma twenty or thirty years ago think she should live to be told that to the dancing master the singing or musicmaster the high mode would require the gamingmaster to be added for the completing of the female education  lady betty will kindly take the lead in all these diversions  and now lucy will you not repeat your wishes that i return to you with a sound heart and are you not afraid that i shall become a modern fine lady as to the latter fear i will tell you when you shall suspect me  if you find that i prefer the highest of these entertainments or the opera itself well as i love music to a good play of our favorite shakespeare then my lucy let your heart ache for your harriet then be apprehensive that she is laid hold on by levity that she is captivated by the eye and the ear that her heart is infected by the modern taste and that she will carry down with her an appetite to pernicious gaming and in order to support her extravagance will think of punishing some honest man in marriage  james has signified to sally his wishes to be allowed to return to selbyhouse i have not therefore bought him the new liveries i designed for him on coming to town i cannot bear an unchearful brow in a servant and he owning to me on my talking with him his desire to return i have promised that he shall as soon as mr reeves has provided me with another servant  silly fellow but i hope my aunt will not dismiss him upon it the servant i may hire may not care to go into the country perhaps or may not so behave as that i should choose to take him down with me and james is honest and his mother would break her heart if he should be dismissed our service  several servants have already offered themselves but as i think people are answerable for the character of such as they choose for their domestics i find no small difficulty in fixing i am not of the mind of that great man whose goodnatured reason for sometimes preferring men noways deserving was that he loved to be a friend to those whom no other person would befriend this was carrying his goodness very far if he made it not an excuse for himself for having promoted a man who proved bad afterward rather than as supposing him to be so at the time since else he seemed not to consider that every bad man he promoted ran away with the reward due to a better  mr and mrs reeves are so kind to me and their servants are so ready to oblige me that i shall not be very uneasy if i cannot soon get one to my mind only if i could fix on such a one and if my grandmammas oliver should leave her as she supposes he will now he has married ellen as soon as a good inn offers james may supply olivers place and the new servant may continue mine instead of james  and now that i have gone so low dont you wish me to put an end to this letter  i believe you do  well then with duty and love ever remembered where so justly due believe me to be my dear lucy  your truly affectionate harriet byron i will write separately to what you say of mr greville mr fenwick and miss orme yet hope to be time enough for the post    letter vi miss byron to miss selby sat jan    as to what you say of mr grevilles concern on my absence and i think with a little too much feeling for him and of his declaring himself unable to live without seeing me i have but one fear about it which is that he is forming a pretense from his violent love to come up after me and if he does i will not see him if i can help it  and do you indeed believe him to be so much in love by your seriousness on the occasion you seem to think he is o my lucy what a good heart you have and did he not weep when he told you so did he not turn his head away and pull out his handkerchief  o these dissemblers the hyaena my dear was a male devourer the men in malice and to extenuate their own guilt made the creature a female and yet there may be male and female of this species of monsters but as women have more to lose with regard to reputation than men the male hyaena must be infinitely the more dangerous creature of the two since he will come to us even into our very houses fawning cringing weeping licking our hands while the den of the female is by the highwayside and wretched youths must enter into it to put it in her power to devour them  let me tell you my dear that if there be an artful man in england with regard to us women artful equally in his free speaking and in his sycophancies mr greville is the man and he intends to be so too and values himself upon his art does he not as boldly as constantly insinuate that flattery is dearer to a woman than her food yet who so gross a flatterer as himself when the humor is upon him and yet at times he wants to build up a merit for sincerity or plaindealing by saying free things  it is not difficult my dear to find out these men were we earnest to detect them their chief strength lies in our weakness but however weak we are i think we should not add to the triumph of those who make our weakness the general subject of their satire we should not prove the justice of their ridicule by our own indiscretions but the traitor is within us if we guard against ourselves we may bid defiance to all the arts of man  you know that my great objection to mr greville is for his immoralities a man of free principles shown by practices as free can hardly make a tender husband were a woman able to get over considerations that she ought not to get over who shall trust for the performance of his second duties the man who avowedly despises his first mr greville had a good education he must have taken pains to render vain the pious precepts of his worthy father and still more to make a jest of them  three of his women we have heard of besides her whom he brought with him from wales you know he has only affected to appear decent since he has cast his eyes upon me the man my dear must be an abandoned man and must have a very hard heart who can pass from woman to woman without any remorse for a former whom as may be supposed he has by the most solemn vows seduced and whose leavings is it my dear that a virtuous woman takes who marries a profligate  is it not reported that his welshwoman to whom at parting he gave not sufficient for a twelvemonths scanty subsistence is now upon the town vile man he thinks it to his credit i have heard to own it a seduction and that she was not a vicious creature till he made her so  one only merit has mr greville to plead in this black transaction it is that he has by his whole conduct in it added a warning to our sex and shall i despising the warning marry a man who specious as he is in his temper and lively in his conversation has shown so bad a nature  his fortune as you say is great the more inexcusable therefore is he for his niggardliness to his welshwoman on his fortune he presumes it will procure him a too easy forgiveness from others of our sex but fortune without merit will never do with me were the man a prince  you say that if a woman resolves not to marry till she finds herself addressed to by a man of strict virtue she must be for ever single if this be true what wicked creatures are men what a dreadful abuse of passions given them for the noblest purposes are they guilty of  i have a very high notion of the marriagestate i remember what my uncle once averred that a woman out of wedlock is half useless to the end of her being how indeed do the duties of a good wife of a good mother and a worthy matron well performed dignify a woman let my aunt selbys example in her enlarged sphere set against that of any single woman of like years moving in her narrow circle testify the truth of the observation my grandfather used to say that families are little communities that there are but few solid friendships out of them and that they help to make up worthily and to secure the great community of which they are so many miniatures  but yet it is my opinion and i hope that i never by my practice shall discredit it that a woman who with her eyes open marries a profligate man had generally much better remain single all her life since it is very likely that by such a step she defeats as to herself all the good ends of society what a dreadful what a presumptuous risque runs she who marries a wicked man even hoping to reclaim him when she cannot be sure of keeping her own principles  be not deceived evil communication corrupts good manners is a caution truly apostolical  the text you mention of the unbelieving husband being converted by the believing wife respects as i take it the first ages of christianity and is an instruction to the converted wife to let her unconverted husband see in her behavior to him while he beheld her chaste conversation coupled with fear the efficacy upon her own heart of the excellent doctrines she had embraced it could not have in view the woman who being single chose a pagan husband in hopes of converting him nor can it give encourgement for a woman of virtue and religion to marry a profligate in hopes of reclaiming him who can touch pitch and not be defiled  as to mr fenwick i am far from having a better opinion of him than i have of mr greville you know what is whispered of him he has more decency however he avows not free principles as the other does but you must have observed how much he seems to enjoy the mad talk and free sentiments of the other and that other always brightens up and rises in his freedoms and impiety on mr fenwicks sty applauses and encouraging countenance in a word mr fenwick not having the same lively things to say nor so lively an air to carry them off as mr greville has though he would be thought not to want sense takes pains to show that he has as corrupt an heart if i thought anger would not give him consequence i should hardly forbear to show myself displeased when he points by a leering eye and by a broad smile the free jest of the other to the person present whom he thinks most apt to blush as if for fear it should be lost and still more when on the mantling cheeks showing the sensibility of the person so insulted he breaks out into a loud laugh that she may not be able to recover herself  surely these men must think us women egregious hypocrites they must believe that we only affect modesty and in our hearts approve of their freedom for can it be supposed that such as call themselves gentlemen and who have had the education and opportunities that these two have had would give themselves liberties of speech on purpose to affront us  i hope i shall find the london gentlemen more polite than these our neighbors of the foxchace and yet hitherto i have seen no great cause to prefer them to the others but about the court and at the fashionable public places i expect wonders pray heaven i may not be disappointed  thank miss orme in my name for the kind wishes she sends me tell her that her doubts of my affection for her are not just and that i do really and indeed love her nor should she want the most explicit declarations of my love were i not more afraid of her in the character of a sister to a truly respectable man than doubtful of her in that of a friend to me in which latter light i even joy to consider her but she is a little naughty tell her because she is always leading to one subject and yet how can i be angry with her for it if her good opinion of me induces her to think it in my power to make the brother happy whom she so dearly and deservedly loves i cannot but esteem her for the part she takes  and this it is that makes me afraid of the artleslyartful miss orme  it would look as if i thought my duty and love and respects were questionable if in every letter i repeated them to my equally honored and beloved benefactors friends and favorers suppose them therefore always included in my subscription to you my lucy when i tell you that i am and will be  your everaffectionate harriet byron  letter vii mr selby to miss byron selbyhouse jan  0 well and now there wants but a london lover or two to enter upon the stage and vanityfair will be proclaimed and directly opened greville everywhere magnifying you in order to justify his flame for you fenwick exalting you above all women orme adoring you and by his humble silence saying more than any of them proposals besides from this man letters from that what scenes of slattery and nonsense have i been witness to for these past three years and half that young mr elford began the dance single well may you have remained single till this your twentieth year when you have such choice of admirers that you dont know which to have so in a mercers shop the tradesman has a fine time with you women when variety of his rich wares distract you and fifty to one at last but as well in men as silks you choose the worst especially if the best is offered at first and refused for women know better how to be sorry than to amend  it is true say you that we young women are apt to be pleased with admiration   oho are you so and so i have gained one point with you at last have i  but i have always endeavored and i harriet wish you had succeeded in your endeavours to keep down any foolish pride  then you own that pride you have  another point gained conscience honest conscience will nowandthen make you women speak out but now i think of it here is vanity in the very humility well say you endeavored when female pride like love though hid under a barrel will flame out at the bung  well said i to your aunt selby to your grandmamma and to your cousin lucy when we all met to sit in judgment upon your letters now i hope you will never dispute with me more on this flagrant love of admiration which i have so often observed swallows up the hearts and souls of you all since your harriet is not exempt from it and since with all her speciousness with all her prudence with all her caution she taken with a qualm of conscience owns it  but no truly all is right that you say all is right that you do  your very confessions are brought as so many demonstrations of your diffidence of your ingenuousness and i cannot tell what  why i must own that no father ever loved his daughter as i love my niece but yet girl your faults your vanities i do not love it is my glory that i think myself able to judge of my friends as they deserve not as being my friends why the best beloved of my heart your aunt herself  you know i value her now more now less as she deserves but with all those i have named and with all your relations indeed their harriet cannot be in fault and why because you are related to them and because they attribute to themselves some merit from the relation they stand in to you supererogatorians all of them i will make words whenever i please with their attributions to you and because you are of their sex forsooth and because i accuse you in a point in which you are all concerned and so make a common cause of it  here one exalts you for your good sense because you have a knack by help of an happy memory of making every thing you read and every thing that is told you that you like your own your grandfathers precepts particularly and because i think you pass upon us as your own what you have borrowed if not stolen  another praises you for your goodnature  the duce is in it if a girl who has crowds of admirers after her and a new lover wherever she shows her bewitching face who is blessed with health and spirits and has everybody for her friend let her deserve it or not can be illnatured who can such a one have to quarrel with trow  another extols you for your cheerful wit even when displayed bold girl as you are upon your uncle in which indeed you are upheld by the wife of my bosom whenever i take upon me to tell you what ye all even the best of ye are  yet sometimes they praise your modesty and why your modesty because you have a skin in a manner transparent and because you can blush  i was going to say whenever you please  at other times they will find out that you have features equally delicate and regular when i think and i have examined them jointly and separately that all your takingness is owing to that open and cheerful countenance which gives them a gloss or what shall i call it that we men are apt to be pleased with at first sight a gloss that takes one as it were by surprise but give me the beauty that grows upon us every time we see it that leaves room for something to be found out to its advantage as we are more and more acquainted with it  your correcting uncle you call me and so i will be but what hope have i of your amendment when every living soul man woman and child that knows you puffs you up there goes mr selby i have heard strangers say  and who is mr selby another stranger has asked why mr selby is uncle to the celebrated miss byron  yet i who have lived fifty years in this county should think i might be known on my own account and not as the uncle of a girl of twenty  am i not a saucy creature in another place you ask and you answer i know i am i am glad you do now may i call you so by your own authority i hope but with your aunt it is only the effect of your agreeable vivacity what abominable partiality even do what you will harriet you will never be in fault i could almost wish  but i will not tell you what i wish neither but something must betide you that you little think of depend upon that all your days cannot be halcyon ones i would give a thousand pounds with all my soul to see you heartily in love ay up to the very ears and unable to help yourself you are not thirty yet child and indeed you seem to think the time of danger is not over i am glad of your consciousness my dear shall i tell greville of your doubts and of your difficulties harriet as to the ten coming years i mean and shall i tell him of your prayer to pass them safely  but is not this wish of yours that ten years of bloom were overpast and that you were arrived at the thirtieth year of your age a very singular one  a flight a mere flight ask ninetynine of your sex out of an hundred if they would adopt it  in another letter you ask lucy if mr greville has not said that flattery is dearer to a woman than her food well niece and what would you be at is it not so  i do averr that mr greville is a sensible man and makes good observations  mens chief strength you say lies in the weakness of women why so it does where else should it lie and this from their immeasurable love of admiration and flattery as here you seem to acknowledge of your own accord though it has been so often perversely disputed with me give you women but rope enough you will do your own business  however in many places you have pleased me but nowhere more than when you recollect my averrment without contradicting it which is a rarity that a woman out of wedlock is half useless to the end of her being good girl that was an assertion of mine and i will abide by it lucy simperd when we came to this place and looked at me she expected i saw my notice upon it so did your aunt but the confession was so frank that i was generous and only said true as the gospel  i have written a long letter yet have not said one quarter of what i intended to say when i began you will allow that you have given your correcting uncle ample subject but you fare something the better for saying you unbespeak not your monitor  you own that you have some vanity be more free in your acknowlegements of this nature you may for are you not a woman and you will fare something the better for your ingenuouiness and the rather as your acknowlegements will help me up with your aunt and lucy and your grandmamma in an argument i will not give up  i have had fresh applications made to me  but i will not say from whom since we have agreed long ago not to prescribe to so discreet a girl as in the main we all think you in the articles of love and marriage  with all your faults i must love you i am half ashamed to say how much i miss you already we are all naturally cheerful folks yet i dont know how it is your absence has made a strange chasm at our table let us hear from you every post that will be something your doting aunt tells the hours on the day she expects a letter your grandmother is at present with us and in heart i am sure regrets your absence but as your tenderness to her has kept you from going to london for so many years she thinks she ought to be easy her example goes a great way with us all you know and particularly with  your truly affectionate though correcting uncle geo selby  letter viii miss byron to miss selby tuesday jan    i am already my dear lucy quite contrary to my own expectation enabled to obey the third general injunction laid upon me at parting by you and all my dear friends since a gentleman not inconsiderable in his family or fortune has already beheld your harriet with partiality  not to heighten your impatience by unnecessary parade his name is fowler he is a young gentleman of an handsome independent fortune and still larger expectations from a welsh uncle now in town sir rowland meredith knighted in his sheriffalty on occasion of an address which he brought up to the king from his county  sir rowland it seems requires from his nephew on pain of forfeiting his favor for ever that he marries not without his approbation which he declares he never will give except the woman be of a good family has a gentlewomans fortune has had the benefit of a religious education which he considers as the best security that can be given for her good behavior as a wife and as a mother so forward does the good knight look her character unsullied acquainted with the theory of the domestic duties and not ashamed occasionally to enter into the direction of the practic her fortune however as his nephew will have a good one he declares to be the least thing he stands upon only that he would have her possessed of from six to ten thousand pounds that it may not appear to be a match of mere love and as if his nephew were taken in as he calls it rather by the eyes than by the understanding where a woman can have such a fortune given her by her family though no greater it will be an earnest he says that the family she is of have worth as he calls it and want not to owe obligations to that of the man she marries  something particular something that has the look of forecast and prudence you will say in the old knight  o but i had like to have forgot his future niece must also be handsome he values himself it seems upon the breed of his horses and dogs and makes polite comparisons between the more noble and the less noble animals  sir rowland himself as you will guess by his particularity is an old bachelor and one who wants to have a woman made on purpose for his nephew and who positively insists upon qualities before he knows her not one of which perhaps his future niece will have  dont you remember mr tolson of derbyshire he was determined never to marry a widow if he did it should be one who had a vast fortune and who never had a child and he had still a more particular exception and that was to a woman who had red hair he held these exceptions till he was forty and then being looked upon as a determined bachelor no family thought it worth their while to make proposals to him no woman to throw out a net for him to express myself in the style of the gay mr greville and he at last fell in with and married the laughing mrs turner a widow who had little or no fortune had one child a daughter living and that child an absolute idiot and to complete the perverseness of his fate her hair not only red but the most disagreeable of reds the honest man was grown splenetic disregarded by everybody he was become disregardful of himself he hoped for a cure of his gloominess from her cheerful vein and seemed to think himself under obligation to one who had taken notice of him when nobody else would bachelors wives maids children these old saws always mean something  mr fowler saw me at my cousin reevess the first time i cannot say he is disagreeable in his person but he seems to want the mind i would have a man blessed with to whom i am to vow love and honor i purpose whenever i marry to make a very good and even a dutiful wife must i not vow obedience and shall i break my marriagevow i would not therefore on any consideration marry a man whose want of knowledge might make me stagger in the performance of my duty to him and who would perhaps command from caprice or want of understanding what i should think unreasonable to be complied with there is a pleasure and a credit in yielding up even ones judgment in things indifferent to a man who is older and wiser than ones self but we are apt to doubt in one of a contrary character what in the other we should have no doubt about and doubt you know of a persons merit is the first step to disrespect and what but disobedience which lets in every evil is the next  i saw instantly that mr fowler beheld me with a distinguished regard we women you know let me for once be aforehand with my uncle are very quick in making discoveries of this nature but everybody at table saw it he came again next day and besought mr reeves to give him his interest with me without asking any questions about my fortune though he was even generously particular as to his own he might since he has an unexceptionable one who is it in these cases that forgets to set foremost the advantages by which he is distinguished while fortune is the last thing talked of by him who has little or none and then love love love is all his cry  mr reeves who has a good opinion of mr fowler in answer to his enquiries told him that he believed i was disengaged in my affections mr fowler rejoiced at that that i had no questions to ask but those of duty which indeed he said was a stronger tie with me than interest he praised my temper and my frankness of heart the latter at the expense of my sex for which i least thanked him when he told me what he had said in short he acquainted him with everything that was necessary and more than was necessary for him to know of the favor of my family and of my good mr deane in referring all proposals of this kind to myself mingling the detail with commendations which only could be excused by the goodness of his own heart and accounted for by his partiality to his cousin  mr fowler expressed great apprehensions on my cousins talking of these references of my grandmother aunt and mr deane to myself on occasions of this nature which he said he presumed had been too frequent for his hopes  if you have any hope mr fowler said mr reeves it must be in your good character and that much preferably to your clear estate and great expectations although she takes no pride in the number of her admirers yet is it natural to suppose that it has made her more difficult and her difficulties are enhanced in proportion to the generous confidence which all her friends have in her discretion and when i told him proceeded mr reeves that your fortune exceeded greatly what sir rowland required in a wife for him and that you had as well from inclination as education a serious turn too much too much in one person cried he out as to fortune he wished you had not a shilling and if he could obtain your favor he should be the happiest man in the world  o my good mr reeves said i how have you overrated my merits surely you have not given mr fowler your interest if you have should you not for his sake have known something of my mind before you had set me out thus had i even deserved your high opinion or mr fowler might have reason to repent the double wellmeant kindness of his friend if men in these days were used to break their hearts for love  it is the language i do and must talk of you in to everybody returned mr reeves is it not the language that those most talk who know you best  where the world is inclined to favor replied i it is apt to overrate as much as it will underrate where it disfavours in this case you should not have proceeded so far as to engage a gentlemans hopes what may be the end of all this but to make a compassionate nature as mine has been thought to be if mr fowler should be greatly in earnest uneasy to itself in being obliged to show pity where she cannot return love  what i have said i have said replied mr reeves pity is but one remove from love mrs reeves there she sits was first brought to pity me for never was man more madly in love than i and then i thought myself sure of her and so it proved i can tell you i am no enemy to mr fowler  and so my dear mr fowler seems to think he has met with a woman who would make a fit wife for him but your harriet i doubt has not in mr fowler met with a man whom she can think a fit husband for her  the very next morning sir rowland himself   but now my lucy if i proceed to tell you all the fine things that are said of me and to me what will my uncle selhy say will he not attribute all i shall repeat of this sort to that pride to that vanity to that sondness of admiration which he as well as mr greville is continually charging upon all our sex  yet he expects that i shall give a minute account of every thing that passes and of every conversation in which i have any part how shall i do to please him and yet i know i shall best please him if i give him room to find fault with me but then should he for my faults blame the whole sex is that just  you will tell me i know that if i give speeches and conversations i ought to give them justly that the humors and characters of persons cannot be known unless i repeat what they say and their manner of saying that i must leave it to the speakers and complimenters to answer for the likeness of the pictures they draw that i know best my own heart and whether i am puffed up by the praises given me that if i am i shall discover it by my superciliousness and be enough punished on the discovery by incurring from those i love deserved blame if not contempt instead of preserving their wishedfor esteem  let me add to all this that there is an author i forget who who says it is lawful to repeat those things though spoken in our praise that are necessary to be known and cannot otherwise be come at  and now let me ask will this preamble do once for all  it will and so says my aunt selby and so says every one but my uncle well then i will proceed and repeat all that shall be said and that as well to my disadvantage as advantage only resolving not to be exalted with the one and to do my endeavor to amend by the other and here pray tell my uncle that i do not desire he will spare me since the faults he shall find in his harriet shall always put her upon her guard  not however to conceal them from his discerning eye but to amend them  and now having as i said once for all prepared you to guard against a surfeit of selfpraise though delivered at second or third hand i will go on with my narrative  but hold  my paper reminds me that i have written a monstrous letter  i will therefore with a new sheet begin a new one only adding to this that i am and ever will be  your affectionate harriet byron p s well but what shall i do now  i have just received my uncles letter and after his charge upon me of vanity and pride will my parade as above stand me in any stead  i must trust to it only one word to my dear and everhonoured uncle  dont you sir impute to me a belief of the truth of those extravagant compliments made by men professing love to me and i will not wish you to think me one bit the wiser the handsomer the better for them than i was before    letter ix miss byron in continuation thursday feb   the very next morning sir rowland himself paid his respects to mr reeves  the knight before he would open himself very freely as to the business he came upon desired that he might have an opportunity to see me i knew nothing of him nor of his business we were just going to breakfast miss allestree miss bramber and miss dolyns a young lady of merit were with us  just as we had taken our seats mr reeves introduced sir rowland but let him not know which was miss byron he did nothing at first sitting down but peer in our faces by turns and fixing his eye upon miss allestree he jogged mr reeves with his elbow  hay sir  audibly whispered he  mr reeves was silent sir rowland who is shortsighted then looked under his bent brows at miss bramber then at miss dolyns and then at me  fay sir whispered he again  he sat out the first dish of tea with an impatience equal as it seemed to his uncertainty and at last taking mr reeves by one of his buttons desired a word with him they withdrew together and the knight not quitting hold of mr reevess button adsmylife sir said he i hope i am right i love my nephew as i love myself i live but for him he ever was dutiful to me his uncle if that be miss byron who sits on the right hand of your lady with the countenance of an angel her eyes sparkling with good humor and blooming as a maymorning the business is done i give my consent although i heard not a word pass from her lips i am sure she is all intelligence my boy shall have her the other young ladies are agreeable but if this be the lady my kinsman is in love with he shall have her how will she outshine all our caermarthen ladies and yet we have charming girls in caermarthen  am i or am i not right mr reeves as to my nephews flame as they call it  the lady you describe sir rowland is miss byron  and then mr reeves in his usual partial manner let his heart overflow at his lips in my favor  thank god thank god said the knight let us return let us go in again i will say something to her to make her speak but not a word to dash her i expect her voice to be music if it be as harmonious as the rest of her by the softness or harshness of the voice let me tell you mr reeves i form a judgment of the heart and soul and manners of a lady it is a criterion as they call it of my own and i am hardly ever mistaken let us go in again i pray ye  they returned and took their seats the knight making an awkward apology for taking my cousin out  sir rowland his forehead smoothed and his face shining sat swelling as big with meaning yet not knowing how to begin mrs reeves and miss allestree were talking at the reentrance of the gentlemen sir rowland thought he must say something however distant from his main purpose breaking silence therefore you ladies seemed to be deep in discourse when we came in whatever were your subject i beg you will resume it  they had finished they assured him what they had to say  sir rowland seemed still at a loss he hemmed three times and looked at me with particular kindness mr reeves then in pity to his fullness asked him how long he proposed to stay in town  he had thought he said to have set out in a week but something had happened which he believed could not be completed under a fortnight yet i want to be down said he for i had just finished as i came up the newbuilt house i design to present to my nephew when he marries i pretend plain man as i am to be a judge both of taste and elegance sir rowland was now set a going all i wish for is to see him happily settled ah ladies that i need not go further than this table for a wife for my boy  we all smiled and looked upon each other  you young ladies proceeded he have great advantages in certain cases over us men and this which i little thought of till it came to be my own case whether we speak for our kindred or for ourselves but will you madam to mrs reeves will you sir to mr reeves answer my questions  as to these ladies  i must have a niece among them my nephew though i say it is one whom any lady may love and as for fortune let me alone to make him in addition to his own all clear as the sun worthy of any womans acceptance though she were a duchess  we were all silent and smiled upon one another  what i would ask then is which of the ladies before me  mercy i believe by their smiling and by their pretty looks they are none of them engaged i will begin with the young lady on your righthand she looks so lovely so goodnatured and so condescending  mercy what an open forehead  hem  forgive me madam but i believe you would not disdain to answer my question yourself  are you madam are you absolutely and bona fide disengaged or are you not  as this sir rowland answered i is a question i can best resolve i frankly own that i am disengaged  charming charming  mercy why now what a noble frankness in that answer  no jesting matter you may smile ladies  i hope madam you say true i hope i may rely upon it that your affections are not engaged  you may sir rowland i do not love even in jest to be guilty of an untruth  admirable  but let me tell you madam that i hope you will not many days have this to say adsmylife sweet soul how i rejoice to see that charming flush in the finest cheek in the world but heaven forbid that i should dash so sweet a creature  well but now there is no going further excuse me ladies i mean not a slight to any of you but now you know there is no going further  and will you madam permit me to introduce to you as a lover as an humble servant a very proper and agreeable young man let me introduce him he is my nephew your looks are all graciousness perhaps you have seen him and if you are really disengaged you can have no objection to him of that i am confident and i am told that you have nobody that either can or will control you  the more controulable for that very reason sir rowland  adsmylife i like your answer why madam you must be full as good as you look to be i wish i were a young man myself for your sake but tell me madam will you permit a visit from my nephew this afternoon  come come dear young lady be as gracious as you look to be fortune must do had you not a shilling i should rejoice in such a niece and that is more than i ever said in my life before my nephew is a sober man a modest man he has a good estate of his own a clear  000 l a year i will add to it in my lifetime as much more be all this good company witnesses for me i am no flincher it is well known that the word of sir rowland meredith is as good as his bond at all times i love these open doings i love to be aboveboard what signifies shillyshally what says the old proverb  happys the wooing that is not long a doing but sir rowland said i there are proverbs that may be set against your proverb you hint that i have seen the gentleman now i have never yet seen the man whose addresses i could encourage  o i like you the better for that none but the giddy love at first sight adsmylife you would have been snapt up before now young as you are could you easily have returned love for love why madam you cannot be above sixteen  o sir rowland you are mistaken cheerfulness and a contented mind make a difference to advantage of half a dozen years at any time i am much nearer twentyone than nineteen i assure you  nearer to twentyone than nineteen and yet so freely tell your age without asking  miss byron sir rowland said mrs reeves is young enough at twenty surely to own her age  true madam but at twenty if not before time always stands still with women a ladys age once known will be always remembered and that more for spite than love at twentyeight or thirty i believe most ladies are willing to strike off half a dozen years at least  and yet and yet smiling and looking arch i have always said pardon me ladies that it is a sign when women are so desirous to conceal their age that they think they shall be good fornothing when in years ah ladies shaking his head and laughing women dont think of that but how i admire you madam for your frankness would to the lord you were twentyfour  i would have no woman marry under twentyfour and that let me tell you ladies for the following reasons  standing up and putting the forefinger of his right hand extended with a flourish upon the thumb of his left  o sir rowland i doubt not but you can give very good reasons and i assure you i intend not to marry on the wrong side as i call it of twentyfour  admirable by mercy but that will not do neither the man lives not young lady who will stay your time if he can have you at his i love your noble frankness then such sweetness of countenance sitting down and audibly whispering and jogging my cousin with his elbow such dovelike eyes daring to tell all that is in the honest heart  i am a physiognomist madam raising his voice to me adsmylife you are a perfect paragon say you will encourage my boy or you will be worse off for standing up again i will come and court you myself a good estate gives a man confidence and when i set about it  hum  one hand stuck in his side flourishing with the other no woman yet i do assure you  ever won my heart as you have done  o sir rowland i thought you were too wise to be swayed by first impressions none but the giddy you know love at first sight  admirable admirable indeed i knew you had wit at will and i am sure you have wisdom know you ladies that wit and wisdom are two different things and are very rarely seen together plain man as i appear to be looking on himself first on one side then on the other and unbuttoning his coat two buttons to let a gold braid appear upon his waistcoat i can tell ye i have not lived all this time for nothing i am considered in wales  hem  but i will not praise myself  adsmylife how do this young ladys perfections run me all into tongue  but i see you all respect her as well as i so i need not make apology to the rest of you young ladies for the distinction paid to her i wish i had as many nephews as there are ladies of ye disengaged by mercy we would be all of kin  thank you sir rowland said each of the young ladies smiling and diverted at his oddity  but as to my observation continued the knight that none but the giddy love at first sight there is no general rule without exception you know every man must love you at first sight do i not love you myself and yet never did i see you before nor any body like you  you know not what you do sir rowland to raise thus the vanity of a poor girl how may you make conceit and pride run away with her till she become contemptible for both in the eye of every person whose good opinion is worth cultivating  adsmylife that is prettily said but let me tell you that the she who can give this caution in the midst of her praisings can be in no danger of being run away with by her vanity why madam you extort praises from me i never ran on so glibly in praise of mortal woman before you must cease to look to smile to speak i can toll you if you would have me cease to praise you  it is well you are not a young man sir rowland said miss allestree you seem to have the art of engaging a womans attention you seem to know how to turn her own artillery against her and as your sex generally do exalt her in courtship that you may have it in your power to abase her afterward  why madam i must own that we men live to sixty before we know how to deal with you ladies or with the world either and then we are not fit to engage with the one and are ready to quit the other an old head upon a young pair of shoulders would make rare work among ye but to the main point looking very kindly on me i ask no questions about you madam fortune is not to be mentioned i want you not to have any not that the lady is the worse for having a fortune and a man may stand a chance for as good a wife among those who have fortunes as among those who have none i adore you for your frankness of heart be all of a piece now i beseech you you are disengaged you say will you admit of a visit from my nephew my boy may be bashful true love is always modest and diffident you dont look as if you would dislike a man for being modest and i will come along with him myself  and then the old knight looked important as one who if he lent his head to his nephews shoulders had no doubt of succeeding  what sir rowland admit of a visit from your nephew in order to engage him in a three years courtship i have told you that i intend not to marry till i am twentyfour  twentyfour i must own is the age of marriage i should choose for a lady and for the reasons aforesaid  but now i think of it i did not tell you my reasons  these be they  down went his cup and sawcer up went his left hand ready spread and his crooked finger of his right hand as ready to enumerate  no doubt sir rowland you have very good reasons  but madam you must hear them  and i shall prove   i am convinced sir rowland that twentyfour is an age early enough  but i shall prove madam that you at twenty or at twentyone   enough enough sir rowland what need of proof when one is convinced  but you know not madam what i was driving at   well but sir rowland said miss bramber will not the reasons you could give for the proper age at twentyfour make against your wishes in this case  they will make against them madam in general cases but in this particular case they will make for me for the lady before me is   not in my opinion perhaps sir rowland will your reasons make for you and then your exception in my favor will signify nothing and besides you must know that i never can accept of any compliment that is made me at the expense of my sex  well then madam i hope you forbid me in favor to my plea you are loath to hear any thing for twentyfour against twentyone i hope  that is another point sir rowland  why madam you seem to be afraid of hearing my reasons no man living knows better than i how to behave in ladies company i believe i should not be so little of a gentleman as to offend the nicest ear no need indeed no need indeed looking archly ladies on certain subjects are very quick  that is to say sir rowland interrupted mrs reeves that modesty is easily alarmed  if any thing is said or implied upon certain subjects that you would not be thought to understand ladies know how to be ignorant and then he laughed  undoubtedly sir rowland said i such company as this need not be apprehensive that a gentleman like you should say any thing unsuitable to it but do you really think affected ignorance can be ever graceful or a proof of true delicacy let me rather say that a woman of virtue would be wanting to her character if she had not courage enough to express her resentment of any discourse that is meant as an insult upon modesty  admirably said again but men will sometimes forget that there are ladies in company  very favorably put for the men sir rowland but pardon me if i own that i should have a mean opinion of a man who allowed himself to talk even to men what a woman might not hear a pure heart whether in man or woman will be always in every company on every occasion pure  adsmylife you have excellent notions madam i wanted to hear you speak just now and now you make me and every one else silent  twentyone why what you say would shame sixtyone you must have kept excellent company all your life  mercy if ever i heard the like from a lady so young  what a glory do you reflect back upon all who had any hand in your education why was i not born within the past thirty years i might then have had some hopes of you myself  and this brings me to my former subject of my nephew  but mr reeves one word with you mr reeves i beg your pardon ladies but the importance of the matter will excuse me and i must get out of town as soon as i can  one word with you mr reeves  the gentlemen withdrew together for breakfast by this time was over and then the knight opened all his heart to mr reeves and besought his interest he would afterward have obtained an audience as he called it of me but the three young ladies having taken leave of us and mrs reeves and i being retired to dress i desired to be excused  he then requested leave to attend me tomorrow evening but mr reeves pleading engagements till monday evening he besought him to indulge him with his interest in that long gap of time as he called it and for my being then in the way  and thus lucy have i given you an ample account of what has passed with regard to this new servant as gentlemen call themselves in order to become our masters  it is now friday morning we are just setting out to dine with lady betty if the day furnishes me with any amusing materials for my next packet its agreeableness will be doubled to  your everaffectionate harriet byron  letter x miss byron in continuation friday night some amusement my lucy the day has afforded indeed more than i could have wished a large packet however for selbyhouse  lady betty received us most politely she had company with her to whom she introduced us and presented me in a very advantageous character  shall i tell you how their first appearance struck me and what i have since heard and observed of them  the first i shall mention was miss cantillon very pretty but visibly proud affected and conceited  the second miss clements plain but of a fine understanding improved by reading and who having no personal advantages to be vain of has by the cultivation of her mind obtained a preference in every ones opinion over the fair cantillon  the third was miss barnevelt a lady of masculine features and whose mind belied not those features for she has the character of being loud bold free even fierce when opposed and affects at all times such airs of contempt of her own sex that one almost wonders at her condescending to wear petticoats  the gentlemens names were walden and singleton the first an oxford scholar of family and fortune but quaint and opinionated despising every one who has not had the benefit of an university education  mr singleton is an harmless man who is it seems the object of more ridicule even down to his very name among all his acquaintance than i think he by any means ought considering the apparent inoffensiveness of the man who did not give himself his intellects and his constant good humor which might entitle him to better quarter the rather too as he has one point of knowledge which those who think themselves his superiors in understanding do not always attain the knowledge of himself for he is humble modest ready to confess an inferiority to every one and as laughing at a jest is by some taken for high applause he is ever the first to bestow that commendation on what others say though it must be owned he nowandthen mistakes for a jest what is none which however may be generally more the fault of the speakers than of mr singleton since he takes his cue from their smiles especially when those are seconded by the laugh of one of whom he has a good opinion  mr singleton is in possession of a good estate which makes amends for many defects he has a turn it is said to the wellmanaging of it and nobody understands his own interest better than he by which knowledge he has opportunities to lay obligations upon many of those who behind his back think themselves entitled by their supposed superior sense to deride him and he is ready enough to oblige in this way but it is always on such securities that he has never given cause for spendthrifts to laugh at him on that account  it is thought that the friends of the fair cantillon would not be averse to an alliance with this gentleman while i were i his sister should rather wish that he had so much wisdom in his weakness as to devote himself to the worthier pulcheria clements lady bettys wish as well as mine whose fortune though not despicable and whose humbler views would make her think herself repaid the obligation she would lay him under by her acceptance of him  nobody it seems thinks of an husband for miss barnevelt she is sneeringly spoken of rather as a young fellow than as a woman and who will one day look out for a wife for herself one reason indeed she everywhere gives for being satisfied with being a woman which is that she cannot be married to a woman  an odd creature my dear but see what women get by going out of character like the bats in the fable they are looked upon as mortals of a doubtful species hardly owned by either and laughed at by both  this was the company and all the company besides us that lady betty expected but mutual civilities had hardly passed when lady betty having been called out returned introducing as a gentleman who would be acceptable to every one sir hargrave pollexfen he is whispered she to me as he saluted the rest of the company in a very gallant manner a young baronet of a very large estate the greatest part of which has lately come to him by the death of a grandmother and two uncles all very rich  when he was presented to me by name and i to him i think myself very happy said he in being admitted to the presence of a young lady so celebrated for her graces of person and mind then addressing himself to lady betty much did i hear when i was at the last northampton races of miss byron but little did i expect to find report fall so short of what i see  miss cantillon bridled played with her fan and looked as if she thought herself slighted a little scorn intermingled with the airs she gave herself  miss clements smiled and looked pleased as if she enjoyed goodnaturedly a compliment made to one of the sex which she adorns by the goodness of her heart  miss barnevelt said she had from the moment i first entered beheld me with the eye of a lover and freely taking my hand squeezed it  charming creature said she as if addressing to a country innocent and perhaps expecting me to be covered with blushes and confusion  the baronet excusing himself to lady betty assured her that she must place this his bold intrusion to the account of miss byron he having been told that she was to be there  whatever were his motive lady betty said he did her favor and she was sure the whole company would think themselves doubly obliged to miss byron  the student looked as if he thought himself eclipsed by sir hargrave and as if in revenge he was putting his fine speeches into latin and trying them by the rules of grammar a broken sentence from a classic author bursting from his lips and at last standing up half on tiptoe as if he wanted to look down upon the baronet he stuck one hand in his side and passed by him casting a contemptuous eye on his gaudy dress  mr singleton smiled and looked as if delighted with all he saw and heard once indeed he tried to speak his mouth actually opened to give passage to his words as sometimes seems to be his way before the words are quite ready but he sat down satisfied with the effort  it is true people who do not make themselves contemptible by affectation should not be despised poor and rich wise and unwise we are all links of the same great chain and you must tell me my dear if i in endeavoring to give true descriptions of the persons i see incur the censure i bestow on others who despise anyone for defects they cannot help  will you forgive me my dear if i make this letter as long as my last  no say  well then i thank you for a freedom so consistent with our friendship and i will conclude with assureances that i am and ever will be  most affectionately yours harriet byron  letter xi miss byron in continuation it was convenient to me lucy to break off just where i did in my last else i should not have been so very selfdenying as to suppose you had no curiosity to hear what undoubtedly i wanted to tell two girls talking over a new set of company would my uncle selby say are not apt to break off very abruptly not she especially of the two who has found out a fair excuse to repeat every compliment made to herself and when perhaps there may be a new admirer in the case  may there so my uncle and which of the gentlemen do you think the man the baronet i warrant you guess  and so he is  well then let me give you lucy a sketch of him but consider i form my accounts from what i have since been told as well as from what i observed at the time  sir hargrave pollexfen is handsome and genteel pretty tall about twentyeight or thirty his complexion is a little of the fairest for a man and a little of the palest he has remarkably bold eyes rather approaching to what we would call goggling and he gives himself airs with them as if he wished to have them thought rakish perhaps as a recommendation in his opinion to the ladies miss cantillon on his back being turned lady betty praising his person said sir hargrave had the finest eyes she ever saw in a man they were manly meaning ones  he is very voluble in speech but seems to owe his volubility more to his want of doubt than to the extraordinary merit of what he says yet he is thought to have sense and if he could prevail upon himself to hear more and speak less he would better deserve the good opinion he thinks himself sure of but as he can say anything without hesitation and excites a laugh by laughing himself at all he is going to say as well as at what he has just said he is thought infinitely agreeable by the gay and by those who wish to drown thought in merriment  sir hargrave it seems has traveled but he must have carried abroad with him a great number of follies and a great deal of affectation if he has left any of them behind him  but with all his foibles he is said to be a man of enterprise and courage and young ladies it seems must take care how they laugh with him for he makes ungenerous constructions to the disadvantage of a woman whom he can bring to seem pleased with his jests i will tell you hereafter how i came to know this and even worse of him  the taste of the present age seems to be dress no wonder therefore that such a man as sir hargrave aims to excel in it what can be misbestowed by a man on his person who values it more than his mind but he would in my opinion better become his dress if the pains he undoubtedly takes before he ventures to come into public were less apparent this i judge from his solicitude to preserve all in exact order when in company for he forgets not to pay his respects to himself at every glass yet does it with a seeming consciousness as if he would hide a vanity too apparent to be concealed breaking from it if he finds himself observed with an halfcareless yet seemingly dissatisfied air pretending to have discovered something amiss in himself this seldom fails to bring him a compliment of which he shows himself very sensible by affectedly disclaiming the merit of it perhaps with this speech bowing with his spread hand on his breast waving his head to and fro  by my soul madam or sir you do me too much honor  such a man is sir hargrave pollexfen he placed himself next to the country girl and laid himself out in fine speeches to her running on in such a manner that i had not for some time an opportunity to convince him that i had been in company of gay people before he would have it that i was a perfect beauty and he supposed me very young  very silly of course and gave himself such airs as if he were sure of my admiration  i viewed him steadily several times and my eye once falling under his as i was looking at him i dare say he at that moment pitied the poor fond heart which he supposed was in tumults about him when at the very time i was considering whether if i were obliged to have the one or the other as a punishment for some great fault i had committed my choice would fall on mr singleton or on him i mean supposing the former were not a remarkably obstinate man since obstinacy in a weak man i think must be worse than tyranny in a man of sense  if indeed a man of sense can be a tyrant  a summons to dinner relieved me from his more particular addresses and placed him at a distance from me  sir hargrave the whole time of dinner received advantage from the supercilious looks and behavior of mr walden who seemed on everything the baronet said and he was seldom silent half to despise him for he made at times so many different mouths of contempt that i thought it was impossible for the same features to express them i have been making mouths in the glass for several minutes to try to recover some of mr waldens in order to describe them to you lucy but i cannot for my life so distort my face as to enable me to give you a notion of one of them  he might perhaps have been better justified in some of his contempts had it not been visible that the consequence which he took from the baronet he gave to himself and yet was as censurable one way as sir hargrave was the other  mirth however insipid will occasion smiles though sometimes to the disadvantage of the mirthful but gloom severity moroseness will always disgust though in a solomon mr walden had not been taught that and indeed it might seem a little ungrateful dont you think so lucy if women failed to reward a man with their smiles who scrupled not to make himself a  monkey shall i say to please them  never before did i see the difference between the man of the town and the man of the college displayed in a light so striking as in these two gentlemen in the conversation after dinner the one seemed resolved not to be pleased while the other laid himself out to please everybody and that in a manner so much at his own expense as frequently to bring into question his understanding by a second silly thing he banished the remembrance of a first by a third the second and so on and by continually laughing at his own absurdities left us at liberty to suppose that his folly was his choice and that had it not been to divert the company he could have made a better figure  mr walden as was evident by his scornsul brow by the contemptuous motions of his lip and by his whole face affectedly turned from the baronet grudged him the smile that sat upon everyones countenance and for which without distinguishing whether it was a smile of approbation or not he looked as if he pitied us all and as if he thought himself cast into unequal company nay twice or thrice he addressed himself in preference to every one else to honest simpering mr singleton who for his part as was evident much better relished the baronets flippances than the dry significance of the student for whenever sir hargrave spoke mr singletons mouth was open but it was quite otherwise with him when mr walden spoke even at the time that he paid him the distinction of addressing himself to him as if he were the principal person in the company  but one word by the bye lucy  dont you think it is very happy for us foolish women that the generality of the lords of the creation are not much wiser than ourselves or to express myself in other words that overwisdom is as foolish a thing to the full as moderate solly  but hush i have done  i know that at this place my uncle will be ready to rise against me  after dinner mr walden not choosing to be any longer so egregiously eclipsed by the man of the town put forth the scholar  by the way let me ask my uncle if the word scholar means not the learner rather than the learned if it originally means no more i would suppose that formerly the most learned men were the most modest contenting themselves with being thought but learners a modesty well becoming a learned man since vast is the field of science as my revered first instructor used to say and the more a man knows the more he will find he has to know  pray sir hargrave said mr walden may i ask you  you had a thought just now speaking of love and beauty which i know you must have from tibullus and then he repeated the line in an heroic accent and pausing looked round upon us women which university had the honor of finishing your studies sir hargrave i presume you were brought up at one of them  not i said the baronet a man surely may read tibullus and virgil too without being indebted to either university for his learning  no man sir hargrave in my humble opinion with a decisive air he spoke the word humble can be wellgrounded in any branch of learning who has not been at one of our famous universities  i never yet proposed mr walden to qualify myself for a degree my chaplain is a very pretty fellow he understands tibullus i believe immoderately laughing and by his eyes cast in turn upon each person at table bespeaking a general smile  and of oxford as you are and again he laughed but his laugh was then such a one as rather showed ridicule than mirth a provoking laugh such a one as mr greville often affects when he is in a disputatious humor in order to dash an opponent out of countenance by getting the laugh instead of the argument on his side  my uncle you know will have it sometimes that his girl has a satirical vein i am afraid she has  a bold hussy  but this i will say i mean no ill nature i love everybody but not their faults as my uncle in his letter tells me and wish not to be spared for my own nor very probably am i if those who see me write of me to their chosen friends as i do to mine of them shall i tell you what i imagine each person of the company i am writing about writing in character would say of me to their correspondents  it would be digressing too much or i would  mr walden in his heart i dare say was revenged on the baronet he gave him such a look as would have grieved me the whole day had it been given me by one whom i valued  sir hargrave had too much business for his eyes with the ladies in order to obtain their countenance to trouble himself about the looks of the men and indeed he seemed to have as great a contempt for mr walden as mr walden had for him  but here i shall be too late for the post will this stuff go down with you at selbyhouse in want of better subjects  every thing from you my harriet   thank you thank you all my indulgent friends so it ever was trifles from those we love are acceptable may i deserve your love  adieu my lucy  but tell my nancy that she has delighted me by her letter  h b  letter xii miss byron in continuation what is your opinion my charming miss byron said the baronet may not a man of fortune who has not received his education and polish he pronounced the word polish with an emphasis and another laugh at an university make as good a figure in social life and as ardent a lover as if he had  i would have been silent but staring in my face he repeated what say you to this miss byron  the world sir hargrave i have heard called an university but in my humble opinion neither a learned nor what is called a fine education has any other value than as each tends to improve the morals of men and to make them wise and good  the world an university repeated mr walden why truly looking up to sir hargraves face and then down to his feet disdainfully as if he would measure him with his eye i cannot but say twisting his head on one side and with a drolling accent that the world produces very pretty scholars  for the ladies   the baronet took fire at being so contemptuously measured by the eye of the scholar and i thought it was not amiss for fear of high words between them to put myself forward  and are not women mr walden resumed i one half in number though not perhaps in value of the human species  would it not be pity sir if the knowledge that is to be obtained in the lesser university should make a man despise what is to be acquired in the greater in which that knowledge was principally intended to make him useful  this diverted the baronets anger well mr walden said he exultingly rubbing his hands what say you to the young ladys observation by my soul it is worth your notice you may carry it down with you to your university and the best scholars there will not be the worse for attending to it  mr walden seemed to collect himself as if he were inclined to consider me with more attention than he had given me before and waving his hand as if he would put by the baronet as an adversary he had done with i am to thank you madam said he it seems for your observation and so the lesser university   i have great veneration mr walden interrupted i for learning and great honor for learned men  but this is a subject   that you must not get off from young lady  i am sorry to hear you say so sir  but indeed i must  the company seemed pleased to see me so likely to be drawn in and this encouraged mr walden to push his weak adversary  know you madam said he anything of the learned languages  no indeed sir  nor do i know which particularly you call so  the greek the latin madam  who i a woman know any thing of latin and greek i know but one lady who is mistress of both and she finds herself so much an owl among the birds that she wants of all things to be thought to have unlearned them  why ladies i cannot but say that i should rather choose to marry a woman whom i could teach something than one who would think herself qualified to teach me  is it a necessary consequence sir said miss clements that knowledge which makes a man shine should make a woman vain and pragmatical may not two persons having the same taste improve each other was not this the case of monsieur and madame dacier think you  flint and steel to each other added lady betty  turkish policy i doubt in you men proceeded miss clements  no second brother near the throne that empire some think the safest which is founded in ignorance  we know miss clements replied mr walden that you are a wellread lady but i have nothing to say to observations that are in everybodys mouth  pardon me madam  indeed sir said mr reeves i think miss clements should not pardon you there is in my opinion great force in what she hinted  but i have a mind to talk with this fair lady your cousin mr reeves she is the very lady that i wish to hold an argument with on the hints she threw out  pardon me sir but i cannot return the compliment i cannot argue  and yet madam i will not let you go off so easily you seem to be very happy in your elocution and to have some pretty notions for so young a lady  i cannot argue sir   dear miss byron said the baronet hear what mr walden has to say to you  every one made the same request i was silent looked down and played with my fan  when mr walden had liberty to say what he pleased he seemed at a loss himself for words  at last i asked you madam i asked you hesitatingly began he whether you knew any thing of the learned languages it has been whispered to me that you have had great advantages from a grandfather of whose learning and politeness we have heard much he was a scholar he was of christs in our university if i am not mistaken  to my question you answered that you knew not particularly which were the languages that i called the learned ones and you have been pleased to throw out hints in relation to the lesser and to the greater university by all which you certainly mean something   pray mr walden said i   and pray miss byron  i am afraid of all smatterers in learning those who know a little  and ladies cannot know to the bottom  they have not the happiness of an university education   nor is every man at the university i presume sir a mr walden  he took it for a compliment  why as to that madam  bowing  but this is a misfortune to ladies not a fault in them  but as i was going to say those who know little are very seldom sound are very seldom orthodox as we call it whether respecting religion or learning and as it seems you lost your grandfather too early to be wellgrounded in the latter in the former lady betty who is my informant says you are a very good young lady i should be glad to put you right if you happen to be a little out of the way  i thank you sir bowing and simpleton still playing with my fan but though mr reeves said nothing he did not think me very politely treated yet he wanted he told me afterward to have me drawn out he should not have served me so i told him especially among strangers and men  now madam will you be pleased to inform me said mr walden whether you had any particular meaning when you answered that you knew not which i called the learned languages you must know that the latin and greek are of those so called  i beg mr walden that i may not be thus singled out  mr reeves  sir  you have had universityeducation pray relieve your cousin  mr reeves smiled bowed his head but said nothing  you were pleased madam proceeded mr walden to mention one learned lady and said that she looked upon herself as an owl among the birds   and you sir said that you had rather and i believe most men are of your mind have a woman you could teach   than one who would suppose she could teach me i did so  well sir and would you have me be guilty of an ostentation that would bring me no credit if i had had some pains taken with me in my education but indeed sir i know not anything of those you call the learned languages nor do i take all learning to consist in the knowledge of languages  all learning  nor i madam  but if you place not learning in language be so good as to tell us what do you place it in  he nodded his head with an air as if he had said this pretty miss is got out of her depth i believe i shall have her now  i would rather sir said i be an hearer than a speaker and the one would better become me than the other i answered sir hargrave because he thought proper to apply to me  and i madam apply to you likewise  then sir i have been taught to think that a learned man and a linguist may very well be two persons in other words that science or knowledge and not language merely is learning  very well be pleased to proceed madam  languages i own sir are of use to let us into the knowledge for which so many of the ancients were famous  but   here i stopped every ones eyes were upon me i was a little out of countenance  in what a situation lucy are we women  if we have some little genius and have taken pains to cultivate it we must be thought guilty of affectation whether we appear desirous to conceal it or submit to have it called forth  but what madam pray proceed eagerly said mr walden  but what madam  but have not the moderns sir if i must speak if they have equal geniuss the same heavens the same earth the same works of god or of nature as it is called to contemplate upon and improve by the first great geniuss of all had not human example had not human precepts   nor were the first geniuss of all with an emphasis replied mr walden so perfect as the observations of the geniuss of aftertimes which were built upon their foundations made them and they others learning or knowledge as you choose to call it was a progressive thing and it became necessary to understand the different languages in which the sages of antiquity wrote in order to avail ourselves of their learning  very right sir i believe you consider skill in languages then as a vehicle to knowledge  not i presume as science itself  i was sorry the baronet laughed because his laughing made it more difficult for me to get off as i wanted to do  pray sir hargrave said mr walden let not every thing that is said be laughed at i am fond of talking to this young lady and a conversation upon this topic may tend as much to edification perhaps as most of the subjects with which we have been hitherto entertained  sir hargrave took an empty glass and with it humourously rapped his own knuckles bowed smiled and was silent by that act of yielding which had gracefulness in it gaining more honor to himself than mr walden obtained by his rebuke of him however just  but this humourous acknowlegement hindered not mr walden from showing by a nod given with an assuming air that he thought he had obtained a victory over the baronet and then he again applied himself to me  now madam if you please and he put himself into a disputing attitude a word or two with you on your vehicle and sosorth  pray spare me sir i am willing to sit down quietly i am unequal to this subject i have done  but said the baronet you must not sit down quietly madam mr walden has promised us edification and we all attend the effect of his promise  no no madam said mr walden you must not come off so easily you have thrown out some extraordinary things for a lady and especially for so young a lady from you we expect the opinions of your worthy grandfather as well as your own notions he no doubt told you or you have read that the competition set on foot between the learning of the ancients and moderns has been the subject of much debate among the learned in the latter end of the last century  indeed sir i know nothing of the matter i am not learned my grandfather was chiefly intent to make me an english and i may say a bible scholar i was very young when i had the misfortune to lose him my whole endeavor has been since that the pains he took with me should not be cast away  i have discovered you madam to be a parthian lady you can fight flying i see you must not i tell you come off so easily for what you have thrown out let me ask you did you ever read the tale of a tub  the baronet laughedout though evidently in the wrong place  how apt are laughing spirits said mr walden looking solemnly to laugh when perhaps they ought  there he stopped  to be laughed at i suppose he had in his head but i will not however be laughed out of my question  have you madam read swifts tale of a tub  there is such a book sir hargrave looking with a leer of contempt at the baronet  i know there is mr walden replied the baronet and again laughed  have you madam to me pray let us know what mr walden drives at  i have sir  why then madam resumed mr walden you no doubt read bound up with it the battle of the books a very fine piece written in favor of the ancients and against the moderns and thence must be acquainted with the famous dispute i mentioned and this will show you that the moderns are but pygmies in science compared to the ancients and pray shall not the knowledge which enables us to understand and to digest the wisdom of these immortal ancients be accounted learning  pray madam nodding his head answer me that  o how these pedants whispered sir hargrave to mr reeves strut in the livery and brass buttons of the ancients and call their servility learning  you are going beyond my learning or capacity sir i must agree that the knowledge which enables us to comprehend the wisdom of the ancients and to be improved by it deserves to be called learning yet the ancients may be read i suppose and not understood  but pray sir let the parthian fly the field i promise you that she will not return to the charge escape not victory is all she contends for  all in good time madam  but who pray learns the language but with a view to understand the author  nobody i believe sir but yet some who read the ancients may fail of understanding them or at least of improving by them for every scholar i presume is not necessarily a man of sense  the baronet was wicked here in pointing by a laugh as particular satire what i meant but as general observation  but supposing the knowledge of these ancients continued i as great as you please is it not to be lamented is it not indeed strange that none of the modern learned notwithstanding the advantage of their works most of which they have taught to speak our language notwithstanding the later important discoveries in many branches of science notwithstanding a revelation from heaven to which the religion of the pagans was foolishness and on which foolishness however i am told most of the works of antiquity are founded should have deserved a higher consideration in the comparison than as pygmies to giants  i was going to say something farther but the baronet by his loud applauses disconcerted me and i was silent  proceed madam  no triumph no cause of triumph here sir hargrave  pray madam proceed  you have not done i perceive  i should be very glad sir to have done pray change either the subject or choose another disputant  every one called upon me to proceed and mr walden urged me to say what i was going to say  but will you not my lucy be glad of a little relief from this argument  yes say  here then i conclude this letter to begin another but it must be after i return from the play this night or early in the morning before i go to church  letter xiii miss byron in continuation urged thus by every one what i had further in my thoughts to say resumed i was from what i read in my bible the first man seems to have had an intuitive knowledge given him of almost all that concerned him to know and his early descendants while there was but one language and long before the greek and roman sages existed understood husbandry and music were artificers in brass and iron built that surprising naval structure the ark attempted a yet greater piece of architecture the tower of babel and therefore must have had skill in many other parts of science which are not particularly mentioned  and so madam you really seem to think that the knowledge we gather from the great ancients is hardly worth the pains we take in acquiring the languages in which they wrote  not so sir i have great respect even for linguists do we not owe to them the translation of the sacred books  but methinks i could wish that such a distinction should be made between language and science as should convince me that that confusion of tongues which was intended for a punishment of presumption in the early ages of the world should not be thought to give us our greatest glory in these more enlightened times  well madam ladies must be treated as ladies but i shall have great pleasure on my return to oxford in being able to acquaint my learned friends that they must all turn fine gentlemen and laughers mr reeves had smiled as well as the baronet and despise the great ancients as men of straw or very shortly they will stand no chance in the ladies favor  good mr walden good mr walden laughed the baronet shaking his embroidered sides let me let me beg your patience while i tell you that the young gentlemen at both universities are already in more danger of becoming fine gentlemen than fine scholars  and then again he laughed and looking round him bespoke in his usual way a laugh from the rest of the company  mr reeves a little touched at the scholars reference to him in the word laughers said it were to be wished that in all nurseries of learning the manners of youth were proposed as the principal end it is too known a truth said he that the attention paid to languages has too generally swallowed up all other and more important considerations insomuch that sound morals and good breeding themselves are obliged to give way to that which is of little moment but as it promotes and inculcates those and learned men i am persuaded if they dared to speak out would not lay so much stress upon languages as you mr walden seem to do  learning here replied mr walden a little peevishly has not a fair tribunal to be tried at as it is said of the advantages of birth or degree so it may be said of learning no one despises it that has pretensions to it but proceed miss byron if you please  very true i believe sir said i but on the other hand may not those who have either or both value themselves too much on that account i knew once an excellent scholar who thought that too great a portion of life was bestowed in the learning of languages and that the works of many of the ancients were more to be admired for the stamp which antiquity has fixed upon them and for the sake of their purity in languages that cannot alter and whose works are therefore become the standard of those languages than for the lights obtained from them by men of genius in ages that we have reason to think more enlightened as well by new discoveries as by revelation  and then i was going to ask whether the reputation of learning was not oftener acquired by skill in those branches of science which principally serve for amusement to inquisitive and curious minds than by that in the more useful sort but mr walden broke in upon me with an air that had severity in it  i could almost wish said he and but almost as you are a lady that you knew the works of the great ancients in their original languages  something said miss clements should be left for men to excel in i cannot but approve of mr waldens word almost  she then whispered me pray miss byron proceed for she saw me a little out of countenance at mr waldens severe air  strange added she still whispering that people who know least how to argue should be most disputatious thank heaven all scholars are not like this  a little encouraged pray sir said i let me ask one question  whether you do not think that our milton in his paradise lost shows himself to be a very learned man  and yet that work is written wholly in the language of his own country as the works of homer and virgil were in the language of theirs  and they i presume will be allowed to be learned men  milton madam let me tell you is infinitely obliged to the great ancients and his very frequent allusions to them and his knowledge of their mythology show that he is  his knowledge of their mythology sir  his own subject so greatly so nobly so divinely above that mythology  i have been taught to think by a very learned man that it was a condescension in milton to the taste of persons of more reading than genius in the age in which he wrote to introduce so often as he does his allusions to the pagan mythology and that he neither raised his sublime subject nor did credit to his vast genius by it  mr addision said mr walden is a writer admired by the ladies mr addison madam as you will find in your spectators sneeringly he spoke this gives but the second place to milton on comparing some passage of his with some of homer  if mr addison sir has not the honor of being admired by the gentlemen as well as the ladies i dare say mr walden will not allow that his authority should decide the point in question and yet as i remember he greatly extols milton  but i am going out of my depth  only permit me to say one thing more  if homer is to be preferred to milton he must be the sublimest of writers and mr pope admirable as his translation of the iliad is said to be cannot have done him justice  you seem madam to be a very deep english scholar but say you this from your own observation or from that of any other  i readily own that my lights are borrowed replied i i owe the observation to my godfather mr deane he is a scholar but a greater admirer of milton than of any of the ancients a gentleman his particular friend who was as great an admirer of homer undertook from mr popes translation of the iliad to produce passages that in sublimity exceeded any in the paradise lost the gentlemen met at mr deanes house where i then was they allowed me to be present and this was the issue the gentleman went away convinced that the english poet as much excelled the grecian in the grandeur of his sentiments as his subject founded on the christian system surpasses the pagan  the debate i have the vanity to think said mr walden had i been a party in it would have taken another turn  the baronet expressed himself highly delighted with me and was running over with the praises he had heard given me at last northampton races when i endeavored to stop him by saying surely sir it must be your too low opinion of the qualifications of our sex that can induce you to think such obvious remarks as i have been drawn in to make at all considerable  but this hindered not sir hargrave from being even noisy in his applauses he would have it that i must know a vast deal because i happened to touch upon some things that had not taken his attention he drowned the voice of mr walden who two or three times was earnest to speak but not finding himself heard drew up his mouth as if to a contemptuous whistle shruggd his shoulders and sat collected in his own conscious worthiness his eyes however were often cast upon the pictures that hung round the room as much better objects than the living ones before him  but what extremely disconcerted me was a freedom of miss barnevelts taken upon what i last said and upon mr waldens hesitation and sir hargraves applauses she prosessed that i was able to bring her own sex into reputation with her wisdom as i call it said she notwithstanding what you have modestly alleged to depreciate your own proceeding throteeth of ivory and lips of coral give a grace to every word and then clasping one of her mannish arms round me she kissed my cheek  i was surprised and offended and with the more reason as sir hargrave rising from his seat declared that since merit was to be approved in that manner he thought himself obliged to follow so good an example  i stood up and said surely sir my compliance with the request of the company too much i fear at my own expense calls rather for civility than freedom from a gentleman i beg sir hargrave  there i stopped and i am sure looked greatly in earnest  he stood suspended till i had speaking and then bowing sat down again but as mr reeves told me afterward he whispered a great oath in his ear and declared that he beheld with transport his future wife and cursed himself if he would ever have another vowing in the same whisper that were a thousand men to stand in his way he would not scruple any means to remove them  miss barnevelt only laughed at the freedom she had taken with me she is a loud and fearless laugher she hardly knows how to smile for as soon as anything catches her fancy her voice immediately bursts her lips and widens her mouth to its full extent  forgive me lucy i believe i am spiteful  lady betty and miss clements in low voices praised me for my presence of mind as they called it in checking sir hargraves forwardness  just here lucy i laid down my pen and stepped to the glass to see whether i could not please myself with a wise frown or two at least with a solemnity of countenance that occasionally i might dash with it my childishness of look which certainly encouraged this freedom of miss barnevelt but i could not please myself my muscles have never been used to anything but smiling so favored so beloved by every one of my dear friends an heart so grateful for all their favors  how can i learn now to frown or even long to look grave  all this time the scholar sat uneasilycareless can you connect together my lucy ideas so very different as these two words joined will give you  in the mean time mr reeves having sent for from his study bishop burnets history of his own times said he would by way of moderatorship in the present debate read them a passage to which he believed all parties would subscribe and then read what i will transcribe for you from the conclusion to that performance  i have often thought it a great error to waste young gentlemens years so long in learning latin by so tedious a grammar i know those who are bred to the profession in literature must have the latin correctly and for that the rules of grammar are necessary but these rules are not at all requisite to those who need only so much latin as thoroughly to understand and delight in the roman authors and poets but suppose a youth had either for want of memory or of application an incurable a version to latin his education is not for that to be despaired of there is much noble knowledge to be had in the english and french languages geography history chiefly that of our own country the knowledge of nature and the more practical parts of the mathematics if he has not a genius for the demonstrative may make a gentleman very knowing though he has not a word of latin and why i would fain know said mr reeves not a gentlewoman there is a fineness of thought and a nobleness of expression indeed in the latin authors this makes for your argument mr walden that will make them the entertainment of a mans whole life if he once understands and reads them with delight very well said mr walden but if this cannot be attained to i would not have it reckoned that the education of an ill latin scholar is to be given over  thus far the bishop we all know proceeded mr reeves how well mr lock has treated this subject and he is so far from discouraging the fair sex from learning languages that he gives us a method in his treatise of education by which a mother may not only learn latin herself but be able to teach it to her son be not therefore ladies ashamed either of your talents or acquirements only take care you give not up any knowledge that is more laudable in your sex and more useful for learning and then i am sure you will you must be the more agreeable the more suitable companions to men of sense nor let any man have so narrow a mind as to be apprehensive for his own prerogative from a learned woman a woman who does not behave the better the more she knows will make her husband uneasy and will think as well of herself were she utterly illiterate nor would any argument convince her of her duty do not men marry with their eyes open and cannot they court whom they please a conceited a vain mind in a woman cannot be hid upon the whole i think it may be fairly concluded that the more a woman knows as well as a man the wiser she will generally be and the more regard she will have for a man of sense and learning  here ended mr reeves mr walden was silent yet shrugged his shoulders and seemed unsatisfied  the conversation then took a more general turn in which every one bore a part plays fashion dress and the public entertainments were the subjects  miss cantillon who had till now sat a little uneasy seemed resolved to make up for her silence but did not shine at all where she thought herself most entitled to make a figure  but miss clements really shone yet in the eye of some people what advantages has folly in a pretty face over even wisdom in a plain one sir hargrave was much more struck with the pert things spoken without fear or wit by miss cantillon than with the just observations that fell from the lips of miss clements  mr walden made no great figure on these fashionable subjects no not on that of plays for he would needs force into conversation with a preference to our shakespeare his sophocles his euripides his terence of the merits of whose performances except by translation no one present but mr reeves and himself could judge  sir hargrave spoke well on the subject of the reigning fashions and on modern dress so much the foible of the present age  lady betty and mrs reeves spoke very properly of the decency of dress and propriety of fashions as well as of public entertainments  miss clements put in here also with advantage to herself  nor would mr walden be excluded this topic but as the observations he made on it went no deeper than what it was presumed he might have had at secondhand he made a worse figure here than he did on his more favorite subject he was however heard till he was for bringing in his spartan jacket i forget what he called it descending only to the knees of the women in place of hoops and the roman toga for the men  my uncle will be pleased to remember that mr walden has given my letters the learned jaundice had not that gentleman been one of the company not a word of all this jargon would my uncle have had from his harriet and yet all i have said is but from common reading and let me ask why because we know but little we are to be supposed to know nothing  miss barnevelt broke in upon the scholar but by way of approbation of what he said and went on with subjects of heroism without permitting him to rally and proceed as he seemed inclined to do after praising what he said of the spartan and roman dresses she fell to enumerating her heroes both ancient and modern achilles the savage achilles charmed her hector was a good clever man however yet she could not bear to think of his being so mean as to beg for his life though of her heroic achilles he deserved for it she said to have his corpse dragged round the trojan walls at the wheels of the victors chariot alexander the great was her dear creature and julius caesar was a very pretty fellow these were miss barnevelts ancient heroes among the moderns the great scanderbeg our henry v henry iv of france charles xii of sweden and the great czar peter who my grandfather used to say was worth them all were her favorites  all this while honest mr singleton had a smile at the service of every speaker and a loud laugh always ready at the baronets  sir hargrave seemed not a little pleased with the honest mans complaisance and always directed himself to him when he was disposed to be merry laughing you know my dear is almost as catching as gaping be the subject ever so silly and more than once he showed by his eyes that he could have devoured miss cantillon for generally adding her affected tehe twisting and bridling behind her fan to his louder hah hah hah hah  what a length have i run how does this narrative letterwriting if one is to enter into minute and characteristic descriptions and conversations draw one on i will leave off for the present yet have not quite dismissed the company though i have done with the argument that i thought to have parted with before i concluded this letter  but i know i shall please my uncle in the livelier parts of it by the handle they will give him against me my grandmother and aunt selby will be pleased and so will you my lucy with all i write for the writers sake such is their and your partial love to  their evergrateful harriet  letter xiv miss byron in continuation by the time tea was ready lady betty whisperingly congratulated me on having made so considerable a conquest as she was sure i had by sir hargraves looks in which was mingled reverence with admiration as she expressed herself she took notice also of a gallant expression of his uttered as she would have it with an earnestness that gave it a meaning beyond a common compliment my cousin reeves had asked miss clements if she could commend to me an honest modest manservant i said sir hargrave can i myself shall be proud to wear miss byrons livery and that for life  miss cantillon who was within hearing of this and had seemed to be highly taken with the baronet could hardly let her eyes be civil to me and yet her really pretty mouth occasionally worked itself into forced smiles and an affectation of complaisance  sir hargrave was extremely obsequious to me all the teatime and seemed in earnest a little uneasy in himself and after tea he took my cousin reeves into the next room and there made your harriet the subject of a serious conversation and desired his interest with me  he prefaced his declaration to mr reeves with assuring him that he had sought for an opportunity more than once to be admitted into my company when he was last at northampton and that he had not intruded himself then into this company had he not heard i was to be there he made protestations of his honorable views which looked as if he thought they might be doubted if he had not given such assurances a tacit implication of an imagined superiority as well in consequence as fortune  mr reeves told him it was a rule which all my relations had set themselves not to interfere with my choice let it be placed on whom it would  sir hargrave called himself an happy man upon this intelligence he afterward on his return to company found an opportunity as mrs reeves and i were talking at the furthest part of the room in very vehement terms to declare himself to me an admirer of perfections of his own creation for he volubly enumerated many and begged my permission to pay his respects to me at mr reevess  mr reeves sir hargrave said i will receive what visits he pleases in his own house i have no permission to give  he bowed and made me a very high compliment taking what i said for a permission  what can a woman do with these selfflatterers  mr walden took his leave sir hargrave his he wanted i saw to speak to me at his departure but i gave him no opportunity  mr singleton seemed also inclined to go but knew not how and having lost the benefit of their example by his irresolution sat down  lady betty then repeated her congratulations how many ladies said she and fine ladies too have sighed in secret for sir hargrave you will have the glory miss byron of fixing the wavering heart of a man who has done and is capable of doing a great deal of mischief  the ladies madam said i who can sigh in secret for such a man as sir hargrave must either deserve a great deal of pity or none at all  sir hargrave said miss cantillon is a very fine gentleman and so looked upon i assure you and he has a noble estate  it is very happy replied i that we do not all of us like the same person i mean not to disparage sir hargrave but i have compassion for the ladies who sigh for him in secret one woman only can be his wife and perhaps she will not be one of those who sigh for him especially were he to know that she does  perhaps not replied miss cantillon but i do assure you that i am not one of those who sigh for sir hargrave  the ladies smiled  i am glad of it madam said i every woman should have her heart in her own keeping till she can find a worthy man to bestow it upon  miss barnevelt took a tilt in heroics well ladies said she you may talk of love and love as much as you please but it is my glory that i never knew what love was i for my part like a brave man a gallant man one in whose loud praise fame has cracked half a dozen trumpets but as to your milksops your doughbaked lovers who stay at home and strut among the women when glory is to be gained in the martial field i despise them with all my heart i have often wished that the foolish heads of such fellows as these were all cut off in time of war and sent over to the heroes to fill their cannon with when they batter in breach by way of saving ball  i am afraid said lady betty humouring this romantic speech that if the heads of such persons were as soft as we are apt sometimes to think them they would be of as little service abroad as they are at home  o madam replied miss barnevelt there is a good deal of lead in the heads of these fellows but were their brains said the shocking creature if any they have made to fly about the ears of an enemy they would serve both to blind and terrify him  even mr singleton was affected with this horrid speech for he clapped both his hands to his head as if he were afraid of his brains  lady betty was very urgent with us to pass the evening with her but we excused ourselves and when we were in the coach mr reeves told me that i should find the baronet a very troublesome and resolute lover if i did not give him countenance  and so sir said i you would have me do as i have heard many a good woman has done marry a man in order to get rid of his importunity  and a certain cure too let me tell you cousin said he smiling  we sound at home waiting for mr reevess return sir john allestree a worthy sensible man of plain and unaffected manners upwards of fifty  mr reeves mentioning to him our past entertainment and company sir john gave us such an account of sir hargrave as helped me not only in the character i have given of him but let me know that he is a very dangerous and enterprising man he says that laughing and light as he is in company he is malicious illnatured and designing and sticks at nothing to carry a point on which he has once set his heart he has ruined sir john says three young creatures already under vows of marriage  sir john spoke of him as a managing man as to his fortune he said that though he would at times be lavish in the pursuit of his pleasures yet that he had some narrownesses which made him despised and that most by those for whose regard a good man would principally wish his neighbors and tenants  could you have thought my lucy that this laughing finedressing man could have been a man of malice of resentment of enterprise a cruel man yet sir john told two very bad stories of him besides what i have mentioned which prove him to be all i have said  but i had no need of these stories to determine me against receiving his addresses what i saw of him was sufficient though sir john made no manner of doubt on being told by mr reeves in confidence of his application to him for leave to visit me that he was quite in earnest and making me a compliment added that he knew sir hargrave was inclined to marry and the more as one half of his estate on failure of issue male would go at his death to a distant relation whom he hated but for no other reason than for admonishing him when a schoolboy on his low and mischievous pranks  his estate sir john told my cousin is full as considerable as reported and mr reeves after sir john went away said what a glory will it be to you cousin byron to reform such a man and make his great fortune a blessing to multitudes as i am sure would be your endeavor to do were you lady pollexfen  but my lucy were sir hargrave king of one half of the globe i would not go to the altar with him  but if he be a very troublesome man what shall i say to him i can deal pretty well with those who will be kept at arms length but i own i should be very much perplexed with resolute wretches the civility i think myself obliged to pay every one who prosesses a regard for me might subject me to inconveniences with violent spirits which protected as i have been by my uncle selby and my good mr deane i never yet have known o my lucy to what evils but for that protection might i not as a sole an independent young woman have been exposed since men many men are to be looked upon as savages as wild beasts of the desert and a single and independent woman they hunt after as their proper prey  to have done with sir hargrave for the present and i wish i may be able to say for ever early in the morning a billet was brought from him to mr reeves excusing himself from paying him a visit that morning as he had intended by reason of the sudden and desperate illness of a relation whose seat was near reading with whom he had large concerns and who was desirous to see him before he died as it was impossible that he could return under three days which he said would appear as three years to him and he was obliged to set out that moment he could not dispense with himself for putting in his claim as he called it to miss byrons favor and confirming his declaration of yesterday in very high strains he professed himself her admirer and begged mr and mrs reevess interest with her one felicity he said he hoped for from his absence which was that as miss byron and mr and mrs reeves would have time to consider of his offers he presumed to hope he should not be subjected to a repulse  and now my lucy you have before you as good an account as i can give you of my two new lovers how i shall manage with them i know not but i begin to think that those young women are happiest whose friends take all the trouble of this sort upon them only consulting their daughters inclinations as preliminaries are adjusting  my friends indeed pay an high compliment to my discretion when they so generously allow me to judge for myself and we young women are fond of being our own mistresses but i must say that to me this compliment has been and is a painful one for two reasons that i cannot but consider their goodness as a task upon me which requires my utmost circumspection as well as gratitude and that they have shown more generosity in dispensing with their authority than i have done whenever i have acted so as to appear though but to appear to accept of the dispensation let me add besides that now when i find myself likely to be addressed to by mere strangers by men who grew not into my knowledge insensibly as our neighbors greville fenwick and orme did i cannot but think it has the appearance of confidence to stand out to receive as a creature uncontrollable the first motions to an address of this awful nature awful indeed might it be called were ones heart to incline toward a particular person  allow me then for the future my revered grandmamma and you my beloved and equally honored uncle and aunt selby allow me to refer myself to you if any person offers to whom i may happen to have no strong objections as to mr fowler and the baronet i must now do as well as i can with them it is much easier for a young woman to say no than yes but for the time to come i will not have the assurance to act for myself i know your partiality for your harriet too well to doubt the merit of your recommendation  as mr and mrs reeves require me to show them what i write they are fond of indulging me in the employment you will therefore be the less surprised that i write so much in so little a time miss byron is in her closet miss byron is writing is an excuse sufficient they seem to think to everybody because they allow it to be one to them but besides i know they believe they oblige you all by the opportunity they so kindly give me of showing my duty and love where so justly due  i am however surprised at casting my eye back  two sheets and such a quantity before unconscionable say and let me echolike repeat unconscionable  harriet byron sunday night letters from northamptonshire by farmer jenkins i kiss the seals what agreeable things now has my lucy to say to her harriet disagreeable ones she cannot write if all my beloved friends are well    letter xv miss byron in continuation monday february   and so my uncle selby you tell me is making observations in writing on my letters and waits for nothing more to begin with me than my conclusion of the conversations that offered at lady bettys  and is it expected that i should go on furnishing weapons against myself  it is  well with all my heart as long as i can contribute to his amusement as long as i know that he rather sometimes delights to say what may be said than what he really thinks as long as i have my good aunt selby for my advocate as long as my grandmamma is pleased and diverted with what i write as well as with his pleasantries on her girl and as long as you my lucy stand up for your harriet i will proceed and when my measure is full and runs over in his opinion then let him ascribe vanity and what he pleases to me i am but a woman and he knows that i must love him the better for his stripes only let him take care that when he lays at my door faults of which i think i can acquit myself he increases not in me the vanity he is so ready to attribute to me  well but will you not my harriet methinks you ask write with less openness with more reserve in apprehension of the rod which you know hangs over your head  indeed i will not it is my glory that i have not a thought in my heart which i would conceal from any one whom it imported to know it and who would be gratified by the revealing of it and yet i am a little chagrind at the wager which you tell me my uncle has actually laid with my grandmamma that i shall not return from london with a sound heart  and does he teaze you my lucy on this subject with reminding you of your young partiality for captain duncan in order to make good his assertion of the susceptibility of us all  why so let him and why should you deny that you were susceptible of a natural passion you must not be prudish lucy if you are not all his raillery will lose its force what better assurance can i give to my uncle and to all my friends that if i were caught i would own it than by advising you not to be ashamed to confess a sensibility which is no disgrace when duty and prudence are our guides and the object worthy  your man indeed was not worthy as it proved but he was a very specious creature and you knew not his bad character when you suffered liking to grow into love but when the lovefever was at the height did you make anybody uneasy with your passion did you run to woods and groves to record it on the barks of trees  no  you sighed in silence indeed but it was but for a little while i got your secret from you not however till it betrayed itself in your pined countenance and then the mans discovered unworthiness and your own discretion enabled you to conquer a passion to which you had given way supposing it unconquerable because you thought it would cost you pains to contend with it  as to myself you know i have hitherto been on my guard i have been careful ever to shut the door of my heart against the blind deity the moment i could imagine him setting his incroaching foot on the threshhold which i think liking may be called had he once gained entrance perhaps i might have come off but simply  but i hope i am in the less danger of falling in love with any man as i can be civil and courteous to all when a stream is sluiced off into several channels there is the less fear that it will overflow its banks i really think i never shall be in love with anybody till duty directs inclination  excuse me lucy i do nowandthen you know get into a boasting humor but then my punishment as in most other cases follows my fault my uncle pulls me down and shows me that i am not half so good as the rest of my friends think me  you tell me that mr greville will be in london in a very few days i cannot help it he pretends business you say and since that calls him up intends to give himself a months pleasure in town and to take his share of the public entertainments well so let him but i hope that i am not to be either his business or entertainment after a civil neighbourly visit or so i hope i shall not be tormented with him  what happened once betwixt mr fenwick and him gave me pain enough exposed me enough surely a young woman though without her own fault made the occasion of a rencounter between two men of fortune must be talked of too much for her own liking or she must be a strange creature what numbers of people has the unhappy rashness of those two men brought to stare at me and with what difficulty did my uncle and mr deane bring them into so odd a compromise as they at last came into to torment me by joint consent notwithstanding all i could say to them which was the only probable way shocking creatures to prevent murder  and may i not be apprehensive of what may happen should sir hargrave persist in his present way of thinking  mr greville is a rash creature and sir john allestree says sir hargrave wants no resolution  i suppose mr fenwick will come up if the other does but pray my lucy let them know  yet should you tell them that i am greatly averse to seeing them and that i will not see them if i can help it that will be giving them consequence in their own opinion and as the one pleads business it will be in the interpretation of so bold a man as mr greville making myself a part of it and denying his visit before it is offered they must in short do as they will if they are resoved to haunt me at the public places to which i am to go i am not so fond of show and glitter but i can forbear going often to them  but to have done with these men  what an odd thing is it in my uncle to take hold of what i said in one of my letters that i had a good mind to give you a sketch of what i might suppose the company at lady bettys would say of your harriet were each to write her character to their confidents or correspondents as she has done theirs to you  i am apprehensive that his command on this occasion is owing to his hope to find room from what i write to charge me the heavier but be this as it may i will endeavor to obey him and the more readily as the task will be an exercise to my fancy  which of you my dear friends was it that once called me a fanciful girl  to begin  lady betty who owns she thinks favorably of me i will suppose would write to her lucy in such terms as these but shall i suppose every one to be so happy as to have her lucy  miss byron of whom you have heard mr reeves talk so much discredits not in the main the character he has given her we must allow a little you know for the fondness of relationship  the girl has had a good education and owes all her advantages to it but it is a country and bookish one and that will not do every thing for one of our sex if any thing poor thing she never was in town before  but she seems docile and for a country girl is tolerably geneteel i think therefore i shall receive no discredit by introducing her into the beau monde miss clements perhaps agreeable to the goodness of her kind heart would have written thus  miss byron is an agreeable girl she has invited me to visit her and i hope i shall like her better and better she has one may see kept worthy persons company and i dare say will preserve the improvement she has gained by it she is lively and obliging she is young not more than twenty yet looks rather younger by reason of a country bloom which however misbecomes her not and gives a modesty to her first appearance that possesses one in her favor she is a great observer yet i think not censorious what a castaway would miss byron be if knowing so well as she seems to know what the duty of others is she should forget her own  miss cantillon would perhaps thus write  there was miss harriet byron of northamptonshire a young woman in whose favor report has been very lavish i cannot say that i think her so very extraordinary yet she is well enough for a country girl but though i do not impute to her a very pert look yet if she had not been set up for something beyond what she is by all her friends who it seems are excessively fond of her she might have had a more humble opinion of herself than she seems to have when she is set a talking she may indeed make a figure in a country assembly but in the london world she must be not a little awkward having never been here before  i take her to have a great deal of art but to do her justice she has no bad complexion that you know is a striking advantage nor are her features taking them either in whole or part much amiss but to me she has a babyish look especially when she smiles yet i suppose she has been told that her smiles become her for she is always smiling  so like a simpleton i was going to say  upon the whole i see nothing so engaging in her as to have made her the idol she is with everybody  and what little beauty she has it cannot last for my part were i a man the clear brunette  you will think i am praising myself miss barnevelt would perhaps thus write to her lucy  to her lucy  upon my word i will not let her have a lucy  she shall have a brother man to write to not a woman and he shall have a fierce name we will suppose that she also had been describing the rest of the company  well but my dear bombardino i am now to give you a description of miss byron it is the softest gentlest smiling rogue of a girl  i protest i could five or six times have kissed her for what she said and for the manner she spoke in  for she has been used to prate a favored child in her own family one may easily see that yet so prettily loath to speak till spoken to  such a blushing little rogue  it is a dear girl and i wished twenty times as i sat by her that i had been a man for her sake upon my honor bombardino i believe if i had i should have caught her up popt her under one of my arms and run away with her something like this my lucy did miss barnevelt once say  having now dismissed the women i come to mr singleton mr walden and sir hargrave  mr walden himself a pasquin would thus perhaps have written to his marforio  the first lady whom as the greatest stranger i shall take upon me to describe is miss harriet byron of northamptonshire in her person she is not disagreeable and most people think her pretty but what is prettiness why nevertheless in a woman prettiness is  pretty what other word can i so fitly use of a person who though a little sightly cannot be called a beauty i will allow that we men are not wrong in admiring modest women for the graces of their persons but let them be modest let them return the compliment and revere us for our capaciousness of mind and so they will if they are brought up to know their own weakness and that they are but domestic animals of a superior order even ignorance let me tell you my marforio is pretty in a woman humility is one of their principal graces women hardly ever set themselves to acquire the knowledge that is proper to men but they neglect for it what more indispensably belongs to women to have them come to their husbands to their brothers and even to their lovers when they have a mind to know anything out of their way and beg to be instructed and informed inspireth them with the becoming humility which i have touched upon and gives us importance with them  indeed my marforio there are very few topics that arise in conversation among men upon which women ought to open their lips silence becomes them let them therefore hear wonder and improve in silence they are naturally contentious and lovers of contradiction something like this mr walden once threw out and you know who my lucy has said as much and shall we qualify them to be disputants against ourselves  these reflections marforio are not foreign to my subject this girl this harriet byron is applauded for a young woman of reading and observation vation but there was another lady present miss clements who if there be any merit to a woman in it appears to me to excel her in the compass of her reading and that upon the strength of her own diligence and abilities for this miss harriet has had some pains taken with her by her late grandfather a man of erudition who had his education among us this old gentleman i am told took it into his head having no grandson to give this girl a bookish turn but he wisely stopped at her mother tongue only giving her a smattering in french and italian  as i saw that the eyes of every one were upon her i was willing to hear what she had to say for herself poor girl she will suffer i doubt for her speciousness yet i cannot say all things considered that she was very malapert that quality is yet to come she is young  i therefore trifled a little with her and went farther than i generally choose to go with the reading species of women in order to divert an inundation of nonsense and foppery breaking in from one of the company sir hargrave pollexfen of whom more anon you know marforio that a man when he is provoked to fight with an overgrown boy has everybody against him so has a scholar who engages on learned topics with a woman the sex must be flattered at the expense of truth many things are thought to be pretty from the mouth of a woman which would be egregiously weak and silly proceeding from that of a man his very eminence in learning on such a contention would tend only to exalt her and depreciate himself as the girl was everybodys favorite and as the baronet seemed to eye her with particular regard i spared her a man would not you know spoil a girls fortune  but how shall i be able to tell you what i imagine sir hargrave would have written can i do it if i place him in the light of a lover and not either underdo his character as such or incur the censure of vanity and conceit  well but are you sure harriet methinks my uncle asks that the baronet is really and truly so egregiously smitten with you as he pretended he was  why ay that is the thing sir  you girls are so apt to take in earnest the compliments made you by men  and so we are but our credulity my dear sir is a greater proof of our innocence than mens professions are of their sincerity so let losers speak and winners laugh  but let him be in jest if he will in jest or in earnest sir hargrave must be extravagant i ween in lovespeeches and that i may not be thought wholly to decline this part of my task i will suppose him professing with hudibras after he has praised me beyond measure for graces of his own creation  the sun shall now no more dispense his own but harriets influence wherever she treads her feet shall set the primrose and the violet all spices perfumes and sweet powders shall borrow from her breath their odours worlds shall depend upon her eye and when she frowns upon them die and what if i make him address me by way of apostrophe shall i say writing to his friend in the following strain  my faith my friend is adamantine as chains of destiny i will maintain true as apollo ever spoke or oracle from heart of oak then shine upon me but benignly with that one and that other pigsnye the sun and day shall sooner part than love or you shake off my heart well but what my harriet would honest mr singleton have written methinks you ask had he written about you  why thus perhaps my lucy and to his grandmother for she is living  we had rare fun at dinner and after dinner my grandmother there was one miss barnevelt a fine tall portly young lady there was miss clements not handsome but very learned and who as was easy to perceive could hold a good argument on occasion there was miss cantillon as pretty a young lady as one should wish to behold in a summers day and there was one miss byron a northamptonshire lady whom i never saw before in my born days there was mr walden a famous scholar i thought him very entertaining for he talked of learning and suchlike things which i know not so much of as i wish i did because my want of knowing a little latin and greek has made my understanding look less than other mens o my grandmother what a wise man would the being able to talk latin and greek have made me  and yet i thought that nowandthen mr walden made too great a fuss about his but there was a rich and noble baronet richer than me as they say a great deal sir hargrove pollexfun if i spell his name right a charming man and charmingly dressed and so many fine things he said and was so merry and so facetious that he did nothing but laugh as a man may say and i was as merry as him to the full why not  o my grandmother what with the talk of the young country lady that same miss byron for they put her upon talking a great deal what with the famous scholar who however being a learned man could not be so merry as us what with sir hargrave i could live and die with sir hargrave you never knew my grandmother such a bright man as sir hargrave and what with one thing and what with another we boxed it about and had rare fun as i told you  so that when i got home and went to bed i did nothing but dream of being in the same company and three or four times waked myself with laughing  there lucy  will this do for mr singleton it is not much out of character i assure you  monday afternoon this knight this sir rowland meredith  he is below it seems his nephew in his hand sir rowland my sally tells me in his gold button and buttonhole coat and fullbuckled wig mr fowler as spruce as a bridegroom what shall i do with sir rowland  what my lucy can there be in the addresses of these men that even those who are indifferent to us can put ones spirits in an hurry but my dear it is painful to be obliged to deny the earnest suits of those who declare a love for us  expect another letter next post and so you will if i did not bid you for have i missed one yet  adieu my lucy h b  letter xvi miss byron to miss selby monday night tuesday morn feb   and   sir rowland and his nephew tea being not quite ready sat down with my cousins and the knight leaving mr fowler little to say expatiated so handsomely on his nephews good qualities and great passion for me and on what he himself proposed to do for him in addition to his own fortune that my cousins knowing i liked not the gentlemen in our own neighborhood and thought very indifferently of sirhargrave were more than half inclined to promote the addresses of mr fowler and gave them both room to think so  this favorable disposition set the two gentlemen up they were impatient for tea that they might see me  by the time i had sealed up my letters word was brought me that tea was ready and i went down  the knight it seems as soon as they heard me coming jogged mr fowler  nephew said he pointing to the door see what you can say to the primrose of your heart  this is now the primroseseason with us in caermarthen mr reeves  mr fowler by a stretch of complaisance came to meet and introduce me to the company though at home the knight nodded his head after him smiling as if he had said let my nephew alone to gallant the lady to her seat  i was a little surprised at mr fowlers approaching me the moment i appeared and with his taking my hand and conducting me to my seat with an air not knowing how much he had been raised by the conversation that had passed before  he bowed i courtesied and looked a little sillier than ordinary i believe  your servant young lady said the knight lovelier and lovelier by mercy how these blushes become that sweet face  but forgive me madam it is not my intent to dash you  writing miss byron all day said mrs reeves we have greatly missed you  my cousin seemed to say this on purpose to give me time to recover myself  i have blotted several sheets of paper said i and had just concluded  i hope madam said the knight leaning forward his whole body and peering in my face under his bent brows that we have not been the cause of hastening you down  i stared but as he seemed not to mean anything i would not help him to a meaning by my own overquickness  mr fowler had done an extraordinary thing and sat down hemmed and said nothing looking however as if he was at a loss to know whether he or his uncle was expected to speak  the cold weather was then the subject and the two gentlemen rubbed their hands and drew nearer the fire as if they were the colder for talking of it many hems passed between them now the uncle looking on the nephew now the nephew on the uncle at last they fell into talk of their newbuilt house at caermarthen and the furnishing of it  they mentioned afterward their very genteel neighborhood and gave the characters of half a dozen people of whom none present but themselves ever heard but all tending to show how much they were valued by the best gentry in caermarthenshire  the knight then related a conversation that had once passed between himself and the late lord mansell in which that nobleman had complimented him on an estate of a clear  000 l a year besides a good deal of ready cash and with supposing that he would set up his nephew when at age for it was some years ago as a representative for the county and he repeated the prudent answer he gave his lordship disavowing such a design as no better than a gaming propensity as he called it which had ruined many a fair estate  this sort of talk in which his nephew could bear a part and indeed they had it all between them held the teatime and then having given themselves the consequence they had seemed to intend the knight drawing his chair nearer me and winking to his nephew who withdrew began to set forth the young gentlemans good qualities to declare the passion he had for me and to beg my encouragement of so worthy so proper and so wellfavoured a young man who was to be his sole heir and for whom he would do such things on my account as during his life he would not do for any other woman breathing  there was no answering a discourse so serious with the air of levity which it was hardly possible to avoid assuming on the first visit of the knight  i was vexed that i found myself almost as bashful as silly and as silent as if i had thoughts of encourageing mr fowlers addresses my cousins seemed pleased with my bashfulness the knight i once thought by the tone of his voice and his hum would have struck up a welsh tune and danced for joy  shall i call in my kinsman madam to confirm all i have said and to pour out the whole soul at your feet my boy is bashful but a little favor from that sweet countenance will make a man of him let me let me call in my boy i will go for him myself and was going  let me say one word sir rowland  before mr fowler comes in  before you speak to him  you have explained yourself unexceptionably i am obliged to you and mr fowler for your good opinion but this can never be  how madam can never be  i will allow that you shall take time for half a dozen visits or so that you may be able to judge of my nephews qualities and understanding and be convinced from his own mouth and heart and soul as i may say of his love for you no need of time for him he poor man is fixed immoveably fixed but say you will take a weeks time or so to consider what you can do what you will do  and that is all i at present crave or indeed madam can allow you  i cannot doubt now sir rowland of what my mind will be a week hence as to this matter  how madam  why we are all in the suds then  why mr reeves mrs reeves  whew with an halfwhistle  why madam we shall at this rate be all untwisted  but after a pause by mercy i will not be thus answered  why madam would you have the conscience to break my poor boys heart  come be as gracious as you look to be  give me your hand  he snatched my hand in respect to his years i withdrew it not and give my boy your heart  sweet soul such sensible such goodnatured mantlings  why you cannot be cruel if you would  dear lady say you will take a little time to consider of this matter dont repeat those cruel words it can never be  what have you to object to my boy  mr fowler both by character and appearance sir rowland is a worthy man he is a modest man and modesty   well and so he is  mercy i was afraid that his modesty would be an objection   it cannot sir rowland with a modest woman i love i revere a modest man but indeed i cannot give hope where i mean not to encourage any  your objection madam to my nephew  you must have seen something in him you dislike  i do not easily dislike sir but then i do not easily like and i never will marry any man to whom i cannot be more than indifferent  why madam he adores you  he   that sir is an objection unless i could return his love my gratitude would be endangered  excellent notions  with these notions madam you could not be ungrateful  that sir is a risque i will never run how many bad wives are there who would have been good ones had they not married either to their dislike or with indifference good beginnings sir rowland are necessary to good progresses and to happy conclusions  why so they are but beginnings that are not bad with good people will make no bad progresses no bad conclusions  no bad is not good sir rowland and in such a world as this shall people lay themselves open to the danger of acting contrary to their duty shall they suffer themselves to be bribed either by conveniences or superfluities to give their hands and leave their hearts doubtful or indifferent it would not be honest to do so  you told me madam the first time i had the honor to see you that you were absolutely and bonafide disengaged  i told you truth sir  then madam we will not take your denial we will persevere we will not be discouraged what a duce have i not heard it said that faint heart never won fair lady  i never would give an absolute denial sir were i to have the least doubt of my mind if i could balance i would consult my friends and refer to them and their opinion should have due weight with me but for your nephews sake sir rowland while his esteem for me is young and conquerable urge not this matter farther i would not give pain to a worthy heart  as i hope for mercy madam so well do i like your notions that if you will be my niece and let me but converse with you once a day i will be contented with an hundred pounds a year and settle upon you all i have in the world  his eyes glistened his face glowed an honest earnestness appeared in his countenance  generous man good sir rowland said i i was affected i was forced to withdraw  i soon returned and found sir rowland his handkerchief in his hand applying very earnestly to my cousins and they were so much affected too that on his resuming the subject to me they could not help putting in a word or two on his sde of the question  sir rowland then proposed to call in his nephew that he might speak for himself my boy may be overawed by love madam true love is always fearful yet he is no milksop i do assure you to men he has courage how he will behave to you madam i know not for really notwithstanding that sweetness of aspect which i should have thought would have led one to say what one would to you in modesty i mean i have a kind of i cannottellwhat for you myself reverence it is not neither i think  i only reverence my maker  and yet i believe it is why madam your face is one of god almightys wonders in a little compass  pardon me  you may blush  but be gracious now  dont show us that with a face so encouragingly tender you have an hard heart  o sir rowland you are an excellent advocate but pray tell mr fowler   i will call him in  and was rising  no dont but tell mr fowler that i regard him on a double account for his own worths sake and for his uncles but subject me not i once more entreat you to the pain of repulsing a worthy man i repeat that i am under obligation to him for the value he has for me i shall be under more if he will accept of my thanks as all i have to return  my dear miss byron said mr reeves oblige sir rowland so far as to take a little time to consider   god bless you on earth and in heaven mr reeves for this you are a good man  why ay take a little time to consider  god bless you madam take a little time say you will consider you know not what a man of understanding my nephew is why madam modest as he is and awed by his love for you he cannot show half the good sense he is master of  modest men must have merit sir but how can you mr reeves make a difficult task more difficult and yet all is from the goodness of your heart you see sir rowland thinks me cruel i have no cruelty in my nature i love to oblige i wish to match you in generosity sir rowland  ask me for anything but myself and i will endeavor to oblige you  admirable by mercy why everything you say instead of making me desist induces me to persevere there is no yielding up such a prize if one can obtain it tell me mr reeves where there is such another woman to be had and we may give up miss byron but i hope she will consider of it  pray madam  but i will call in my nephew and out he went in haste as if he were afraid of being again forbidden  mean time my cousins put it to me  but before i could answer them the knight followed by his nephew returned  mr fowler entered bowing in the most respectful manner he looked much more dejected than when he approached me at my first coming down his uncle had given him an hint of what had passed between us  mr fowler and i had but just sat down when the knight said to mr revees but took him not by the button as in his first visit one word with you sir  mr reeves one word with you if you please  they withdrew together and presently after mrs reeves went out at the other door and i was left alone with mr fowler  we both sat silent for about three or four minutes i thought i ought not to begin mr fowler knew not how he drew his chair nearer to me then sat a little farther off then drew it nearer again stroked his ruffles and hemmed two or three times and at last you cannot madam but observe my confusion my concern my my my confusion  it is all owing to my reverence my respect my reverence for you  hem  he gave two gentle hems and was silent  i could not enjoy the modest mans aukwardness  every feature of his face working his hands and his knees trembling and his tongue faltering how barbarous had i been if i could  o lucy what a disqualifier is love if such agitations as these are natural effects of that passion  sir rowland has been acquainting me sir said i with the good opinion you have of me i am very much obliged to you for it i have been telling sir rowland   ah madam say not what you have been telling sir rowland he has hinted it to me i must indeed confess my unworthiness yet i cannot forbear aspireing to your favor who that knows what will make him the happiest of men however unworthy he may be can forbear seeking his happiness i can only say i am the most miserable of men if   good mr fowler interrupted i indulge not an hope that cannot be answered i will not pretend to say that i should not merit your esteem if i could return it because to whomsoever i should give my hand i would make it a point of duty to deserve his affection but for that very reason and that i may have not temptation to do otherwise i must be convinced in my own mind that there is not a man in the world whom i could value more than him i chose  he sighed i was assured madam said he that your heart was absolutely disengaged on that assurance i founded my presumptuous hope  and so it is mr fowler i have never yet seen a man whom i could wish to marry  then madam may i not hope that time that my assiduities that my profound reverence my unbounded love   o mr fowler think me not either insensible or ungrateful but time i am sure can make no alteration in this case i can only esteem you and that from a motive which i think has selfishness in it because you have shown a regard for me  no selfishness in this motive madam it is amiable gratitude and if all the services of my life if all the adoration   i have a very indifferent notion of sudden impressions mr fowler but i will not question the sincerity of a man i think so worthy sir rowland has been very urgent with me he has wished me to take time to consider i have told him i would if i could doubt but that i cannot for your own sake therefore let me entreat you to place your affections elsewhere and may you place them happily  you have madam i am afraid seen men whom you could prefer to me   our acquaintance mr fowler is very short it would be no wonder if i had yet i told you truly that i never yet saw a man whom i could wish to marry  he looked down and sighed  but mr fowler to be still more frank and explicit with you as i think you a very worthy man i will own that were any of the gentlemen i have hitherto known to be my lot it must be i think in compassion in gratitude i had almost said one who nevertheless it cannot be who has professed a love for me ever since i was a child a man of honor of virtue of modesty such a man as i believe mr fowler is his fortune indeed is not so considerable as sir rowland says yours will be but sir as there is no other reason on the comparison why i should prefer mr fowler to him i should think the worse of myself as long as i lived if i gave a preference over such a tried affection to fortune only and now sir i expect that you will make a generous use of my frankness lest the gentleman if you should know him may hear of it and this i request for his sake as i think i can never be his as for yours i have been thus explicit  i can only say that i am the most miserable of men  but will you madam give me leave to visit mr reeves nowandthen  not on my account mr fowler understand it so and if you see me let it be with indifference and without expectation from me and i shall always behave myself to you as to a man who has obliged me by his good opinion  he bowed sat in silence pulled out his handkerchief  i pitied him  but let me ask all you my friends who love mr orme was i wrong i think i never could love mr fowler as a wife ought to love her husband  may he meet with a worthy woman who can and surely so good so modest a man and of such an ample fortune easily may while it may be my lot if ever i marry to be the wife of a man with whom i may not be so happy as either mr orme or mr fowler would probably make me could i prevail upon myself to be the wife of either o my uncle often do i reflect on your mercers shop  mr fowler arose and walked disconsolately about the room and often profoundly and i believe not grevillelike sincerely sighed his motion soon brought in the knight and mr reeves at one door and mrs reeves at the other  well what news what news  good i hope said the knight with spread hands  ah my poor boy thus alamort surely madam   there he stopped and looked wistfully at me then at my cousins  mr reeves mrs reeves speak a good word for my boy the heart that belongs to that countenance cannot be adamant surely  dear young lady let your power be equalled by your mercy  mr fowler sir rowland has too much generosity to upbraid me i dare say nor will you think me either perverse or ungenerous when he tells you what has passed between us  have you given him hope then god grant it though but distant hope have you said you will consider  dear blessed lady   o sir interrupted i how good you are to your nephew how worthily is your love placed on him what a proof is it of his merit and of the goodness of your heart  i shall always have an esteem for you both  your excuse sir rowland yours mr fowler be so good as to allow me to withdraw  i retired to my own apartment and throwing myself into a chair reflected on what had passed and after a while recollected myself to begin to write it down for you  as soon as i had withdrawn mr fowler with a sorrowful heart as my cousins told me related all that i had said to him  mr reeves was so good as to praise me for what he called my generosity to mr orme as well as for my frankness and civility to mr fowler  that was the duce of it sir rowland said that were they to have no remedy they could not find any fault in me to comfort themselves with  they put it over and over to my cousin whether time and assiduity might not prevail with me to change my mind and whether an application to my friends in the country might not on settingevery thing fairly before them be of service but mr reeves told them that now i had opened so freely my mind and had spoken so unexpectedly yet so gratefully in favor of mr orme he feared there could be no hopes  however both gentlemen at taking leave recommended themselves to mr and mrs reeves for their interests and the knight vowed that i should not come off so easily  so much and adieu my lucy for the addresses of worthy mr fowler pray however for your harriet that she may not draw a worse lot  tuesday morning at a private concert last night with my cousins and miss clements and again to be at the play this night i shall be a racketer i doubt  mr fowler called here this morning mrs reeves and i were out on a visit but mr reeves was at home and they had a good deal of discourse about me the worthy man spoke so despairingly of his success with me that i hope for his own sake i shall hear no more of his addresses and with the more reason as sir rowland will in a few days set out for caermarthen  sir rowland called afterward but mr reeves was abroad and mrs reeves and i were gone to ludgate hill to buy a gown which is to be made up in all haste that i may the more fashionably attend lady betty williams to some of the public entertainments i have been very extravagant but it is partly my cousins fault i send you enclosed a pattern of my silk i thought we were high in the fashion in northamptonshire but all my clothes are altering that i may not look frightful as the phrase is  but shall i as easily get rid of the baronet think you as i hope i have of mr fowler he is come to town and by his own invention in a card to mr reeves is to be here tomorrow afternoon what signifies my getting out of the way he will see me at another time and i shall increase my own difficulties and his consequence if he thinks i am afraid of him  letter xvii miss byron in continuation wednesday night sir hargrave came before six oclock he was richly dressed he asked for mr reeves i was in my closet writing he was not likely to be the better received for the character sir john allestree gave of him  he excused himself for coming so early on the score of his impatience and that he might have a little discourse with them if i should be engaged before teatime  was i within  i was  thank heaven  i was very good  so he seemed to imagine that i was at home in compliment to him  shall i give you from my cousins an account of the conversation before i went down you know mrs reeves is a nice observer  he had had he told my cousins a most uneasy time of it ever since he saw me the devil fetch him if he had had one hours rest he never saw a woman before whom he could love as he loved me by his soul he had no view but what was strictly honorable  he sometimes sat down sometimes walked about the room strutting and nowandthen adjusting something in his dress that nobody else saw wanted it he gloried in the happy prospects before him not but he knew i had a little army of admirers but as none of them had met with encouragement from me he hoped there was room for him to flatter himself that he might be the happy man  i told you mr reeves said he that i will give you carte blanch as to settlements what i do for so prudent a woman will be doing for myself i am not used mr reeves to boast of my fortune then it seems he went up to the glass as if his person could not fail of being an additional recommendation but i will lay before you or before any of miss byrons friends mr deane if she pleases  my rentrolls there never was a betterconditioned estate she shall live in town or in the country as she thinks fit and in the latter at which of my seats she pleases i know i shall have no will but hers i doubt not your friendship mr reeves i hope for yours madam i shall have great pleasure in the alliance i have in view with every individual of your family  as if he would satisfy them of his friendship in the near relation as the only matter that could bear a doubt  then he ran on upon the part i bore in the conversation at lady betty williamss  by his soul only the wisest the wittiest the most gracefully modest of women  that was all  then ha ha ha hah poor walden what a silly fellow he had caught a tartar  ha ha ha hah  shaking his head and his gay sides devil take him if ever he saw a prig so fairly taken in  but i was a sly little rogue  he saw that  by all that is good i must myself sing small in her company  i will never meet at hardedge with her  if i did  and yet i have been thought to carry a good one i should be confoundedly gapped i can see that alluding to two knives i suppose gapping each other and winking with one eye and as mrs reeves described him looking as wise as if he would make a compliment to his penetration at the expense of his understanding but continued he as a woman is more an husbands than a man is a wifes have all the men this prerogativenotion lucy you know it is a better mans i shall have a pride worth boasting of if i can call such a jewel mine poor walden  rot the fellow  i warrant he would not have so knowing a wife for the world  ha ha ha hah he is right it is certainly right for such narrow pedants to be afraid of learned women  methinks i see the fellow conjurerlike circumscribed in a narrow circle putting into greek what was better expressed in english and forbidding every ones approach within the distance of his wand  hah hah hah  let me die if ever i saw a tragicomical fellow better handled  then the faces he made  saw you ever mr reeves saw you ever in your life such a parcel of disastrous faces made by one man  thus did sir hargrave laughingly run on nor left he hardly anything for my cousins to say or to do but to laugh with him and to smile at him  on a message that tea was near ready i went down on my entering the room he addressed me with an air of kindness and freedom charming miss byron said he i hope you are all benignity and compassion you know not what i have suffered since i had the honor to see you last bowing very low then rearing himself up holding back his head and seemed the taller for having bowed  handsome fop thought i to myself i took my seat and endeavored to look easy and free as usual finding something to say to my cousins and to him he begged that tea might be postponed for half an hour and that before the servants were admitted i would hear him relate the substance of the conversation that had passed between him and mr and mrs reeves  had not sir hargrave intended me an honor and had he not a very high opinion of the efficacy of eight thousand pounds a year in an address of this kind i dare say he would have supposed a little more prefacing necessary but after he had told me in few words how much he was attracted by my character before he saw me he thought fit directly to refer himself to the declaration he had made at lady betty williamss both to mr reeves and myself and then talked of large settlements boasted of his violent passion and besought my favor with the utmost earnestness  i would have played a little female trifling upon him and affected to take his professions only for polite raillery which men call making love to young women who perhaps are frequently but too willing to take in earnest what the wretches mean but in jest but the fervor with which he renewed as he called it his declaration admitted not of sooling and yet his volubility might have made questionable the sincerity of his declarations as therefore i could not think of encouraging his addresses i thought it best to answer him with openness and unreserve  to seem to question the sincerity of such professions as you make sir hargrave might appear to you as if i wanted to be assured but be pleased to know that you are directing your discourse to one of the plainesthearted women in england and you may therefore expect from me nothing but the simplest truth i thank you sir for your good opinion of me but i cannot encourage your addresses  you cannot madam encourage my addresses and express yourself so seriously good heaven he stood silent a minute or two looking upon me and upon himself as if he had said foolish girl knows she whom she refuses i have been assured madam recovering a little from his surprise that your affections are not engaged but surely it must be a mistake some happy man   is it interrupted i a necessary consequence that the woman who cannot receive the addresses of sir hargrave pollexsen must be engaged  why madam  as to that  i know not what to say  but a man of my fortune and i hope not absolutely disagreeable either in person or temper of some rank in life  he paused then resuming  what madam if you are as much in earnest as you seem can be your objection be so good as to name it that i may know whether i cannot be so happy as to get over it  we do not we cannot all like the same person women i have heard say are very capricious perhaps i am so but there is a something we cannot always say what that attracts or disgusts us  disgusts madam  disgusts miss byron  i spoke in general sir i dare say nineteen women out of twenty would think themselves favored in the addresses of sir hargrave pollexfen  but you madam are the twentieth that i must love and be so good as to let me know   pray sir ask me not a reason for a peculiarity do you not yourself show a peculiarity in making me the twentieth  your merit madam   it would be vanity in me sir interrupted i to allow a force to that plea you sir may have more merit than perhaps the man i may happen to approve of better but  shall i say pardon me sir you do not  you do not hesitated i  hit my fancy  pardon me sir  if pardon depends upon my breath let me die if i do  not hit your fancy madam and then he looked upon himself all round not hit your fancy madam  i told you sir that you must not expect anything from me but the simplest truth you do me an honor in your good opinion and if my own heart were not in this case a very determined one i would answer you with more politeness but sir on such an occasion as this i think it would not be honorable it would not be just to keep a man in an hours suspense when i am in none myself  and are you then angrily so determined miss byron  i am sir  confound me  and yet i am enough confounded  but i will not take an answer so contrary to my hopes tell me madam by the sincerity which you boast are you not engaged in your affections is there not some one happy man whom you prefer to all men  i am a free person sir hargrave it is no impeachment of sincerity if a free person answers not every question that may be put to her by those to whom she is not accountable  very true madam but as it is no impeachment of your freedom to answer this question either negatively or affirmatively and as you glory in your frankness let me be beseech you to answer it are you madam or are you not disengaged in your affections  excuse me sir hargrave i dont think you are entitled to an answer to this question nor perhaps would you be determined by the answer i should make to it whether negative or affirmative  give me leave to say madam that i have some little knowledge of mr fenwick and mr greville and of their addresses they have both owned that no hopes have you given them yet declare that they will hope have you madam been as explicit to them as you are to me  i have sir  then they are not the men i have to fear  mr orme madam   is a good man sir  ah madam  but why then will you not say that you are engaged  if i own i am perhaps it will not avail me it will much less if i say i am not  avail you dear miss byron i have pride madam if i had not i should not aspire to your favor but give me leave to say and he reddened with anger that my fortune my descent and my ardent affection for you considered it may not disavail you your relations will at least think so if i may have the honor of your consent for applying to them  may your fortune sir hargrave be a blessing to you it will as you do good with it but were it twice as much that alone would have no charms for me my duties would be increased with my power my fortune is an humble one but were it less it would satisfy my ambition while i am single and if i marry i shall not desire to live beyond the estate of the man i choose  upon my soul madam you must be mine every word you speak adds a rivet to my chains  then sir let us say no more upon this subject  he then laid a title to my gratitude from the passion he avowed for me  that is a very poor plea sir said i as you yourself would think i believe were one of our sex whom you could not like to claim a return of love from you upon it  you are too refined surely madam  refined what meant the man by the word in this place  i believe sir we differ very widely in many of our sentiments  we will not differ in one madam when i know yours such is the opinion i have of your prudence that i will adopt them and make them my own  this may be said sir but there is hardly a man in the world that saying it would keep his word nor a woman who ought to expect he should  but you will allow of my visits to your cousins madam  not on my account sir  you will not withdraw if i come you will not refuse seeing me  as you will be no visitor of mine i must be allowed to act accordingly had i the least thought of encouraging your addresses i would deal with you as openly as is consistent with my notions of modesty and decorum  perhaps madam from my gay behavior at lady betty williamss you think me too airy a man you have doubts of my sincerity you question my honor  that sir would be to injure myself  your objections then dear madam give me i beseech you some one material objection  why sir should you urge me thus  when i have no doubt it is unnecessary to look into my own mind for the particular reasons that move me to disapprove of the addresses of a gentleman whose professions of regard for me notwithstanding entitle him to civility and acknowlegement  by my soul madam this is very comical  i do not like thee dr fell the reason why i cannot tell  but i dont like thee dr fell such madam seem to me to be your reasons  you are very pleasant sir but let me say that if you are in earnest in your professions you could not have quoted anything more against you than these humorous lines since a dislike of such a nature as is implied by them must be a dislike arising from something resembling a natural aversion whether just or not is little to the purpose  i was not aware of that replied he but i hope yours to me is not such a one  excuse me cousin said i turning to mrs reeves but i believe i have talked away the teatime  i think not of tea said she  hang tea said mr reeves  the devil fly away with the teakettle said sir hargrave let it not have entrance here till i have said what i have further to say and let me tell you miss byron that though you may not have a dying lover you shall have a resolute one for i will not cease pursuing you till you are mine or till you are the wife of some other man  he spoke this fiercely and even rudely i was disgusted as much at his manner as with his words  i cannot replied i but congratulate myself on one felicity since i have been in your company sir and that is that in this whole conversation and i think it much too long i have not one thing to reproach myself with or be sorry for  your servant madam bowing  but i am of the contrary opinion by heaven madam with anger and an air of insolence i think you have pride madam   pride sir  cruelty   cruelty sir   ingratitude madam  i thought it was staying to be insulted all that sir john allestree had said of him came into my head  hold sir for he seemed to be going on pride cruelty ingratitude are crimes black enough if you think i am guilty of them excuse me that i retire for the benefit of recollection  and making a low courtesy i withdrew in haste he besought me to return and followed me to the stairs foot  he showed his pride and his ill nature too before my cousins when i was gone he bit his lip he walked about the room then sitting down he lamented defended accused and redefended himself and yet besought their interest with me  he was greatly disturbed he owned that with such honorable intetnions with so much power to make me happy and such a will to do so he should be refused and this without my assigning one reason for it  and my cousins to whom he again referred on that head answering him that they believed me disengaged in my affections  d  him he said if he could account then for my behavior to him  he however threatened mr orme who if any he said was the man i favored i had acknowleged that neither greville nor fenwick were my proud repulse had stung him he owned he begged that they would send for me down in their names  they liked not the humor he seemed to be in well enough to comply with his request and he sent up in his own name  but i returned my compliments i was busy in writing and so i was  to you my lucy i hoped sir hargrave and my cousins would excuse me i put them in to soften my refusal  this still more displeased him he besought their pardon but he would haunt me like a ghost in spite of man and devil i should be his he had the presumption to repeat and went away with a flaming face  dont you think my dear that my cousin reeves was a little too mild in his own house as i am under his guardianship but perhaps he was the more patient for that very reason and he is one of the bestnatured men in england and then  000 l a year  yet why should a man of my cousins independent fortune  but grandeur will have its charms  thus did sir hargrave confirm all that sir john allestree had said of his bad qualities and i think i am more afraid of him than ever i was of any man before i remember that mischievous is one of the bad qualities sir john attributed to him and revengeful another should i ever see him again on the same errand i will be more explicit as to my being absolutely disengaged in my affections if i can be so without giving him hope lest he should do private mischief to some one on my account upon my word i would not of all the men i have ever seen be the wife of sir hargrave pollexfen  and so much for this first visit of his i wish his pride may be enough piqued to make it the last  but could you have thought he would have shown himself so soon  yet he had paraded so much before i went down to my cousins and so little expected a direct and determined repulse that a man of his selfconsequence might perhaps be allowed to be the more easily piqued by it  lady betty has sent us notice that on thursday next there will be a ball at the operahouse in the haymarket my cousins are to choose what they will be but she insists that my dress shall be left to her i am not to know what it is to be till the day before or the very day if i like it not she will not put me to any expense about it  you will easily imagine upon such an alternative i shall approve of it be it what it will i have only requested that i may not be so remarkably dressed as to attract the eyes of the company if i am i shall not behave with any tolerable presence of mind  letter xviii miss byron in continuation friday feb  0 one of mr grevilles servants has just been here with his masters compliments so the wretch is come to town i believe i shall soon be able to oblige him he wishes you know to provoke me to say i hate him  surely i draw inconveniences upon myself by being so willing to pay civility for esteem yet it is in my nature to do so and i cannot help it without committing a kind of violence on my temper there is no merit therefore in my behavior on such occasions very pretty selfdeception  i study my own ease and before i consider am ready to call myself patient and goodhumoured and civil and to attribute to myself i know not how many kind and complaisant things when i ought in modesty to distinguish between the virtue and the necessity  i never was uncivil as i call it but to one young gentleman a man of quality you know who i mean and that was because he wanted me to keep secret his addresses to me for family considerations the young woman who engages to keep her lovers secrets in this particular is often brought into a plot against herself and oftener still against those to whom she owes unreserved honor and duty and is not such a conduct also an indirect confession that you know you are engaging in something wrong and unworthy  mr grevilles arrival vexes me i suppose it will not be long before mr fenwick comes too i have a good mind to try to like the modest mr orme the better in spite  sat morn feb    i shall have nothing to trouble you with i think but scenes of courtship sir rowland sir hargrave and mr greville all met just now at our breakfasttime  sir rowland came first a little before breakfast was ready after enquiries of mr reeves whether i held in the same mind or not he desired to have the favor of one quarter of an hours conversation with me alone  methinks i have a value for this honest knight honesty my lucy is good sense politeness amiableness all in one an honest man must appear in every light with such advantages as will make even singularity agreeable i went down directly  he met me and taking my notwithdrawn hand and peering in my face mercy said he the same kind aspect the same sweet and obliging countenance how can this be but you must be gracious you will say you will  you must not urge me sir rowland you will give me pain if you lay me under a necessity to repeal   repeat what dont say a resusal dear madam dont say a resusal will you not save a life why madam my poor boy is absolutely and bona fide brokenhearted i would have had him come with me but no he could not bear to teaze the beloved of his soul why there is an instance of love now not for all his hopes not for his lifes sake could he bear to teaze you none of your sluttering jacka dandys now would have said this and let not such succeed where modest merit fails  mercy you are struck with my plea dont dont god bless you now dont harden your heart on my observation i was resolved to set out in a day or two but i will stay in town were it a month to see my boy made happy and let me tell you i would not wish him to be happy unless he could make you so  come come   i was a little affected i was silent  come come be gracious be merciful dear lady be as good as you look to be one word of comfort for my poor boy i could kneel to you for one word of comfort  nay i will kneel taking hold of my other hand as he still held one and down on his knees dropped the honest knight  i was surprised i knew not what to say what to do i had not the courage to attempt to lift him up yet to see a man of his years and who had given himself a claim to my esteem kneel and with glistening eyes looking up to me for mercy as he called it on his boy how was i affected  but at last rise dear sir rowland rise said i you call out for mercy to me yet have none upon me o how you distress me  i would have withdrawn my hands but he held them fast i stamped in tender passion i am sure it was in tender passion now with one foot now with the other dear sir rowland rise i cannot bear this i beseech you rise and down i dropped involuntarily on one knee what can i say rise dear sir on my knee i beg of you kneel not to me indeed sir you greatly distress me pray let go my hands  tears ran down his cheeks  and do i distress you madam and do you vouchsafe to kneel to me  i will not distress you for the world i will not distress you  he arose and let go my hands i arose too abashed he pulled out his handkerchief and hastening from me to the window wiped his eyes then turning to me what a fool i am what a mere child i make of myself how can i blame my boy o madam have you not one word of comfort to send by me to my boy say but you will see him give him leave to wait on you yet poor soul wiping his eyes again he would not be able to say a word in his own behalf  bid me bring him to you bid us come together  and so i could and so i would sir rowland if no other expectations were to be formed than those of civility but i will go farther to show my regard for you sir let me be happy in your friendship and good opinion let me look upon you as my father let me look upon mr fowler as my brother i am not so happy as to have either father or brother and let mr fowler own me as his sister and every visit you make me you will both in these characters be dearer to me than before  but o my father already will i call you father urge not your daughter to an impossibility  mercy mercy what will become of me what will become of my boy rather  he turned from me with his handkerchief at his eyes again and even sobbed where are all my purposes irresistible lady  but must i give up my hopes must my boy be told  and yet do you call me father and do you plead for my indulgence as if you were my daughter  indeed i do indeed i must i have told mr fowler with so much regard for him as an honest as a worthy man   why that is the weapon that wounds him that cuts him to the heart your gentleness your openness  and are you determined can there be no hope  mr fowler is my brother sir and you are my father  accept me in those characters  accept you mercy accept you  forgive me madam catching my hand and pressing it with his lips you do me honor in the appellation but if your mind should change on consideration and from motives of pity   indeed indeed sir rowland it cannot change  why then i as well as my nephew must acquiesce with your pleasure but madam you dont know what a worthy creature he is i will not however teaze you  but how but how shall i see mr reeves i am ashamed to see him with this baby in my face  and i sir rowland must retire before i can appear excuse me sir withdrawing but i hope you will breakfast with us  i will drink tea with you madam if i can make myself fit to be seen were it but to claim you for my daughter but yet had much rather you would be a farther remove in relation would to god you would let it be neice  i courtisied as a daughter might do parting with her real father and withdrew  and now my lucy will you not be convinced that one of the greatest pains the loss of dear friends excepted that a grateful mind can know is to be too much beloved by a worthy heart and not to be able to return his love  my sheet is ended with a new one i will begin another letter  yet a few words in the margin  i tell you not my dear of the public entertainments to which lady betty is continually contriving to draw me out she intends by it to be very obliging and is so but my present reluctance to go so very often must not be overcome as it possibly would be too easily done were i to give way to the temptation if it be your harriet may turn gadfly and never be easy but when she is forming parties or giving way to them that may make the home that hitherto has been the chief scene of her pleasures undelightful to her bad habits are sooner acquired than shaken off as my grandmamma has often told us  letter xix miss byron in continuation who would have thought that a man of sir rowlands time of life and a woman so young as i could have so much discomposed each other i obeyed the summons to breakfast and entered the room at one door as he came in at the other in vain had i made use of the short retirement to conceal my emotion from my cousins they also saw sir rowlands by his eyes and looked at him at me and at each other  mercy said sir rowland in an accent that seemed between crying and laughing you you you madam are a surprising lady i i i never was so affected in my life and he drew the back of his hand cross first one eye then the other  o sir rowland said i you are a good man how affecting are the visible emotions of a manly heart  my cousins still looked as if surpised but said nothing  o my cousins said i i have found a father in sir rowland and i acknowledge a brother in mr fowler  best of women most excellent of creatures and do you own me he snatched my hand and kissed it what pride do you give me in this open acknowlegement if it must not be niece why then i will endeavor to rejoice in my daughter i think but yet my boy my poor boy  but you are all goodness and with him i say i must not teaze you  what you have been saying to each other alone said mrs reeves i cannot tell but i long to know  why madam i will tell you  if i know how  you must know that i that i came as an ambassadorextraordinary from my sorrowful boy yet not desired not sent i came of my own accord in hopes of getting one word of comfort and to bring matters on before i set out for caermarthen  the servant coming in and a loud rap rap rap on the footmans musical instrument the knocker of the door put a stop to sir rowlands narrative in apprehension of company i breathed on my hand and put it to either eye and sir rowland hemmed twice or thrice and rubbed his the better to conceal their redness though it made them redder than before he got up looked at the glass would have sung toll doll  hem said he as if the muscles of his face were in the power of his voice mercy all the infant still in my eye  toll doll  hem  i would sing it away if i could  sir hargrave entered bowing scraping to me and with an air not ungraceful  servant sir said the knight to sir hargraves silent salute to him bowing and looking at the baronets genteel morning dress and then at his own  who the duce is he whispering to mr reeves who then presented each to the other by name  the baronet approached me i have madam a thousand pardons to ask   not one sir  indeed i have  and most heartily do i beg   you are forgiven sir   but i will not be so easily forgiven  mercy whispered the knight to mr reeves i dont liken ah my poor boy no wonder at this rate   you have not much to fear sir rowland rewhisperd my cousin on this gentlemans account  thank you thank you  and yet it is a fine figure of a man whispered again sir rowland nay if she can withstand him  but a word to the wise mr reeves  hem  i am a little easier than i was  he turned from my cousin with such an air as if from contrasted pleasure and pain he would again have sung toll doll  the servant came in with the breakfast and we had no sooner sat down as before than we were alarmed by another modern rapping mr reeves was called out and returned introducing mr greville  who the duce is he whispered to me sir rowland as he sat next me before mr reeves could name him  mr greville profoundly bowed to me i asked after the health of all our friends in northamptonshire  have you seen fenwick madam  no sir  a dog i thought he had played me a trick i missed him for three days  but in a low voice if you have not seen him i have stolen a march upon him  well i had rather ask his pardon than he should ask mine i rejoice to see you well madam raising his voice  but what  looking at my eyes  colds are very rife in london sir   i am glad it is no worse for your grandmamma and all friends in the country are well  i have found a papa mr greville referring to sir rowland since i came to town this good gentleman gives me leave to call him father  no son  i hope sir rowland you have no son said mr greville the relation comes not about that way i hope and laughed as he used to do at his own smartness  the very question i was going to put by my soul said the baronet  no  said the knight but i have a nephew gentlemen  a very pretty young fellow and i have this to say before ye all i am downright dunstable i had much rather call this lady niece than daughter and then the knight forced a laugh and looked round upon us all  o sir rowland replied i i have uncles more than one  i am a niece but i have not had for many years till now the happiness of a father  and do you own me madam before all this gay company  the first time i beheld you i remember i called you a perfect paragon why madam you are the most excellent of women  we are so much convinced of this sir rowland said the baronet that i dont know but miss byrons choosing you for a father instead of an uncle may have saved two or three throats and then he laughed his laugh was the more seasonable as it softened the shockingness of his expression  mr greville and the baronet had been in company twice before in northamptonshire at the races but nowandthen looked upon each other with envious eyes and once or twice were at crosspurposes but my particular notice of the knight made all pass lightly over  sir rowland went first away he claimed one word with his daughter in the character of a father  i withdrew with him to the farther end of the room  not one word of comfort not one word madam  to my boy whispered he  my compliments speaking low to my brother sir i wish him as well and as happy as i think he deserves to be  well but  well but   only remember sir rowland that you act in character i followed you hither on the strength of your authority as a father i beg sir that you will preserve to me that character  why god in heaven bless my daughter if only daughter you can be too well do i understand you i will see how my poor nephew will take it if it can be no otherwise i will prevail upon him i think to go down with me to caermarthen for a few months  but as to those two fine gentlemen madam  it would grieve me it is a folly to deny it to say i have seen the man that is to supplant my nephew  i will act in character sir rowland as your daughter you have a right to know my sentiments on this subject  you have not yet seen the man you seem to be afraid of  you are all goodness madam  my daughter  and i cannot bear it  he spoke this loud enough to be heard and mr greville and the baronet both with some emotion rose and turned about to us  once more sir rowland said i my compliments to my brother  adieu  god in heaven bless you madam that is all  gentlemen your servant mrs reeves your most obedient humble servant madam to me you will allow me and my nephew too one more visit i hope before i set out for caermarthen  i courtesied and joined my cousins away went the knight brushing the ground with his hat at his going out mr reeves waited on him to the outward door  bye bye to you mr reeves  with some emotion as my cousin told me afterward  a wonderful creature by mercy a wonderful creature  i go away with my heart full yet am pleased i know not why neither that is the jest of it  bye mrs reeves i can stay no longer  an odd mortal said the man of the town  but he seems to know on which side his bread is buttered  a whimsical old fellow said the man of the country but i rejoice that he has not a son that is all  a good many frothy things passed not worth relateing i wanted them both to be gone they seemed each to think it time but looked as if neither cared to leave the other behind him  at last mr greville who hinted to me that he knew i loved not too long an intrusion bowed and politely enough took his leave and then the baronet began with apoligizing for his behavior at taking leave on his last visit  some gentlemen i said had one way some another of expressing themselves on particular occasions he had thought fit to show me what was his  he seemed a little disconcerted but quickly recovering himself he could not indeed excuse himself he said for having then called me cruel  cruel he hoped he should not find me  proud  i knew not what pride was ungrateful  i could not be guilty of ingratitude he begged me to forgive his peremptoriness  he had hoped as he had been assured that my affections were absolutely disengaged that the proposals he had to make would have been acceptable and so positive a resusal without any one reason assigned and on his first visit had indeed hurt his pride he owned he said that he had some pride and made him forget that he was addressing himself to a woman who deserved and met with the veneration of every one who approached her he next expressed himself with apprehensions on mr grevilles arrival in town he spoke slightly of him mr greville i doubt not will speak as slightly of sir hargrave and if i believe them both i fansy i shall not injure either  mr grevilles arrival i said ought not to concern me he was to do as he thought fit i was only desirous to be allowed the same free agency that i was ready to allow to others  that could not be he said every man who saw me must wish me to be his and endeavor to obtain his wishes  and then making vehement professions of love he offered me large settlements and to put it in my power to do all the good that he knew it was in my heart to do  and that i should prescribe to him in every thing as to place of residence excursions even to the going abroad to france to italy and wherever i pleased  to all which i answered as before and when he insisted upon my reasons for resusing him i frankly told him though i owned it was with some reluctance that i had not the opinion of his morals that i must have of those of the man to whom i gave my hand in marriage  of my morals madam starting and his color went and came my morals madam  i thought he looked with malice but i was not intimidated and yet my cousins looked at me with some little surprise for my plain dealing though not as blaming me  be not displeased sir with my freedom you call upon me to make objections i mean not to upbraid you that is not my business but thus called upon i must repeat  i stopped  proceed madam angrily  indeed sir hargrave you must pardon me on this occasion if i repeat that i have not that opinion of your morals   very well madam   that i must have of those of the man on whose worthiness i must build my hopes of present happiness and to whose guidance entrust my future this sir is a very material consideration with me though i am not fond of talking upon it except on proper occasions and to proper persons but sir let me add that i am determined to live longer single i think it too early to engage in a life of care and if i do not meet with a man to whom i can give my whole heart i never will marry at all o how maliciously looked the man  you are angry sir hargrave added i but you have no right to be so you address me as one who is her own mistress and though i would not be thought rude i value myself on my openness of heart  he arose from his seat he walked about the room muttering you have no opinion of my morals  by heaven madam  but i will bear it all  yet no opinion of my morals  i cannot bear that   he then clenched his fist and held it up to his head and snatching up his hat bowing to the ground to us all his face crimsoned over as the time before he withdrew  mr reeves attended him to the door  not like my morals said he  i have enemies mr reeves  not like my morals  miss byron treats politely every body but me sir her scorn may be repaid  would to god i could say with scorn mr reeves  adieu excuse my warmth  adieu  and into his chariot he stepped pulling up the glasses with violence and as mr reeves told us rearing up his head to the top of it as he sat swelling and away it drove  his menacing airs and abrupt departure terrified me i did not recover myself in an hour  a fine husband for your harriet would this half madman make  o mr fowler sir rowland mr orme what good men are you to sir hargrave should i have known half so much as i do of his ill qualities had i not refused him drawn in by his professions of love and by  000 l a year i might have married him and when too late found myself miserable yoked with a tyrant and madman for the remainder of a life begun with happy prospects and glorying in every ones love  letter xx miss byron in continuation monday february    i have received my uncles long letter and i thank him for the pains he has taken with me he is very good but my grandmamma and my aunt are equally so and in the main much kinder in acquitting me of some charges which he is pleased to make upon his poor harriet but either for caution or reproof i hope to be the better for his letter  james is set out for northamptonshire pray receive him kindly he is honest and sally has given me an hint as if a sweetheart is in his head if so his impatience to leave london may be accounted for my grandmamma has observed that young people of small or no fortunes should not be discouraged from marrying who that could be masters or mistresses would be servants the honest poor as she has often said are a very valuable part of the creation  mr reeves has seen several footmen but none that he gave me the trouble of speaking to till just now when a welllooking young man about twentysix years of age offered himself and whom i believe i shall like mrs reeves seems mightily taken with him he is wellbehaved has a very sensible look and seems to merit a better service  mr reeves has written for a character of him to the last master he lived with mr bagenhall a young gentleman in the neighborhood of reading of whom he speaks well in the main but modestly objected to his hours and free way of life the young man came to town but yesterday and is with a widow sister who keeps an inn in smithfield i have a mind to like him and this makes me more particular about him  his name is william wilson he asks pretty high wages but wages to a good servant are not to be stood upon what signify forty or fifty shillings a year an honest servant should be enabled to lay up something for age and infirmity hire him at once mrs reeves says she will be answerable for his honesty from his looks and from his answers to the questions asked him  sir hargrave has been here again mrs revees miss dolyns miss clements and i were in the back room together we had drank tea and i excused myself to his message as engaged  he talked a good deal to mr reeves sometimes high sometimes humble he had not intended he said to have renewed his visits my disdain had stung him to the heart yet he could not keep away he called himself names he was determined i should be his and swore to it a man of his fortune to be refused by a lady who had not and whom he wished not to have an answerable fortune and no preserable liking to any other man there sir hargrave was mistaken for i like almost every man i know better than him his person not contemptible and then my cousin says he surveyed himself from head to foot in the glass was very very unaccountable  he asked if mr greville came up with any hopes  mr reeves told him that i was offended at his coming and he was sure he would not be the better for his journey  he was glad of that he said there were two or three free things proceeded he said to me in conversation by mr greville which i knew not well what to make of but they shall pass if he has no more to boast of than i i know mr grevilles blustering character but i wish the carrying of miss byron were to depend upon the swords point between us i would not come into so paltry a compromise with him as fenwick has done but still the imputing want of morals to me sticks with me surely i am a better man in point of morals than either greville or fenwick what man on earth does not take liberties with the sex hay you know mr reeves women were made for us and they like us not the worse for loving them want of morals  and objected to me by a lady  very extraordinary by my soul  is it not better to sow all ones wild oats before matrimony than run riot afterward  what say you mr reeves  mr reeves was too patient with him he is a mild man yet wants not spirit my cousin says on occasion he gave sir hargrave the hearing who went away swearing that i should be his in spite of man or devil  monday night mr greville came in the evening he begged to be allowed but ten words with me in the next room i desired to be excused you know sir said i that i never complied with a request of this nature at selbyhouse he looked hard at my cousins and first one then the other went out he then was solicitous to know what were sir hargraves expectations from me he expressed himself uneasy upon his account he hoped such a man as that would not be encouraged yet his ample fortune  woman woman  but he was neither a wiser nor a better man than himself and he hoped miss byron would not give a preference to fortune merely against a man who had been her admirer for so long a time and who wanted neither will nor power to make her happy  it was very irksome to me i answered to be obliged so often to repeat the same things to him i would not be thought assronting to anybody especially to a neighbor with whom my friends were upon good terms but i did not think myself answerable to him or to any one out of my own family for my visitors or for whom my cousin reevess thought fit to receive as theirs  would i give him an assurance that sir hargrave should have no encouragement  no sir i will not would not that be to give you indirectly a kind of control over me would not that be to encourage an hope that i never will encourage  i love not my own soul madam as i love you i must and will persevere if i thought sir hargrave had the least hope by the great god of heaven i would pronounce his days numbered  i am but too well acquainted with your rashness mr greville what formerly passed between you and another gentleman gave me pain enough in such an enterprise your own days might be numbered as well as anothers but i enter not into this subject  henceforth be so good as not to impute incivility to me if i deny myself to your visits  i would have withdrawn   dear miss byron stepping between me and the door leave me not in anger if matters must stand as they were i hope you can i hope you will assure me that this sir fopling   what right have you sir to any assurance of this nature from me  none madam  but from your goodness  dear miss byron condescend to say that this sir hargrave shall not make any impression on your heart for his sake say it if not for mine i know you care not what becomes of me yet let not this milkfaced and tygerhearted fop for that is his character obtain favor from you let your choice if it must fall on another man and not on me fall on one to whose superior merit and to whose good fortune i can subscribe for your own fames sake let a man of unquestionable honor be the happy man and vouchsafe as to a neighbor and as to a wellwishing friend only i ask it not in the light of a lover to tell me that sir hargrave pollexfen shall not be the man  what mr greville let me ask you is your business in town  my chief business madam you may guess at i had an hint of this mans intentions given me and that he has the vanity to think he shall succeed but if i can be assured that you will not be prevailed upon in favor of a man whose fortune is so ample   you will then return to northamptonshire  why madam i cannot but say that now i am in town and that i have bespoke a new equipage and soforth   nay sir it is nothing to me what you will or will not do only be pleased to remember that as in northamptonshire your visits were to my uncle selby not to me they will be here in london to my cousin reevess only  too well do i know that you can be cruel if you will but is it your pleasure that i return to the country  my pleasure sir mr greville is surely to do as he pleases i only wish to be allowed the same liberty  you are so very delicate miss byron so very much afraid of giving the least advantage   and men are so ready to take advantage  but yet mr greville not so delicate as just i do assure you that if i were not determined   determined  yes yes you can be steady as mr selby calls it i never knew so determined a woman in my life i own it was a little inconvenient for me to come to town just now and say that you would wish me to leave london and that neither this sir hargrave nor that other man your new fathers nephew what do you call him foregad madam i am afraid of these new relations shall make any impression on your heart and that you will not withdraw when i come here and i will set out next week and write this very night to let fenwick know how matters stand and that i am coming down but little the better for my journey and this may save you seeing your other tormentor as your cousin lucy says you once called that poor devil and the still poorer devil before you  you are so rash a man mr greville and other men may be as rash as you that i cannot say but it would save me some pain   o take care take care miss byron that you express yourself so cautiously as to give no advantage to a poor dog who would be glad to take a journey to the farthest part of the globe to oblige you but what say you about this sir hargrave and about your new brother  let me tell you madam i am so much afraid of those whining insinuating creeping dogs attacking you on the side of your compassion and be d  nd to them orme for that that i must have a declaration and now madam cannot you give it with your usual caution cannot you give it as i put it as to a neighbor as to a well wisher and soforth not as to a lover  well then mr greville as a neighbor as a wellwisher and since you own it was inconvenient to your affairs to come up  i advise you to go down again  the devil how you have hit it your delicacy ought to thank me for the loopehole the condition madam the condition if i take your neighbourly advice  why mr greville i do most sincerely declare to you as to a neighbor and wellwisher that i never yet have seen the man to whom i can think of giving my hand  yes you have by heaven you have snatching my hand you shall give it to me  and the strange wretch pressed it so hard to his mouth that he made prints upon it with his teeth  oh cried i withdrawing my hand surprised and my face as i could feel all in a glow  and oh said he mimicking and snatching my other hand as i would have run from him and patting it speaking through his closed teeth you may be glad you have an hand lest by my soul i could eat you  this was your disconsolate fallenspirited greville lucy  i rushed into the company in the next room he followed me with an air altogether unconcerned and begged to look at my hand whispering to mrs reeves by jupiter said he i had like to have eaten up your lovely cousin i was beginning with her hand  i was more offended with this instance of his assureance and unconcern than with the freedom itself because that had the appearance of his usual gaiety with it i thought it best however not to be too serious upon it but the next time he gets me by himself he shall eat up both my hands  at taking leave he hoped his mad flight had not discomposed me see miss byron said he what you get by making an honest fellow desperate  but you insist upon my leaving the town as a neighbor as a wellwisher you advise it madam come come dont be afraid of speaking after me when i endeavor to hit your cue  i do advise you   conditions remember you know what you have declared  angel of a woman said he again through his shut teeth  i left him and went up stairs glad i had got rid of him  he has since seen mr reeves and told him he will make me one visit more before he leaves london and pray tell her said he that i have actually written to my brothertormentor fenwick that i am returning to northamptonshire  i told you that miss clements was with me when sir hargrave came last i like her every time i see her better than before she has a sine understanding and if languages according to my grandfathers observation need not be deemed an indispensable part of learning she may be looked upon as learned  she has engaged me to breakfast with her tomorrow morning when she is to show me her books needleworks and other curiosities shall i not fansy myself in my lucys closet how continually amid all this fluttering scene do i think of my dear friends in northamptonshire express for me love duty gratitude every sentiment that fills the heart of  your harriet byron  letter xxi miss byron in continuation tuesday morning feb    i have passed an agreeable two hours with miss clements and am just returned she is extremely ingenious and perfectly unaffected i am told that she writes finely and is a madame de sevigne to her correspondents i hope to be one of them but she has not i find suffered her pen to run away with her needle nor her reading to interfere with that housewifry which the best judges hold so indispensable in the character of a good woman  i revere her for this as her example may be produced as one in answer to such as object i am afraid sometimes too justly but i hope too generally against learning in women methinks however i would not have learning the principal distinction of the woman i love and yet where talents are given should we wish them to be either uncultivated or unacknowleged surely lucy we may pronounce that where no duty is neglected for the acquirement where modesty delicacy and a teachable spirit are preserved as characteristics of the sex it need not be thought a disgrace to be supposed to know something  miss clements is happy as well as your harriet in an aunt that loves her she has a mother living who is too great a selflover to regard anybody else as she ought she lives as far off as york and was so unnatural a parent to this good child that her aunt was not easy till she got her from her mrs wimburn looks upon her as her daughter and intends to leave her all she is worth  the old lady was not very well but she obliged us with her agreeable company for half an hour  we agreed to fall in occasionally upon each other without ceremony  i should have told you that the last master of the young man william wilson having given him in writing a very good character i have entertained him and his first service was attending on me to miss clements  lady betty called here in my absence she is it seems very full of the dresses and mine in particular but i must know nothing about it as yet we are to go to her house to dress and to proceed from thence in chairs she is to take care of everything you shall know my lucy what figure i am to make when i know it myself  the baronet also called at my cousins while i was out he saw only mr reeves he staid about a quarter of an hour he was very moody and sullen it seems quite another man mr reeves said than he had ever seen him before not one laugh not one smile all that sell from his lips was yes or no or by way of invective against the sex it wasthe devil of a sex it was a cursed thing he said that a man could be neither happy with them nor without them devils baits was another of his compliments to us he hardly mentioned my name  mr reeves at last began to rally him on his moodiness and plainly saw that to avoid showing more of his petulance when he had not a right to show any to a man of mr reevess consideration and in his own house he went away the sooner his footmen and coachman he believed had an ill time of it for without reason he cursed them swore at them and threatened them  what does the man haunt us for  why brings he such odious humors to mr reevess  but no more of such a man nor of any thing else till my next only  adieu my lucy letter xxii miss byron in continuation wednesday morning feb    mr greville took leave of us yesterday evening in order to set out this morning on his return home he would fain have engaged me for half an hour alone but i would not oblige him  he left london he said with some regret because of the fluttering sir hargrave and the creeping mr fowler but depended upon my declaration that i had not in either of them seen the man i could encourage either of them were the words he chose to use for in compliment to himself he would not repeat my very words that i had not yet seen any man to whom i could give my hand shall i give you a few particulars of what passed between me and this very whimsical man i will  he had been enquiring he said into the character and pretensions of my bother fowler and intended if he could bring orme and him together to make a match between them who would outwhine the other  heroes i told him ought not to make a jest of those who on comparison gave them all their advantages  he bowed and called himself my servant  and with an affected laugh yet madam yet madam i am not afraid of those piping men though you have compassion for such watryheaded fellows yet you have only compassion  respectful love mr greville is not always the indication either of a weak head or a faint heart any more than the contrary is of a true spirit  perhaps so madam but yet i am not afraid of these two men  you have no reason to be afraid of anybody on my account mr greville  i hope not  you will find sir at last that you had better take my meaning it is obvious enough  but i have no mind to hang drown or pistol myself  mr greville still yet it would be well if there were not many mr grevilles  i take your meaning madam you have explained it heretofore it is that i am a libertine that we have all one dialect and that i can say nothing new or that is worthy of your attention  there madam may i not be always sure of your meaning when i construe it against myself  i wish sir that my neighbor would give me leave to behave to him as to my neighbor   and could you madam supposing love out of the question which it cannot be could you in that case regard me as your neighbor  why not sir  because i believe you hate me and i only want you to tell me that you do  i hope sir i shall never have reason given me to hate any man  but if you hate any one man more than another is it not me i was silent strange mrs reeves turning to her that miss byron is not susceptible either of love or hatred  she is too good to hate anybody and as for love her time seems not to be yet come  when it is come it will come with a vengeance i hope  uncharitable man said i smiling  dont smile i cannot bear to see you smile why dont you be angry at me  angel of a creature with his teeth again closed dont smile i cannot bear your bewitching smiles  the man is out of his right mind mrs reeves i dont choose to stay in his company  i would have withdrawn he besought me to stay and stood between me and the door i was angry  he whimsically stamped  obliging creature  i besought you to forbear smiling  you frown  do god forever bless you my dear miss byron let me be favored with another frown  strange man and bold as strange  i would have pressed to the door but he set his back against it  these are the airs you know lucy for which i used to shun him  pish said i vexed to be hindered from withdrawing  another another such frown said the confident man and i am happy  the last has left no trace upon your features it vanished before i could well behold it another frown i beseech you another pish   i was really angry  bear witness looking around him bear witness once did miss byron endeavor to frown and to oblige whom her greville  mr greville you had better  i stopped i was vexed i knew not what i was going to say  how better madam am i not desperate  but had i better say repeat that again  had i better  ter what  the mans mad o my cousins let me never again be called to this man  mad  and so i am mad for you i care not who knows it why dont you hate me he snatched at my hand but i started back you own that you never yet loved the man who loved you such is your gratitude say you hate me  i was silent and turned from him peevishly  why then as if i had said i did not hate him say you love me and i will look down with contempt upon the greatest prince on earth  we should have had more of this  but the rap of consequence gave notice of the visit of a person of consideration it was the baronet  the devil pick his bones said the shocking greville i shall not be civil to him  he is not your guest mr greville said i  afraid that something affronting might pass between two spirits so unmanageable the one in an humor so whimsical the other very likely to be moody  true true replied he i will be all silence and observation but i hope you will not now be for retiring  it would be too particular thought i if i am yet i should have been glad to do so  the baronet paid his respects to every one in a very set and formal manner nor distinguished me  silly as vain thought i handsome fop to imagine thy displeasure of consequence to me  mr greville said sir hargrave the town i understand is going to lose you  the town sir hargrave cannot be said to have found me  how can a man of your gallantry and fortune find himself employment in the country in the winter i wonder   very easily when he has used himself to it hargrave and has seen abroad in greater perfecti than you can have them here the kind of diversions you all run after with so keen an appetite  in greater perfection i question that mr greville and i have been abroad though too early i own to make critical observations  you may question it sir hargrave but i dont  have we not from italy the most famous singers mr greville and from thence and from france for our money the most famous dancers in the world  no sir they set too great a value in italy let me tell you upon their finest voices and upon their finest composers too to let them turn strollers  strollers do you call them ha ha ha hah  princely strollers as we reward them  and as to composers have we not handel  there you say something sir hargrave but you have but one handel in england they have several in italy  is it possible said every one  let me die said the baronet with a forced laugh if i am not ready to think that mr greville has run into the fault of people of less genius than himself he has got such a taste for foreign diversions that he cannot think tolerably of those of his own country be they ever so excellent  handel sir hargrave is not an englishman but i must say that of every person present i least expected from sir hargrave pollexfen this observation  he then returned the baronets laugh and not without an air of mingled anger and contempt  nor i this taste for foreign performances and compositions from mr greville for so long time as thou have been a downright country gentleman  indeed thought i to myself you seem both to have changed characters but i know how it comes about let one advance what he will in the present humor of both the other will contradict it mr greville knows nothing of music what he said was from hearsay and sir hargrave is no better grounded in it  a downright country gentleman repeated mr greville measuring sir hargrave with his eye and putting up his lip  why prythee now greville thou whatshallicall thee thou art not offended i hope that we are not all of one mind ha ha ha hah  i am offended at nothing you say sir hargrave  nor i at anything you look my dear ha ha ha hah  yet his looks showed as much contempt for mr greville as mr grevilles did for him how easily might these combustible spirits have blown each other up mr reeves was once a little apprehensive of consequences from the airs of both  mr greville turned from sir hargrave to me well miss byron said he but as to what we were talking about  this he seemed to say on purpose as i thought by his air to alarm the baronet  i beg pardon said sir hargrave turning with a stiff air to me i beg pardon miss byron if i have intruded   we were talking of indifferent things sir hargrave answered i  mere matters of pleasantry  i was more in earnest than in jest miss byron replied mr greville  we all i believe thought you very whimsical mr greville returned i  what was sport to you madam is death to me  poor greville ha ha ha hah affectedly laughed the baronet but i know you are a joker you are a man of wit this a little softened mr greville who had begun to look grave upon sir hargrave come prythee man give thyself up to me for this night and i will carry thee to a private concert where none but choice spirits are admitted and let us see if music will not divert these gloomy airs that sit so ill upon the face of one of the liveliest men in the kingdom  music ay if miss byron will give us a song and accompany it with the harpsichord i will despise all other harmony  every one joined in his request and i was not backward to oblige them as i thought the conversation bore a little too rough a cast and was not likely to take a smoother turn  mr greville who always enjoys any jest that tends to reflect on our sex begged me to sing that whimsical song set by galliard which once my uncle made me sing at selbyhouse in mr grevilles hearing you were not there lucy that day and perhaps may not have the book as galliard is not a favorite with you  chloe by all the powers above to damon vowed eternal love a rose adorned her sweeter breast she on a leaf the vow impressed but zephyr by her side at play love vow and leaf blew quite away the gentlemen were very lively on the occasion and encored it but i told them that as they must be better pleased with the jest on our sex contained in it than they could be with the music i would not for the sake of their own politeness oblige them  you will favor us however with your discreet lover miss byron said mr greville that is a song written entirely on your own principles  well then i will give you said i set by the same hand  the discreet lover ye fair that would be blessed in love take your pride a little lower let the swain whom you approve rather like you than adore love that rises into passion soon will end in hate or strife but from tender inclination flow the lasting joys of life these two light pieces put the gentlemen into good humor and a deal of silly stuff was said to me by way of compliment on the occasion by sir hargrave and mr greville not one word of which i believed  the baronet went away first to go to his concert he was very cold in his behavior to me at taking leave as he had been all the time  mr greville soon after left us intending to set out this morning  he snatched my hand at going i was afraid of a second savage freedom and would have withdrawn it  only one sigh over it but one sigh oh  said he an oh half a yard long  and pressed it with his lips  but remember madam you are watched i have half a dozen spies upon you and the moment you find the man you can favor up comes your greville cuts a throat and flies his country  he stopped at the parlourdoor  one letter miss byron  receive but one letter from me  no mr greville but i wish you well  wishes that like the bishops blessing cost you nothing i was going to say no for you but you were too quick it had been some pleasure to have denied myself and prevented the mortification of a denial from you  he went away every one wishing him a good journey and speaking favorably of the odd creature mrs reeves in particular thought fit to say that he was the most entertaining of all my lovers but if so what is it they call entertaining and what are those others whom they call my lovers  the man said i is an immoral man and had he not got above blushes and above being hurt by love he could not have been so gay and so entertaining as you call it  miss byron says true said mr reeves i never knew a man who could make a jesting matter of the passion in the presence of the object so very deeply in love as to be hurt by a disappointment there sits my saucebox did i ever make a jest of my love to you madam  no indeed sir had i not thought you most deplorably in earnest you had not had any of my pity  why look you there now that is a declaration in point either mr orme or mr fowler must be the happy man miss byron  indeed neither  but why they have both good estates they both adore you sir hargrave i see you cannot have mr greville dies not for you though he would be glad to live with you mr fenwick is a still less eligible man i think where can you be better than with one of the two i have named  you speak seriously cousin i will not answer lightly but neither of those gentlemen can be the man yet i esteem them both because they are good men  well but dont you pity them  i dont know what to say to that you hold that pity is but one remove from love and to say i pity a man who professes to love me because i cannot consent to be his carries with it i think an air of arrogance and looks as if i believed he must be unhappy without me when possibly there may be hundreds of women with any one of whom he might be more truly happy  well this is in character from you miss byron but may i ask you now which of the two gentlemen mr orme or mr fowler were you obliged to have one of them would you choose  mr orme i frankly answer have i not told mr fowler so  well then what are your objections may i ask to mr orme he is not a disagreeable man in his person you own that you think him a good man his sister loves you and you love her what is your objection to mr orme  i dont know what to say i hope i should perform my duty to the man to whom i shall give my vows be he who he will but i am not in haste to marry if a single woman knows her own happiness she will find that the time from eighteen to twentyfour is the happiest part of her life if she stay till she is twentyfour she has time to look about her and if she has more lovers than one is enabled to choose without having reason on looking back to reproach herself for hastiness her fluttering her romantic age we all know something of it i doubt is over by twentyfour or it will hold too long and she is then fit to take her resolutions and to settle i have more than once hinted that i should be afraid to engage with one who thinks too highly of me beforehand nothing violent can be lasting and i could not bear when i had given a man my heart with my hand and they never shall be separated that he should behave to me with less affection than he showed to me before i was his as i wish not now to be made an idol of i may the more reasonably expect the constancy due to friendship and not to be affronted with his indifference after i have given him my whole self in other words i could not bear to have my love slighted or to be despised for it instead of being encouraged to show it and how shall extravagant passion warrant hopes of this nature  if the man be not a man of gratitude of principle and a man whose love is founded in reason and whose object is mind rather than person  but mr orme replied mr reeves is all this such i believe in his love  be it so but if i cannot love him so well as to wish to be his a man i have heard my uncle as well as sir hargrave say is his own a woman is a mans if i cannot take delight in the thought of bearing my part of the yoke with him in the belief that in case of a contrariety of sentiments i cannot give up my judgment in points indifferent from the good opinion i have of his what but a fondness for the state and an irksomeness in my present situation could bias me in favor of any man indeed my cousin i must love the man to whom i could give my hand well enough to be able on cool deliberation to wish to be his wife and for his sake with my whole heart choose to quit the single state in which i am very happy  and you are sure that your indifference to mr orme is not either directly or indirectly owing to his obsequious love of you and to the milkiness of his nature as shakespeare calls it  very sure all the leaning toward him that i have in preference as i think to every other man who has beheld me with partiality is on the contrary owing to the grateful sense i have of his respect to me and to the gentleness of his nature does not my behavior to mr greville to mr fenwick to sir hargrave compared with my treatment of mr orme and mr fowler confirm what i say  then you are as indeed i have always thought you a nonsuch of a woman  not so your own lady whom you first brought to pity you as i have heard you say is an instance that i am not  well that is true but is she not at the same time an example that pity melts the soul to love  i have no doubt said mrs reeves but miss byron may be brought to love the man she can pity  but madam said i did you not let pity grow into love before you married mr reeves  i believe i did smiling  well then i promise you mr reeves when that comes to be the case with me i will not give pain to a man i can like to marry  very well replied mr reeves and i dare say that at last mr orme will be the man and yet how you will get off with sir hargrave i cannot tell for lady betty williams this very day told me that he declared to her he was resolved you should be his and she has promised him all her interest with you and with us and is astonished that you can refuse a man of his fortune and address and who has many very many admirers among people of the first rank  the baronet is at the door i suppose he will expect to see me  wednesday afternoon sir hargrave is just gone he desired to talk with me alone i thought i might very well decline obligeing him as he had never scrupled to say to me all he had a mind to say before my cousins and as he had thought himself of consequence enough to behave moodily and even made this request rather with an air of expectation than of respect and i accordingly desired to be excused he stalked about my cousins first one then the other withdrew his behavior had not been so agreeable as to deserve this compliance i was vexed they did  he offered as soon as they were gone to take my hand  i withdrew it  madam said he very impertinently angry you would not do thus to mr greville you would not do thus to any man but me  indeed sir i would were i left alone with him  you see madam that i cannot forbear visiting you my heart and soul are devoted to you i own i have pride forgive me it is piqued i did not believe i should have been rejected by any lady who had no dislike to a change of condition and was disengaged you declare that you are so and i am willing i am desirous to believe you  and yet that greville   there he stopped as expecting me to speak  to what purpose sir hargrave do you expect an answer to what you hint about mr greville it is not my way to behave with incivility to any man who professes a regard for me   except to me madam   selfpartiality sir and nothing else could cause you to make this exception  well madam but as to mr greville   pray sir hargrave   and pray miss byron   i have never yet seen the man who is to be my husband  by g  said the wretch fiercely almost in the language of mr greville on the like occasion but you have  and if you are not engaged in your affections the man is before you  if this sir hargrave is all you wanted to say to me and would not be denied saying it it might have been said before my cousins i was for leaving him  you shall not go i beg madam putting himself between me and the door  what further would sir hargrave say standing still and angry what further would sir hargrave say  have you madam a dislike to matrimony  what right have you sir to ask me this question  do you ever intend to enter into the state  perhaps i may if i meet with a man to whom i can give my whole heart  and cannot that man be i  let me implore you madam i will kneel to you and down he dropped on his knees i cannot live without you for gods sake madam your pity your mercy your gratitude your love i could not do this before anybody unless assured of favor i implore your favor  foolish man it was plain that this kneeling supplication was premeditated  o sir what undue humility  could i have received your address none of this had been necessary  your pity madam once more your gratitude your mercy your love  pray sir rise  he swore by his god that he would not till i had given him hope   no hope can i give you sir it would be cheating it would be deluding you it would not be honest to give you hope  you objected to my morals madam have you any other objection  need there any other  but i can clear myself  to god and to your conscience then do it sir i want you not to clear yourself to me  but madam the clearing myself to you would be clearing myself to god and my conscience  what language is this sir but you can be nothing to me indeed you can be nothing to me  rise sir rise or i leave you  i made an effort to go he caught my hand and arose  then kissed it and held it between both his  for gods sake madam   pray sir hargrave   your objections i insist upon knowing your objections my person madam  forgive me i am not used to boast  my person madam   pray sir hargrave   is not contemptible my fortune   god bless you sir with your fortune   is not inconsiderable my morals   pray sir hargrave why this enumeration to me   are as unexceptionable as those of most young men of fashion in the present age  i am sorry if this be true thought i to myself  you have reason i hope sir to be glad of that  my descent   is honorable sir no doubt  my temper is not bad i am thought to be a man of vivacity and of cheerfulness  i have courage madam  and this should have been seen had i found reason to dread a competitor in your favor  i thought you were enumerating your good qualities sir hargrave  courage madam magnanimity in a man madam   are great qualities sir courage in a right cause i mean magnanimity you know sir is greatness of mind  and so it is and i hope   and i sir hargrave hope you have great reason to be satisfied with yourself but it would be very grievous to me if i had not the liberty so to act so to govern myself in essential points as should leave me as well satisfied with myself  this i hope may be the case madam if you encourage my passion and let me assure you that no man breathing ever loved a woman as i love you my person my fortune my morals my descent my temper a man in such a case as this may be allowed to do himself justice all unexceptionable let me die if i can account for your  your  your refusal of me in so peremptory in so unceremonious a manner slapdash as i may say and not one objection to make or which you will condescend to make  you say sir that you love me above all women would you can you be so little nice as to wish to marry a woman who does not prefer you to all men  if you are let me tell you sir that you have assigned a reason against yourself which i think i ought to look upon as conclusive  i make no doubt madam that my behavior to you after marriage will induce you in gratitude as well as justice to prefer me to all men  your behavior after marriage sir  never will i trust to that where   where what madam  no need of entering into particulars sir you see that we cannot be of the same mind you sir hargrave have no doubt of your merit   i know madam that i should make it the business as well as pleasure of my life to deserve you  you value yourself upon your fortune sir   only as it gives me power to make you happy  riches never yet of themselves made anybody happy i have already as great a fortune as i wish for you think yourself polite   polite madam  and i hope   the whole of what i mean sir hargrave is this you have a very high opinion of yourself you may have reason for it since you must know yourself and your own heart better than i can pretend to do but would you let me ask you make choice of a woman for a wise who frankly owns that she cannot think so highly as you imagine she ought to think of you  in justice to yourself sir   by my soul madam haughtily you are the only woman who could thus   well sir perhaps i am but will not this singularity convince you that i can never make you happy nor you me you tell me that you think highly of me but if i cannot think so highly of you pray sir let me be entitled to the same freedom in my refusal that governs you in your choice  he walked about the room and gave himself airs that showed greater inward than even outward emotion  i had a mind to leave him yet was not willing to withdraw abruptly intending and hoping to put an end to all his expectations for the future i therefore in a manner asked for leave to withdraw  i presume sir that nothing remains to be said but what may be said before my cousins and courtesying was going  he told me with a passionate air that he was halfdistracted and complained of the use i made of the power i had over him and as i had near opened the door he threw himself on his knees to me against it and undesignedly hurt my finger with the lock  he was grieved i made light of it though in pain that he might not have an opportunity to flourish upon it and to show a tenderness which i doubt is not very natural to him  how little was i affected with his kneeling to what i was with the same posture in sir rowland sir hargrave supplicated me as before i was forced in answer to repeat some of the same things that i had said before  i would fain have parted civilly he would not permit me to do so though he was on his knees he mingled passion and even indirect menaces with his supplications i was forced to declare that i never more would receive his visits  this declaration he vowed would make him desperate and he cared not what became of him  i often begged him to rise but to no purpose till i declared that i would stay no longer with him and then he arose rapt out an oath or two again called me proud and ungrateful and followed me into the other room to my cousins he could hardly be civil to them he walked two or three turns about the room at last forgive me mr reeves forgive me mrs reeves said he bowing to them more stiffly to me  and you forbid my future visits madam said he with a face of malice  i do sir and that for both our sakes you have greatly discomposed me  next time madam i have the honor of attending you it will be i hope  he stopped a moment but still looking fiercely to an happier purpose and away he went  mr reeves was offended with him and discouraged me not in my resolution to avoid receiving his future visits you will now therefore hear very little farther in my letters of this sir hargrave pollexfen  and yet i wish i do not see him very soon but it will be in company enough if i do at the masquerade i mean tomorrow night for he never misses going to such entertainments  our dresses are ready mr reeves is to be an hermit mrs reeves a nun lady betty a lady abbess but i by no means like mine because of its gaudiness the very thing i was afraid of  they call it the dress of an arcadian princess but it falls not in with any of my notions of the pastoral dress of arcadia  a white paris net sort of cap glittering with spangles and incircled by a chaplet of artificial flowers with a little white feather perking from the left ear is to be my headdress  my masque is venetian  my hair is to be complimented with an appearance because of its natural ringlets as they call my curls and to shade my neck  tucker and ruffles blond lace  my shape is also said to be consulted in this dress a kind of waistcoat of blue satin trimmed with silver point despagne the skirts edged with silver fringe is made to sit close to my waist by double clasps a small silver tassel at the ends of each clasp all set off with bugles and spangles which make a mighty glitter  but i am to be allowed a kind of scarf of white persian silk which gathered at the top is to be fastened to my shoulders and to fly loose behind me  bracelets on my arms  they would have given me a crook but i would not submit to that it would give me i said an air of confidence to aim to manage it with any tolerable freedom and i was apprehensive that i should not be thought to want that from the dress itself a large indian fan was not improper for the expected warmth of the place and that contented me  my petticoat is of blue satin trimmed and fringed as my waistcoat i am not to have an hoop that is perceivable they wore not hoops in arcadia  what a sparkling figure shall i make had the ball been what they call a subscription ball at which people dress with more glare than at a common one this dress would have been more tolerable  but they all say that i shall be kept in countenance by masks as extravagant and even more ridiculous  be that as it may i wish the night were over i dare say it will be the last diversion of this kind i ever shall be at for i never had any notion of masquerades  expect particulars of all in my next i reckon you will be impatient for them but pray my lucy be fanciful as i sometimes am and let me know how you think everything will be beforehand and how many prettyfellows you imagine in this dress will be slain by  your harriet byron  letter xxiii mr reeves to george selby esquire friday feb    dear mr selby no one at present but yourself must see the contents of what i am going to write  you must not be too much surprised  but how shall i tell you the news the dreadful news  my wife has been since three this morning in violent hysterics upon it  you must not  but how shall i say you must not be too much affected when we are unable to support ourselves  o my cousin selby  we know not what is become of our dearest miss byron  i will be as particular as my grief and surprise will allow there is a necessity for it as you will find  mr greville as i apprehend  but to particulars first  we were last night at the ball in the haymarket  the chairmen who carried the dear creature and who as well as our chairmen were engaged for the night were inveigled away to drink somewhere they promised wilson my cousins servant to return in half an hour  it was then but little more than twelve  wilson waited near two hours and they not returning he hired a chair to supply their place  between two and three we all agreed to go home the dear creature was fatigued with the notice everybody took of her everybody admired her she wanted to go before but lady betty prevailed on her to stay a little longer  i waited on her to her chair and saw her in it before i attended lady betty and my wife to theirs  i saw that neither the chair nor the chairmen were those who brought her i asked the meaning and received the above particulars after she was in the chair  she hurried into it because of her dress and being warm and no less than four gentlemen following her to the very chair  it was then near three  i ordered wilson to bid the chairmen stop when they had got out of the crowd till lady bettys chair and mine and my wifes joined them  i saw her chair move and wilson with his lighted slambeaux before it and the four masks who followed her to the chair return into the house  when our servants could not find that her chair had stopped we supposed that in the hurry the fellow heard not my orders and directed our chairmen to proceed not doubting but we should find her got home before us  we had before agreed to be carried directly home declining lady bettys invitation to resume our own dresses at her house where we dressed for the ball  we were very much surprised at finding her not arrived but concluding that by mistake she was carried to lady bettys and was there expecting us we sent thither immediately  but good god what was our consternation when the servants brought us word back that lady betty had not either seen or heard of her  mr greville as i apprehend   but let me give you all the lights on which i ground my surmises  last night lady betty williams had an hint given her as she informed me at the masquerade that mr greville who took leave of my cousin on tuesday evening in order to set out for northamptonshire the next morning was neither gone nor intended to go being on the contrary resolved to continue in town perdue in order to watch my cousins visitors  he had indeed told her that she would have half a dozen spies upon her and threw out some hints of jealousy of two of her visitors  sir hargrave pollexfen in an harlequin dress was at the ball he soon discovered our lovely cousin and notwithstanding his former ill nature on being rejected by her addressed her with the politeness of a man accustomed to public places  he found me out at the sideboard a little before we went off and asked me if i had not seen mr greville there i said no  he asked me if i had not observed a mask distinguished by a broadbrimd halfslouched hat with a high flat crown a short black cloak a dark lantern in his hand holding it up to every ones masque and who he said was saluted by everybody as guido vaux that person he said was mr greville  i did indeed observe this person but recollected not that he had the air of mr greville but thought him a much more bulky man but that as he intended to have it supposed he had left the town might be easily managed  mr greville you know is a man of enterprise  he came to town having professedly no other material business but to give obstruction to my cousins visitors he saw she had two new ones he talked at first of staying in town and partaking of its diversions and even of bespeaking a new equipage  but all of a sudden though expecting mr fenwick would come up he pretended to leave the town and to set out directly for northamptonshire without having obtained any concession from my cousin in his favor  laying all these circumstances together i think it is hardly to be doubted but mr greville is at the bottom of this black affair  you will therefore take such steps on these lights as your prudence will suggest to you if mr greville is not come down  if mr fenwick  what would i say  the less noise however the affair makes till we can come at certainty the better  how i dread what that certainty may be  dear creature  but i am sure you will think it advisable to keep this dreadful affair from her poor grandmother and i hope your good lady  yet her prudent advice may be necessary  i have six people out at different parts of the town who are to make enquiries among chairmen coachmen etc  her new servant cannot be a villain  what can one say  what can one think  we have sent to his sister who keeps an inn in smithfield she has heard nothing of him  i have sent after the chairmen who carried her to this cursed masquerade lady bettys chairmen who had provided the chairs know them and their number they are traced with a fare from whites to berkeleysquare  something may be discovered by means of those fellows if they were tampered with they are afraid i suppose to come to demand their but halfearned money woe be to them if they come out to be rascals  i had half a suspicion of sir hargrave as well from the character given us of him by a friend of mine as because of his unpolite behavior to the dear creature on her rejecting him and sent to his house in cavendishsquare to know if he were at home and if he were at what time he returned from the ball  answer was brought that he was in bed and they supposed would not be stirring till dinnertime when he expected company and that he returned not from the ball till between four and five this morning  we sent to mr grevilles lodgings he has actually discharged them and the people think as he told them so that he is set out for the country but he is master of contrivances enough to manage this there can be no thought that he would give out otherwise to them than he did to us happy had we sound him not gone  mr greville must be the man  you will be so good as to dispatch the bearer instantly with what information can be got about mr greville  ever ever yours archibald reeves  letter xxiv mr selby to archibald reeves esquire in answer to the preceding saturday feb    o mr reeves  dear sweet child  flower of the world   but how could i keep such dreadful tidings within my own breast   how could i conceal my consternation  my wife saw it she would know the cause of it  i could not tell her the fatal news  fatal news indeed it will be immediate death to her poor grandmother   we must keep it from her as long as we can  but keep it from her  and is the dearest creature spirited away  o mr reeves   i gave my wife your letter she fainted away before she had read it through  masquerades i have generally heard said were more silly than wicked but they are now i am convinced the most profligate of all diversions  almost distracted cousin  you may well be so we shall all be quite distracted  dear dear creature what may she not have suffered by this time  why parted we with such a jewel out of your sight  you would not be denied you would have her to that cursed town  some damned villain to be sure  greville it is not  greville was seen late last night alighting at his own house from a postchaise he had nobody with him  in half an hour late as it was he sent his compliments to us to let us know that he had left the dear child well and in his usual style happier than she would make him he knows that our lives are bound up in hers  find out where she is and find her safe and well or we will never forgive those who were the cause of her going to london  dear soul she was overpersuaded  she was not fond of going  the sweetest obliging creature  what is now become of her  what by this time may she not have suffered   search everywhere  but you will no doubt  suspect everybody  this lady betty williams  such a plot must have a woman in it was she not sir hargraves friend  this sir hargrave  greville it could not be had we not the proof i mentioned greville bad as he is could not be such a villain  the first moment you have any tidings bad or good spare no expense   greville was this moment here  we could not see him we did not let him know the matter  he is gone away in great surprise on the servants telling him that we had received some bad news which made us unfit to see anybody the servants could not tell him what yet they all guess by your livery and by our grief that something has befallen their beloved young lady they are all in tears  and they look at us when they attend us with such inquisitive yet silent grief  we are speechless before them and tell them our wills by motions and not by words  good god  after so many happy years  happy in ourselves to be at last in so short a time made the most miserable of wretches  but this had not been if  but no more  good god of heaven what will become of my poor aunt shirley  lucy nancy will go distracted  but no more  hasten your next  and for give this distracted letter i know not what i have written but i am  yours george selby  letter xxv mr reeves to george selby esquire in continuation of letter xxiii lady bettys chairmen have found out the first chairmen  the fellows were made almost dead drunk they are sure something was put into their liquor they have been hunting after the footmen who enticed them and drank them down they describe their livery to be brown trimmed and turned up with yellow and are in the service of a merchants relict who lives either in marklane or mincinglane they forgot which but have not yet been able to find them out their lady they said was at the masquerade they were very officious to scrape acquaintance with them we know not anybody who gives this livery so no lights can be obtained by this part of the information a cursed deeplaid villainy  the fellows are resolved they say to find out these footmen if aboveground and the chairmen who were hired on their failure  every hour we have one messenger or other returning with something to say but hitherto with nothing to the purpose this has kept me within o mr selby i know not what to direct i know not what to do i send them out again as fast as they return yet rather show my despair than my hope  surely this villainy must be mr grevilles though i have but just dispatched away my servant to you i am impatient for his return  i will write every hour as anything offers that i may have a letter ready to send you by another man the moment we hear anything and yet i expect not to hear any thing material but from you  we begin to suspect the servant that wilson whom my cousin so lately hired were he clear of the matter either he or the chairmen he hired must have been heard of he would have returned they could not all three be either murdered or secreted  these cursed masquerades  never will i   o mr selby her servant is must be a villain sarah my dear cousins servant my poor wife can think of nothing she is extremely ill sarah took it into her head to have the specious rascals trunk broke open it felt light and he had talked but the night before of his stock of clothes and linen to the other servants there was nothing of value found in it not of sixpence value the most specious villain if a villain everybody liked him the dear creature herself was pleased with him he knew everything and everybody  cursed be he for his adroitness and knowledge we had made too many enquiries after a servant for her  eleven oclock i am just returned from smithfield from the villains sister he comes out to be a villain  this wilson i mean  a practiced villain  the woman shook her head at the enquiry which i made half out of breath after what was become of him she was afraid she said that all was not right but was sure her brother had not robbed  he had been guilty i said of a villainy that was a thousand times worse than robbery  she was inquisitive about it and i hinted to her what it was  her brother she said was a young man of parts and understanding and would be glad she was sure of getting a livelihood by honest services it was a sad thing that there should be such masters in the world as would put servants upon bad practices  i asked after the character of that bagenhall whose service her brother last lived in and imprudently i threatened her brother  ah sir was all the answer she made shaking her head  i repeated my question who was that bagenhall   excuse me sir said she i will give no other answer till i hear whether my brothers life may be in danger or not she abhorred she said all base practices as much as anybody could do and she was sorry for the lady and for me  i then offered to be the making of her brother were it possible to engage him before any violence was done to the lady i asked if she knew where to send to him  indeed she did not she dared to say she should not hear of him for one while whenever he had been drawn in to assist in any outoftheway pranks see mr selby a practiced villain he kept away from her till all was blown over those who would take such steps she feared would by this time have done the mischief  how i raved  i offered her money a handsome sum if she would tell me what she knew of that begenhall or of any of her brothers employers but she refused to say one word more till she knew whether her brothers life were likely to be affected or not  i left her and hastened home to enquire after what might have happened in my absence but will soon see her again in hopes she may be wrought upon to drop some hints by which something may be discovered  but all this time what may be the fate of the dear sufferer  i cannot bear my own thoughts  lady betty is inexpressibly grieved   i have dispatched a man and horse god knows to what purpose to a friend i have at reading to get him to enquire after the character of this bagenhall there is such a man and he is a man of pleasure as sir john allestree informs me  accursed villain this wilson he could not bear with his masters constant bad hours and profligate course of life as he told our servants and mrs sarah  spacious impostor  one oclock lady bettys chairmen have sound out and they brought with them one of the fellows whom that vile wilson hired the other was afraid to come i have secured this fellow yet he seems to be ingenuous and i have promised that if he prove innocent he shall be rewarded instead of punished and the two chairmen on this promise are gone to try to prevail upon his partner to come were it but to release the other as both insisted upon their innocence  and now will you be impatient to know what account this fellow gives  o mr selby the dear dear creature  but before i can proceed i must recover my eyes  two oclock this fellows name is macpherson his partners mc dermot this is macphersons account of the matter  wilson hired them to carry this young lady to paddington  to paddington a vile dog   they objected distance and danger the latter as macpherson owns to highten the value of the service  as to the danger wilson told him they would be met by three others of his fellow servants armed at the first fields and as to the distance they would be richl rewarded and he gave them a crown a piece earnest and treated them besides with brandy  to prevent their curiosity and entirely to remove their difficulties the villain told them that his young lady was an heiress and had agreed to go off from the masquerade with her lover but that the gentleman would not appear to them till she came to the very house to which she was to be conveyed  she thinks said the hellish villain that she is to be carried to mayfair chapel and to be married directly and that the minister unseasonable as the hour is will be there in readiness but the gentleman who is a man of the utmost honor intends first to try whether he cannot obtain her friends consent so when she finds her way lengthened proceeded the vile wretch she will perhaps be frightened and will ask me questions i would not for the world disoblige her but here she must be cheated for her own sake and when all is over will value me the more for the innocent imposture but whatever orders she may give you observe none but mine and follow me you shall be richly rewarded repeated the miscreant should she even cry out mind it not she is full of fears and hardly holds in one mind for an hour together  he further cautioned them not to answer any questions which might possibly be asked of them by the person who should conduct his young lady to her chair but refer to himself and in case any other chairs were to go in company with hers he bid them fall behind and follow his flambeaux  macpherson says that she drew the curtains close because of her dress no doubt the moment i had lest her after seeing her in the chair  the fellows thus prepossessed and instructed speeded away without stopping for our chairs yet the dear creature must have heard me give that direction  they had carried her a great way before she called out and then she called three times before they would hear her at the third time they stopped and her servant asked her commands where am i william said she just at home madam answered he surely you have taken a strange roundabout way we are come about said the rascal on purpose to avoid the crowd of chairs and coaches  they proceeded onwards and were joined by three men as wilson had told them they would but they fansied one of them to be a gentleman for he was muffled up in a cloak and had a silverhilted sword in his hand but he spoke not he gave no directions and all three kept aloof that they might not be seen by her  at maribone she again called out william william said she with vehemence the lord have mercy upon me where are you going to carry me chairmen stop stop chairmen set me down  william  call my servant chairmen   dear soul her servant her devil  the chairmen called him they lifted up the head the sidecurtains were still undrawn and mcdermot stood so close that she could not see far before her did you not tell me said the villain to them that it was not far about  see how you have frighted my lady  madam we are now almost at home  they proceeded with her saying they had indeed mistaken their way but they were just there and hurried on  she then undrew the sidecurtains  good god of heaven protect me they heard her say  i am in the midst of fields  they were then at lissomgreen  they heard her pray and macpherson said he began then to conclude that the lady was too much frightened and too pious to be in a loveplot  but nevertheless backoned by their villainous guide they hurried on and then she screamed out and happening to see one of the three men she begged his help for gods sake  the fellow blustered at the chairmen and bid them stop she asked for grosvenorstreet she was to be carried she said to grosvenorstreet  she was just there that fellow said  it cannot be sir it cannot be  dont i see fields all about me  i am in the midst of fields sir  grosvenorsquare madam replied that villain the trees and garden of grosvenorsquare  what a strange way have you come about cried her miscreant and then trod out his flambeaux while another fellow took the chairmens lantern from them and they had only a little glimmering starlight to guide them  she then poor dear soul screamed so dismally that macpherson said it went to his heart to hear her but they followed wilson who told them they were just landed that was his word he led them up a long gardenwalk by a backway one of the three men having got before opened the gardendoor and held it in his hand and by the time they got to the house to which the garden seemed to belong the dear creature ceased screaming  they too well saw the cause when they stopped with her she was in a fit  two women by the assistance of the person in the cloak helped her out with great seeming tenderness they said something in praise of her beauty and expressed themselves concerned for her as if they were afraid she was past recovery which apparently startled the man in the cloak  wilson entered the house with those who carried in the dear creature but soon came out to the chairmen they say the man in the cloak who hung about the villain and hugged him as in joy give the rascal money who then put a guinea into each of their hands and conveyed them through the garden again to the door at which they entered but refused them light even so much as that of their own candle and lantern however he sent another man with them who led them over rough and dirty byways into a path that pointed londonward but plainly so much about with design to make it difficult for them to find out the place again  the other fellow is brought hither he tells exactly the same story  i asked of both what sort of man he in the cloak was but he so carefully muffled himself up and so little appeared to them either walking after them or at the house that i could gain no light from their description  on their promise to be forthcoming i have suffered them to go with lady bettys chairmen to try if they can trace out their own footsteps and find the place  how many hopeless things must a man do in an exigence who knows not what is right to be done  i have enquired of lady betty who it was that told her mr greville was not gone out of town but intended to lie perdue and she named her informant i asked how the discourse came in she owned a little aukwardly i asked whether that lady knew mr greville she could not say whether she did or not  i went to that lady mrs preston in new bondstreet she had her intelligence she told me from sir hargrave pollexfen who had hinted to her that he should take such notice of mr greville as might be attended with consequences and she was the readier to intimate this to lady betty in order to prevent mischief  now mr selby as the intimation that the darklantern figure at the masquerade was mr greville came from sir hargrave and nobody else and we saw nothing of him ourselves how do we know  and yet mr greville intended that we should believe him to be out of town  yet even that intimation came from sir hargrave  and furthermore was it not likely that he would take as much care to conceal himself from sir hargrave as from us  but i will go instantly to sir hargraves house he was to dine at home and with company if i cannot see him if he should be absent  but no more till i return  o mr selby i believe i have wronged mr greville the dear soul i am afraid is fallen into even worse hands than his  i went to sir hargraves house he was not at home he was at home he had company with him he was not to be spoken with these were the different answers given me by his porter with as much confusion as i had impatience and yet it was evident to me that he had his lesson given him in short i have reason to think that sir hargrave came not home all night the man in the cloak i doubt was he now does all that sir john allestree said of the malicious wickedness of this devilish man and his arrogant behavior to our dear miss byron on her rejecting him come fresh into my memory and is she can she be fallen into the power of such a man  rather much rather may my first surmises prove true greville is surely exceptionable as he is a better man at least a betternatured man than this and he can have no thoughts less honorable than marriage but this villian if he be the villian  i cannot i dare not pursue the thought  the four chairmen are just returned they think they have found the place but having gained some intelligence intelligence which distracts me they hurried back for directions  they had asked a neighboring alehousekeeper if there were not a long garden belonging to the house they suspected and a backdoor out of it to a dirty lane and fields he answered in the affirmative the front of this house faces the road  they called for some hot liquors and asked the landlord after the owners he knew nothing of harm of them he said they had lived there near a twelvemonth in reputation the family consisted of a widow whose name is awberry her son and two daughters the son a man of about thirty years of age has a place in the customhouse and only came down on a saturday and went up on monday but an odd circumstance he said had alarmed him that very morning  he was at first a little shy of telling what it was he loved he said to mind his own business what other people did was nothing to him but at last he told them that about six oclock in the morning he was awakened by the trampling of horses and looking out of his window saw a chariotandsix and three or four men on horseback at the widow awberrys door he got up the footmen and coachmen were very hush not calling for a drop of liquor though his doors were open a rare instance he said where there were so many menservants together and a coachman one of them this he said could not but give a greater edge to his curiosity  about seven oclock one of the widows daughters came to the door with a lighted candle in her hand and directed the chariot to drive up close to the house the alehousekeeper then slipped into an arbourlike porch next door to the widows where he had not been three minutes before he saw two persons come to the door the one a tall gentleman in laced clothes who had his arms about the other a person of middling stature wrapped up in a scarlet cloak and resisting as one in great distress the others violence and begging not to be put into the chariot in a voice and accent that evidently showed it was a woman  the gentleman made vehement protestations of honor but lifted the lady into the chariot she struggled and seemed to be in agonies of grief and on being lifted in and the gentleman going in after her she screamed out for help and he observed in the struggling that she had on under her cloak a silverlaced habit the masquerade habit no doubt her screaming grew fainter and fainter and her voice sounded to him as if her mouth were stopped and the gentleman seemed to speak high as if he threatened her  away drove the chariot the servants rode after it  in about half an hour a coach and four came to the widows door the widow and her two daughters went into it and it took the same road  the alehousekeeper had afterward the curiosity to ask the maidservant an ignorant country wench whither her mistresses went so early in the morning she answered they were gone to windsor or that way and would not return she believed in a week  o this damned sir hargrave he has a house upon the forest i have no doubt but he is the villain who knows what injuries the dear creature might have sustained before she was forced into the chariot  god give me patience dear soul her prayers her struggling her crying out for help her mouth stopped  o the villain  i have ordered as many men and horses as two of my friends can furnish me with to be added to two of my own we shall be nine in all to get ready with all speed i will pursue the villain to the worlds end but i will find him  our first course shall be to his house at windsor if we find him not there we will proceed to that bagenhalls near reading  it would be but lesing time were i to go now to paddington and when the vile widow and her daughters are gone from home and only an ignorant wench left what can we learn of her more than is already told to us  i have however accepted lady bettys offer of her stewards going with the two chairmen to get what farther intelligence he can from paddington against my return  i shall take what i have written with me to form from it a letter less hurrying less alarming for your perusal than this that i have written at such snatches of time and under such dreadful uncertainties would be to you were i to send it that is to say if i have time and if i am able to write with any certainty  o that dreaded certainty  at four in the morning the six men i borrow and myself and two of my servants well armed are to rendezvous at hydepark corner it is grievous that another night must pass but so many people cannot be got together as two or three might  my poor wife has made me promise to take the assistance of peaceofficers wherever i find either the villain or the suffering angel  where the road parts we shall divide and enquire at every turnpike and shall agree upon our places of meeting  i am harassed to death but my mind is the greatest sufferer  o my dear mr selby we have tidings  god be praised we have tidings  not so happy indeed as were to be wished yet the dear creature is living and in honorable hands  god be praised  read the enclosed letter directed to me  sir miss byron is in safe and honorable hands  the first moment she could give any account of herself she besought me to quiet your heart and your i adys with this information  she has been cruelly treated  particulars at present she cannot give  she was many hours speechless  but dont fright yourselves her fits though not less frequent are weaker and weaker  the bearer will acquaint you who my brother is to whom you owe the preservation and safety of the loveliest woman in england and he will direct you to a house where you will be welcome with your lady for miss byron cannot be removed to convince yourselves that all possible care is taken of her by sir  your humble servant charlotte grandison friday feb     in fits  has been cruelly treated  many hours speechless  cannot be removed  her solicitude though hardly herself for our ease  dearest dear creature  but you will rejoice with me my cousins that she is in such honorable hands  what i have written must now go i have no time to transcribe  i have sent to my two friends to let them know that i shall not have occasion for their peoples assistance  she is at a noblemans house the earl of l near colnebrooke  my wife harassed and fatigued in mind as she has been on this occasion and poorly in health wanted to go with me but it is best first for me to see how the dear creature is  i shall set out before day on horseback my servant shall carry with him a portmanteau of things ordered by my wife my cousin must have made a strange appearance in her masquerade dress to her deliverer  the honest man who brought the letter he looks remarkably so but had he a less agreeable countenance he would have been received by us as an angel for his happy tidings was but just returned from windsor whither he had been sent early in the morning to transact some business when he was dispatched away to us with the welcome letter he could not therefore be so particular as we wished him what he gathered was from the housekeeper the menservants who were in the fray a fray there was being gone to town with their master but what we learnt from him is briefly as follows  his master is sir charles grandison a gentleman who has not been long in england i have often heard mention of his father sir thomas who died not long ago this honest man knew not when to stop in his masters praise he gives his young lady also an excellent character  sir charles was going to town in his chariotandsix when he met most happily met our distressed cousin  sir hargrave is the villain  i am heartily sorry for suspecting mr greville  sir charles had earnest business in town and he proceeded thither after he had rescued the dear creature and committed her to the care of his sister  god for ever bless him  the vile sir hargrave as the servant understood was wounded sir charles it seems was also hurt thank god it was so slightly as not to hinder him from pursuing his journey to town after the glorious act  i would have given the honest man a handsome gratuity but he so earnestly besought me to excuse him declaring that he was under an obligation to the most generous of masters to decline all gifts that i was obliged to withdraw my hand  i will speed this away by richard fennel i will soon send you farther particulars by the post not unhappy ones i hope  excuse mean time all that is amiss in a letter the greatest part of which was written in such dreadful uncertainty and believe that i will be  ever yours aechibald reeves  letter xxvi mr reeves to george selby esquire sat feb    dear sir i am just returned from visiting my beloved cousin you will be glad of every minute particular as i can give it to you relating to this shocking affair and to her protector and his sister there are not such another brother and sister in england  i got to the hospitable mansion by nine this morning i enquired after miss byrons health and on giving in my name was shown into a handsome parlour elegantly furnished  immediately came down to me a very agreeable young lady miss grandison i gave her a thousand thanks for the honor of her letter and the joyful information it had given me of the safety of one so deservedly dear to us  she must be an excellent young lady answered she i have just left her  you must not see her yet   ah madam said i and looked surprised and grieved i believe   dont affright yourself sir miss byron will do very well but she must be kept quiet she has had a happy deliverance  she   o madam interrupted i your generous your noble brother   is the best of men mr reeves his delight is in doing good  and as to this adventure it has made him i am sure a very happy man  but is my cousin madam so ill that i cannot be allowed to see her for one moment  she is but just come out of a fit she fell into it in the relation she would have made of her story on mentioning the villains name by whom she has suffered she could give only broken and imperfect accounts of herself all day yesterday or you had heard from me sooner when you see her you must be very cautious of what you say to her we have a skilful physician by whose advice we proceed  god for ever bless you madam  he has not long left her he advises quiet she has had a very bad night could she compose herself could she get a little natural rest the cure is performed have you breakfasted sir  breakfasted madam my impatience to see my cousin allowed me not to think of breakfast  you must breakfast with me sir and when that is over if she is tolerable we will acquaint her with your arrival and go up together i read your impatience sir we will make but a very short breakfasting i was just going to breakfast  she rang it was brought in  i longed i said as we sat at tea to be acquainted with the particulars of the happy deliverance  we avoid asking any questions that may affect her i know very little of the particulars myself my brother was in haste to get to town the servants that were with him at the time hardly dismounted he doubted not but the lady to whom he referred me for the gratifying my curiosity would be able to tell me everything but she fell into fits and as i told you was so ill on the recollection of what she had suffered   good god said i what must the dear creature have suffered   that we thought fit to restrain our curiosity and so must you till we see sir charles i expect him before noon  i am told madam that there was a skirmish i hope sir charles   i hope so too mr reeves interrupted she i long to see my brother as much as you can do to see your cousin  but on my apprehensions he assured me upon his honor that he was but very slightly hurt sir charles is no qualifier sir when he stakes his honor be the occasion either light or serious  i said i doubted not but she was very much surprised at a ladys being brought in by sir charles and in a dress so fantastic  i was sir i had not left my chamber but hastened down at the first word to receive and welcome the stranger my maid out of breath burst into my room  sir charles madam beseeches you this moment to come down he has saved a lady from robbers that was her report a very fine lady and is come back with her he begs that you will come down this instant  i was too much surprised at my brothers unexpected return and too much affected with the ladys visible grief and terror to attend to her dress when i first went down she was sitting dreadfully trembling and sir charles next her in a very tender manner assuring her of his and of his sisters kindest protection i saluted her continued the lady welcome welcome thrice welcome to this house and to me   she threw herself on one knee to me distress had too much humbled her sir charles and i raised her to her seat you see before you madam said she a strange creature and looked at her dress but i hope you will believe i am an innocent one this vile appearance was not my choice fie upon me i must be thus dressed out for a masquerade hated diversion i never had a notion of it think not hardly sir turning to sir charles her hands clasped and held up of her whom you have so generously delivered think not hardly of me madam turning to me i am not a bad creature that vile vile man  she could say no more  charlotte said my brother you will make it your first care to raise the spirits of this injured beauty your next to take her directions and inform her friends of her safety such an admirable young lady as this cannot be missed an hour without exciting the fears of all her friends for her i repeat madam that you are in honorable hands my sister will have pleasure in obliging you  she wished to be conveyed to town but looking at her dress i offered her clothes of mine and my brother said if she were very earnest and thought herself able to go he would take horse and leave the chariot and he was sure that i would attend her thither  but before she could declare her acceptance of this offer as she seemed joyfully ready to do her spirits failed her and she sunk down at my feet  sir charles just staid to see her come to herself and then  sister said he the lady cannot be removed let dr holmes be sent for instantly i know you will give her your best attendance i will be with you before noon tomorrow the lady is too low and too weak to be troubled with questions now johnson will be back from windsor let him take her commands to any of her friends adieu dear madam  your cousin sir seemed likely to faint again support yourself repeating you are in safe and honorable hands bowing to her as she bowed in return but spoke not  adieu charlotte and away went the best of brothers  and god almighty bless him said i wherever he goes  miss grandison then told me that the house i was in belonged to the earl of l who had lately married her elder sister about three months ago they set out she said to pay a visit to my lords estate and relations in scotland for the first time and to settle some affairs there they were expected back in a week or fortnight she came down but last tuesday and that in order to give directions for everything to be prepared for their reception it was happy for your cousin said she that i obtained the favor of my brothers company and that he was obliged to be in town this morning he intended to come back to carry me to town this evening we are a family of love mr reeves we are true brothers and sisters  but why do i trouble you with these things now we shall be better acquainted i am charmed with miss byron  she was so good as to hurry the breakfast and when it was over conducted me up stairs she bid me stay at the door and stepped gently to the bedside and opening the curtain i heard the voice of our cousin  dear madam what trouble do i give were her words  still talk of trouble miss byron answered miss grandison with an amiable familiarity you will not forbear  will you promise me not to be surprised at the arrival of your cousin reeves  i do promise  i shall rejoice to see him  miss grandison called to me i approached and catching my cousins heldout hand thank god thank god best beloved of an hundred hearts said i that once more i behold you that once more i see you in safe and honorable hands  i will not tell you what we have all suffered  no dont said she  you need not  but o my cousin i have fallen into the company of angels  forbear gently patting her hand forbear these high flights said the kind lady or i shall beat my charming patient i shall not think you in a way to be quite well till you descend  she whispered me that the doctor had expressed fears for her head if she were not kept quiet then raising her voice your cousins gratitude mr revees is excessive you must allow me smiling to beat her when she is well she shall talk of angels and of what she pleases  but my dear mr selby we who know how her heart overflows with sentiments of gratitude on every common obligation and even on but intentional ones can easily account for the high sense she must have of those she lies under for such a deliverance from the brother and of such kind treatment from the sister both absolute strangers till her distresses threw her into their protection  i will only ask my dear miss byron one question said i forgetting the caution given me below by miss grandison whether this villain by his violence  meant marriage i was going to say but interrupting me you shall not mr reeves said miss grandison smiling ask half a question that may revive disagreeable remembrances is she not alive and here and in a way to be well have patience till she is able to tell you all  my cousin was going to speak my dear said the lady you shall not answer mr reevess question if it be a question that will induce you to look backward at present you must look only forward and are you not in my care and in sir charles grandisons protection  i have done madam said i bowing  the desire of taking vengeance   hush mr revees  surely  smiling and holding her finger to her lip  it is a patients duty said my cousin to submit to the prescriptions of her kind physician but were i ever to forgive the author of my distresses it must be for his being the occasion of bringing me into the knowledge of such a lady and yet to lie under the weight of obligations that i never can return  here she stopped  i took this as a happy indication that the last violence was not offered if it had she would not have mentioned forgiving the author of her distress  as to what you say of obligation miss byron returned miss grandison let your heart answer for mine had you and i changed situation and if on such a supposition you can think that your humanity would have been so extraordinary a matter then shall you be at liberty when you are recovered to say a thousand fine things till when pray be silent on this subject  then turning to me see how much afraid your cousin byron is of lying under obligation i am afraid she has a proud heart has she not a very proud heart mr reeves  she has a very grateful one madam replied i  she turned to my cousin will you miss byron be easy under the obligations you talk of or will you not  i submit to your superiority madam in everything replied my cousin bowing her head  she then asked me if i had let her friends in the country know of this shocking affair  i had suspected mr greville i said and had written in confidence to her uncle selby   o my poor grandmamma  o my good aunt selby and my lucy  i hope   miss grandison interposed humorously interrupting  i will have nothing said that begins with o indeed miss byron mr reeves i will not trust you together  cannot you have patience   we both asked her pardon my cousin desired leave to rise  but these odious clothes said she   if you are well enough child replied miss grandison you shall rise and have no need to see those odious clothes as you call them i told them mrs reeves had sent her some of her clothes the portmanteau was ordered to be brought up  then miss grandison sitting down on the bed by my cousin took her hand and feeling her pulse are you sure my patient that you shall not suffer if you are permitted to rise will you be calm serene easy will you banish curiosity will you endeavor to avoid recollection  i will do my endeavor answered my cousin  miss grandison then rung and a maidservant coming up jenny said she pray give your best assistance to my lovely patient but be sure dont let her hurry her spirits i will lead mr reeves into my dressing room and when you are dressed my dear we will either return to you here or expect you to join us there at your pleasure  and then she obligingly conducted me into her dressing room and excused herself for refusing to let us talk of interesting subjects i am rejoiced said she to find her more sedate and composed than hitherto she has been her head has been greatly in danger her talk for some hours when she did talk was so wild and incoherent and she was so full of terror on every ones coming in her sight that i would not suffer anybody to attend her but myself  i left her not continued miss grandison till eleven and the housekeeper and my maid sat up in her room all the rest of the night  i arose before my usual time to attend her i slept not well myself i did nothing but dream of robbers rescues and murders such an impression had the distress of this young lady made on my mind  they made me a poor report proceeded she of the night she had passed and as i told you she fainted away this morning a little before you came on her endeavoring to give me some account of her affecting story  let me tell you mr reeves i am as curious as you can be to know the whole of what has befallen her but her heart is tender and delicate her spirits are low and we must not pull down with one hand what we build up with the other my brother also will expect a good account of my charge  i blessed her for her goodness and finding her desirous of knowing all that i could tell her of our cousins character family and lovers i gave her a brief history which extremely pleased her good god said she what a happiness is it that such a lady in such a distress should meet with a man as excellent and as much admired as herself my brother mr reeves can never marry but he must break half a score hearts forgive me that i bring him in whenever any good person or thing or action is spoken of everybody i believe who is strongly possessed of a subject makes everything seen heard or read of that bears the least resemblance turn into and illustrate that subject  but here i will conclude this letter in order to send it by the post besides i have been so much fatigued in body and mind and my wife has also been so much disturbed in her mind that i must give way to a call of rest  i will pursue the subject the now agreeable subject in the morning and perhaps shall dispatch what i shall farther write as you must be impatient for it by an especial messenger  sir rowland was here twice yesterday and once today my wife caused him to be told that miss byron by a sudden call has been obliged to go a little way out of town for two or three days  he proposes to set out for caermarthen the beginning of next week he hoped he should not be denied taking his corporal leave of her  if our cousin has a good day tomorrow and no return of her fits she proposes to be in town on monday i am to wait on her and sir charles and his sister at breakfast on monday morning and to attend her home where there will be joy indeed on her arrival  pray receive for yourself and make for me to your lady and all friends my compliments of congratulation  i have not had either leisure or inclination to enquire after the villain who has given us all this disturbance  ever ever yours archibald revees saturday night letter xxvii from mr reeves to george selby esquire in continuation miss grandison went to my cousin to see how she bore rising supposing her near dressed  she soon returned to me the most charming woman i think said she i ever saw but she trembles so that i have persuaded her to lie down i answered for you that you would stay dinner  i must beg excuse madam i have an excellent wife she loves miss byron as her life she will be impatient to know   well well well say no more mr reeves my brother has redeemed one prisoner and his sister has taken another and glad you may be that it is no worse  i bowed and looked silly i believe  you may look and beg and pray mr reeves when you know me better you will find me a very whimsical creature but you must stay to see sir charles would you go home to your wife with half your errand she will not thank you for that i can tell you let her be as good a woman as the best but to comfort you we give not into every modern fashion we dine earlier than most people of our condition my brother though in the main above singularity will nevertheless in things he thinks right be governed by his own rules which are the laws of reason and convenience you are on horseback and were i you such good news as i should have to carry considering what might have happened would give me wings and make me fly through the air with it  i was about to speak come come i will have no denial interrupted she i shall have a double pleasure if you are present when sir charles comes on hearing his account of what happened you are a good man and have a reasonable quantity of wonder and gratitude to heighten a common case into the mavelous so sit down and be quiet  i was equally delighted and surprised at her humorous raillery but could not answer a single word if it be midnight before you will suffer me to depart thought i i will not make another objection  while this amiable lady was thus entertaining me we heard the trampling of horses  my brother said she i hope  he comes pardon the fondness of a sister who speaks from sensible effects  a father and a brother in one  sir charles entered the room he addressed himself to me in a most polite manner mr reeves said he as i understand from below  then turning to his sister excuse me charlotte i heard this worthy gentleman was with you and i was impatient to know how my fair guest   miss byron is in a good way i hope interrupted she but very weak and lowspirited she arose and dressed but i have prevailed on her to lie down again  then turning to me with a noble air he both welcomed and congratulated me  sir charles grandison is indeed a fine figure he is in the bloom of youth i dont know that i have ever seen an handsomer or genteeler man well might his sister say that if he married he would break half a score hearts o this vile pollexfen thought i at the moment could he draw upon has he hurt such a man as this  after pouring out my acknowlegements in the name of several families as well as my own i could not but enquire into the nature of the hurt he had received  a very trifle  my coat only was hurt mr reeves the skin of my left shoulder raked a little putting his hand upon it  thank god said i thank god said miss grandison  but so near  o the villain what might it have been   sir hargrave pent up in a chariot had great disadvantage my reflections on the event of yesterday yield me the more pleasure as i have on enquiry understood that he will do well again if he will be ruled i would not on any account have had his instant death to answer for but no more of this just now give me the particulars of the young ladys state of health i left her in a very bad way  you had advice  miss grandison gave her brother an account of all that had been done and of everything that had passed since he went away as also of the character and excellencies of the lady whom he had rescued  i confirmed what she said in my cousins favor and he very gratefully thanked his sister for her care as a man would do for one the nearest and dearest to him  we then besought him to give an account of the glorious action which had restored to all that knew her the darling of our hearts  i will relate all he said in the first person as nearly in his own words as possible and will try to hit the coolness with which he told the agreeable story  you know sister said he the call i had to town it was happy that i yielded to your importunity to attend you hither  about two miles on this side hounslow i saw a chariotandsix driving at a great rate i also had ordered jerry to drive pretty fast  the coachman seemed inclined to dispute the way with mine this occasioned a few moments stop to both i ordered my coachman to break the way i dont love to stand upon trisles my horses were fresh i had not come far  the curtain of the chariot we met was pulled down i saw not who was in it but on turning out of the way i knew by the arms it was sir hargrave pollexfens  there was in it a gentleman who immediately pulled up the canvas  i saw however before he drew it up another person wrapped up in a mans scarlet cloak  for gods sake help help cried out the person for gods sake help  i ordered my coachman to stop  drive on said the gentleman cursing his coachman drive on when i bid you  help again cried she but with a voice as if her mouth was half stopped  i called to my servants on horseback to stop the postition of the other chariot and i bid sir hargraves coachman proceed at his peril  sir hargrave called out on the contrary side of the chariot his canvas being still up on that next me with vehement execrations to drive on  i alighted and went round to the other side of the chariot  again the lady endeavored to cry out i saw sir hargrave struggle to pull over her mouth an handkerchief which was tied round her head he swore outrageously  the moment she beheld me she spread out both her hands for gods sake   sir hargrave pollexfen said i by the arms  you are engaged i doubt in a very bad affair  i am sir hargrave pollexfen and am carrying a fugitive wife  your own wife sir hargrave   yes by g  said be and she was going to elope from me at a damned masquerade  see drawing aside the cloak detected in the very dress  o no no no said the lady   proceed coachman said he and cursed and swore   let me ask the lady a question sir hargrave  you are impertinent sir who the devil are you  are you madam lady pollexfen said i  o no no no  was all she could say   two of my servants came about me a third held the head of the horse on which the postilion sat  three of sir hargraves approached on their horses but seemed as if afraid to come too near and parleyd together  have an eye to those fellows said i some base work is on foot you will presently be aided by passengers sirrah said i to the coachman forhelashd the horses on proceed at your peril  sir hargrave then with violent curses and threatenings ordered him to drive over every one that opposed him  coachman proceed at your peril said i madam will you   o sir sir sir relieve help me for gods sake i am in a villains hands tricked vilely tricked into a villains hands help help for gods sake  do you said i to frederick cut the traces if you cannot otherwise stop this chariot bid jerry cut the reins and then seize as many of those fellows as you can leave sir hargrave to me  the lady continued screaming and crying out for help  sir hargrave drew his sword which he had held between his knees in the scabbard and then called upon his servants to fire at all that opposed his progress  my servants sir hargrave have firearms as well as yours they will not dispute my orders dont provoke me to give the word  then addressing the lady will you madam put yourself into my protection  o yes yes yes with my whole heart  dear good sir protect me  i opened the chariotdoor sir hargrave made a pass at me take that and be damned to you for your insolence scoundrel said he  i was aware of his thurst and put it by but his sword a little raked my shoulder  my sword was in my hand but undrawn  the chariotdoor remaining open i was not so ceremonious as to let down the footstep to take the gentleman out i seized him by the collar before he could recover himself from the pass he had made at me and with a jerk and a kind of twist laid him under the hindwheel of his chariot  i wrenchd his sword from him and snappd it and flung the two pieces over my head  his coachman cried out for his master mine threatened his if he stirred the postilion was a boy my servant had made him dismount before he joined the other two whom i had ordered aloud to endeavor to seize but my view was only to terrify wretches who knowing the badness of their cause were before terrified  sir hargraves mouth and face were very bloody i believe i might hurt him with the pommel of my sword  one of his legs in his sprawling had got between the spokes of his chariotwheel i thought that was a fortunate circumstance for preventing further mischief and charged his coachman not to stir with the chariot for his masters sake  he cried out cursed and swore i believe he was bruised with the fall the jerk was violent so little able to support an offense sir hargrave upon his own principles should not have been so ready to give it  i had not drawn my sword i hope i never shall be provoked to do it in a private quarrel i should not however have scrupled to draw it on such an occasion as this had there been an absolute necessity for it  the lady though greatly terrified had disengaged herself from the mans cloak i had not leisure to consider her dress but i was struck with her figure and more with her terror  i offered my hand i thought not now of the footstep any more than i did before she not of anything as it seemed but her deliverance  have you not read mr reeves pliny i think gives the relation of a frighted bird that pursued by an hawk flew for protection into the bosom of a man passing by  in like manner your lovely cousin the moment i returned to the chariotdoor instead of accepting of my offered hand threw herself into my arms  o save me save me  she was ready to faint she could not i believe have stood  i carried the lovely creature round sir hargraves horses and seated her in my chariot be assured madam said i that you are in honorable hands i will convey you to my sister who is a young lady of honor and virtue  she looked out at one window then at the other in visible terror as if fearing still sir hargrave fear nothing said i i will attend you in a moment i shut the chariotdoor  i then went backward a few paces keeping however the lady in my eye to see what had become of my servants  it seems that at their first coming up pretty near with sir hargraves horsemen they presented their pistols  what shall we do wilkins or wilson or some such name said one of sir hargraves men to another all three of them on their defense fly for it answered the fellow we may swing for this i see our master down there may be murder  their consciences put them to slight  my servants pursued them a little way but were returning to support their master just as i had put the lady into my chariot  i saw sir hargrave at a distance on his legs supported by his coachman he limped leaned his whole weight upon his servant and seemed to be in agonies  i bid one of my servants tell him who i was  he cursed me and threatened vengeance he cursed my servants and still more outrageously his own scoundrels as he called them  i then stepped back to my chariot  miss byron had through terror sunk down at the bottom of it where she lay panting and could only say on my approach save me save me  i reassured her i listed her on the seat and brought her to my sister and what followed i suppose charlotte bowing to her you have told mr reeves  we were both about to break out in grateful applauses but sir charles as if designing to hinder us proceeded  you see mr reeves what an easy conquest this was you see what a small degree of merit falls to my share the violators conscience was against him the consciences of his fellows were on my side my own servants are honest worthy men they love their master in a good cause i would set any three of them against six who were engaged in a bad one vice is the greatest coward in the world when it knows it will be resolutely opposed and what have good men engaged in a right cause to fear  what an admirable man is sir charles grandison  thus thinking thus acting  i explained to sir charles who this wilson was whom the others consulted and were directed by and what an implement in this black transaction  to what other mans protection in the world mr selby could our kinswoman have been obliged and so little mischief followed  sir hargrave it seems returned back to town what a recreant figure my dear mr selby must he make even to himself  a villain  sir charles says that the turnpikemen at smallbury green told his servants on their attending him to town after the happy rescue a formidable story of a robbery committed a little beyond hounslow by half a dozen villains on horseback upon a gentleman in a chariot and six which had passed through that turnpike but half an hour before he was a tacked and that the gentleman about an hour and half before sir charles went through returned to town wounded for advice and they heard him groan as he passed through the turnpike  i should add one circumstance said sir charles do you know charlotte that you have a rake for your brother  a man on horseback it seems came to the turnpikegate whilst the turnpikemen were telling my servants this story nothing in the world said he but two young rakes in their chariotsandsix one robbing the other of a lady i and two other passengers added the man stood aloof to see the issue of the affair we expected mischief and some there was one of the bystanders was the better for the fray for he took up a silverhilted sword broken in two pieces and rode off with it  sir hargrave said sir charles smiling might well give out that he was robbed to lose such a prize as miss byron and his sword besides  i asked sir charles if it were not advisable to take measures with the villain  he thought it best he said to take as little notice of the affair as possible unless the aggressor stirred in it masquerades added he are not creditable places for young ladies to be known to be insulted at them they are diversions that fall not in with the genius of the english commonalty scandal will have something to say from that circumstance however causeless but miss byrons story told by herself will enable you to resolve upon your future measures  so sir charles seems not to be a friend to masquerades  i think were i to live an hundred years i never would go to another had it not been for lady betty  she has indeed too gay a turn for a woman of forty and a mother of children miss byron i dare say will be afraid of giving the lead to her for the future but excepting my wife and self nobody in town has suffered more than lady betty on this occasion indeed she is i must say an obliging wellmeaning woman and she also declares so much has she been affected with miss byrons danger of which she takes herself to be the innocent cause that she will never again go to a masquerade  i long to have miss byrons account of this horrid affair  god grant that it may not be such a one as will lay us under a necessity  but as our cousin has a great notion of female delicacy  i know not what i would say  we must have patience a little while longer  miss grandisons eyes shone with pleasure all the time her brother was giving his relation  i can only say my brother said she when he had done that you have rescued an angel of a woman and you have made me as happy by it as yourself  i have a generous sister mr reeves said sir charles  till i knew my brother mr reeves as i now know him i was an inconsiderate unreflecting girl good and evil which immediately affected not my self were almost alike indifferent to me but he has awakened in me a capacity to enjoy the true pleasure that arises from a benevolent action  depreciate not my charlotte your own worth absence mr reeves endears i have been long abroad not much above a year returned but when you know us better you will find i have a partial sister  mr reeves will not then think me so but i will go and see how my fair patient does  she went accordingly to my cousin  o sir charles said i what an admirable woman is miss grandison  my sister charlotte mr reeves is indeed an excellent woman i think myself happy in her but i tell her sometimes that i have still a more excellent sister and it is no small instance of charlottes greatness of mind that she herself will allow me to say so  just then came in the ladies the two charming creatures entered together miss grandison supporting my trembling cousin but she had first acquainted her that she would find sir charles in her dressing room  she looked indeed lovely though wan at her first entrance but a fine glow overspread her cheeks at the sight of her deliverer  sir charles approached her with an air of calmness and serenity for fear of giving her emotion she cast her eyes upon him with a look of the most respectful gratitude  i will not oppress my fair guest with many words but permit me to congratulate you as i hope i may on your recovered spirits  allow me madam   and he took her almost motionless hand and conducted her to an easy chair that had been set for her she sat down and would have said something but only bowed to sir charles to miss grandison and me and reclined her head against the check of the chair  miss grandison held her salts to her  she took them into her own hands and smelling to them raised her head a little forgive me madam pardon me sir  o my cousin to me  how can i  so oppressed with obligations  such goodness  no words  my gratitude  my full heart   and then she again reclined her head as giving up hopelesly the effort she made to express her gratitude  you must not madam said sir charles sitting down by her overrate a common benefit  dear miss byron permit me to address myself to you as of long acquaintance by what mr reeves has told my sister and both have told me i must think yesterday one of the happiest days of my life i am sorry that our acquaintance has begun so much at your cost but you must let us turn this evil appearance into real good i have two sisters the world produces not more worthy women let me henceforth boast that i have three and shall i not then have reason to rejoice in the event that has made so lovely an addition to my family  then taking her passive hand with the tenderness of a truly affectionate brother consoling a sister in calamity and taking his sisters and joining both shall i not madam present my charlotte to a sister and will you not permit me to claim as a brother under that relation  our miss byrons christian name mr reeves  harriet sir  my sister harriet receive and acknowledge your charlotte my charlotte   miss grandison arose and saluted my cousin who looked at sir charles with reverence as well as gratitude at miss grandison with delight and at me with eyes lifted up and after a little struggle for speech how shall i bear this goodness said she  this indeed is bringing good out of evil  did i not say my cousin that i was fallen into the company of angels  i was afraid she would have fainted  we must endeavor mr reeves said sir chales to me to lessen the sense our miss byron has of her past danger in order to bring down to reasonable limits the notion she has of her obligation for a common relief  miss grandison ordered a few drops on sugar  you must be orderly my sister harriet said she am i not your elder sister my elder sister makes me do what she pleases  oh madam said my cousin   call me not madam call me your charlotte my brother has given me and himself a sister  will you not own me  how can an heart bowed down by obligation and goodness never to be returned rise to that lovely familiarity by which the obligers so generously distinguish themselves my lips and my heart i will be so bold as to say ever went together but how  and yet so sweetly invited my  my  my charlotte withdrawing her hand from sir charles and clasping both her arms round miss grandisons neck the two worthi bosoms of the sex joining as one take your harriet person and mind  may i be found worthy on proof of all this goodness  lady betty has just left us i read to her what i have written since my visit to colnebrooke she shall not she says recover her eyes for a week to come  the women mr selby are ever looking forward on certain occasions lady betty and my wife extended their wishes so far as that they might be able to call miss grandison and our miss byron sisters but by a claim that should exclude sir charles as a brother to one of them  should sir charles  but no more on this subject  yet one word more when the ladies had mentioned it i could not help thinking that this graceful and truly fine gentleman seems to be the only man whom our cousin has yet seen that would meet with no great difficulty from her on such an application  but sir charles has a great estate and still greater expectations from my lord w his sister says he would break half a score hearts were he to marry  so for that matter would our miss byron but once more  not another word however on this subject  i stayed to dine with this amiable brother and sister my cousin exerted herself to go down and sat at table for one halfhour but changing countenance once or twice as she sat miss grandison would attend her up and make her lie down i took leave of her at her quitting the table  on monday i hope to see her once more among us  if our dear miss byron cannot write you will perhaps have one letter more my dear mr selby from  your everaffectionate archibald reeves my servant is this moment returned with your letter indeed my dear mr selby there are two or three passages in it that would have cut me to the heart see letter xxiv p      had not the dear creature been so happily restored to our hopes    letter xxviii mr reeves in continuation monday night feb  0 i will write one more letter my dear cousin selby and then i will give up my pen to our beloved cousin  i got to colnebrooke by nine this morning i had the pleasure to find our miss byron recovered beyond my hopes she had a very good night on saturday and all sunday she said was a cordial day to her from morning till night and her night was quiet and happy  miss grandison staid at home yesterday to keep my cousin company sir charles passed the greatest part of the day in the library the two ladies were hardly ever separated my cousin expresses herself in raptures whenever she speaks of this brother and sister miss grandison she says and indeed every one must see it is one of the frankest and most communicative of women sir charles appears to be one of the most unreserved of men as well as one of the most polite he makes not his guests uneasy with his civilities but you see freedom and ease in his whole deportment and the stranger cannot doubt but sir charles will be equally pleased with freedom and ease in return i had an encouraging proof of the justness of this observation this morning from him as we sat at breakfast i had expressed myself occasionally in such a manner as showed more respect than freedom my dear mr reeves said he kindred minds will be intimate at first sight receive me early into the list of your friends i have already numbered you among mine i should think amiss of myself if so good a man as i am assured mr reeves is should by his distance show a diffidence of me that would not permit his mind to mingle with mine  miss grandison my cousin says put her on relateing to her her whole history and the histories of the several persons and families to whom she is related  miss byron concluding as well as i that sir charles would rather take his place in the coach than go on horseback to town and being so happily recovered as not to give us apprehension about her bearing tolerably the little journey i kept my horse in our return and sir charles went in the coach this motion coming from miss byron i raillied her upon it when i got her home but she will not forgive me if she knows that i told you whose the motion was and yet the dear creatures eyes sparkled with pleasure when she had carried her point  i was at home near half an hour before the coach arrived and was a welcome guest  my dear mrs reeves told me she had expected our arrival before dinner and hoped sir charles and his sister would dine with us i hoped so too i told her  i found there lady betty and miss clements a favorite of us all both impatiently waiting to see my cousin  dont be jealous mr reeves said my wife if after what i have heard of sir charles grandison and what he has done for us i run to him with open arms  i give you leave my dear to love him replied i and to express your love in what manner you please  i have no doubt said lady betty that i shall break my heart if sir charles takes not very particular notice of me  he shall have my prayers as well as my praises said miss clements  she is acquainted with the whole shocking affair  when the coach stopped and the bell rung the servants contended who should first run to the door i welcomed them at the coach sir charles handed out miss byron i miss grandison sally said my cousin to her raptured maid take care of mrs jenny  sir charles was received by mrs reeves as i expected she was almost speechless with joy he saluted her but i think as i tell her the first motion was hers he was then obliged to go round and my cousin i do assure you looked as if she would not wish to have been neglected  as soon as the ladies could speak they poured out their blessings and thanks to him and to miss grandison whom with a most engaging air he presented to each lady and she as engagingly saluted her sister harriet by that tender relation and congratulated them and miss byron and herself upon it kindly bespeaking a family relation for herself through her dear miss byron were her words  when we were seated my wife and lady betty wanted to enter into the particulars of the happy deliverance in praise of the deliverer but sir charles interrupting them my dear mrs reeves said he you cannot be too careful of this jewel everything may be trusted to her own discretion but how can we well blame the man who would turn thief for so rich a treasure i do assure you my sister harriet do you know mrs reeves that i have found my third sister was she not stolen from us in her cradle that if sir hargrave will repent i will forgive him for the sake of the temptation  mrs reeves was pleased with this address and has talked of it since  i never can forgive him sir said miss byron were it but   that he has laid you under such an obligation said miss grandison patting her hand with her fan as she sat over against her but hush child you said that before  and then turning to mrs reeves has not our newfound sister a very proud heart mrs reeves  and dearest miss grandison replied my smiling delighted cousin did you not ask that question before  i did child i did but not of mrs reeves  a compromise however  do you talk no more of obligation and i will talk no more of pride  charlotte justly chides her harriet said sir charles what must the man have been that had declined his aid in a distress so alarming not one word more therefore upon this subject  we were all disappointed that this amiable brother and sister excused themselves from dining with us all i mean of our own family for lady betty and miss clements not being able to stay were glad they did not  they took leave amidst a thousand grateful blessings and acknowlegements miss grandison promising to see her sister harriet very soon again and kindly renewing her wishes of intimacy  when they went away there goes your heart miss byron said mrs reeves  true answered miss byron if my heart have no place in it for anything but gratitude as i believe it has not  miss grandison added she is the most agreeable of women   and sir charles rejoined mrs reeves archly is the most disagreeable of men  forbear cousin replied miss byron and blushed  well well said lady betty you need not my dear be ashamed if it be so  indeed you need not joined in miss clements i never saw a finer man in my life such a lover if one might have him   if if  replied miss byron  but till if is out of the question should there not be such a thing as discretion miss clements  no doubt of it returned that young lady and if it be to be shown by any woman on earth where there is such a man as this in the question and in such circumstances it must be by miss byron  miss byron was not so thoroughly recovered but that her spirits began to stag we made her retire and at her request excused her coming down to dinner  i told you i had accepted of the offer made by lady betty when we were in dreadful uncertainty that her steward should make further enquiries about the people at paddington nothing worth mentioning has occurred from those enquiries except confirming that the widow and her daughters are not people of bad characters in all likelihood they thought they should entitle themselves to the thanks of all miss byrons friends when the marriage was completed with a man of sir hargraves fortune  the messenger that i sent to enquire after that bagenhalls character has informed us that it is a very profligate one and that he is an intimate of sir hargrave but no more is necessary now god be praised to be said of him  the vile wretch himself i hear keeps his room and it is whispered that he is more than halfcrazed insomuch that his very attendants are afraid to go near him we know not the nature of his hurt but hurt he is though in a fair way of recovery he threatens it seems destruction to sir charles the moment he is able to go abroad god preserve one of the worthiest and best of men  sir hargrave has turned off all the servants we are told that attended him on his shocking but happilydisappointed enterprise  miss byron intends to write to her lucy by tomorrows post if she continue mending an ample account of all that she suffered from the date of her last letter to the hour of her happy deliverance i am to give her minutes to the best of my recollection of what i have written to you that so the account may be as complete as possible and that she may write no more than is consistent with the series which she is required to preserve she begins this evening she bids me tell you that you may be as little a while in suppense about her as possible but if she cannot finish by tomorrow night she will have an opportunity to dispatch her letter on wednesday by a servant of mr grevilles whom he left in town with some commissions and who promises to call for anything we may have to send to selbyhouse  sir rowland  but let my cousin write to you upon that and other matters she knows what to say on that subject better than i do  mean time i heartily congratulate every one of the dear family upon the return and safety of the darling of so many hearts and remain dear mr selby  your most faithful and obedient servant archibald reeves  letter xxix miss byron to miss selby monday feb  0 is it again given me to write to you my lucy and in you to all my revered friends to write with cheerfulness to call upon you all to rejoice with me  god be praised  what dangers have i escaped how have my head and my heart been affected i dare not as yet think of the anguish you all endured for me  with what wretched levity did i conclude my last letter giddy creature that i was vain and foolish  but let me begin my sad story your impatience all this while must be too painful only let me premise that gaily as i boasted when i wrote to you so conceitedly as it might seem of my dress and of conquests and i know not what nonsense i took no pleasure at the place in the shoals of fools that swam after me i despised myself and them despised i was shocked at both  two lucisers were among them but the worst the very worst lucifer of all appeared in a harlequin dress he hopped and skipt and played the fool about me and at last told me he knew miss byron and that he was as he called himself the despised the rejected sir hargrave pollexfen  he behaved however with complaisance and i had no apprehension of what i was to suffer from his villainy  mr reeves has told you that he saw me into the chair provided for me by my vile new servant o my lucy one branch of my vanity is entirely lopt off i must pretend to some sort of skill in physiognomy never more will i for this fellows sake presume to depend on my judgment of peoples hearts framed from their countenances  mr reeves has told you everything about the chair and the chairmen how can i describe the misgivings of my heart when i first began to suspect treachery but when i undrew the curtains and found myself further deluded by another false heart whose help i implored and in the midst of fields and soon after the lights put out i pierced the night air with my screams till i could scream no more i was taken out in fits and when i came a little to my senses i found myself on a bed three women about me one at my head holding a bottle to my nose my nostrils sore with hartshorn and a strong smell of burnt feathers but no man near me  where am i who are you madam and who are you where am i were the questions i first asked  the women were a mother and two daughters the mother answered you are not in bad hands  god grant you say truth said i  no harm is intended you only to make you one of the happiest of women we would not be concerned in a bad action  i hope not i hope not let me engage your pity madam you seem to be a mother these young gentlewomen i presume are your daughters save me from ruin i beseech you madam save me from ruin as you would your daughters  these young women are my daughters they are sober and modest women no ruin is intended you one of the richest and noblest men in england is your admirer he dies for you he assures me that he intends honorable marriage to you you are not engaged he says and you must and you shall be his you may save murder madam if you consent he resolves to be the death of any lover whom you encourage  this must be the vile contrivance of sir hargrave pollexsen immediately cried i out is it not is it not tell me i beg of you to tell me  i arose and sat on the bedside and at that moment in came the vile vile sir hargrave  i screamed out he threw himself at my feet i reclined my head on the bosom of the elderly person and by hartshorn and water they had much ado to keep me out of a fit had he not withdrawn had he kept in my sight i should certainly have fainted but holding up my head and seeing only the women i revived and began to pray to beg to offer rewards if they would facilitate my escape or procure my safety but then came in again the hated man  i beg of you miss byron said he with an air of greater haughtiness than before to make yourself easy and hear what i have to say it is in your own choice in your own power to be what you please and to make me what you please do not therefore needlessly terrify yourself you see i am a determined man ladies you may withdraw   not and leave me here  and as they went out i pushed by the mother and between the daughters and followed the foremost into the parlour and then sunk down on my knees wrapping my arms about her o save me save me said i  the vile wretch entered i left her and kneeled to him i knew not what i did i remember i said wringing my hands if you have mercy if you have compassion let me now now i beseech you sir this moment experience your mercy  he gave them some motion i suppose to withdraw for by that time the widow and the other daughter were in the parlour and they all three retired  i have besought you madam and on my knees too to show me mercy but none would you show me inexorable miss byron kneel if you will in your turn kneel supplicate pray you cannot be more in earnest than i was now are the tables turned  barbarous man said i rising from my knees my spirit was raised but it as instantly subsided i beseech you sir hargrave in a quite frantic way wringing my hands and coming near him and then running to the window and then to the door without meaning to go out at either had they been open for whither could i go and then again to him be not i beseech you sir hargrave cruel to me i never was cruel to anybody you know i was civil to you i was very civil   yes yes and very determined you called me no names i call you none miss byron you were very civil hitherto i have not been uncivil but remember madam  but sweet and everadorable creature and he clasped his arms about me your very terror is beautiful i can enjoy your terror madam  and the savage would have kissed me my averted head frustrated his intention and at his feet i besought him not to treat the poor creature whom he had so vilely betrayed with indignity  i dont hit your fancy madam  can you be a malicious man sir hargrave  you dont like my morals madam  and is this the way sir hargrave are these the means you take to convince me that i ought to like them  well madam you shall prove the mercy in me you would not show you shall see that i cannot be a malicious man a revengeful man and yet you have raised my pride you shall find me a moral man  then sir hargrave will i bless you from the bottom of my heart  but you know what will justify me in every eye for the steps i have taken be mine madam be legally mine i offer you my honest hand consent to be lady pollexfen  no punishment i hope  or take the consequence  what sir justify by so poor so very poor a compliance steps that you have so basely taken  take my life sir but my hand and my heart are my own they never shall be separated  i arose from my knees trembling and threw myself upon the windowseat and wept bitterly  he came to me i looked on this side and on that wishing to avoid him  you cannot fly madam you are securely mine and mine still more securely you shall be dont provoke me dont make me desperate by all that is good and holy   he cast his eyes at my feet then at my face then threw himself at my feet and embraced my knees with his odious arms  i was terrified i screamed in ran one of the daughters  good sir pray sir  did you not say you would be honorable  her mother followed her in  sir sir in my house   thank god thought i the people here are better than i had reason to apprehend the were but o my lucy they seemed to believe that marriage would make amends for every outrage  here let me conclude this letter i have a great deal more to say  letter xxx miss byron in continuation what a plague said the wretch to the women do you come in for i thought you knew your own sex better than to mind a womans squalling they are always ready said the odious fellow to put us in mind of the occasion we ought to give them for crying out i have not offered the least rudeness   i hope not sir i hope my house  so sweet a creature   dear blessed blessed women frantic with terror and mingled joy to find myself in better hands than i expected  standing up and then sitting down i believe at every sentence protect me save me be my advocate indeed i have not deserved this treacherous treatment indeed i am a good sort of body i scarce knew what i said all my friends love me they will break their hearts if any mishap besal me they are all good people you would love them dearly if you knew them sir hargrave may have better and richer wives than i pray prevail upon him to spare me to my friends for their sake i will forgive him for all he has done  nay dear lady if sir hargrave will make you his lawful and true wife there can be no harm done surely  i will i will mrs awberry said he i have promised and i will perform but if she stand in her own light  she expects nothing from my morals  if she stand in her own light and looked fiercely   god protect me said i god protect me  the gentleman is without sir said the woman o how my heart at that moment seemed to be at my throat what gentleman thought i some one come to save me  o no   and instantly entered the most horriblelooking clergyman that i ever behld  this as near as i can recollect is his description  a vast tall bigboned splayfooted man a shabby gown as shabby a wig an huge red pimply face and a nose that hid half of it when he looked on one side and he seldom looked fore right when i saw him he had a dogseared common prayer book in his hand which once had been gilt opened horrid sight at the page of matrimony  yet i was so intent upon making a friend when a man a clergyman appeared that i heeded not at his entrance his frightful visage as i did afterward i pushed by sir hargrave turning him half round with my vehemence and made mrs awberry totter and throwing myself at the clergymans feet man of god said i my hands clasped and held up man of god gentleman worthy man  a good clergyman must be all this  if ever you had children save a poor creature basely tricked away from all her friends innocent thinking no harm to anybody i would not hurt a worm i love everybody  save me from violence give not your aid to sanctify a base action  the man snuffled his answer through his nose when he opened his pouched mouth the tobacco hung about his great yellow teeth he squinted upon me and took my clasped hands which were buried in his huge hand rise madam kneel not to me no harm is intended you one question only who is that gentleman before me in the silverlaced clothes what is his name   he is sir hargrave pollexsen sir a wicked a very wicked man for all he looks

hargraves great estate  what are riches to me dirt dirt dirt i hate them they cannot purchase peace of mind i want not riches  they pleaded his honorable love  i my invincible aversion  he was a handsome man  the most odious in my eyes of the human species never never should my consent be had to sanctify such a baseness  my danger and that they should not be able to save me from worse

vile debasement said i  to exalt miss byron into lady pollexfen and yet if you hold not out your hand to me   he would have snatched my hand i put it behind me he would have snatched the other i put that behind me too and the vile wretch would then have kissed my undefended neck but with both my hands i pushed his audacious forehead from me charming creature he called me with passion in his look and accent then cruel proud ungrateful and swore by his maker that if i would not give my hand instantly instead of exalting me he would humble me ladies pray withdraw said he leave her to me either lady pollexfen or what i please rearing himself proudly up she may be happy if she will leave her to me  pray sir said the youngest of the two daughters and wept for me  greatly hurt indeed to be the wife of a man of my fortune and consequence but leave her to me i say  i will soon bring down her pride what a devil am i to creep beg pray entreat and only for a wife but madam said the insolent wretch you will be mine upon easier terms perhaps  madam pray madam said the widow to me consider what you are about and whom you refuse can you have a handsomer man can you have a man of a greater fortune sir hargrave means nothing but what is honorable you are in his power   in his power madam returned i i am in yours you are mistress of this house i claim the protection of it have you not neighbors your protection i put myself under then clasping my arms about her lock me up from him till you can have help to secure to you the privilege of your own house and deliver me safe to my friends and i will share my fortune with your two daughters  the wicked man took the mother and youngest daughter each by her hand after he had disengaged the former from my clasping arms and led them to the door the elder followed them of her own accord they none of them struggled against going i begged prayed besought them not to go and when they did would have thrust myself out with them but the wretch in shutting them out squeezed me dreadfully as i was half in half out and my nose gushed out with blood  i screamed he seemed frighted but instantly recovering myself  so so you have done your worst  you have killed me i hope i was out of breath my stomach was very much pressed and one of my arms was bruised i have the marks still for he clapped to the door with violence not knowing to do him justice that i was so forward in the doorway  i was in dreadful pain i talked half wildly i remember i threw myself in a chair  so so you have killed me i hope  well now i hope now i hope you are satisfied now may you moan over the poor creature you have destroyed for he expressed great tenderness and consternation and i for my part felt such pains in my bosom that having never felt such before i really thought i was bruised to death repeating my foolish so so  but i forgive you said i  only sir call to the gentlewomen sir  retire sir let me have my own sex only about me my head swam my eyes failed me and i fainted quite away  letter xxxii miss byron in continuation i understood afterward that he was in the most dreadful consternation he had fastened the door upon me and himself and for a few moments was not enough present to himself to open it yet crying out upon his god to have mercy upon him and running about the room the women hastily rapped at the door then he ran to it opened it cursed himself and besought them to recover me if possible  they said i had death in my face they lamented over me my nose had done bleeding but careful of his own safety in the midst of his terror he took my bloody handkerchief if i did not recover he said that should not appear against him and he hastened into the next room and thrust it into the fire by which were sitting it seems the minister and his helper over some burnt brandy  o gentlemen cried the wretch nothing can be done to night take this and gave them money the lady is in a sit i wish you well home  the younger daughter reported this to me afterward and what follows they had desired the maid it seems to bring them more firing and a jug of ale and they would sit in the chimneycorner they said till peep of day but the same young woman who was taken off from her errand to assist me finding me as they all thought not likely to recover ran in to them and declared that the lady was dead certainly dead and what said she will become of us all this terrified the two men they said it was then time for them to be gone accordingly taking each of them another dram they snatched up their hats and sticks and away they hurried hoping the doctor said that as they were innocent and only meant to serve the gentleman their names whatever happened would not be called in question  when i came a little to myself i found the three women only with me i was in a cold sweat all over shivering there was no fire in that room they led me into the parlour which the two men had quitted and set me down in an elbow chair for i could hardly stand or support myself and chased my temples with hungarywater  wretched creatures men of this cast my lucy thus to sport with the healths and happiness of poor creatures whom they pretend to love i am afraid i never shall be what i was at times i am very sensible at my stomach of this violent squeeze  the mother and elder sister left me soon after and went to sir hargrave i can only guess at the result of their deliberations by what followed  the younger sister with compassionate frankness answered all my questions and let me know all the above particulars yet she wondered that i could refuse so handsome and so rich a man as sir hargrave  she boasted much of their reputation her mother would not do an ill thing she said for the world and she had a brother who had a place in the customhouse and was as honest a man though she said it as any in it she owned that she knew my new vile servant and praised his fidelity to the masters he had served in such high terms as if she thought all duties were comprised in that one of obeying his principal right or wrong mr william she said was a pretty man a genteel man and she believed he was worth money and she was sure would make an excellent husband i soon found that the simple girl was in love with this vile this specious fellow she could not bear to hear me hint anything in his disfavour as by way of warning to her i would have done but she was sure mr william was a downright honest man and that if he were guilty of any bad thing it was by command of those to whom he owed duty and they are to be answerable for that you know madam  we ere broken in upon as i was intending to ask more questions for i find this wilson was the prime agent in all this mischief when the elder sister called out the younger and instantly came in sir hargrave  he took a chair and sat down by me one leg thrown over the knee of the other his elbow upon that knee and his hand supporting his bowddown head biting his lips looking at me then from me then at me again five or six times as in malice  illnatured spiteful moody wretch thought i trembling at his strange silence after such hurt as he had done me and what i had endured and still felt in my stomach and arm what an odious creature thou art  at last i broke silence i thought i would be as mild as i could and not provoke him to do me further mischief well have you done sir hargrave have you not to commit such a violence upon a poor young creature that never did nor thought you evil  i paused he was silent  what distraction have you given to my poor cousin reevess how my heart bleeds for them  i stopped he was still silent  i hope sir your are sorry for the mischief you have done me and for the pain you have given to my friends  i hope sir   cursed said he  i stopped thinking he would go on but he said no more only changing his posture and then resumeing it  these people sir seem to be honest people i hope you designed only to terrify me your bringing me into no worse company is an assurance to me that you meant better than   devils all interrupted he   i thought he was going on but he grinned shook his head and then again reclined it upon his hand  i forgive you sir the pain you have given me  but my friends  as soon as day breaks and i hope that is not far off i will get the women to let my cousin reeves   then up he started  miss byron said he you are a woman a true woman  and held up his hand clenched i knew not what to think of his intention  miss byron proceeded he after a pause you are the most consummate hypocrite that i ever knew in my life and yet i thought that the best of you all could fall into fits and swoonings whenever you pleased  i was now silent i trembled  damned fool ass blockhead womans fool  i ought to be d  nd for my credulous folly  i tell you miss byron  then he looked at me as if he were crazy and walked too or three times about the room  to be dying one halfhour and the next to look to provoking   i was still silent  i could curse myself for sending away the parson i thought i had known something of womens tricks  but yet your arts your hypocrisy shall not serve you madam what i failed in here shall be done elsewhere by the great god of heaven it shall  i wept i could not then speak  cannot you go into fits again cannot you said the barbarian with an air of a piece with his words and using other words of the lowest reproach  god deliver me prayed i to myself from the hands of this madman  i arose and as the candle stood near the glass i saw in it my vile figure in this abominable habit to which till then i had paid little attention o how i scorned myself  pray sir hargrave said i let me beg that you will not terrify me further i will forgive you for all you have hitherto done and place it to my own account as a proper punishment for consenting to be thus marked for a vain and foolish creature your abuse sir give me leave to say is low and unmanly but in the light of a punishment i will own it to be all deserved and let here my punishment end and i will thank you and forgive you with my whole heart  your fate is determined miss byron  just then came in a servantmaid with a capuchin who whispered something to him to which he answered that is well   he took the capuchin the maid withdrew and approached me with it i started trembled and was ready to saint i caught hold of the back of the elbow chair  your fate is determined madam repeated the savage  here put this on  now sall into fits again  put this on  pray sir hargrave   and pray miss byron what has not been completed here shall be completed in a safer place and that in my own way  put this on i tell you your compliance may yet befriend you  where are the gentlewomen  where are   gene to rest madam  john frank called he out  in came two menservants  pray sir hargrave  lord protect me  pray sir hargrave  where are the gentlewomen  lord protect me  then running to the door against which one of the men stood  man stand out of the way said i but he did not he only bowed  i cried out mrs  i forget your name miss  and the other miss  i forget your names  if you a e good creatures as i hoped you were   i called as loud as my fears would let me  at last came in the elder sister  o madam good young gentlewoman i am glad you are come said i  and so am i said the wicked man  pray miss sally put on this ladys capuchin  lord bless me for why for what i have no capuchin  i would not permit her to put it on as she would have done  the savage then wrapped his arms about mine and made me so very sensible by his force of the pain i had had by the squeeze of the door that i could not help crying out the young woman put on the capuchin whether i would or not  now miss byron said he make yourself easy or command a fit it is all one my end will be better served by the latter  miss sally give orders  she ran out with the candle frank give me the cloak said sir hargrave  the fellow had a red cloak on his arm his barbarous master took it from him to your posts said he  the two men withdrew in haste now my dearest life said he with an air of insult as i thought you command your fate if you are easy  he threw the cloak about me  i begged prayed would have kneeled to him but all was in vain the tygerhearted man as mr greville had truly called him muffled me up in it and by force carried me through a long entry to the foredoor there was ready a chariotandsix and that sally was at the door with a lighted candle  i called out to her i called out for her mother for the other sister i besought him to let me say but six words to the widow  but no widow was to appear no younger sister she was perhaps more tenderhearted than the elder and in spite of all my struggles prayers resistance he lifted me into the chariot  men on horseback were about it i thought that wilson was one of them and so it proved sir hargrave said to that fellow you know what tale to tell if you meet with impertinents and in he came himself  i screamd scream on my dear upbraidingly said he and barbarously mocked me imitating low wretch the bleating of a sheep could you not have killed him for this my lucy then rearing himself up now am i lord of miss byron exulted he  still i screamed for help and he put his hand before my mouth though vowing honor and such sort of stuff and with his unmanly roughness made me bite my lip and away lashed the coachman with your poor harriet  letter xxxiii miss byron in continuation as the chariot drove by houses i cried out for help once or twice at setting out but under pretense of preventing my taking cold he tied an handkechief over my face head and mouth having first muffled me up in the cloak pressing against my arm with his whole weight so that i had not my hands at liberty and when he had done he seized them and held them both in his left hand while his rightarm thrown round me kept me fast on the seat and except that nowandthen my struggling head gave me a little opening i was blinded  but at one place on the road just after i had screamed and made another effort to get my hands free i heard voices and immediately the chariot stopped then how my heart was filled with hope but alas it was but momentary i heard one of his men say that wilson i believe the best of husbands i assure you sir and she is the worst of wives  i screamed again ay scream and be d  nd i heard said in a strangers voice if that be the case poor gentleman i pity him with all my heart and immediately the coachman drove on again  the vile wretch laughed that is you my dear and hugged me round you are the d  nd wife and again he laughed by my soul i am a charming contriver greville fenwick orme where are you now  by my soul this will be a pretty story to tell when all your fears are over my byron  i was ready to faint several times i begged for air and when we were in an open road and i suppose there was nobody in sight he vouchsafed to pull down the blinding handkerchief but kept it over my mouh so that except nowandthen that i struggled it aside with my head and my neck is still my dear very stiff with my efforts to free my face i could only make a murmuring kind of noise  the curtain of the foreglass was pulled down and generally the canvas on both sides drawn up but i was sure to be made acquainted when we came near houses by his care again to blind and stifle me up  a little before we were met by my deliverer i had by getting one hand free unmuffled myself so far as to see as i had guessed once or twice before by the stone pavements that we were going through a town and then i again vehemently screamed but he had the cruelty to thrust an handkerchief into my mouth so that i was almost stranled and my mouth was hurt and is still sore with that and his former violence of the like nature  indeed he nowandthen made apologies for the cruelty to which he said he was compelled by my invincible obstinacy to have recourse i was sorely hurt he said to be the wife of a man of his consideration but i should be that or worse he was in for it he said more than once and must proceed i might see that all my resistance was in vain he had me in his net and d  n him if he were not revenged for all the trouble i had given him you keep no terms with me my byron said he once and d  n me if i keep any with you  i doubted not his malice his love had no tenderness in it but how could i think of being consenting as i may say to such barbarous usage and by a man so truly odious to me what a slave had i been in spirit could i have qualified on such villainous treatment as i had met with or had i been able to desert myself  at one place the chariot drove out of the road over rough ways and little hillocks as i thought by its rocking and then it stopping he let go my hands and endeavored to footh me he begged i would be pacified and offered if i would forbear crying out for help to leave my eyes unmuffled all the rest of the way but i would not i told him give such a sanction to his barbarous violence  on the chariots stopping one of his men came up and put an handkerchief into his masters hands in which were some cakes and sweetmeats and gave him also a bottle of sack with a glass sir hargrave was very urgent with me to take some of the sweetmeats and to drink a glass of the wine but i had neither stomach nor will to touch either  he eat himself very cordialy god forgive me i wished in my heart there were pins and needles in every bit he put in his mouth  he drank two glasses of the wine again he urged me i said i hoped i had cat and drank my last  you have no dependence upon my honor madam said the villain so cannot be disappointed match do what i will ungrateful proud vain obstinate he called me  what signifies says he showing politeness to a woman who has shown none to me though she was civil to every other man ha ha ha hah what my sweet byron i dont hit your fancy you dont like my morals laughing again my lovely fly said the insulting wretch hugging me round in the cloak how prettily have i wrapped you about in my web   such a provoking low wretch  i struggled to free myself and unhooked the curtain of the foreglass but he wrapped me about the closer and said he would give me his garter for my girdle if i would not sit still and be orderly ah my charming byron said he your opportunity is over  all your struggles will not avail you  will not avail you that is a word of your own you know i will however forgive you if you promise to love me now but if you stay till i get you to the allotted place then madam take what follows  i saw that i was upon a large wild heathlike place between two roads as it seemed i asked nothing about my journeys end all i had to hope for as to an escape though then i began to despair of it was upon the road or in some town my journeys end i knew must be the beginning of new dials for i was resolved to suffer death rather than to marry him what i now was most apprehensie about was of failing into fits and i answered to his barbarous insults as little as possible that i might not be provoked beyond the little strength i had left me  three or four times he offered to kiss me and cursed my pride for resisting him making him clasp a cloud was his speech aiming at wit instead of his juno calling the cloak a cloud  and now my dear byron said he if you will not come to a compromise with me i must dress you again for the journey we will stop at a town a little further beckoning to one of his men and on his approaching whispering to him his whole body out of the chariot and there you shall alight and a very worthy woman to whom i shall introduce you will persuade you perhaps to take refreshment though i cannot  you are a very barbarous man sir hargrave i have the misfortune to be in your power you may dearly repent the usage i have already received from you you have made my life of no estimation with me i will not contend  and tears ran down my cheeks indeed i thought my heart was broke  he wrapped me up close and tied the handkerchief about my mouth and head i was quite passive  the chariot had not many minutes got into the great road again over the like rough and sometimes plashy ground when it stopped on a dispute beween the coachman and the coachman of another chariotandsix as it proved  sir hargrave had but just drawn my handkerchief closer to my eyes when this happened hinder not my tears from flowing said i struggling to keep my eyes free the cloak enough muffling me and the handkerchief being over my mouth so that my voice could be but just heard by him as i imagine  he looked out of his chariot to see the occasion of this stop and then i found means to disengage one hand  i heard a gentlemans voice directing his own coachman to give way  i then pushed up the handkerchief with my disengaged hand from my mouth and pulled it down from over my eyes and cried out for help help for gods sake  a mans voice it was my deliverers as it happily proved bid sir hargraves coachman proceed at his peril  sir hargrave with terrible oaths and curses ordered him to proceed and to drive through all opposition  the gentleman called sir hargrave by his name and charged him with being upon a bad design  the vile wretch said he had only securd a runaway wife eloped to and intended to elope from a masquerade to her adultere ord he put aside the cloak and appealed  dress  i cried out no no no five or six times repeated but could say no more at that  holding up then both my disengaged hands for protection  the wicked man endeavored to mussle me up again and to force the handkerchief which i had then got under my chin over my mouth and brutally cursed me  the gentleman would not be satisfied with sir hargraves story he would speak to me sir hargrave called him impertinent and other names and asked who the devil he was with rage and contempt  the gentleman however asked me and with an air that promised deliverance if i were sir hargraves wife  no no no no  i could only say  for my own part i could have no scruple distressed as i was and made desperate to throw myself into the protection and even into the arms of my deliverer though a very fine young gentleman it would have been very hard had i fallen from bad to bad had the sacred name of protector been abused by another sir hargrave who would have had the additional crime of betraying a confidence to answer for but however this had proved an escape from the present evil was all i had in my head at the time  but you may better conceive than i can express the terror i was in when sir hargrave drew his sword and pushed at the gentleman with such words as denoted for i could not look that way he had done him mischief but when i found my oppressor my lowmeaning and soon after lowlaid oppressor pulled out of the chariot by the brave the gallant man which was done with such force as made the chariot rock and my protector safe i was near fainting with joy as before i had been with terror i had shaken off the cloak and united the handkerchief  he carried me in his arms i could not walk to his own chariot  i heard sir hargrave curse swear and threaten i was glad however he was not dead  mind him not madam fear him not said sir charles grandison you know his noble name my lucy coachman drive not over your master take care of your master or some such words he said as he lifted me into his own chariot he came not in but shut the chariotdoor as soon as he had seated me  he just surveyed as it were the spot and bid a servant let sir hargrave know who he was and then came back to me  partly through terror partly through weakness i had sunk to the bottom of the chariot he opened the door entered and with all the tenderness of a brother soothed me and lifted me on the seat once more he ordered his coachman to drive back to colnebrooke in accents of kindness he told me that he had there at present the most virtuous and prudent of sisters to whose care he would commit me and then proceed on his journey to town  how irresistably welcome to me was his supporting arm thrown round me as we flew back compared to that of the vile sir hargrave  mr reeves has given you an account from the angelic sister  o my lucy they are a pair of angels  i have written a long long letter or rather five letters in one of my distresses of my deliverance and when my heart is stronger i will say more of the persons as well as minds of this excellent brother and his sister  but what shall i do with my gratitude o my dear i am overwhelmed with my gratitude i can only express it in silence before them every look if it be honest to my heart however tells it reverence mingles with my gratitude  yet there is so much ease so much sweetness in the behavior of both  o my lucy did i not find that my veneration of both is equal did i not on examination find that the amiable sister is as dear to me from her experienced tenderness as her brother from his remembered bravery which must needs mingle awe with my esteem in short that i love the sister and revere the brother i should be afraid of my gratitude  i have overwritten myself i am tired o my grandmamma you have never yet while i have been in london sent me your overvalued blessing under your own hand yet i am sure i had it and your blessings my dear uncle and aunt selby and your prayers my lucy my nancy and all my loves else my deliverance had not perhaps followed my presumptuous folly in going dressed out like the fantastic wretch i appeared to be at a vile a foolish masquerade  how often throughout the several stages of my distress and even in my deliverance did i turn my eye to myself and from myself with the disgust that made a part and that not a light one of my punishment  and so much my lucy for masquerades and masqueradedresses for ever  pray let not anybody unnecessarily be acquainted with this shocking affair particularly neither mr greville nor mr fenwick it is very probable that they especially mr greville would be for challenging sir hargrave were it only on a supposition that it would give him an interest in me in the eye of the world you know that mr greville watches for all opportunities to give himself consequence with me  were any farther mischief to happen to anybody i should be grieved beyond measure hitherto i have reason to think that a transaction so shocking is not very unhappily concluded may the vile man sit himself down satisfied and i shall be willing to do so too provided i never more behold his face  mr reeves will send you with the above paccuet a letter from sir charles grandison enclosing one from that vile wilson i can write no more just now and they will sufficiently explain themselves  adieu my dearest lucy i need not say how much i am and will ever be  your faithful and affectionate harriet byron  letter xxxiv sir cha grandison to archib reeves esquire canterbury feb    dear sir the enclosed long letter is just now brought to me i pretend not to judge of the writers penitence yet his confessions seem ingenuous and he was not under any obligation to put them on paper  as i presume that you will not think it advisable to make the ineffectual attempt upon miss byron public by a prosecution perhaps your condescending to let the mans sister know that her brother if in earnest may securely pursue the honest purposes he mentions may save the poor wretch from taking such courses as might be fatal not only to himself but to innocent persons who otherwise may suffer by his being made desperate  the man as you will see by his letter if you had not a still stronger proof has abilities to do mischief he has been in bad hands as he tells us from his youth upwards or he might have been an useful member of society he is a young man and if yet he could be made so his reformation will take from the number of the profligate and add to that of the hopeful and who knows how wide the circle of his acquaintance is and how many of them may be influenced by his example either way if he marry the notdishonest young woman to whom he seems to be contracted may not your lenity be a means of securing a whole future family on the side of moral honesty  his crime as the attempt was frustrated is not capital and not to metion the service of such an evidence as this should sir hargrave seek for a legal redress as he sometimes weakly threatens my hope makes me see a further good that may be brought about by this mans reformation wicked masters cannot execute their base views upon the persons of the innocent without the assistance of wicked servants what a nest of vipers may be crushed at once or at least rendered unhurtful by depriving the three monsters he names of the aid of such an agent men who want to save appearances and have estates to forfeit will sometimes be honost of necessity rather than put themselves into the power of untried villains  you will be so good as to make my compliments to your lady and to our lovely ward you see sir that i join myself with you in the honor of that agreeable relation  i hope the dear lady has perfectly recovered her health and spirits i am good mr reeves  your most faithful and obedient servant charles grandison  letter xxxv to the honorable sir charles grandison bart saturday feb    in what an odious light must that wretch appear before the worthiest of men who cannot but abhor himself  i am the unhappy man who was hired into the service of the best of young ladies whom i was the means of betraying into the power of sir hargrave pollexfen from the ball in the haymarket on thursday night last  your honor has made yourself an interest in miss byrons fate as i may say by your powerful protection pardon me if i give you some account of myself and of transactions which perhaps will otherwise never be known and this in justice to all round  my parentage was honest my education was above my parentage i set out with good principles but i fell into a bad service i was young and of a good natural disposition but had not virtue enough to resist a temptation i could not say no to an unlawful thing when my principles commanded my assent  i was at first setting out by favor of friends taken as clerk to a merchant in profess of time i transacted his business at the customhouse he taught me to make light of oaths of office and this by degrees made me think light of all moral obligations and laid the foundation of my ruin  my masters name was bagenhall he died and i was to seek his brother succeeded to his fortune which was very large he was brought up to no business he was a gentleman his seat is near reading i was recommended by him to the service of a gentleman who was nominated to go abroad on a foreign embassy i will name his name lest your honor should imagine i have any design to evade the strictest truth sir christopher lucas i was to be this gentlemans master of the horse abroad  the first service my new master employed me in was to try to get for him the pretty daughter of an honest farmer  i had been out of place for a twelvemonth had i had twenty shillings aforehand in the world i would i think have said no nevertheless i consulted in confidence my late masters brother upon it the advice he gave me was not to boggle at it but if he said i could manage the matter so as to cheat sir christopher and get the girl for him and keep the secret he would give me  0 l i abhorred the double treachery of young mr bagenhall but undertook to serve sir christopher and carried on a treaty with the farmer for his daughter as if she were to be the wife of sir christopher but not to be owned till he returned from abroad no not even if she should prove with child  i found in the course of my visits at the farmers so much honesty both in father and mother and so much innocence in the daughter that my heart relented and i took an opportunity to reveal sir christophers base design to them for the girl was designed to be ruined the very first moment that sir christopher could be alone with her your honor may belive that i injoined all three strict secrecy  nevertheless this contriving devil of a master found a way to get the young woman by other means and in amorous dalliance she told him to whom he was obliged for not succeeding before  in rage he turned me out of his service in the most disgraceful manner but without giving any other reasons than that he knew me to be a villain and that i knew myself to be one nor would he give me a character so i was quite reduced and but for the kindness of a sister who keeps an inn in smithfield i should have starved or been obliged to do worse  i should have told your honor that the poor farmer and his wife both died of grief in half a year an honest young man who dearly loved the young woman was found drowned soon after it is feared he was his own executioner sir christopher went not on his embassy his preparations for it and his expensive way of life before and after reduced him and he has been long a beggar as i may say the poor young woman is now if living on the town i saw her about half a year ago in st martins roundhouse taken up as a common prostitute and charged with picking a pocket she was a pretty creature and had a very pious turn when i knew her first her father had gone beyond himself in her education and this was the fruit what has such a man as sir christopher to answer for  but it is come home to him i rejoice that this wickedness was not added to my score  but heavy scenes i had enough afterward being utterly destitute except what my sister did for me and not enduring to be a burden to her i threw myself on my master bagenhall he employed me in mean offices till his pander died he is a very profligate man sir and then he promoted me to a still meaner  in this way i grew a shameless contriver he introduced me to sir hargrave pollexfen and to mr merceda a portuguse jew in the service of these three masters good heaven forgive me what villainies was i not the means of perpetrating yet i never was so hardened but i had temporary remorses but these three gentlemen would never let me rest from wickedness yet they kept me poor and necessitous as the only means to keep me what they called honest for they had often reason to think that had i had any other means of subsistence i would have been really honest  i was now mr bagenhalls constant servant sir hargrave and mr merceda used to borrow me but i must say sir hargrave is an innocent man to the other two they caressed me i speak it to my shame as a man fit for their turn i had contrivance temper i knew something of everybody but my sister knows my frequent compunctions and that i hated the vile course i was in she used to lecture me enough she is a good woman  will your honor have patience with me a little longer  sir hargrave on the seventh of this month came to my master bagenhall at reading with whom he had double business one was to take a bond and judgment of him sir hargrave is no better than an usurer mr bagenhall has lived a most extravagant life the other was to borrow me mr merceda had a scheme on foot at the same time which he was earnest to engage me in but it was too shocking and mr bagenhall came into sir hargraves  sir hargrave told them he designed nothing more than a violation if he could get my assistance of the most beautiful woman in the world and sir to see the villainy of the other two they both unknown to each other made proposals to me to trick sir hargrave and to get the lady each for himself  but to me sir hargave swore that he was fully rsolved to leave this wicked course of life bagenhall and merceda he said were devils and he would marry and have no more to say to them all that was in his view was honest marriage he said he had never been in the ladys company but once and that was the day before at lady betty williamss he said he went thither knowing she was to be there for having for some time had it in his head to marry this was the lady he had pitched upon in his mind from the character he had of her from every mouth at the northampton races  now said he i shall have some difficulty to obtain her notwithstanding my fortune is so great for every one who sees her is in love with her and he named several gentlemen who laid close siege to her  she brought a servant up with her said he who hones after the country and is actually gone or soon will her cousin enquires of every one after a proper servant for her you wilson said he are handsome and genteel he was pleased to say so you have a modest humble look you know all the duties of a servant get yourself entertained and your fortune is made for life if by your means i obtain the lady i have already tendered myself said he perhaps she will have me in a few days i dont expect to be denied if she be disengaged as it is said she is if you can get into her service you will find out every thing this is all that is to be done but you must never mention my name nor ever know anything of me as i go and come  sir hargrave declared that his heart was burnt up with the love of the lady and if he succeeded as he had little doubt even without my help had i been actually in mercedas service you will said he as my ladys servant be mine of course you shall never wear a livery and you shall be my gentleman till i can get a place for you in the customs this may it please your honor he knew i had long aimed at and it had been often promised by himself and my other two masters and was their first promise when they wanted to engage me in any of their schemes though they never thought more of it when the service was over if i got but myself engaged i was on the day i entered into my ladys service to have as an earnest ten guineas  encouraged by such promises and the project being an honester one than ever sir hargrave or either of the other two had sought to engage me in i offered my service to my lady and on mr bagenhalls writing a good character of me was accepted  i could have been happy in the service of this lady all the days of my life she is all goodness all the servants everybody gentle and simple adored her but she unexpectedly refusing to have sir hargrave and he being afraid that one of her three or four lovers would cut him out he resolved to take more violent measures than he had at first intended  if any man was ever mad in love it was sir hargrave but then he was as mad with anger to be refused sir hargrave was ever thought to be one of the proudest men in england and he complained that my lady used him worse than she did anybody else but it was not her way to use anybody ill i saw that  nevertheless he was resolved to strike a bold stroke for a wife as were his words from the title of a play and between us we settled the matter in one night for i had found means to get out unknown to the family  it will be trespassing too much upon your honors patience to be very particular in our contrivances i will be as brief as possible  my lady was to go to a masquerade i got into the knowledge of every thing how and about it the maids were as full of the matter as their master and mistresses  it was agreed to make the chairmen fuddled two of mr mercedas footmen were to undertake the task brandy was put into their liquor to hasten them  they were soon overcome the weather was cold they drank briskly and were laid up safe i then hired two chance chairmen and gave them orders as had been contrived  i had twenty guineas given me in hand for my encouragement in which were included the promised ten  i had when i was my first master bagenhalls clerk made acquaintance with several clerks of the custumhouse particularly with one awberry a sober modest man who has two sisters to one of whom i am contracted and always for two years past intended to make my wife as soon as i should be in any way to maintain her the mother is a widow all of them are very honest people  mr awberry the brother being assured by me and i was well assured of it myself and had no doubt about it that marriage was intended and knowing sir hargraves great estate and having indeed seen sir hargrave on the occasion and received his protestations of honor engaged his mother and sister in it and the result as to them and me was that i was to receive as soon as the knot was tied an hundred guineas besides the twenty and moreover an absolute promise of a place and twenty pounds a year till i got it and then my marriage with young mrs awberry was to follow  the widow has an annuity of thirty pounds which with their sons salary keeps them above want  she lives at paddington there is a backdoor and garden as it happens convenient to bring anybody in or carry anybody out secretly and hither it was resolved if possible that the lady should be brought and a fleet parson and his clerk ready stationd to perform the ceremony and then all that the bridegroom wished was to follow of course  sir hargrave doubted not though he was fruitful in contrivances and put many others in practice but he should be detected if he carried the lady to his own house and as he was afraid that the chairmen notwithstanding several other artful contrivances would be able to find out the place they carried her to he had ordered his chariotandsix to be at the widow awberrys by six in the morning with three servants on horseback armed and a horse and pistols besides after marriage and consummation he was resolved to go to his house on the forest but not to stay there but to go to mr mercedas house near newberry where he doubted not but he should be secret till he thought fit to produce the lady as lady pollexfen and often very often did he triumph on the victory he should obtain over her other lovers and over her own proud heart as he would have it to be  the parson sir came the clerk was there but what with fits prayers tears and one thing or other at one time the lady being thought irrecoverable having received some unintended hurt in her struggling to get out of a door as i heard it was sir hargrave in terror dismissed the parson and resolved to carry the lady who by that time was recovered in the chariot to his seat at windsor and then staying there only to marry go to newberry and from thence break out by degrees as the matter should be taken  my lady screamed resisted and did all that woman could do to get free and more than once people who heard her cry out for help were put on a wrong scent and had we not met with your honor who would see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears the affair had been all over in the way sir hargrave wished and was at so much pains and expense to effect for sir the chariot generally drove so fast that before passengers could have resolved whether to interfere or not we should have been out of sight or reach  sir hargrave is in the greatest rage with us all because we stood not better by him he refuses any favor to me and threatens to pistol me the moment he sees me that is to be my reward  we were four at setting out from paddington but one of the servants was dispatched to prepossess an old servant of sir hargraves mother at colnebrooke who keeps there a kind of haberdashery shop and where he proposed to get some refreshment for the lady if he could make her take any for my part i wonder how she kept out of fits on the road she had enough of them at paddington  the two servants who staid about sir hargrave are discharged with all the marks of indignation that a master incensed by such a disappointment could express and as i said before he is resolved to pistol me the moment he sees me yet i too well served him for the peace of my conscience  a coachandfour was ordered to carry the widow and her two daughters to reading to the newinn there where they were to reside for a week or so till all was blown over and that they might be out of the way of answering questions and my brother awberry as i call him and hope to make him for he is a very honest man was to go to them there  and there in all probability had sir hargrave succeeded and been as good as his word should i have been the husband of as tenderhearted a young woman as any in the parish she lives in  here is a very long letter may it please you sir i have shortened it however as much as i could but in hatred to myself and the vile ways i have by excess of goodnature and by meeting with wicked masters been drawn into  for the clearing of my sisters character who lives in credit among her neighbors and of every other person who might otherwise have been suspected  in justice to mrs awberrys and her two daughters and her sons characters  and in justice so far to sir hargraves as that he intended marriage and had he not he would have found no friends in his designs at paddington and so far as to clear him of having not offered the least incivility to my lady  had he intended or been provoked so to do he was too well watched by the widow and her daughters to have been permitted and that by my own request which was that they should be ready to run in whenever they heard her cry out and that they would not leave sir hargrave alone with my lady for six minutes till their hands were joined in wedlock  in justice i say to all these persons i thought proper thus to give you sir all that i knew relating to this wicked transaction and if may it please your honor i were to be taken up i could say no more before a magistrate except this which i had like to have forgot which is that had it not been for me some mischief might have been done between sir hargraves servants and yours if not to your honors person  all that i most humbly beg is the pardon of so sweet a lady i have chosen evertobehonoured sir to write to you whose goodness is so generally talked of and who have so nobly redeemed and protected her mr reeves i know has suffered too much in his mind to forgive me he is a worthy gentleman i am sorry for the disturbance i have given him i have hopes given me that i shall get employment on the keys or as a tidewaiter extraordinary  please the lord i will never never more be the tool of wicked masters all i wish for is to be able to do justice to the love of an honest young woman and i am resolved whether so enabled or not to starve rather than to go any more no not for a single hour into the service of the iniquitous gentlemen i have so often named in this long letter  if i might be assured that i may pursue unmolested any honest calling so as that i may not be tempted or driven into unhappy courses my heart would be at rest  there might have been murder in this affair that shocks me to think of o sir good excellent brave and the most worthy of gentlemen you have given to me as great a deliverance as you have to the lady yea greater for mine may be a deliverance if i make a proper use of it of soul as well as body which god grant as also your honors health and prosperity to the prayers of  your honors everdevoted humble servant william wilson i thought i had something else to say something it is of high importance your life is threatened sir god preserve your precious life amen    letter xxxvi miss byron to miss selby friday feb    my cousin reeves has given assurance to the sister of that wilson that he may unmolested by any of us pursue the best means he can fall upon for the obtaining of an honest livelihood  in everything it is determined to follow the advice of my deliverer  what a letter is that fellows what men are there in the world  of such we have read but i hoped that i might have escaped suffering by any such  we are extremely disturbed at the fellows postscript and the more as we are told by several people that sir hargrave will not sit down quietly but threatens vengeance upon sir charles i wish i had not come to london  i hope my grandmammas spirits are not affected by what she knows of the matter it was very good of my aunt selby to take the measures she did in softening every circumstance and not to let her know anything till the danger was over but indeed it was but the natural effect of that prudence which regulates all the actions of my honored aunt  my grandmamma has such strength of mind that now she knows i am safe and not unhappy i dare say she will by degrees bear to hear my narrations read she will be more uneasy if she thinks anything is kept from her  yet i know that her tenderness and her love for her harriet will cost her some anguish some sighs some tears as she reads or hears read the cruelty her girl has been treated with who so tenderly brought up so greatly indulged never before knew what harshness was and had only read of the words cruelty barbarity and suchlike words but then she will have more joy i hope in my deliverance than she will have pain in my sufferings and pray let her know that i am every day less and less sensible of the pain in my stomach of which i was so apprehensive as really at the time to think it a mortal blow my grandmamma has told us girls you know my lucy twenty and twenty frightful stories of the vile enterprises of men against innocent creatures and will therefore call to mind stories which have concluded much worse than blessed be god mine has done  just now i have received a congratulatory packet of letters  one from my aunt selby such a sweetly kind such a truly maternal letter  one from my dearest grandmamma i will put it next my heart whenever i feel there any of that pain of which she is so kindly apprehensive  one from nancy  dear girl  she is very very generous to forget her own malady to condole and congratulate me your brother james my lucy has written me a very kind letter he is a good young man god keep him so what a mischievous creature is a bad man  i have a charming letter by the post from my godfather deane he has heard nothing of what has happened and i am sure is too sollicitous for my welfare to take it well if i do not let him know something about it i will therefore soon write to him  but your letter my lucy  what i warrant you thought i had forgot your letter in the enumeration of the contents of the precious packet if i had your goodness your love might have made you forgive me but i never would have forgiven myself  but you and i my dear write for all to see what we write and so i reserved yours to be lastmentiond only i slid in my godfather deanes between not because i love him better than i do my lucy  no that is impossible  but because i had a mind to show you that i was hastening to be quite well and so assumed my little saucy tricks and surprises as if it were possible for me to be heedless where my love to my lucy was in the question  and so you expect the particular character and description of the persons of this more than amiable brother and sister need you to have told me that you do and could you think that after having wasted so many quires of paper in giving you the characters of people many of whom deserved not to be drawn out from the common crowd of mortals i would forbear to give you those of persons who adorn the age in which they live and even human nature  you dont question you say if i begin in their praises but my gratitude will make me write in a sublime style so you phraise it and are ready you promise me to take with allowance all the fine things from me which mr reeves has already taught you to expect  you may be right in your expectations as far as i know for my grandfather so many years ago used to say that his little byron was an enthusiast in her gratitude but however when i say anything of the exalted minds of the expanded hearts of the amiaable manners of this happy brother and sister which seems to exceed in my praises the bounds you will all be willing to set me then let the over flowings be carried to account of the grateful enthusiasm and only to that  which shall i begin with you will have a sharp lookout upon me you say ah my lucy i know what you mean but i am safe from everything but my gratitude i will assure you  and so if i begin with the character of the brother then will you join with my uncle shake your head and cry ah my harriet if i begin with the sister will you not say that i save my choicest subject for the last how difficult is it to avoid censure when there is a resolution taken to be censorious  well but keep a lookout if you please my lucy not the least shadow of reserve shall it give to my heart my pen shall be honest to that heart and i shall be benefited i am sure by the faithful wounds of such affectionate and equallybeloved as revered friends  and so pen take thy course  miss grandison  yes my volant my selfconducted quill begin with the sister say my lucy what she pleases   miss grandison is about twentyfour of a fine stature she has dignity in her aspect and a very penetrating black eye with which she does what she pleases her hair is black very fine and naturally curls she is not fair but her complexion is delicate and clear and promises a long duration to her loveliness her features are generally regular her nose is a little aquiline but that is so far from being a blemish that it gives a kind of majesty to her other features her teeth are white and even her mouth is perfectly lovely and a modest archness appears in her smiles that makes one both love and fear her when she begins to speak she is finely shaped and in her air and whole appearance perfectly genteel  she herself says that before her brother came to england she was thought to be proud pert and lofty but i hardly believe her for the man lives not it is my belief who in fourteen months time and sir charles has not been longer arrived could so totally eradicate those qualities in a mind of which they had takenpossession as that they should not occasionally show themselves  she has charming spirits i dare say she sings well from the air she nowandthen warbles in the gaiety of her heart as she goes up and down stairs she is very polite yet has a vein of raillery that were she not polite would give one too much apprehension for ones ease but i am sure she is frank easy and goodhumoured and by turning over all the just and handsome things which are attributed to herself to her brothers credit she must be equally humble and generous  she says she has but lately taken a very great likeing to reading but i am ready to question what she says when she speaks anything that some would construe to her disadvantage she pretends that she was too volatile too gay too airy to be confined to sedentary amusements her father however according to the genteelest and most laudable modern education for women had given her a master who taught her history and geography in both which she acknowledges she made some progress in music she owns she has skill but i am told by her maid who attended me by her young ladys direction and who delights to praise her mistress that she reads and speaks french and italian that she writes finely and is greatly admired for her wit prudence and obligingness nobody said jenny who is a sensible young woman a clergymans daughter well educated and very obligeing can stand against her goodnatured raillery her brother she says is not spared but he takes delight in her vivacity and gives way to it when it is easy to see that he could take her down if he pleased and then added this good young woman she is an excellent manager in a family finely as she is educated i rejoiced to hear that for the honor of our reading ladies as in miss clementss case she knows everything and how to direct what should be done from the private familydinner to a sumptuous entertainment and every day inspects and approves or alters the bill of fare by the way my lucy she is an early riser  do you mind that and so can do everything with ease pleasure and without hurry and confusion for all her servants are early risers of course what servants can for shame be in bed at a reasonable hour to be up when they have a master or mistresss example for early rising  yet this fine lady loves to go to the public places and often goes and makes a brilliant figure there she has time for them and earns her pleasures by her early rising  miss grandison jenny tells me has two humble servants i wonder she has not twoandtwenty one is sir walter watkyns a man of a large estate in somersetshire the other is lord g son of the earl of g but neither of them highly approved by her yet jenny says they are both of them handsome men and admired by the ladies this makes me afraid that they are modern men and pay their court by the exterior appearance rather than by interior worth who my lucy that has heard what my late grandfather has said and my grandmamma still says of the men in their youthful days will not say that we have our lots cast in an age of petits maitres and insignificants  such an amiable woman is miss charlotte grandison  may i be found on further acquaintance but half as lovely in her eyes as she is in mine  dont be jealous lucy i hope i have a large heart i hope there is room in it for half a dozen sweet female friends  yes although another love were to intervene i could not bear that even the affection due to the man of my choice were i to marry should like aarons rod swallow up all the rest  but now for her brother  my deliverer  but pray now lucy dont you come with your sharp lookout i warrant you will expect on this occasion to read the tumults of the poor girls heart in her character and description of a man to whom she is so much obliged  but what if she disappoints you and yet do justice to his manifold excellencies what if she find some faults in him that his sister has not  parading harriet methinks you say teazing girl go on go on leave it to us to find you out and take care that the very faults you pretend to discover do not pass for a color only and lead to your detection  thank you lucy for your caution but i will not be obliged to it my pen shall follow the dictates of my heart and if it be as honest to me as i think it is to everybody else i hope i have nothing to fear either from your lookout or which is still a sharper my uncle selbys  sir charles grandison in his person is really a very fine man he is tall rather slender than full his face in shape is a fine oval he seems to have florid health health confirmed by exercise  his complexion seems to have been naturally too fine for a man but as if he were above being regardful of it his face is overspread with a manly sunniness i want a word that shows he has been in warmer climates than england and so it seems he has since the tour of europe has not contented him he has visited some parts of asia and even of afric egypt particularly  i wonder what business a man has for such fine teeth and so fine a mouth as sir charles grandison might boast of were he vain  in his aspect there is something great and noble that shows him to be of rank were kings to be chosen for beauty and majesty of person sir charles grandison would have few competitors his eye  indeed my lucy his eye shows if possible more of sparkling intelligence than that of his sister   now pray be quiet my dear uncle selby what is beauty in a man to me you all know that i never thought beauty a qualification in a man  and yet this grandeur in his person and air is accompanied companied with so much ease and freedom of manners as engages ones love with ones reverence his good breeding renders him very accessible his sister says he is always the first to break through the restraints and to banish the diffidences that will generally attend persons on a quite new acquaintance he may for he is sure of being acceptable in whatever he does or says  very true lucy shake your head if you please  in a word he has such an easy yet manly politeness as well in his dress as in his address no singularity appearing in either that were he not a fine figure of a man but were even plain and hardfeatured he would be thought what is far more eligible in a man than mere beauty very agreeable  sir charles grandison my dear has traveled we may say to some purpose  well might his sister tell mr reeves that whenever he married he would break half a score hearts  upon my word lucy he has too many personal advantages for a woman who loved him with peculiarity to be easy with whatever may be his virtue from the foible our sex in general love to indulge for handsome men for o my dear womens eyes are sad giddy things and will run away with their sense with their understandings beyond the power of being overtaken either by stop theif or hueandcry  i know that here you will bid me take care not to increase the number of the giddy and so i will my lucy  the good sense of this real fine gentleman is not as i can find rusted over by sourness by moroseness he is above quarreling with the world for trifles but he is still more above making such compliances with it as would impeach either his honor or conscience once miss grandison speaking of her brother said my brother is valued by those who know him best not so much for being an handsome man not so much for his birth and fortune nor for this or that single worthiness as for being in the great and yet comprehensive sense of the word a good man and at another time she said that he lived to himself and to his own heart and that though he had the happiness to please everybody yet he made the judgment or approbation of the world matter but of second consideration in a word added she sir charles grandison my brother and when she looks proud it is when she says my brother is not to be misled either by false glory or false shame which he calls the great snares of virtue  what a man is this so to act  what a woman is this so to distinguish her brothers excellencies  what a poor creature am i compared to either of them and yet i have had my admirers so perhaps may still more faulty creatures among their inferiors if my lucy we have so much good sense as to make fair comparisons what have we to do but to look forward rather than backward in order to obtain the grace of humility  but let me tell you my dear that sir charles does not look to be so great a selfdenier as his sister seems to think him when she says he lives to himself and to his own heart rather than to the opinion of the world  he dresses to the fashion rather richly it is true than gaudily but still richly so that he gives his fine person its full consideration he has a great deal of vivacity in his whole aspect as well as in his eye mrs jenny says that he is a great admirer of handsome women his equipage is perfectly in taste though not so much to the glare of taste as if he aimed either to inspire or show emulation he seldom travels without a set and suitable attendants and what i think seems a little to favor of singularity his horses are not docked their tails are only tied up when they are on the road this i took notice of when we came to town i want methinks my dear to find some fault in his outward appearance were it but to make you think me impartial my gratitude to him and my veneration for him notwithstanding  but if he be of opinion that the tails of these noble animals are not only a natural ornament but are of real use to defend them from the vexatious insects that in summer are so apt to annoy them as jenny just now told me was thought to be his reason for not depriving his cattle of a defense which nature gave them how far from a dispraise is this humane consideration and how in the more minute as well as we may suppose in the greater instances does he deserve the character of the man of mercy who will be merciful to his beast  i have met with persons who call those men good that yet allow themselves in liberties which no good man can take but i dare say that miss grandison means by good when she calls her brother with so much pride a good man what i and what you my lucy would understand by the word  with so much spirit life and gallantry in the first appearance of sir charles grandison you may suppose that had i not been so dreadfully terrified and illused and so justly apprehensive of worse treatment and had i been offered another protection i should hardly have acted the frighted bird flying from the hawk to which as mr reeves tells me sir charles though politely and kindly enough yet too sensibly for my recollection compared me  do you wonder lucy that i cannot hold up my head when i recollect the figure i must make in that odious masqueradehabit hanging by my clasping arms about the neck of such a young gentleman can i be more effectually humbled than by such a recollection and yet is not this an instance of that false shame in me to which sir charles grandison is so greatly superior  surely surely i have had my punishment for my compliances with this foolish world false glory and false shame the poor harriet has never been totally above why was i so much indulged why was i allowed to stop so many miles short of my journeys end and then complimented as if i had no farther to go  but surely i was past all shame when i gave my consent to make such an appearance as i made among a thousand strangers at a masquerade  but now i think something offers of blame in the character of this almost faultless man as his sister and her jenny represent him to be  i cannot think from a hint given by miss grandison that he is quite so frank and so unreserved as his sister is nay it was more than a hint i will repeat her very words she had been mentioning her own openness of heart and yet confessing that she would have kept one or two things from him that affected him not but as for my brother said she he winds one about and about yet seems not to have more curiosity than one would wish him to have led on by his smiling benignity and fond of his attention to my prattle i have caught myself in the midst of a tale of which i intended not to tell him one syllable  o sir charles where am i got have i said and suddenly stopped  proceed my charlotte no reserves to your nearest friend  yet he has his and i have winded and winded about him as he had done about me but all to no purpose  nevertheless he has found means insensibly to set me on again with my own story till i had told him all i knew of the matter and all the time i was intending only that my frankness should be an example to him when he instead of answering my wishes doublelocked the door of his heart and left not so much as the keyhole uncovered by which i might have peeped into it and this in one or two points that i thought it imported me to know and then have i been ready to scold  now this reserve to such a sister and in points that she thinks it imports her to know is what i do not like in sir charles a friend as well as sister ought there to be a secret on on side when there is none on the other very likely he would be as reserved to a wife and is not marriage the highest state of friendship that mortals can know and can friendship and reserve be compatible surely no  his sister who cannot think he has one fault excuses him and says that her brother has no other view in drawing her on to reveal her own heart but the better to know how to serve and oblige her  but then might not the same thing be said in behalf of the curiosity of so generous a sister or is sir charles so conscious of his own superiority as to think he can give advice to her but wants not hers to him or thinks he meanly of our sex and highly of his own yet there are but two years difference in their age and from sixteen to twentyfour i believe women are generally more than two years aforehand with the men in ripeness of understanding though after that time the men may ripen into a superiority  this observation is not my own for i heard a very wise man once say that the intellects of women usually ripen sooner than those of men but that those of men when ripened like trees of slow growth generally hold longer are capable of higher perfection and serve to nobler purposes  sir charles has seen more of the world it may be said than his sister has he has traveled but is not human nature the same in every country allowing only for different customs  do not love hatred anger malice all the passions in short good or bad show themselves by like effects in the faces hearts and actions of the people of every country and let men make ever such strong pretensions to knowledge from their farfetched and dearbought experience cannot a penetrating spirit learn as much from the passions of a sir hargrave pollexfen in england as it could from a man of the same or the like ill qualities in spain in france or in italy and why is the grecian homer to this day so much admired as he is in all these nations and in every other nation where he has been read and will be to the worlds end but because he writes to nature and is not the language of nature one language throughout the world though there are different modes of speech to express it by  but i shall go out of my depth all i mean and from the frankness of my own heart you will expect from me such a declaration is that i do not love that a man so nearly perfect be his motives what they will should have reserves to such a sister dont you think lucy that this seems to be a kind of fault in sir charles grandison dont you think that it would mingle some fear in a sisters love of him and should ones love of so amiable a brother be dashed or allayed with fear he is said to be a good man and a good man i dare say he is what secrets can a good man have that such a sister living with him in the same house and disdaining not but on the contrary priding herself in the title of her brothers housekeeper should not be made acquainted with will a man so generous look upon her as he would upon a mere housekeeper  does not confidence engage confidence  and are they not by nature as well as inclination friends  but i fancy i am acting the world in its malevolence as well as impertinence that world which thinks itself affronted by great and superior merit and takes delight to bring down exalted worth to its own level but at least you will collect from what i have written an instance of my impartiality and see that though bound to sir charles by a tie of gratitude which never can be dissolved i cannot excuse him if he be guilty of a diffidence and reserve to his generous sister which she is above showing to him  if i am allowed to be so happy as to cultivate this desirable acquaintance and i hope it is not their way to leave those whom they have relieved and raised in order to shine upon and bless only new objects of compassion then will i closely watch every step of this excellent man in hope however to find him as perfect as report declares him that i may fearlesly make him my theme as i shall delight to make his sister my example and if i were to find any considerable faults in him never fear my dear but my gratitude will enlarge my charity in his favor but i shall at the same time arm my heart with those remembered failings lest my gratitude should endanger it and make me a hopeless fool  now my uncle do not be very hard on your niece i am sure very sure that i am not in danger as yet and indeed i will tell you by my lucy whenever i find out that i am spare therefore my dear uncle selby all your conjectural constructions  and indeed you should in pity spare me my dear sir at present for my spirits are still weak i have not yet forgiven myself for the masquerade affair especially since mr reeves has hinted to me that sir charles grandison as he judges from what he dropped about that foolish amusement approves not of masquerades and yet selfpartiality has suggested several strong pleas in my favor indeed by way of extenuation only how my judge conscience will determine upon those pleas when counsel has been heard on both sides i cannot say yet i think that an acquittal from this brother and sister would go a great way to make my conscience easy  i have not said one half of what i intended to say of this extraordinary man but having imagined from the equal love i have to his admirable sister that i had found something to blame him for my impartiality has carried me out of my path and i know not how to recover it without going a great way back let therefore what i have further to say mingle in with my future narratives as new occasions call it forth  but yet i will not suffer any other subject to interfere with that which fills my heart with the praises the due praises of this worthy brother and sister to which i intended to consecrate this rambling and very imperfect letter and which here i will conclude with assurances however needless i hope they are of duty love and gratitude where so much due from  your harriet byron  letter xxxvii miss byron in continuation feb    and    now have i near a week to go back my lucy with my current narrative having been thrown behindhand by the long letters i have been obliged to write to give you an account of my distress of my deliverance of the characters of this noble brother and sister and a multitude of coincidences and reflections which all my dear friends expect as they fall in from the pen of their harriet and this letter shall therefore be a kind of diary of that week only that i will not repeat what my cousin revees has told me he has written  on monday i was conducted home in safety by my kind protector and his amiable sister  mrs reeves lady betty and miss clements are in love with them both  my cousin has told you how much they disappointed us in declining to stay dinner what shall we do if they are not as fond of our company as we are of theirs we are not used to be slighted you know and to be slighted by those we love there can be no earing of that but i hope this will not be the case  at tea the name of sir rowland meredith carried me instantly down  mr reeves had old the good knight on his calling on the friday saturday sunday and on this day bfre we returned from colnebrooke that i had been overfatigued at the masquerade on thursday night and so i was and was gone a little way out of town caried he should have said i was carried with a wtness  sir rowland took notice that i must have had a smart illness for the time by my altered countenance you are and must be ever lovely miss byron but i think you look not quite so serene you dont look so composed as you used to do but i was afraid you were denied to my longing sight i was afraid you would let your papa go down to caermarthen without giving him an opportunity to bless his cross girl it is in vain i fear to urge you  he stopped and looked full in my face  pray sir rowland said i how does my brother fowler  why ay that is the duce of it your brother fowler but as the honest man says so say i i will not teaze you but never never will you have  but no more of that  i come to take my leave of you i should have set out this very morning could i have seen you on saturday or yesterday but i shall go tomorrow morning early you are glad of that madam i am sure  indeed sir rowland i shall always respect and value you and i hope i shall have your good wishes sir   yes yes madam you need not doubt it and i will humble all the proud women in wales by telling them of miss byron  you tell me my lucy that you were all moved at one of the conversations i gave you between the knight mr fowler and myself  were i to be as particular in my account of what passed on sir rowlands taking leave of me as i was on that other occasion and were you to judge by the effect his honest tenderness had on me as i craved his blessing and as he blessed me the big tears unheeded by himself straying down his reverend cheeks i think you would have been in like manner affected  mr fowler is to go down after him  if  if  if said the knight looking fervently in my face   i should be glad i said to see and to wish my brother a good journey  tuesday morning early i had a kind enquiry after my rest from miss grandison in her brothers name as well as in her own and about eleven oclock came the dear lady herself she would run up stairs to me following sally  in her dressing room say you  she shall not come down  she entered with the maid  writing my dear said she i one day hope my harriet you will show me all you write  there there sitting down by me no bustle and how does my fair friend  well  i see very well  to a lover  or of a lover  that is the same thing   thus sweetly familiar ran she on  mrs reeves entered excuse me madam said miss grandison this is but one of my flying visits as i call them my next shall be to you but perhaps i may not make it in form neither we are relations you know how does mr reeves he is a good man at home   he is madam and will be rejoiced   i know he will  why madam this our byron our harriet i should say looks charmingly  you had best lock her up there are many more sir hargraves in the world than there are miss byrons  she told me that sir charles had set out that morning early for canterbury he will be absent two or three days said she he charged me with his compliments he did nothing but talk of his newfound sister from the time he parted with you i shall promote your interest with him in order to strengthen my own i want to find him out  some loveengagements i suppose madam said mrs reeves  it is impossible but the ladies   the ladies ay that is the thing the duce is in them they will not stay to be asked these men the best of them love nothing but what is attended with difficulty but all his lovematters he keeps to himself yet knows all mine  except one little entanglement  mr reeves hears not what we say looking about her but you my dear shall reveal to me your sneaking passion if you have one and i will discover mine  but not to you mrs reeves no married women shall i trust with what lies in the innermost fold of my heart your husbands are always the wiser for what you know though they can keep their own counsel and then harriet satanlike the ungenerous wretches becoming both tempters and accusers laugh at us and make it wonderful for a woman to keep a secret  the ladies will not stay to be asked lucy  an odd hint  these men the best of them love nothing but what comes to them with difficulty  he keeps all his love matters to himself all my lucy  but indeed she had said before that if sir charles married half a dozen hearts would be broken  this is nothing to me indeed but once more i wonder why a man of a turn so laudable should have any secrets the more a good man permits any one to know of his heart the more good he might do by way of example  and has he can he have so many lovesecrets and yet will he not let them transpire to such a sister  whom and so she once hinted it imported to know something of them but he knows best i am very impertinent to be more concerned for his sister than she is for herself but i do love her and one can no more bear to have those slighted whom we love than ones self  it is very difficult lucy to know ones self i am afraid i have a little spice of censoriousness in my temper which i knew nothing of till now but no it is not censoriousness neither i cannot be so mean as to be censorious and yet i can now methinks for the first time a little account for those dark spirits who may be too much obliged and who despairing to be able ever to return the obligation are ready to quarrel with the obliger  spiteful men say that we women know not ourselves know not our own hearts i believe there is something of truth in the aspersion but as men and women are brothers and sisters as i may say are not the men equally censurable and should not we women say so were we to be as spiteful as they must it needs be that a daughter of the same father and mother must be more silly more unsteady more absurd more impertinent than her brother  i hope not  mrs reeves not knowing as she said afterward but miss grandison might have something to say to me withdrew  i believe i told you last sunday said miss grandison of a cousin that we have a goodnatured young fellow he supped with us last night sir charles was so full of your praises yet not letting him into your history that he is halfwild to see you  god forbid thought i when she had gone only thus far that this cousin should be proposed  what an easy thing is it my lucy to alarm a woman on the side of her vanity  he breakfasted with me this morning continued she after sir charles had set out and knowing that i intended to make you a flying visit he besought me to take him with me but i would not my dear bring an inundation of new admirers upon you he has a great acquaintance and is very hold though not indecent he is thought to be a modern wit you must know and to speak after an admirable writer a minute philosopher and thinks he has something to say for himself when his cousin is not present before sir charles arrived and when we were in expectation of his coming being apprisd that sir charles had a serious turn he threatened to play upon him and as he phrased it to bamboozle him for these wits and witlings have a language peculiar to themselves but on sir charless arrival in two conversations he drew in his horns as we say and now reverences those good qualities which however he has not the grace to imitate now i will not answer but you may have a visit from him to see the loveliest woman in england if he comes see him or not as you please and think not yourself under any civil obligation to my brother or me to go out of your own way but i hope he will not be so impertinent i dont wish you to see him out of my brothers company because you will see him then to his own advantage and yet he has such a notion that we women love to be admired and to have handsome things said to us that he imagines the visit of a man made for that purpose will give him as free a welcome to the finest woman in the world as painters give to those who come to see their pictures and for the like reason but no more of mr grandison yet i thought proper to prepare you if he should take so confident a liberty  i thanked her  well but my dear you seem to have a long parcel of writing before you one two three four  eight leaves  upon my word  but mr reeves told me you are a writer and that you gave an account of all that befell you to our grandmother shirley to our uncle and aunt selby to our cousins lucy and nancy  you see i remember every name and will you one day let me see what you write  most willingly madam   madam interrupted she so formal charlotte say with all my heart my everamiable my everkind charlotte  so so  well may the men say we love flattery when rather than want it we will flatter one another  i was going to disclaim flattery hush hush hush my dear i doubt not your sincerity you are a grateful and good girl but dare you will you show me all and everything about that greville that orme that fowler that fenwick  you see i forget none of the names that your cousin reeves told me of on saturday last and which i made you talk of last sunday  all and everything miss grandison but will you tell me of your gentleman  will i no doubt of it how can young women be together one quarter of an hour and not lead one another into talk of their lovers lord my dear those secrets sir charles once said are the cement of young womens friendships  and could sir charles   could sir charles  yes yes yes do you think a man can be a judge of human nature and leave women out of the question why my dear he finds us out in a minute take care of yourself harriet  if   i shall be afraid of him   what if you have a good conscience my dear  she then looked very archly she made me blush she looked more archly i blushed i believe a deeper dye  did i not tell you lucy that she could do what she pleased with her eyes  but what did she mean by this  in my conscience my harriet little or much i believe we women are all rogues in our hearts  and does miss grandison say that from her own conscience  i believe i do but i must fly i have ten more visits to pay before i go home to dress you will tell me all about your fellows you say  and you will tell me about your entanglement as you called it  why that is a difficulty upon me but you must encourage me by your freedom and we will take up our wretches and lay them down again one by one as we run them over and bid them lie still and be quiet till we recall them to our memory  but i have not one lover my charlotte to tell you of i always gave them their dismission   and i have but two that at present i care to own and they will not be dismissed but then i have half a dozen i believe that have said extravagant things to me and we must look upon them as lovers elect you know who only want to be coquetted with  miss grandison i hope cannot think of coquetting  not much only a little nowandthen to pay the men in their own coin  charming vivacity said i i shall be undone if you dont love me  no fear no fear of that  i am a whimsical creature but the sun is not more constant in his course than i am steady in my friendships and these communications on both sides will rivet us to each other if you treat me not with reserve  she arose to go in a hurry abate my bear charlotte of half your other visits and favor me with your company a little longer  give me some chocolate then and let me see your cousin reevess i like them of the ten visits six of the ladies will be gone to sales or to plague tradesmen and buy nothing anywhere rather than at home the devils at home is a phrase and our modern ladies live as if they thought so two of the other four called upon me and hardly alighted i shall do so by them the other two i shall have paid my compliments to in one quarter of an hour  i rang for chocolate and to beg my cousins company  they wanted but the word in they came my apartment which the was pleased to admire then became the subject of a few moments conversation and then a much better took place sir charles i mean  i asked if her brother had any relations at canterbury  i protest i dont know said she but this i know that i have none there did i not hint to you that sir charles has his secrets  but he sometimes loves to play with my curiosity he knows i have a reasonable quantity of that  were i his sister   then you must do as he would have you harriet i know him to be steady in his purposes but he is besides so good that i give up anything to oblige him   your entanglement charlotte asked i smiling mr reeves knows nothing from that word  why yes my entanglement and yet i hate to think of it so no more of that it is the only secret i have kept from him and that is because he has no suspicion of the matter if he had though my life were to be the forfeit i believe he would have it  she told us that she expected us soon to dine with her in st jamess square but that she must fix sir charles i hope said she you will often drop in upon me as i will upon you from this time we will have nothing but conversationvisits between us and we will leave the modern world to themselves and be queen elizabeths women i am sorry to tell you  let me whisper it   and she did but loud enough for every one to hear although i follow the fashion and make one fool the more for it i despise above one half of the women i know  miss grandison affectedly whispered i again should not do so because her example is of weight enough to mend them  i will be hanged if miss byron thinks so rewhisperd she the age is too far gone nothing but a national calamity can do it but let me tell you that at the same time i despise more than one half of the men but speaking out you and i will try to think ourselves wiser than anybody else and we shall have this comfort we shall not easily find any of our sex who by their superior wisdom will give us reason to think ourselves mistaken  but adieu adieu and adieu my agreeable friends let me see you and you and you turning to each of the three as often as is convenient without ceremony and remember we have been acquainted these hundred years  away she hurried forbidding me to go out of my apartment mrs reeves could not overtake her mr reeves had much ado to be in time to make his compliments she was in her chariot before he could offer his hand  how pretty it was my lucy in miss grandison to remember the names of all my dear friends she told me indeed on sunday that she should  if traveling into foreign countries gives ease and politeness would not one think that miss grandison has visited every european court as well as her brother if she has not was it necessary for sir charles to go abroad to acquire that freedom and ease which his sister has so happily attained without stirring out of the kingdom  these men had not best despise us lucy there is not i hope so much difference in the geniuss of the two sexes as the proud ones among theirs are apt to imagine especially when you draw comparisons from equal degrees in both  o mr walden take care of yourself if ever again you and i meet at lady bettys  but this abominable sir hargrave not one word more of meeting at lady bettys there saw i first the wretch that still on recollection strikes terror into my heart  wednesday a visit from miss clements and lady betty took me off my writing about two hours yet i overwrit myself and was obliged to lie down for about two more at night we had sir john allestree and his nephew and miss allestree and miss clements and lady betty at supper and cards but my stomach paining me about eleven i was permitted to retire to bed  on thursday i finished my letters relating my distresses and deliverance it was a dreadful subject i rejoiced when i had concluded it  the same day mr reeves received sir charless letter enclosing that of the wretched wilson i have often heard my grandfather observe that men of truly great and brave spirits are most tender and merciful and that on the contrary men of base and low minds are cruel tyrannical insolent wherever they have power what this short letter so full of lenity of mercy of generous and humane care for the future good of a criminal and extended to unborn families as well as to all his acquaintance and friends in being enables one to judge of the truly heroic sir charles grandison and what i have experienced of the low grovelling unmanly insults of sir hargrave pollexfen i a poor defenseless silly girl tricked into his power are flagrant proofs of the justice of the observation  i wish with all my heart that the best woman in the world were queen of a great nation and that it were in my power for the sake of enlarging sir charless ability to do good to make him her consort then am i morally sure that i should be the humble means of making a whole people happy  but as we had all been informed from other hands of sir hargraves threatenings of sir charless life wilsons postscript has fastened a weight on my heart that will not be removed till the danger is overblown  this day i had miss grandisons compliments with tender enquiries brought me and a desire that as she supposed my first visit would be one of thankful duty meaning to church for so i had told her it should my next might be to her  yesterday i received the welcome packet from so many kind friends and i prosecuted with the more vigor for it my writingtask how easily do we glide into subjects that please us  how swiftly flies the pen  the characters of sir charles and of miss grandison were the subjects and i was amazed to find how much i had written in so short a time  miss grandison sent me in the evening of this day her compliments joined with those of her brother who was but just returned from canterbury  i wonder what sir charles could do at canterbury so many days and to have nobody there whom his sister knows  she would have made me a visit she sent me word but that as she expected her brother in the morning she had intended to have brought him with her she added that this morning saturday they should both set out for colnebrooke in hopes of the earl and countess of l arriving there as this night from scotland  do you think lucy it would not have been generous in sir charles to have made one visit before he set out for so many days to that canterbury to the creature on whom he had laid such an obligation i can only mean as to the civility of the thing you must think since he was so good to join in nay to propose the farther intimacy as a brother and friend and soforth  i wish that sir charles be as sincere in his professions as his sister he may in his travels possibly he may have mistaken some gay weeds for fine flowers and picked them up and brought them with him to england and yet if he has done so he will even then be superior to thousands who travel and bring home nothing but the weeds of foreign climates  he once said as miss grandison told me that the countess of l is still a more excellent woman than my charlotte ah sir charles you can tell fibs i believe i will not forgive in you those slighter deviations which we are too apt to pass by in other even tolerable men  i wish you may be in earnest my good sir in proposing to cultivate an intimate friendship with me as that of a brother to a sister shake your head my lucy if you will i mean no more that i may be entitled to tell you your faults as i see them in your sister harriet you shall find though a respectful yet an openeyed monitor our charlotte thinks you cannot be wrong in anything  all i fear is that sir charless tenderness was designed to be excited only while my spirits were weak yet he bespoke a brotherly relation to me before mr reeves when he brought me home and supposed me stolen from his family in my infancy that was going farther than was necessary if he thought to drop the fraternal character soon  but might not my own behavior alarm him the kind the considerate man is perhaps compassionate in his intention not distinguishing aright my bashful gratitude and downcast eye he might be afraid lest i should add one to the halfscore that his sister says will die if he marry  if this be so what my dear will your harriet deserve if his caution does not teach her some  after all i believe these men in general think our hearts are made of strange combustible materials a spark struck a match thrown in  but the best of men this admirable man will i hope find himself mistaken if he think so of your harriet  what ails me that i am grown such a boaster surely this horrid attempt of sir hargrave has not affected my brain methinks i am not some how or other as i used to be in my head or heart i know not which  do you lucy bring me back again by your reminding love if you think there is any alteration in your harriet for the worse and the rather as it may prevent my uncle   but what makes me so much more afraid of my uncle than i used to be  yet men in their raillery dont however read this paragraph to him are so  i dont know how  so untender  but let me fall into the hands of my indulgent grandmamma and aunt selby and into your gentle hands and all will be as it should be  but what was my subject before this last seized and ran away with my pen i did not use to wander thus when i had a beaten path before me o this vile vile sir hargrave if i have a fault in my head that did not use to be there it is entirely owing to him i am sure my heart is not wrong  but i can write nothing now but of miss grandison and her brother what entirely new scenes are opened to me by my distress  may i have cause as sir charles wished to reap good from the evil  i will endeavor to bring miss clements into an acquaintance with these worthie that is to say if i have myself the interest to preserve my footing in their favor  lady betty resolves to recommend herself she will be acquainted with them she says whether they will or not and yet i could not bear for lady betty that she should be slighted by those whom she dotes upon that surely is one of the heaviest of evils and yet selflove where it is evidently inherent will enable one to get over it i believe pretty soon though nothing but that and pride can in such of some use therefore you will be apt to say are pride and selflove why yes and so they are where they are a part of a persons habit but o my lucy will not a native humility render this pride whose genuine offspring are resentment and ill will absolutely unnecessary and procure for us unmingled with mortification the esteem we wish for in the hearts of the worthy  as to the rest of my new acquaintance in town who till i knew this admirable sister and brother took up so much of my paper though some of them are doubtless very worthy adieu  that is to say as chosen subjects  adieu says  your harriet byron  letter xxxviii miss byron to miss selby saturday night lord have mercy upon me my dear  what shall i do  the vile sir hargrave has sent a challenge to sir charles  what may be the event  o that i had not come to london  this is a copy of the letter that communicates it it is from that bagenhall but this is the copy of the letter  i will endeavor to transcribe it  but no i cannot  my sally shall write it over lord bless me what shall i do  to miss byron cavendishsquare feb    madam you might easily believe that the affair betwixt sir hargrave pollexfen and sir charles grandison could not after so violent an insult as the former received from the latter end without consequences  by all that is sacred sir hargrave knows not that i write  there is but one way that i can think of to prevent bloodshed and that madam seems to be in your own power  sir hargrave insists upon it that he meant you nothing but honor you know the use or abuse of the power he had obtained over you if he behaved with indecency he tells me not the truth  to make a young lady whatever were her merit the wife of a man of near  0000 l a year and who had declared himself absolutely disengaged in her affections was not doing dishonor to her so much as to himself in the violent measures his love obliged him to take to make her so  now madam as sir charles grandison was utterly a stranger to you as sir hargrave intended so honorably by you and as you are not engaged in your affections if you will consent to be lady pollexfen and if sir charles grandison will ask pardon for his unprovoked knighterrantry i will not be sir hargraves second in the affair if he refuse to accept of such satisfaction in full for the violence he sustained  i solemnly repeat that sir hargrave knows nothing of my writing to you you may but i insist upon it as in confidence to everybody else consult your cousin reeves on the subject your honor given that you will in a months time be sir hargraves will make me exert all my power with him and i have reason to think that is not small to induce him to compromise on those terms  i went to sir charless house yesterday afternoon with a letter from sir hargrave sir charles was just stepping into his chariot to his sister he opened it and with a civility that became his character told me he was just going with his sister to colnebrooke to meet dear friends on their return from scotland that he should return on monday that the pleasure he should have with his longabsent friends would not permit him to think of the contents till then but that the writer should not fail of such an answer as a gentleman ought to give  now madam i was so much charmed with sir charles grandisons sine person and politeness and his character is so extraordinary that i thought this interval between this night and monday morning an happy one and i took it into my head to make the above proposal to you and i hope you will think it behooves you as much as it does me to prevent the fatal mischief that may otherwise happen to men of their consideration  i have not the honor of being personally known to you madam but my character is too generally established for any one to impute to me any other motives for this my application to you than those above given a line left for me at sir hargraves in cavendishsquare will come to the hands of madam  your most obedient humble servant james bagenhall   o my dear what a letter  mr reeves mrs reeves are grieved to the heart mr reeves says that if sir hardgrave insists upon it sir charles is obliged in honor to meet him  murderous vile word honor what at this rate is honor the very opposite to duty goodness piety religion and to every thing that is or ought to be sacred among men  how shall i look miss grandison in the face miss grandison will hate me to be again the occasion of endangering the life of such a brother  but what do you think  lady betty is of opinion  mr reeves has consulted lady betty williams in confidence  lady betty says that if the matter can be prevented  lord bless me she says i ought to prevent it  what by becoming the wife of such a man as sir hargrave so unmanly so malicious so low a wretch  what does lady betty mean  yet were it in my power to save the life of sir charles grandison and i refused to do it for selfish reasons refused for the sake of my worldly happiness when there are thousands of good wives who are miserable with bad husbands  but will not the sacrifice of my life be accepted by this sanguinary man that with all my heart would i make no scruple to lay down if the wretch will plunge a dagger in my bosom and take that for satisfaction i will not hesitate one moment  but my cousin said that he was of opinion that sir charles would hardly be brought to ask pardon how can i doubt said i that the vile man if he may be induced by this bagenhall to compromise on my being his wife will dispense with that punctilio and wreak on me were i to be his unhappy property his whole unmanly vengeance is he not spiteful mean malicious  but abhorred be the thought of my yiedling to be the wife of such a man  yet what is the alternative were i to die that wretched alternative would still take place his malice to the best of men would rather be whetted than blunted by my irrevocable destiny o my lucy violent as my grief was dreadful as my apprehensions were and unmanly as the treatment i met with from the base man i never was distressed till now  but should miss grandison advise should she insist upon my compliance with the abhorred condition and has she not a right to insist upon it for the sake of the safety of her innocent brother can i then refuse my compliance with it  are we not taught that this world is a state of trial and of mortification and is not calamity necessary to wean our vain hearts from it and if my motive be a motive of justice and gratitude and to save a life much more valuable to the world than my own and which but for me had not been in danger  ought i  and yet  ah my lucy what can i say  how unhappy that i cannot consult this dear lady who has such an interest in a life so precious as i might have done had she been in town  o lucy what an answer as this unwelcome this wicked mediator gives it was that which the excellent man returned to the delivered challenge  i am going to meet dear friends on their return from scotland what a meeting of joy will be here saddened over if they know of this shocking challenge and how can his noble heart overflow with pleasure on the joyful occasion as it would otherwise have done with such an important event in suspense that may make it the last meeting which this affectionate and most worthy of families will ever know how near may be the life of this dear brother to a period when he congratulates the safe arrival of his brother and sister and who can bear to think of seeing ere one week is overpast the now rejoicing and harmonious family clad in mourning for the first of brothers and first of men and i my lucy i the wretched harriet byron to be the cause of all  and could the true hero say that the pleasure he should have on meeting his long absent friends would not permit him to think of the contents of such a letter till monday but that then the writer should not fail of such an answer  as a gentleman ought to give  o my dear sir charles on this occasion he is and ought to be very dear to me how i dread the answer which vile custom and false honor will oblige you as a gentleman to give and is there no way with honor to avoid giving such an answer as distracts me to be told as mr reeves tells me must be given if i your harriet interpose not to the sacrifice of all my happiness in this life  but mr reeves asks may not this bagenhall though he says sir hargrave knows nothing of his writing have written in concert with him  what if he has does not the condition remain and will not the resentment on the refusal take place  and is not the challenge delivered into sir charless hands and has he not declared that he will send an answer to it on monday this is carrying the matter beyond contrivance or stratagem sir charles so challenged will not let the challenger come off so easily he cannot in real honor now make proposals for qualifying or accepting of them if made to him and is not monday the next day but one  only that day between for which i had been preparing my grateful heart to return my silent praises to the almighty in the place dedicated to his honor for so signal a deliverance and now is my safety to be owing as it may happen to a much better persons destruction  i was obliged to lay down my pen  see how the blisterd paper  it is too late to send away this letter if it were not it would be barbarous to torment you with it while the dreadful suspense holds  sunday morning i am unable to write on in the manner i used to do not a moment all the past night did i close my eyes how they are swelled with weeping i am preparing however to go to church there will i renew my fervent prayers that my grateful thanksgiving for the past deliverance may be blessed to me in the future event  mr reeves thinks that no step ought to be or can be taken in this shocking affair till sir charles returns or miss grandison can be consulted he has taken measures to know every motion of the vile sir hargrave  lord bless me my dear the man has lost three of his foreteeth a man so vain of his person o how must he be exasperated  mr reeves also will be informed of sir charless arrival the moment he comes to town he has private information that the furious sir hargrave has with him a mn skilled in the science of offense with whom he is praising  o my dear how this distracts me  for mr reeves or me to answer this bagenhall mr reeves says is not to be thought of as he is a wicked man and was not likely to have written the  from good principles i once indeed proposed to wte  i know not what to do what to propose  can you write said mr reeves and promise or give hope to sir hargrave  o no no answered i  if you could it is my opinion that sir charles and his sister would both despise you however selfdenying and laudable your motive might be  letter xxxix miss byron in continuation monday morning feb    what a dreadful day was yesterday to me and what a still worse night had i if possible than the former my prayers i doubt cannot be heard since they have not that affiance with them that they used to be attended with how happy was i before i came to london i cannot write i cannot do anything mr reeves is just informed that sir charles and lord l and the two sisters arrived in town late last night o my lucy to return such an answer i doubt as sir charles thinks a gentleman ought to send good heaven how will this day end  eight oclock i have received this moment the following billet  my dear harriet prepare yourself for a new admirer my sister l and i are resolved to breakfast with you unless you forbid us by the bearer if we find you to have made an attempt to alter your usual morning appearance we shall suspect you of a desire to triumph over us in the consciouness of your suprior graces it is a sudden resolution you should have had otherwise notice last night and yet it was late fore we came to town  have you been good are you quite recovered but in half an hour i hope to ask you an hundred thousand questions  compliments to our cousins  chapter gr   here is a sweet sprightly billet miss grandison cannot know the countess cannot know anything of the dreadful affair that has given to my countenance and i am sure will continue on it an appearance that did i not always dress when i arose for the morning would make me regardless of that miss grandison hints at  what joy at another time would the honor of this visit have given us but even now we have a melancholy pleasure in it just such a one as the sorrowing friends of the desperatesick experience on the comingin of a longexpected physician although they are in a manner hopless of his success but a coach stops   i ran to the dining room window o my dear it is a coach but only the two ladies good god  sir charles at this moment at this moment my boding heart tells me   twelve oclock my heart is a little lighter yet not unapprehensive  take my narrative in course as i shall endeavor to give you the particulars of everything that passed in the last more than agreeable three hours  i had just got down into the great parlour before the ladies entered mr reeves waited on them at their coach he handed in the countess miss grandison in a charming humor entered with them there lady l first know our cousin reeves said she   the countess after saluting mrs reeves turned to me  there lady l said miss grandison that is the girl that is our harriet  her ladyship saluted me  but how now said miss grandison looking earnestly in my face how now harriet  excuse me lady l taking my hand i must reckon with this girl leading me to the window  how now harriet  those eyes  mr reeves cousin mrs reeves what is to do here   lively and everamiable miss grandison thought i how will byandby all this sweet sunshine in your countenance be shut in  come come i will know proceeded she making me sit down and taking my hand as she sat by me her fan in the other hand i will know the whole of this matter  that is my dear for i tried to smile  an april eye  would to heaven the month was come which my harriets eye anticipates  i sighed well but why that heavy sigh said she  our grandmother shirley   i hope madam is very well  our aunt selby our uncle selby our lucy  all well i hope  what a duce ails the girl then take care i dont have cause to beat you  have any of your fellows hanged themselves  and are you concerned they did not sooner find the rope  but come we will know all byandby  charlotte said the countess approaching me i stood up you oppress our new sister i wish my dear you would borrow a few of our younger sisters blushes let me take you out of this lively girls hands i have much ado to keep her down though i am her elder sister nobody but my brother can manage her  miss grandison madam is all goodness  we have been all disturbed said mrs reeves i was glad to be helped out in the fear that sir hargrave pollexfen   o madam he dare not he will not  he will be glad to be quiet if you will let him said the countess  it was plain they knew nothing of the challenge  you have not heard anything particular asked miss grandison of sir hargrave  i hope your brother madam has not answered i  not a word i dare say  you must believe ladies said i that i must be greatly affected were anything likely to happen to my deliverer as all must have been laid at my door such a family harmony to be interrupted   come said miss grandison this is very good of you this is like a sister but i hope my brother will be here byandby  and lord l added the obliging countess wants to see you my dear come my love if charlotte is naught we will make a party against her and she shall be but my secondbest sister i hope my lord and sir charles will come together if they can but shake off wicked everard as we call a kinsman whom sir charles has no mind to introduce to you without your leave  but well not stay breakfast for them said miss grandison they were not certain and desired we would not  come come get us some breakfast lady l has been up before her hour and i have told you harriet that i am an early riser i dont choose to eat my gloves  but i must do something to divert my hunger and stepping to the harpsichord she touched the keys in such a manner as showed she could make them speak what language she pleased  i attended to her charming finger so did every one but breakfast coming in  no but i will not said she anticipating our requests and continuing the air by her voice ran to the table hang ceremony said she sitting down first let slower souls compliment and taking some muffing i will have breakfasted before these pray madams and pray my dears are seated  mad girl lady l called her these mrs reeves are always her airs with us but i thought she would have been restrained by the example of her sister harriet we have utterly spoiled the girl by our fond indulgence but charlotte is a good heart to be everywhere pleaded for a whimsical head  who sees not the elder sister in that speech replied miss grandison but i am the most generous creature breathing yet nobody sinds it out for why do i assume these silly airs but to make you lady l shine at my expense  still lucy the contents of that bagenhalls letter hung heavy at my heart but as i could not be sure but sir charles had his reasons for concealing the matter from his sisters i knew not how to enter directly into the subject but thought i cannot i fish something out for the quiet of my own heart and leave to sir charless discretion the manner of his revealing the matter to his sisters or otherwise  did your ladyship said i to lady l arrive on saturday i knew not how to begin at the hospitable house at colnebrooke my asylum  i did and shall have a greater value for that house than ever i had before for its having afforded a shelter to so valued a lady  you have been told ladies i suppose of that wilsons letter to sir charles  we have and rejoice to find that so deep a plot was so happily frustrated  his postscript gives me concern  what were the contents of it  that sir hargrave breathed nothing but revenge  sir charles told us nothing of that but it is not unlikely that a man so greatly disappointed should rave and threaten i am told that he is still either by shame or illness confined to his chamber  at that moment a chariot stopped at the door and instantly it is lord l and sir charles with him said miss grandison  i dared not to trust myself with my joy i hurried out at one of the doors as if i had forgot something as they entered at the other i rushed into the back parlour  thank god thank god said i  my gratitude was too strong for my heart i thought i should have fainted  do you wonder lucy at my being so much affected when i had been in such a dreadful suspense and had formed such terrible ideas of the danger of one of the best of men all owing to his serving and saveing me  surprises from joy i fancy and where gratitude is the principal spring are sooner recovered from than surprises which raise the more stormy passions mrs reeves came in to me my dear your withdrawing will be noticed i was just coming in said i and so i was i went in  sir charles bowed low to me so did my lord permit me madam said sir charles to present lord l to you he is our brother  our latefound sister harriet my lord  yes but sir charles said miss grandison miss byron and mr and mrs reeves have been tormenting themselves about a postscript to that footmans letter you told not us of that postscript  who minds postscripts charlotte except indeed to a ladys letter one word wih you good miss byron taking my hand and leading me to the window  how the fool colored i could feel my face glow  o lucy what a consciousness of inferiority fills a mind not ungenerous when it labors under the sense of obligations it cannot return  my sister charlotte madam was impatient to present to you her beloved sister lady l was as impatient to attend you my lord l was equally desirous to claim the honor of your acquaintance they insisted upon my introducing my lord i thought it was too precipitant a visit and might hurt your delicacy and make charlotte and me appear as if we had been ostentatiously boasting of the opportunities that had been thrown into our hands to do a very common service i think i see that you are hurt forgive me madam i will follow my own judgment another time only be assured of this that your merits and not the service have drawn this visit upon you  i could not be displeased at this polite address as it helped me to an excuse for behaving so like a fool as he might think since he knew not the cause  you are very obliging sir my lord and lady l do me great honor miss grandison cannot do anything but what is agreeable to me in such company i am but a common person but my gratitude will never let me look upon your seasonable protection as a common service i am only anxious for the consequences to yourself i should have no pretense to the gratitude i speak of if i did not own that the reported threatenings and what wilson writes by way of postscript have given me disturbance lest your safety should on my account be brought into hazard  miss byron speaks like herself but whatever were to be the consequences can you think madam that a man of any spirit could have acted otherwise than i did would i not have been glad that any man would have done just the same thing in favor of my sister charlotte could i behave with greater moderation i am pleased with myself on looking back and that i am not always there shall no consequences follow that i am not forced upon in my own necessary defense  we spoke loud enough to be heard and miss grandison joining us said but pray brother tell us if there be grounds to apprehend anything from what the footman writes  you cannot imagine but sir hargrave would bluster and threaten to lose such a prize so near as he thought himself to carrying his point must affect a man of his cast but are ladies to be troubled with words men of true courage do not threaten  shall i beg one word with you sir charles said my cousin reeves  they withdrew to the back parlour and there mr reeves who had the letter of that bagenhall showed it to him  he read it  a very extraordinary letter said he and gave it back to him  but pray what says miss byron to it  is she willing to take this step in consideration of my safety  you may believe sir charles she is greatly distressed  as a tenderhearted woman and as one who thinks already much too highly of what was done she may be distressed but does she hesitate a moment upon the part she ought to take does she not despise the writer and the writing  i thought miss byron   he stopped it seems and spoke and looked warm the first time said mr reeves that i thought sir charles on occasion passionate  i wish lucy that he had not stopped i wish he had said what he thought miss byron i own to you that it would go to my heart if i knew that sir charles grandison thought me a mean creature  you must think sir charles that miss byron   pray mr reeves forgive me for interrupting you what steps have been taken upon this letter  none sir  it has not been honored with notice not with the least notice  it has not  and could it be supposed by these mean men all men are mean mr reeves who can be premeditatedly guilty of a baseness that i would be brought to ask pardon for my part in this affair no man mr reeves would be more ready than myself to ask pardon even of my inferior had i done a wrong thing but never should a prince make me stoop to disavow a right one  but sir charles let me ask you has sir hargrave challenged you did this bagenhall bring you a letter  sir hargrave has bagenhall did but what of that mr reeves i promised an answer on monday i would not so much as think of setting pen to paper on such an account to interrupt for a moment the happiness i had hoped to receive in the meeting of a sister and her lord so dear to me an answer i have accordingly sent him this day  you have sent him an answer sir  i am in great apprehensions   you have no reason mr reeves i do assure you but let not my sisters nor lord l know of this matter why should i who cannot have a moments uneasiness upon it for my own sake have the needless fears and apprehensions of persons to whom i wish to give nothing but pleasure to contend with an imaginary distress to those who think it more than imaginary is a real one and i cannot bear to see my friends unhappy  have you accepted sir  have you   i have been two much engaged mr reeves in such causes as this i never drew my sword but in my own defense and when no other means could defend me i never could bear a designed insult i am naturally passionate you know not the pains it has cost me to keep my passion under but i have suffered too much in my afterregret when i have been hurried away by it not to endeavor to restrain its first sallies  i hope sir you will not meet   i will not meet any man mr reeves as a duellist i am not so much a coward as to be afraid of being branded for one i hope my spirit is in general too well known for any one to insult me on such an imputation forgive the seeming vanity mr reeves but i live not to the world i live to myself to the monitor within me  mr reeves applauded him with his hands and eyes but could not in words the heart spoke these last words said my good cousin how did his face seem to shine in my eyes  there are many bad customs mr reeves that i grieve for but for none so much as this of premeditated duelling where is the magnanimity of the man that cannot get above the vulgar breath how many fatherless brotherless sonless families have mourned all their lives the unhappy resort to this dreadful practice a man who defies his fellow creature into the field in a private quarrel must first desy his god and what are his hopes but to be a murderer to do an irreparable injury to the innocent family and dependents of the murdered  but since you have been let into the matter so far by the unaccountable letter you let me see i will show you sir hargraves to me  this is it pulling it out of his pocketbook  you did well sir charles grandison to leave your name my scoundrels were too far off their master to inform themselves by the common symbols who the person was that insulted an innocent man as to him innocent however on the highway you expected to hear from me it is evident and you should have heard before now had i been able from the effects of the unmanly surprise you took advantage of to leave my chamber i demand from you the satisfaction due to a gentleman the time your own provided it exceed not next wednesday which will give you opportunity i suppose to settle your affairs but the sooner the better the place if you have no objection kensington gravelpits i will bring pistols for your choice or you may for mine which you will the rest may be left to my worthy friend mr bagenhall who is so kind as to carry you this on my part and to some one whom you shall pitch upon on yours till when i am  your humble servant hargrave pollexfen saturday  i have a copy of my answer somewhere  here it is you will wonder perhaps mr reeves on such a subject as this to sind it a long one had sir hargrave known me better than he does six lines might have been sufficient  sir mr bagenhall gave me yours on saturday last just as i was stepping into my chariot to go out of town neither the general contents nor the time mentioned in it made it necessary for me to alter my measures my sister was already in the chariot i had not done well to make a woman uneasy i have many friends and i have great pleasure in promoting theirs i promised an answer on monday  my answer is this  i have ever refused and the occasion has happened too often to draw my sword upon a set and formal challenge yet i have reason to think from the skill i pretend to have in the weapons that in declining to do so i consult my conscience rather than my safety  have you any friends sir hargrave do they love you do you love them are you desirous of life for their sakes for your own  have you enemies to whom your untimely end would give pleasure  let these considerations weigh with you they do and always did with me i am cool you cannot be so the cool person on such an occasion as this should put the warm one on thinking this however as you please  but one more question let me ask you  if you think i have injured you is it prudent to give me a chance were it but a chance to do you a still greater injury  you were engaged in an unlawful enterprise if you would not have done by me in the same situation what i did by you you are not let me tell you sir hargrave the man of honor that a man of honor should be sollicituous to put upon a foot with himself  i took not an unmanly advantage of you sir hargrave you drew upon me i drew not in return you had a disadvantage in not quitting your chariot after the lunge you made at me you may be thankful that i made no use of it  i should not have been sorry had i been able to give the lady the protection she claimed with less hurt to yourself for i could have no malice in what i did although i had and have still a just abhorrence of the voilence you were guilty of to an helpless woman and who i have found since merited better treatment from you and indeed merits the best from all the world and whose life was endangered by the violence  i write a long letter because i propose only to write pardon me for repeating that the men who have acted as you and i have acted as well with regard to the lady as to each other cannot were their principles such as would permit them to meet meet upon a foot  let any man insult me upon my refusal and put me upon my defense and he shall find that numbers to my single arm shall not intimidate me yet even in that case i would much rather choose to clear myself of them as a man of honor should wish to do than either to kill or maim any man my life is not my own much less is another mans mine him who thinks differently from me i can despise as heartily as he can despise me and if such a one imagines that he has a title to my life let him take it but it must be in my own way not in his  in a word if any man has aught against me and will not be concluded by the laws of his country my goings out and comings in are always known and i am any hour of the day to be found or met with wherever i have a natural call my sword is a sword of defense not of offense a pistol i only carry on the road to terrify robbers and i have found a less dangerous weapon sometimes sufficient to repel a sudden insult and now if sir hargrave pollexfen be wise he will think himself obliged for this not unfriendly expostulation or whatever he pleases to call it to  his most humble servant charles grandison monday  mr reeves besought sir charles to let him show me these letters  you may mr reeves said he since i intend not to meet sir charles in the way he prescribes  as i asked not leave lucy to take copies of them i beg they may not be seen out of the venerable circle  i know i need not say how much i am pleased with the contents of the latter i doubt not but you all will be equally so yet as sir charles himself expects not that sir hargrave will rest the matter here and indeed says he cannot consistently with the vulgar notions of honor do you think i can be easy as all this is to be placed to my account  but it is evident that sir charles is he is governed by another set of principles than those of false honor and shows what his sister says to be true that he regards first his duty and then what is called honor how does the knowledge of these his excellencies raise him in my mind indeed lucy i seem sometimes to feel as if my gratitude had raised a throne or him in my heart but yet as for a dear friend as a beloved brother only my reverence for him is too great  assure yourself my dear that this reverence will always keep me right  sir charles and mr reeves returning into company the conversation took a general turn but oppressed with obligations as i am i could not be lively my heart as miss grandison says is i believe a proud one and when i thought of what might still happen who knows but from assassination in resentment of some very spirited strokes in sir charless letter as well as from the disgrace the wretch must carry in his face to the grave i could not but look upon this fine man who seemed to possess his own soul in peace sometimes with concern and even with tender grief on supposing that now lively and happy as he seemed to be and the joy of all his friends he might possibly and perhaps in a few hours  how can i put down my horrid thoughts  at other times indeed i cast an eye of some pleasure on him when he looked another way on thinking him the only man on earth to whom in such distress i could have wished to owe the obligations i am under to him his modest merit thought i will not make one uneasy he thinks the protection afforded but a common protection he is accustomed to do great and generous things i might have been obliged to a man whose fortune might have made it convenient for him to hope such advantages from the risque he run for me as prudence would have made objections to comply with not a little embarrassing to my gratitude  but here my heart is left free and o thought i nowandthen as i looked upon him sir charles grandison is a man with whom i would not wish to be in love i to have so many rivals he to be so much admired women not to stay till they are asked as miss grandison once said his heart must be proof against those tender sensations which grow into ardour and glow in the bosom of a man pursuing a first and only love  i warrant my lucy if the truth were known although sir charles has at canterbury or at one place or other his halfscore ladies who would break their hearts if he were to marry yet he knows not any one of them whom he loves better than another and all but right all but justice if they will not stay till they are asked  miss grandison invited mr and mrs reeves and me to dinner on wednesday and for the rest of the day and evening it was a welcome invitation  the countess expressed herself pleased with me poor and spiritless as was the figure which i made in this whole visit her prepossession in my favor from miss grandison must have been very great and generous  and will you not before now have expected that i should have brought you acquainted with the persons of lord and lady l as i am accustomed to give you descriptions of every one to whom i am introduced  to be sure we have say you  well but my mind has not always been in tune to gratify you and upon my word i am so much humbled with one thing and another that i have lost all that pertness i think which used to give such a liveliness to my heart and alertness to my pen as made the writing task pleasant to me because i knew that you all condescended to like the flippant airs of your harriet  lady l is a year older than sir charles but has that true female softness and delicacy in her features which make her perfectly lovely and she looks to be two or three years younger than she is she is tall and slender and enjoys the blessing of health and spirits in an high degree there is something of more dignity and sprightliness in the air and features of miss grandison than in those of lady l but there is in those of the latter so much sweetness and complacency that you are not so much afraid of her as you are of her sister the one you are sure to love at first sight the other you will be ready to ask leave to let you love her and to be ready to promise that you will if she will spare you and yet whether she will or not you cannot help it  lady l is such a wife i imagine as a good woman should wish to be thought the behavior of my lord to her and of her to my lord is free yet respectful affectionate but not apishly fond one sees their love for each other in their eyes all lovematches are not happy this was a match of love and does honor to it everybody speaks of lady l with equal affection and respect as a discreet and prudent woman miss grandison by her livelier manner is not so well understood in those lights as she ought to be and satisfied with the worthiness of her own heart is above giving herself concern about what the world thinks of it  lord l is not handsome but he is very agreeable he has the look of an honest good man and of a man of understanding and he is what he looks to be he is genteel and has the air of a true british nobleman one of those i imagine that would have been respected by his appearence and manners in the purest times an hundred or two years or how long ago  i am to have the familyhistory of this lord and lady on both sides and of their loves their difficulties and of the obligations they talk of being under to their brother to whom both my lord and lady behave with love that carries the heart in every word in every look  what my dear shall we say to this brother does he lay everybody that knows him under obligation and is there no way to be even with him in any one thing i long to have some intimate conversation with miss grandison by which i shall perhaps find out the art he has of making everybody proud of acknowledging an inferiority to him  i almost wish i could while i stay in town devote half my time to this amiable family without breaking in upon them so much as to be thought impertinent the other half ought to be with my kind cousin reevess i never shall make them amends for the trouble i have given them  how i long for wednesday to see all the family of the grandisons  they are all to be there  on several accounts i long for that day yet this sir hargrave   i have written my dear as usual very unreservedly i know that i lie more open than ever to my uncles observations but if he will not allow for weakness of heart of head and for having been frighted out of my wits and cruelly used and for further apprehensions and for the sense i have of obligations that never can be returned why then i must lie wholly at his mercy  but if he should find me to be ever so silly a creature i hope he will not make his particular conclusions general in disfavour of the sex  adieu my dear lucy  and in you adieu all the dear and revered friends benefactors lovers of  your harriet byron  letter xl mrs selby to miss harriet byron selbyhouse feb    my dearest harriet although we have long ago taken a resolution never to dictate to your choice yet we could not excuse ourselves if we did not acquaint you with any proposal that is made to us on your account that you might encourage it or otherwise as you thought fit  the dowager lady d wrote me a letter some time ago as you will see by the date but insisted that i should keep the contents a secret in my own bosom till she gave me leave to reveal it she has now given me that leave and requested that i will propose the matter to you i have since shown what has passed between her ladyship and me to your grandmamma mr selby and lucy they are all silent upon it for the same reasons that i give you not my opinion that is to say till you ask it  but do we not see my dearest child that something has happened within a very few days past that must distance the hope of every one of your admirers as they come to be acquainted with the circumstances and situation you are now in my dear love you will never be able to resist the impulses of that gratitude which always opened and expanded your worthy heart  your uncles tenderness for you on such a prospect has made him suppress his inclination to railly you he professes to pity you my dear while says he the sweet girl was vaunting herself and refusing this man and dismissing that and imagining herself out of the reach of the deity to which sooner or later all women bow i spared her not but now that i see she is likely to be over head and ears in the passion and has so much to be said for her excuse if she is caught and as our side must perhaps be the hoping side the gentlemans the triumphant i pity her too much for what may be the ease to teaze her with my animadversions especially after what she has suffered from the vile sir hargrave  by several hints in your letters it is impossible my dear that we can be beforehand with your inclinations young women in a beginning love are always willing to conceal themselves from themselves they are desirous to smother the fire before they will call out for help till it blazes and frequently becomes too powerful to be extinguished by any help they will call the passion by another name as gratitude suppose but my harriet gratitude so properly sounded as yours is can be but another name for love the object so worthy your own heart so worthy consent of minds must bring it to love on one side perhaps on both if the half score of ladies you have heard of are all of them but mere moderns but that my dear is not to be supposed since worthy hearts find out and assimilate with each other indeed those ladies may be such as are captivated with outward figure an handsome man need not to have the great qualities of a sir charles grandison to engage the hearts of the generality of our sex but a good man and an handsome man if he has the vivacity that distinguishes sir charles may marry whom he pleases if we women love an handsome man for the sake of our eye we must be poor creatures indeed if we love not good men for the sake of our hearts  what makes us apprehensive for you my harriet is this that we every one of us are in love ourselves with this fine young gentleman your uncle has fallen in with mr dawson an attorney of nottingham who acts for sir charles in some of his affairs and gives him such a character respecting his goodness to his tenants and dependents only as will render credible all that even the fondest love and warmest gratitude can say in his praise  we can hardly sometimes tell how to regret though your accounts of your sufferings and danger cut us to the heart as we read them the base attempt of sir hargrave were all to end as we wish we should not regret it but that my harriet is our fear what will become of me said your grandmamma if at last the darling of my heart should be entangled in an hopeless passion  if this is likely to be the case while the fire i spoke of is but smothering and while but here and there a spark escapes your strugging efforts to keep it down resolve my dear to throw cold water on it and quench it quite and how is this to be done but by changing your personal friendship with the amiable family into a correspondence by pen and ink and returning to our longing arms before the flame gets a head  when you are with us you may either give hope to the worthy orme or encourage the proposal i enclose as you please  as you are not capable of the mean pride of seeing a number of men in your train and have always been uneasy at the perseverance of mr fenwick and mr greville  as you have suffered so much from the natural goodness of your heart on the urgency of that honest man sir rowland meredith in his nephews favor and still more from the baseness of that wicked sir hargrave  as your good character and lovely person engage you more and more admirers  and lastly as it would be the highest comfort that your grandmamma and your uncle and i and all your friends and wellwishers could know to see you happily married  we cannot but wish for this pleasure and satisfaction the sooner you give it to us the better  but could there be any hope  you know what i mean  a royal diadem my dear would be a despicable thing in the comparison  adieu my best love you are called upon in my opinion to a greater trial than ever yet you knew of that prudence for which you have hitherto been so much applauded by every one and particularly by  your truly maternal marianna selby  letter xli from the countess dowager of d to mrs selby enclosed in the preceding jan    give me leave madam to address myself to you though personally unknown on a very particular occasion and at the same time to beg of you to keep secret even from mr selby and the party to be named as still more immediately concerned in the subject till i give my consent as no one creature of my family not even the earl of d my son does or shall from me till you approve of it  my lord has just entered into his twentyfifth year there are not many better young men among the nobility his minority gave an opportunity to me and his other trustees to put him in possession when he came of age of a very noble and clear estate which he has not impaired his person is not to be found fault with he has learning and is allowed to have good sense which every learned man has not his conduct his discretion in his travels procured him respect and reputation abroad you may make enquiry privately of all these matters  we are you must believe very sollicitous to have him happily married he is far from being an undutiful son indeed he was always dutiful a dutiful son gives very promising hopes of making a good husband he assures me that his affections are disengaged and that he will pay the most particular regard to my recommendation  i have cast about for a suitable wife for him i look farther than to the person of a woman though my lord will by no means have beauty left out in the qualifications of a wife i look to the family to whom a lady owes her education and trainingup quality however i stand not upon a man of quality you know confers quality on his wife an ancient and good gentlemans family is all i am sollicitous about in this respect in this light yours madam on all sides and for many descents is unexceptionable i have a desire if all things shall be found to be mutually agreeable to be related to it and your character as the young lady has been brought up under your eye is a great inducement with me  your niece byrons beauty and merits as well as sweetness of temper are talked of by everybody not a day passes but we hear of her to her great advantage now madam will you be pleased to answer me one qustion with that explicitness which the importance of the case and my own intended explicitness to you may require from woman to woman especially as i ask it of you in confidence  are then miss byrons affections absolutely disengaged we are very nice and must not doubt in this matter  this is the only question i will ask at present if this can be answered as i wish others in a treaty of this important nature will come into consideration on both sides  the favor of a line as soon as it will suit your convenience will oblige madam  your most faithful and obedient servant m d  letter xlii mrs selby to the countess dowager of d jan    madam i am greatly obliged to your ladyship for your good opinion of me and for the honor you do me and all our family in the proposed alliance  i will answer your ladyships question with the requisite explicitness  mr greville mr orme and mr fenwick all of this county have respectively made application to us for our interest and to miss byron for her favor but hitherto without effect though the terms each proposes might entitle him to consideration  miss byron professes to honor the married state and one day proposes to make some man happy in it if it be not his own fault but declares that she has not yet seen the man to whom with her hand she can give her heart  in truth madam we are all neutrals on this occasion we have the highest opinion of her discretion she has read she has conversed and yet there is not in the county a better housewife or one who would make a more prudent manager in a family we are all fond of her even to doting were she not our child we should love her for her good qualities and sweetness of manners and a frankness that has few examples among young women  permit me madam to add one thing about which miss byron in her turn will be very nice your ladyship is pleased to say that my lords affections are disengaged were his lordship a prince and hoped to succeed with her they must not be so after he had seen and conversed with her yet the future happiness and not pride would be the consideration with her for she has that diffidence in her own merits from which the worthy of both sexes cannot be totally free this diffidence would increase too much for her happiness were she to be thought of with indifference by any man on earth who hoped to be more than indifferent to her  as to other questions which as this is answered your ladyship thinks may come to be asked i choose unasked having no reserves to acquaint your ladyship that miss byron has not in her own power quite   000 l she has it is true reversionary expectations but we none of us wish that they should for many years take place since that must be by the death of mrs shirley her grandmother who is equally revered and beloved by all that know her and whose life is bound up in the happiness of her granddaughter  i will strictly obey your ladyship in the secrecy enjoined and am madam  your ladyships obliged and faithful humble servant marianna selby  letter xliii from the countess dowager of d to mrs selby feb    i should sooner have answered yours had i not waited for the return of my son who had taken a little journey into wales to look into the condition of a small estate he has there which he finds capable of great improvement and about which he has given proper orders  i took the first opportunity to question him in relation to his inclinations to marriage and whether he had a regard to any particular woman and having received an answer to my wishes i mentioned miss byron to him as a young lady that i should think from the general good character she bore would make him an excellent wife  he said he had heard her much talked of and always to her advantage i then showed him as in confidence my letter and your answer there can be said i on purpose to try him but one objection on your part and that is fortune   000 l to a nobleman who is possessed of   000 l a year and has been offered four times the portion may be thought very inadequate the less to be stood upon replied he where the fortune on my side is so considerable the very answer my dear mrs selby that i wished him to make  i asked him if i should begin a formal treaty with you upon what he said he answered that he had heard from every mouth so much said in praise of miss byrons mind as well as person that he desired i would and that i would directly endeavor to obtain leave for him to visit the young lady  i propose it accordingly i understand that she is at present in london i leave it to your choice madam and mrs shirleys and mr selbys to whom now as also to miss byron you will be so good as to communicate the affair whether you will send for her down to receive my lords visit and mine or whether we shall wait on her in town  i propose very high satisfaction to myself if the young people approve of each other in an alliance so much to my wishes in every respect i shall love the countess of d as well as any of you can do miss byron and as she has not at present a mother i shall with pleasure supply that tender relation to her for the sake of so many engaging qualities as common fame as well as good mrs selby says she is mistress of  you will dispatch an answer as to the interview i am impatient for it i depend much upon the frankness of the young lady which you make a part of her agreeable character and am madam  your affectionate and faithful humble servant m d  letter xliv miss byron to mrs selby london feb    indeed my dear and everindulgent aunt selby you have given me pain and yet i am very ungrateful i believe to say so but if i feel the pain though perhaps i ought not should i not own it  what circumstances what situation am i in madam that i cannot be mistress of myself that shall turn my uncles halffeared though always agreeable raillery into pity for me  over head and ears in the passion  i to be on the hoping side the gentleman on the triumphant  it is impossible for you my friends to be aforehand with my inclinations  a beginning love to be mentioned in which one is willing to conceal ones self from ones self fires flames blazes to follow  gratitude and love to be spoken of as synonymous terms  ah my dear aunt how could you let my uncle write such a letter and then copy it and send it to me as yours  and yet some very tender strokes are in it that no man that hardly anybody but you among women could write  but what do you do madam when you tell your harriet of your own prepossessions in favor of a man who as you thought had before in my eye too many advantages indeed you should have taken care not to let me know that his great qualities had impressed you all so deeply and my grandmamma to be so very apprehensive too for the entangled girl  hopeless passion said she entangled in an hopeless passion o let me die before this shall be deserved to be said of your harriet  then again rises to your pen smothering and escaped sparks and i am desired to hurry myself to get cold water to quench the flame  dear dear madam what images are here and applied  to whom  and by whom  have i written any thing so very blazing  surely i have not but you should not say you will all forgive me if this be my sad situation you should not say how much you are yourselves all of you in love with this excellent man and talk of mr dawson and of what he says of him but you should have told me that if i suffer my gratitude to grow into love you will never forgive me then should i have had a call of duty to check or control a passion that you were afraid could not be gratified  well and there is no way left me it seems but to fly for it to hurry away to northamptonshire and either to begin a new treaty with lord d or to give hope to an old lover poor harriet byron and is it indeed so bad with thee and does thy aunt selby think it is  but is there no hope that the man will take pity of thee when he sees thee so sadly entangled will he not vouchsafe to lend an extricating hand  oh no  too much obliged as thou already art how can thou expect to be further obliged obliged in the highest degree  but let me try if i cannot play round this bright this beamy taper without singeing my wings i fancy it is not yet quite so bad with me at least let me stand this one visit of tomorrow and then if i find reason to think i cannot stand it i may take the kind advice and fly for it rather than add another hopeless girl to the halfscore that perhaps have been long sighing for this best of men  but even then my aunt that is to say were i to fly and take shelter under your protecting wings i shall not i hope think it absolutely necessary to light up one flame in order to extinguish another i shall always value mr orme as a friend but indeed i am less than ever inclined to think of him in a nearer light  as to lady ds proposal it admits not with me of half a thought you know my dearest aunt that i am not yet rejected by one with whom you are all in love  but this seriously i will own and yet i hope nothing but my gratitude is engaged and that indeed is a very powerful tie that since i have seen and known sir charles grandison i have not only as before an indifference but a dislike to all other men and i think if i know my own heart i had rather converse but an hour in a week with him and with miss grandison than be the wife of any man i have ever seen or known  if this should end at last in love and if i should be entangled in an hopeless passion the object of it would be sir charles grandison he could not insult me and mean as the word pity in some cases founds i had rather have his pity than the love of any other man  you will upon the strength of what i have said be so good dear madam as to let the countess of d know that i think myself highly obliged to her for her favorable opinion of me that she has by it interested all my good wishes in her sons happiness and that i was always of opinion that equality of fortune and degree though not absolutely necessary to matrimonial felicity was however a circumstance not to be slighted but you madam can put my meaning in better in fitter words when you are assured that it is my meaning to give an absolute though grateful negative to this proposal and i do assure you that such is my meaning and that i should despise myself were i capable of keeping one man in suspense even had i hope of your hope while i was balancing in favor of another  i believe madam i have been a little petulant and very saucy in what i have written but my heart is not at ease and i am vexed with these men one after another when sir hargrave has given me a surfeit of them and only that the bad has brought me into the knowledge of the best or i could resolve never more to hear a man talk to me no not for one moment upon a subject that is become so justly painful to one who never took pleasure in their any adulation  i know you will with your usual goodness and so will my grandmamma and so will my uncle selby pardon all the imperfections of dearest madam  your and their ever dutiful harriet byron  letter xlv miss byron to miss selby tuesday evening feb    mr reeves my dear is just returned from a visit he made to st jamesssquare i transcribe a paper giving an account of what passed between mr bagenhall and sir charles in relation to the shocking affair which has filled me with so much apprehension and which sir charles at my cousins request allowed him to put in his pocket  mr bagenhall came to sir charles yesterday evening with a message from sir hargrave demanding a meeting with him the next morning at a particular hour at kensington gravelpits sir charles took mr bagenhall with him into his study and asking him to sit down mr bagenhall said that he was once concerned in an affair of this nature which had been very much misrepresented afterward and that he had been advised to take a step which sir charles might think extraordinary which was that he had brought with him a young gentleman whom he hoped for sir hargraves satisfaction as well as to do justice to what should pass between them sir charles would permit to take minutes of their conversation and that he was in the hall  let not a gentleman be left in the hall said sir charles and ringing directed him to be shown into the study to them yet mr bagenhall said he i see no occasion for this our conversation on the subject you come to talk of can be but short  were it to hold but two minutes sir charles  what you please mr bagenhall  the young gentleman entered and pen and ink were set before him he wrote in shorthand and read it to the gentlemen and sir charles as it was to be transcribed for sir hargrave desiring a copy of it it was sent him the same night  a conference between sir charles grandison bart and james bagenhall esquire sir chapter you have told me mr bagenhall sir hargravs demand have you seen sir the answer i returned to his letter   mr bagenhall i have sir   sir chapter and do you think there needs any other or further   mr b it is not sir charles such an answer as a gentleman can sit down with   sir chapter do you give that as your own opinion mr bagenhall or as sir ha graves   mr b as sir hargraves sir and i believe it would be the opinion of every man of honor   sir chapter man of honor mr bagenhall a man of honor would not have given the occasion which has brought you and me sir into a personal knowledge of each other i asked the question supposing there could be but one principal in this ebate   mr b i beg pardon i meant not that there should be two   sir chapter pray sir let me ask you do you know the particulars of sir hargraves attempt and of his violence to the lady   mr b sir hargrave i believe has given me a very exact account of everything he meant not dishonor to the lady   sir chapter he must have a very high opinion of himself if he thought the best he could do for her would be to do her honor  sir pray put that down  repeating what he said to the writer that he might not mistake   sir chapter but do you mr bagenhall think sir hargrave was justifiable was a man of honor in what he did   mr b i mean not as i told you sir charles to make myself a principal in this affair i pretend not to justify what sir hargrave did to the lady   sir chapter i hope then you will allow me to refer to my answer to sir hargraves letter i shall send him no other i beg your pardon mr bagenhall i mean not a disrespect to you   mr b no other sir charles   sir chapter since he is to see what this gentleman writes pray put down sir that i say the answer i have written is such a one as he ought to be satisfied with such a one as becomes a man of honor to send if he thought fit to send any and such a one as a man who has acted as sir hargrave acted by a woman of virtue and honor ought to be thankful for  have you written that sir   writer i have sir   sir chapter write further if you please that i say sir hargrave may be very glad if he hear no more of this affair from the ladys natural friends that however i shall rid him of all apprehensions of that nature for that i still consider the lady as under my protection with regard to any consequences that may naturally follow what happened on hounslowheath that i say i shall neglect no proper call to protect her further but that his call upon me to meet him must be such a one as my own heart can justify and that it is not my way to obey the insolent summons of any man breathing  and yet what is this mr bagenhall but repeating what i wrote   mr b you are warm sir charles   sir chapter indeed i am not i am only earnest as sir hargrave is to be shown what passes i say more than otherwise i should choose to say   mr b will you name your own time and place sir charles   sir chapter to do what   mr b to meet sir hargrave   sir chapter to do him good  to do good to my bitterest enemy i would meet him let him know that i wrote a very long letter because i would discharge my mind of all that i thought necessary to say on the occasion   mr b and you have no other answer to return   sir chapter only this let sir hargrave engage himself in a like unworthy enterprise and let the lady as this did claim my protection and i will endeavor to give it to her although sir hargrave were surrounded by as many men armed as he has in his service that is to say if a legal redress were not at hand if it were i hold it not to be a point of bravery to insult magistracy and to take upon myself to be my own judge and as it might happen another mans executioner   mr b this is nobly said sir charles but still sir hargrave had not injured you he says and as i had heard you were a man of an excellent character and as i know that sir hargrave is a man of courage i took it into my head for the prevention of mischief to make a proposal in writing to the lady whom sir hargrave loves as his own soul and if she had come into it    sir chapter a strange proposal mr bagenhall could you expect anything from it   mr b why not sir charles she is disengaged it seems i presume sir you do not intend to make court to her yourself   sir chapter we are insensibly got into a parley upon a subject that will not bear it mr bagenhall tell sir hargrave  or write it down from my lips sir speaking to the writer that i wish him to take time to enquire after my character and after my motives in refusing to meet him on the terms he expects me to see him tell him that i have before now shown an insolent man that i may be provoked but that when i have been so i have had the happiness to chastise such a one without murdering him and without giving any advantage over my own life to his single arm   mr b this is great talking sir charles   sir chapter it is mr bagenhall and i should be sorry to have been put upon it were i not in hope that it may lead sir hargrave to such enquiries as may be for his service as much as for mine   mr b i wish that two such spirits were better acquainted with each other or that sir hargrave had not suffered so much as he has done both in person and mind   sir chapter what does all this tend to mr bagenhall i look upon you as a gentleman and the more for having said you were sollicitous to prevent further mischief or i should not have said so much to so little purpose and once more i must refer to my letter   mr b i own i admire you for your spirit sir but it is amazing to me that a man of your spirit can refuse to a gentleman the satisfaction which is demanded of him   sir chapter it is owing to my having some spirit that i can fearless of consequences refuse what you call satisfaction to sir hargrave and yet be fearless of insult upon my refusal i consider myself as a mortal man i can die but once once i must die and if the cause be such as will justify me to my own heart i for my own sake care not whether my life be demanded of me tomorrow or forty years hence but sir speaking to the writer let not this that i have now said be transcribed from your notes it may to sir hargrave found ostentatiously i want not that anything should be read or shown to him that would appear like giving consequence to myself except for sir hargraves own sake   mr b i beg that it may not be spared if you are capable of acting as you speak by what i have heard of you in the affair on hounslowheath and by what i have heard from you in this conversation and see of you i think you a wonder of a man and should be glad it were in my power to reconcile you to each other   sir cha i could not hold friendship mr bagenhall with a man that has been capable of acting as sir hargrave has acted by an innocent and helpless young lady but i will name the terms on which i can take by the hand wherever i meet him a man to whom i can have no malice these are they that he lay at the door of mad and violent passion the illegal attempt he made on the best of women that he express his sorrow for it and on his knees if he pleases it is no disgrace for the bravest man to kneel to an injured lady beg her pardon and confess her clemency to be greater than he deserves if she give it   mr b good god shall that be transcribed sir charles   sir chapter by all means and if sir hargrave is a man that has in his heart the least spark of magnanimity he will gladly embrace the opportunity of acting accordingly and put down sir that sorrow that cont rition is all the atonement that can be made for a perpetrated evil   a faithful narrative henry cotes february    does not your heart glow my lucy now you have read as i suppose you have this paper and do not the countenances of every one of my revered friends round you pray look shine with admiration of this excellent man and yet you all loved him before and so you all think i did well i cannot help your thoughts  but i hope i shall not be undone by a good man  you will imagine that my heart was a little agitated when i came to read mr bagenhalls question whether sir charles intended to make court to me himself i am sorry to tell you lucy that i was a little more affected than i wished to be indeed i shall keep a lookout as you call it upon myself to say truth i laid down the paper at that place and was afraid to read the answer made to it when i took it up and read what followed i might have spared i saw my foolish little tremors see how frank i continue to be but if you come not to this paragraph before you are aware you need not read it to my uncle  mr bagenhall went away so much pleased with sir charles as he owned that mr reeves encourages me to hope some way may be found to prevent further mischief yet the condition which sir charles has proposed for my forgiving the wretch  upon my word my dear i desire not to see sir hargrave either upon his knees or upon his feet i am sure i could not see him without very violent emotions his barbarity his malice his cruelty have impressed me strongly nor can i be glad to see the wretch with his disfigured mouth and lip his lip it seems has been sewed up and he wears a great blacksilk patch or plaster upon the place  i cannot find that sir charles has heard from the exasperated man since mr bagenhall left him yesterday  i hope nothing will happen to overcloud tomorrow i propose to myself as happy a day as in the present situation of things can be given to  your harriet byron  end of vol i
