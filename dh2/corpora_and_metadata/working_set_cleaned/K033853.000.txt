jephson dublin castle febr      prologue written by arthur murphy esquire spoken by mr palmer while in these days of sentiment and grace poor comedy in tears resigns her place and smit with novels full of maxims crude she that was frolic once now turns a prude to her great end the tragic muse aspires at athens born and faithful to her sires the comic sister in hysteric fit you would swear has lost all memory of wit folly for her may now exult on high feathered by ridicule no arrows fly but if you are distressed she is sure to cry she that could jig and nickname all heavens creatures with sorrows not her own deforms her features with stale reflections keeps a constant pother greece gave her one face and she makes another so very pious and so full of woe you well may bid her to a nunnery go not so melpomene to nature true she holds her own great principle in view she from the first when men her power confessed when grief and terror seized the tortured breast she made to strike her moral to the mind the stage the great tribunal of mankind hither the worthies of each clime she draws who founded states or rescued dying laws who in base times a life of glory led and for their country who have toiled or bled hither they come again they breathe they live and virtues meed through every age receive hither the murderer comes with ghastly mien and the fiend conscience hunts him over the scene none are exempted all must reappear and even kings attend for judgment here here find the day when they their power abuse is a scene furnished to the tragic muse such is her art weakened perhaps at length and while she aims at beauty losing strength oh when resuming all her native rage shall her true energy alarm the stage this night a bard  our hopes may rise too high it is yours to judge  it is yours the cause to try this night a bard as yet unknown to fame once more we hope will rouse the genuine flame his no french play  tame polished dull by rule vigorous he comes and warm from shakespeares school inspired by him he shows in glaring light a nation struggling with tyrannic might oppression rushing on with giant strides a deep conspiracy which virtue guides heroes for freedom who dare strike the blow a tablature of honor guilt and woe if on his canvass natures colors shine you will praise the hand that traced the just design  epilogue by a friend spoken by mrs yates is it permitted in this age severe for female softness to demand a tear is it allowed in such censorious days for female virtue to solicit praise dares manly sense beneath a tender form presume to dictate and aspire to warm may so unnatural a being venture as a true heroine on the stage to enter no says a wit made up of french grimaces yet selfordaind the high priest of the graces women are playthings for our idle hours their souls unfinished and confined their powers loquacious vain by slight attentions won by flattery gained and by untruths undone or should some grave great plan engage their minds the first caprice can give it to the winds and the chief stateswoman of all the sex grows nervous if a fop or pimple vex injurious slanders  in louisas air behold the exemplar of a perfect fair just though aspiring merciful though brave sincere though politic and though fond no slave in danger calm and smiling in success but as securing ampler means to bless nor think as zeuxis for a faultless piece culled various charms from various nymphs of greece our bard has centered in one beauteous whole the rays that gleam through many a separate soul on britains and iernes

lead you thus in fetters through the streets these aged citizens  officer behold this order shows a paper  ribiro i know the character it is signed velasquez   st citizen we have not mines of unexhausted gold to feed rapacious spain and stern velasquez and wrung by hard exactions for the state   officer no more  i must not suffer it   ribiro pointing to the prisoners pray sir  see these white hairs these shackles  misery may sure complain  you are a soldier sir your mien bespeaks a brave one   officer i will walk by detain them not too long  it is a harsh sentence  officer withdraws a little  d citizen o good ribiro what have we deserved that these rude chains should gall us  ribiro what deserved   st citizen the little all our industry had earned to smooth the bed of sickness

was that a fight for lisbon  lemos o shame shame what crime could they commit  old helpless plundered   ribiro  even thoughts are crimes in this distempered state they once had wealth as you have  spain thought meet to seize it  they rash men have dared to murmur velasquez here  our scourge  king philips idol whom portugal must bow to  mildly dooms them but to perpetual bondage for this treason  lemos we must be patient  it is a cureless evil  ribiro is patience then the only virtue left us come come there is a remedy more manly  corea would it were in our reach  ribiro look here i grasp it laying his hand on his sword what turned to statues  hence enfranchisement if the quick fire that lately warmed your breasts already wastes to embers  am i rash we touched this theme before  you felt it then would i could put a tongue in every ingot that now lies pild within your massy stores  your gold perhaps might move you  spain will seize it then bid you mourn the loss in the next dungeon or dig her mines for more  is it not enough  instruct me lemos you good corea teach me this meekness so convenient to our foes or pierce this swelling bosom  lemos who can teach it it is not in art ribiro  know us better the canker discontent consumes within and mocks our smooth exterior  corea hear me for both for all the indignant hearts in portugal  if curses sped like plagues and pestilence thus would i strike them at the towers of spain may her swollen pride burst like an empty bubble distraction rend her councils route and shame pursue her flying squadrons  tempests scatter and whirlpools swallow up her full manned navies bold insurrection spread through all her states shaking like pentup winds their loose allegiance all europe arm and every frowning king point at one foe and let that foe be spain  ribiro o be that curse prophetic  here it is dangerous nor will the time allow to tell you all but thus far rest assured  i speak not rashly  a project is on foot and now just ripening will give our indignation nobler scope than tears or curses priests and womens weapons all that secures the event of great designs sage heads firm hearts and executing arms in formidable union league with us and chain capricious fortune to our standard  lemos say can our aid promote this glorious cause  ribiro all private virtue is the public fund as that abounds the state decays or thrives each should contribute to the general stock and who lends most is most his countrys friend  lemos o would braganza meet the peoples wish  ribiro he is not yet resolved  but may be won  could i assure him men like you but wished it for well he knows and loves you  trust me lemos it would do more to knit him to this cause than legions of our hot nobility  corea we love his virtue  will support his rights   ribiro then show it by your deeds  your artizans are prompt bold hardy fond of violence alarm their slumbering courage rouse their rage wake their dulled senses to the shame and scorn that hisses in the ears of willing bondmen if they will hazard one bold stroke for freedom a leader shall be found a brave  a just one anon expect me where the ivied arch rears the bold image of our late braganza in sullen discontent he seems to frown as if still hostile to the foes of lisbon there well discourse at large  almada comes   lemos is he a friend  ribiro a firm one  no dishonor ever bowed that reverend head  that mighty spirit when first the oppressor like a flood overwhelmed us reared high his countrys standard and defied him  he comes to seek me  lose no time  remember  exeunt lemos and corea ribiro alone i should detest my zeal could it be stirred against the wholesome rigor of restraint licentiousness made needful  but good heaven foul murders unprovoked delibrate cruelty   the god within us must rise up against it  enter almada almada well met ribiro  what new proselytes thy ardor every hour or finds or makes them  ribiro no  thank the spaniards for our proselytes  scarce half an hour ago two citizens my blood still boils by fell velasquez order were dragged to prison   almada spare my soul ribiro superfluous detestation of that villain  ribiro knowing this way they were to pass i brought lemos and corea whom last night i founded that their own eyes might see the outrages men of their order must expect to meet from power that knows no bounds and owns no law  almada twas wisely done for minds of coarse alloy but bluntly feel the touch of others wrongs though deep they take the impression of their own  ribiro by heaven their fury bore a nobler stamp their honest rage glowed on their kindling cheeks broke through the cold restraints of coward caution and swelled even to an eloquence of anger  almada it is well  but are they yet informed how near the approaching hour decisive of our fate that gives us death or freedom  that the dawn   ribiro not yet  they still believe the duke at noon but visits lisbon to command the march of our new levies to the spanish bounds himself to follow straight  ere then i mean again to see them and still more to whet the keeness of their hate against our tyrants  at least a thousand follow where they lead   almada their boldness well directed may do much  ribiro that care be mine  i have studied  and i know them inconstant sanguine easily inflamed but like the nitrous powder uncompressd consuming by the blaze naught but itself it is ours to charge the mine with deadly skill and bury usurpation in the ruin  almada i think we cannot fail  our friends are firm honor will bind the noble  hope the weak and common interest all  the insulting spaniard broods over embryo mischiefs nor suspects the wretched worm conceals a mortal sting to pierce the haughty heel that tramples him  ribiro how great will be our triumph spains disgrace when every mischief that perfidious court has framed against braganzas precious life recoils on the contriver  almada urge that home urge how the dukes affection to his country his right unquestionable to her crown first marked him for the victim of false spain that his commission as high admiral his generals staff and all the lofty pomp of his high sounding titles were but meant as gilded snares to invite him to his death  ribiro these truths shameful to philip must be told they will endear don juan to the people will keep them waking restless and disposed to aid the glorious tumult of tomorrow  almada my heart expands and with a prophets fire seizes the bright reversion of our hopes i see the genius of our realm restored and smiling lead him to his rightful throne no wild ambition like a pampered steed oerleaps the boundaries of law and reason and tramples every seed of social virtue but over the temperate current of his blood the gentlest passions brush their breezy wings to animate but not disturb the stream such is his temper  the approaching hour demands perhaps a sterner  ribiro heaven still kind has in his conforts breast struck deep the root of each aspiring virtue  bright louisa to all the softness of her tender sex unites the noblest qualities of man a genius to embrace the amplest scheme that ever swelled the laboring statesmans breast judgment most sound persuasive eloquence to charm the froward and convince the wise pure piety without religions dross and fortitude that shrinks at no disaster  almada she is indeed a wonder  o ribiro that woman was the spring that moved us all she canvassd all our strength urged all our wrongs combined our force and methodized our vengeance taught us that ends which seem impossible are lost or compassed only by the means that fortune is a false divinity but folly worships what the wise man makes she turned our cold dejection to device and roused despondency to active valor my age delights to dwell on her perfections   ribiro and i could ever hear them  virtues praise to honest ears is music  but no more  a noise comes this way and that hurrying throng proclaims the upstart ministers approach this is the hour with fancy pageantry through our thind streets he takes his wonted round like the dire clapping of the harpys wing to choke the frugal meal with bitter tears and scare content from every humble board i will avoid him but i go proud man when next we meet to make my presence dreadful  exit ribiro almada alone honest ribiro  to this hour my soul has kept her purpose my firm foot has never swerved from its path in lisbon nor shall now give way to insolence  your countrys dregs looking toward the train of velasquez ye supple sycophants ay cringe and beg that he will tread upon your prostrate necks or ride you like his mules  authority thy worshipped symbols round a villains trunk provoke mens mockery not their reverence  officer entering make way there  room room for the minister know you the lord velasquez comes this way to almada pray sir give place  almada officious varlet off let not thy servile touch pollute my robe can hirelings frown   enter velasquez and pizarro  the magistrates of lisbon with their insignia guards and attendants preceding velasquez looking sternly at almada how am i then despised  a tumult in my presence  good my lord it better would become your gravity to set the fair example of obedience to trust and office than instruct the rabble in what they are the most prone to feuds and faction  almada most reverend admonition hold my spleen ye golden coronets and ermind robes bend from your stools behold this wondrous man this lusitanian censor this sage cato this consul with his lictors rods and axes reprove the boy almada for his lightness  pizarro regard not his wild words he is old and choleric  velasquez  to his train attend me at the citadel  move on exeunt attendants i know not whether to accuse my fortune or blame my own demerits brave almada that ever when we meet thy angry brow rebukes me with its frown or keen reproach darts from thy tongue and checks the forward wish that fain would court thy friendship and esteem  almada friendship with thee  is it so slight a boon if such deserve the name go seek for friends amidst the desperate crew whose only bond is the black conscience of confederate crimes nor in prepostrous union think to join integrity with guilt and shame with honor know me for what i am  thy foe professed fall on thy knee  solicit heaven for mercy and tell that seat of pride thy obdurate he art its last its only virtue is  remorse   exit almada manent velasquez and pizarro velasquez go hoary fool preach to the whistling winds i scorn thy council and defy thy hate it is time enough for lagging penitence when age like thine has quenched ambitions flame now nobler thoughts possess my active soul this haughty province first shall feel my weight and since it scorns my love through fear obey me  pizarro already all the power of spain is thine the vice queen margret though of austrian blood discreet firm virtuous complains in vain you leave her but a regents empty title while power is only yours  and happier still braganza summoned to attend the king will soon cut off his countrys only hope and leave no rival to obscure thy luster bate but the show and name of royalty thou art already king  velasquez the show the name all that gives grace and awe to majesty shall soon be mine pizarro  olivarez whose counsels rule the escurial to my hand has long resigned the reins of portugal and dreams not unsuspicious of my faith the delegate the creature of his breath anon will bid defiance to his power and rank himself with monarchs  pizarro o take heed consider sir that power still awes the world   velasquez my towering fortune rises on a rock and firm as atlas will defy the storm the purple cement of a princes blood shall strengthen its foundation  pizarro ha  velasquez braganzas  the precious mischief swells my exulting breast and soon shall burst its prison  pizarro can it be i know thy dauntless temper mocks at fear and prudence guides thy daring  but a prince followed by faithful guards  encompassed round with troops of gallant friends  the peoples idol   velasquez is mortal like the meanest of his train and dies before tomorrow  cease to wonder  but when this mighty ruin shakes the realm prepare like me with welldissembled grief to hide our real joy and blind suspicion flourish of trumpets these trumpets speak his entrance never more such sprightly notes nor shout of joyful friends paean or choral song shall usher him but sad solemnity of funeral pomp mute sorrow mournful dirges ghastly rites marshaled by death in comfortless array wait his cold relics to their sepulcher  end of the first act act ii scene i an antichamber in the duke of braganza s palace ribiro mendoza ribiro a moments pause mendoza here appointed by promise to the duke at noon to wait him i could not mingle with his followers so saw it but in part   mendoza the air still rings with loudest acclamations  ribiro yes mendoza with joy i heard them  heard the vaulted sky echo braganza  twas no hireling noise no factions roar of mercenary joy sound without transport  but the heartfelt cry of a whole nations welcome hear it spain proud usurpation hear it  mendoza the whole way was covered thick with panting multitudes that scarce left passage for their chariot wheels the trees were bent with people every roof dome temple portico so closely filled the gazers made the wonder here and there a discontented spaniard stalked along shouldring the crowd and with indignant scorn turned up his sallow cheek in mockery  ribiro we shall retort their scorn  marked you the duke his mind is ever lettered in his face  mendoza pleasure was mingled with anxiety both visible at once but o what words can paint the angel form that graced his side his bright louisa like the olympian queen when over her fragrant bosom venus bound the enchanting cestus  from her lucid eyes streamed the pure beams of soft benevolence and glories more than mortal shone around her harmonious sounds of dulcet instruments swelled by the breath or swept from tuneful wire floated in air  while yellow tagus burned with prows of flaming gold their painted flags in gandy frolic fluttering to the breeze on to their palace thus the triumph came alighted at the gate the princely pair expressed their thanks in silent dignity of gesture far more eloquent than words then turned them from the throng   ribiro why this looks well the duke will sure be roused to resolution by this bright presage of his coming glory  mendoza with grief i learn he still is undetermined his fears prevail against the public wish and thus the illpoisd scale of our fair hopes mounts light and unsubstantial  ribiro o you wrong him i know his noble nature  juans heart pants not with selfish fear  his wife his friends an infant family a kingdoms fate more than his own besiege his struggling soul he must be more than man who will not hear such powerful calls and less who can despise them  mendoza indeed i cannot wonder he is disturbed but doubts are treason in a cause like this  ribiro dismiss these fears  louisas gentle sway will fix him to our purpose nights chaste orb rules not the heavings of the restless tide more sure than she with mild ascendancy can govern all his ebbs and flows of passion but come by this time the fond multitude have gazed away their longing and retire our greeting will be seasonable now exeunt  scene ii a magnificent chamber in the duke of braganza s palace  the duke speaking to lemos and corea  other citizens at a little distance duke no more kind countrymen  this goodness melts me what can i render back for all these honors this wondrous prodigality of praise what but my life whenever your welfare asks it  lemos heaven guard that precious life for portugal to you as to a tutelary god this sinking country lifts her suppliant hands and certain of your strength implores your arm to raise her prostrate genius from the dust  duke a private man a subject like yourselves bankrupt of power though rich in gratitude  the sense of what you suffer wrings my soul nor makes your sorrows less  duchess much injured men whom love not fear should govern  from this hour know we espouse your cause  we have not hearts of aliens to behold with passing glance and cold indifference the ruthless spoiler smile over the ravage of your fertile plains we feel the fetters that disgrace your limbs we mourn the vigor of your minds depressed with horror we behold your generous blood drained by the infatiate thirst of ravening wolves if we have nature we must feel your wrongs if we have power redress them   corea matchless lady there spoke our rightful queen our better angel in us behold your servants subjects soldiers though yet unpracticed in the trade of war our swords will find an edge at your command  duke we neither doubt your courage nor your love and both perhaps ere long may meet the trial  i would detain you  but our conference might now be dangerous  rank me with your friends and know i have a heart for portugal  exeunt lemos corea etc manent duke and duchess duchess why wears my juans brow that thoughtful cloud why thus with downcast look and folded arms when every other bosom swells with hope when expectation like a fiery steed anticipates the course and pants to hear the sprightly signal start him for the goal think that the people from their leaders eye catch the sure omens of their future fate with his their courage falls their spirits rise for confidence is conquests harbinger  duke light of thy juans life my souls best joy swifter than meteors glide or wings of wind my nimble thoughts shoot through their whirling round a thousand cares distract this anxious breast to recompense the dark uncertainty of this dread interval twixt now and morn would ask whole years of happiness to come now thou art mine these faithful arms enfold thee but oh tomorrow may behold thee torn by barbarous ruffians from their fond embrace the flowing honors of that beauteous head may sweep a scaffolds dust and iron death close in eternal sleep those radiant eyes that beam with love and joy unutterable  duchess o make me not your curse as sure i must be the stain the blot of your immortal fame if one soft passion like a languid spell dissolve thy manly fortitude of soul and melt the prince and patriot in the husband  duke that tender union is the healing balm the cordial of my soul  our destinies are twined together  were my single life the only forfeit of this perilous chance i would throw it like a heedless prodigal and wanton with my fortune  but alas more than the wealth of worlds is now at stake and can i hazard this dear precious pledge venture my all of bliss on one bold cast nor feel the conflict that now rends my heart  duchess why do you tremble  these cold struggling drops   duke  they fall for thee louisa  my quelled spirit avows its weakness there   duchess it is cruel fondness it wounds me deeply juan  duke witness honor thy martial call never found braganzas ear cold till this bitter moment  i have met nay courted death in the steeled files of war when squadrons withered as the giant trod nor shrunk even when the hardiest in the field have paused upon the danger  here i own my agonizing nerves degrade the soldier even to a cowards frailty  should the sword which black destruction soon may wave over all avert it heaven strike at thy precious life should but one drop forced by rude violence stain that dear bosom i were so accursed the outstretchd arm of mercy could not save me  duchess i have a womans form a womans fears i shrink from pain and start at dissolution to shun them is great natures prime command yet summoned as we are your honor pledged your own just rights engaged your countrys fate let threatening death assume his direst form let dangers multiply still would i on still urge exhort confirm thy constancy and though we perished in the bold attempt with my last breath i would bless the glorious cause and think it happiness to die so nobly  duke o thou have roused me  from this hour i banish each fond solicitude that hovered round thee thy voice  thy looks  thy soul are heavens own fire twere impious but to doubt that power ordained thee to guide me to this glorious enterprise  duchess thou shall be chronicld to latest time heavens chosen instrument to punish tyrants the great restorer of a nations freedom thou shall complete what brutus but attempted nor withering age nor cold oblivions shade nor envys cankrous tooth shall blast thy wreaths but every friend to virtue shall inscribe to juans name eternal monuments but see our friends approach  awhile i leave thee  remember still  thou must be king or nothing  exit duchess duke alone i will suppress the emotions of my heart quite to subdue them is impossible enter ribiro and mendoza welcome ye wakeful guardians of your country had we in all the peoples mighty mass but twenty spirits matched with you in virtue how might we bid defiance to proud spain how scorn the close disguise of secret councils and challenge their full force in open combat  ribiro led by don juan can we doubt the event all things conspire  antipathy to spain is here hereditary  it is natures instinct it is principle religion vital heat old men to listening sons with their last breath bequeath it as a dying legacy infants imbibe it at the mothers breast it circles with their blood spreads with their frame its fountain is the heart and till that fails the stream it fed can never cease to flow  mendoza that furious impulse gives the spleen of fiends to softest tempers the unpracticed arm sinews with lions strength and drives us on resistless as the sweeping whirlwinds force  duke all is propitious every post is filled with officers devoted to our service already in their hearts they own my title and wait but for our orders to proclaim it  enter almada duke come to my breast my sage admonisher the tutor and example of my arms the proud iberian soon shall feel their force and learn from juans sword to venerate the fame of brave almada  almada thus my prince thus did i hope to find thee hence no more shall hard exactions grind the prostrate people our gentry to their provinces confined languish no more in shameful circumscription no more our ancient noblemen be stripped of all but empty titles tinsel names like tarnishd gold on rags to mock the wearer our posts of eminence no more be filled with upstart strangers or the sordid lees of base plebian natives   duke my impatient breast full of the expected joy like a young bridegroom upbraids the lazy hours that lag between my wishes and enjoyment  the onset is   almada when st lazar beats five about that hour well welcome the suns rising with an offering more glorious than the persians hecatomb  ribiro at night your friends assemble with almada in dreadful secrecy  then with raised arm we rush to cancel our long debt to vengeance and glut our thirsty blades with spanish gore  almada if we suspend the blow beyond tomorrow all may be lost  three thousand veterans lie cantoned on the rivers southern side should our design be known they will be called to reinforce the posts and guard the city adieu then to our dream of liberty we rivet closer chains on portugal and drag the doom of traitors on ourselves  enter duchess duchess suspend your consultations for a moment within the minister of spain attends forgive the officious love of your louisa no stranger to his arts she warns her juan   duke i know he comes in solemn mockery to make a hollow tender of his service with most obsequious falsehood  duchess my best lord hold strictest watch on all your words and motions guard every look with that discerning villain subtle infiduous false and plausible he can with ease assume all outward forms seem the most honest plain sincere good man and keep his own designs locked close within while with the lynxs beam he penetrates the deep reserve of every other breast  duke i too will wear my vizor in the scene and play the dupe i am not  friends farewell perhaps ere morning we may meet again  the hour is fixed louisa  all prepared   duchess then this is our last night of slavery  a brighter era rises with the dawn exit duke if we may dare without impiety to challenge heavenly aid and swell the breast with confidence of more than mortal vigor can heaven stand neuter in a cause like this or favor fraud oppression cruelty  now gentle friends i am a suitress to you  almada you are our sovereign madam  it is your right not to solicit but command our duty  duchess think me not light capricious variable if i who urged ye to this bold attempt and ever when your anger seemed to cool poured oil to wake the flame and feed its blaze now supplicate with milder earnestness and strive to allay its fury  almada speak your pleasure the obedience of our hearts will follow it  duchess i know the measure of your wrongs would license nay justify the wild excess of vengeance yet in the headlong rage of execution think rather what your mercy may permit than what their crimes deserve who feel your justice o follow not the example we abhor nor let those weapons justice consecrates be died with drops drawn from the bleeding breast of reverend age or helpless innocence will thou take heed almada  almada fear not madam all mercy not injurious to our cause even spaniards as they are men from men may challenge for indus wealth i would not stain this sword sacred to honor in the guiltless blood of unoffending wretches  rest secure a prostrate and defenseless enemy has stronger guards against a brave mans wrath than tenfold brass or shields of adamant  duchess generous almada well do thou instruct  soft pity is not more akin to love than to true fortitude  thy soft youth mendoza need not be tutored to humanity  mendoza heaven and my conscious soul bear witness for me that not to satiate any private malice but for the general good i stand engaged in this great compact  twere a cowards vengeance to turn a sacrifice to massacre and practice while i punish cruelty  ribiro till fortune give one victim to my rage compassion and this bosom must be strangers no sanctuary nor interceding prayers nor wings of angels stretched to cover him shall save that monster from the doom he merits  duchess you mean the minister of spain velasquez  ribiro i mean the minister of hell velasquez that cool deliberate executioner if he escape may this good arm rot off all worthy thoughts forsake and scorn pursue me write boaster on my forehead  let my name blister the tongue that speaks it  infamy be here my portion endless pains hereafter  duchess o would that sacrifice might expiate   ribiro pardon the rash effusion of my zeal it deals too much in words  duchess not so ribiro thy anger has a license  and thy zeal we know is generous not sanguinary  almada madam we take our leave  good angels guard you we go to prove our duty in your service the homage of our hearts has long been yours and soon you shall receive it from our knees  duchess believe me friends your loves are written here in characters no time can ever efface  exeunt almada ribiro and mendoza duchess alone and may the mighty spirits of past times raised by desert to bright immortal thrones suspend awhile their task of heavenly praise in ministry unseen to hover round them protect aspiring virtue like their own and in their bosoms breathe resistless ardour exit  end of the second act act iii scene i the apartments of velasquez in the palace of the vicequeen velasquez pizarro pizarro you seem disturbed   velasquez with reason  dull braganza must have been tutored  at our interview i practiced every supple artifice that glides into mans bosom  the return was blank reserve ambiguous compliment and hatred thinly veiled by ceremony  pizarro might i presume   velasquez pizarro i am stung  his father theodosius that proud prince who durst avow his enmity to philip and menaced thunders at my destined head with all his empty turbulence of rage could never move me like the calm disdain of this cold blooded juan  pizarro then my lord your purpose holds  velasquez it does  i will dispatch this towering duke who keeps the cheek of spain pale with perpetual danger  pizarro for what end unconscious of his fate he blindly speeds to find a grave in spain  why then resolve to spill that blood which elsewhere will be shed without your crime or peril  velasquez that is the question were i assured they meant his death twere needless but when they draw him once from portugal where only he is dangerous then perhaps their fears or lenity may let him live and while he lives my fiery course is checked my sun climbs slowly never can ascend to its meridian brightness  pizarro still my lord my short lined wisdom cannot sound your depth  velasquez i mean to tell thee all for thou may aid me and thy tried faith deserves my confidence  pizarro i am your own for ever  your kind hand bounteous beyond my merit planted here favors innumerable   velasquez  think them little  an earnest not the acquittal of my love the enormous wealth of juans royal house his large domains extended influence his numerous vassals so have swelled his state that were his means but pushed to one great end how easy might he wrest this realm from spain and brave king philips rage  pizarro good careless prince mild and uxorious no ambitious dream disturbs his tranquil slumber   velasquez just his nature on household wing he flutters round the roof that with the princely eagle might have soared and met the dazzling sun now by his death my engine cannot fail this night he meets it his wealth his mightiness his followers become louisas dower  what think thou now could i but win her to accept my hand and much my art will move and more my power might not our union like the impetuous course of blending torrents break all feeble mounds spain could oppose to bar me from the crown that once obtained let olivarez rail let his inglorious master call me traitor i will scorn their idle fury  pizarro still i fear louisas heart cold and impenetrable to all but juans love will own no second though big ambition swells her female breast beyond the sexs softness  velasquez my hope rests even on that favorite passion  grief at first will drive her far from love  a second flame perhaps may never rekindle in her heart yet give her momentary frenzy scope it wastes itself ambition then regains its wonted force and winds her to my lure  but come  i must not lose these precious moments the fates are busy now  what is yet untold there place thyself and learn  take

earthly hopes beyond a cloister but stretched on musty matts in noisome caves to rouse at midnight bells and mutter prayers for souls beyond their reach to senseless saints to wage perpetual war with natures bounty to blacken sick mens chambers and be numbered with the loathed leavings of mortality the watchlight hourglass and the nauseous phial are these the ends of life was this fine frame

sovereign virtue to enfranchise souls too righteous for this world from mortal cares a monk of milan mixed the deadly drug drawn from the quintessence of noxious plants minerals and poisonous creatures whose dull bane arrests the nimble current of lifes tide and kills without a pang  ramirez i knew him well the carmelite castruccio was it not  velasquez the same he first approved it on a wretch condemned for murder to the lingering wheel this night commit it to braganzas lips had he a heart of iron giant strength the antidotes of pontus  all were vain to struggle with the venoms potency  ramirez this night my lord  velasquez this very night nay shrink not unless thou mean to take the lead in death and pull thy own destruction on thy head  ramirez give me a moments pause  a deed like this   velasquez should be at once resolved and executed think thou i am a raw unpracticed novice to make thy breast a partner to the trust and not thy hand accomplice of the crime why it is the bond for my security look not amazed but mark me heedfully thou have thy choice  dispatch mine enemy the means are in thy hand  be safe and great or instantly prepare thee for a death which

health to almada  almada thus to meet antonio is the best health the soundness of the mind better at this dark hour to embrace in arms thus girt for manly execution friend than in the mazes of the

not wont to be thus waited for  ribiro anon they will be here  mean time proceed they know their place already   almada why we meet is not to canvass our opprobrious wrongs but to redress them  yet as trumpets sound to rouse the soldiers ardor  so the breath of our calamities will wake our fires and fan them to spread wide the flame of vengeance it is not my gift to play the orator but in plain words to lay our state before you  our tyrants grandsire whose ambition claimed and first usurped braganzas royal rights my blood established his detested sway old tagus blushed with many a crimson tide sluicd from the noblest veins of portugal the exterminating sword knew no distinction princes and prelates venerable age matrons and helpless virgins fell together till cloyed and sick of slaughter the tired soldier with grim content flung down his reeking steel and glutted rage gave truce to massacre  ribiro nor passed the iron rod to milder hands through two succeeding reigns  with cruel zeal the barbarous offspring emulate their sire and track his bloody footsteps in our ruin  almada now mark how happily the time conspires to give our great achievement permanence  spain is not what she was when europe bowed to the fifth charles and his degenerate son when like a torrent swelled by mountain floods she swept the neighboring nations with her arms and threatened those remote

stupendous mass and threats its downfall  enter mendoza mendoza break off  break off  the fatal snare is spread and deaths pale hand assists to close the toil  almada whence this dread greeting  ha  thy altered cheek wears not the ensign of this glowing hour  mendoza the scream of night owls or the ravens croak would better suit the baleful news i bring than the known accents of a friendly voice  we are undone  betrayed   almada say thou  betrayed  mendoza our tower is sapd  the high raised fabric falls to crush us with the ruin  what avails the full maturity of all our hopes this glorious league  the justice of our cause   high heaven might idly thunder on our side if traitors to ourselves   almada ourselves  oh shame i will not believe it  what perfidious slaves   mendoza two whom we

the ebbing tagus in the tyrants barge and hasten to the sort  the troops of spain even while we speak are summoned to the charge and mark us for their prey  almada nay then it is past malignant fortune when the cup was raised close to our lips has dashed it to the ground  ribiro this unexpected bolt strikes flat our hopes and leaves one dreary desolation round us i see their hangmen muster  wolfeyd cruelty grimly sedate glares over her iron hoard of racks wheels engines feels her axes edge licks her fell jaws and with a monsters thirst already drinks our blood  mendoza there is not a pang that rends the fibers of mans feeling frame no vile disgrace that even in thought oerspreads the cheek with burning crimson but her hate ingenious to devise and sure to inflict in keenest agony will make us suffer  almada would that were all  our dismal scene must close nature over powerd at length will leave her load and baffie persecution  but o portugal alas unhappy country where is the bourn can mark the extent of thy calamities like winters icy hand our luckless end will freeze the source of future enterprise oppression then over the devoted realm erect and bold will stalk with

hands given to the winds  is this the doom that waits us  mendoza alas what better doom to ask for mercy were ignominious to expect it bootless  almada to ask for mercy  could spain stretch my life to

fever in those blessed regions of eternal peace where sorrow never enters where thy truth thy unexampld fortitude and sweetness will meet their full reward  duchess where is the friend who rung our dismal knell  duke good generous man assured of death yet careless of his life and anxious but for us he is returned to know what our brave leaders will determine  yet what can they determine but to die our numbers poorly armed undisciplined may fight and fall with desperate obstinacy for valor can no more  but oh louisa friends country life itself all lost seem little one sharp devouring grief consumes the rest and makes thee all its object  duchess my dear husband these soft endearments this excess of fondness strike deeper to my soul than all the pangs the subtlest vengeance could contrive to wound me oh fly me hate me call me murderess it is i have driven thee to this precipice i urge the ruffian hand of law to seize thee i drag thee to the block  i lift the axe oh agony louisa dooms thee dead  duke  it is anguish insupportable to hear thee add selfupbraidings to our misery thou my destroyer no my best louisa thou art my guardian angel  at this hour this dreadful hour it is safety to be near thee those dastards who betrayed our brave design that baseness which no caution could prevent nor wisdom could foresee twas that undid us i will not curse them  yet i swear by honor thus hunted to the utmost verge of fate without one ray of hope to cheer the danger i would not barter this dire certainty for that ignoble life those bad men purchase by perfidy and vileness   duchess oh two such  but indignation wants a tongue to name them how was their fury thundered on our side their youthful veins full of patrician blood insulted by velasquez  stripped by spain of all the ancient honors of their house sworn at the altar to assert this cause by holiest adjurations  yet these two to turn apostates  can this fleeting breath this transitory frail uncertain being be worth so vast a ransom  duke yes to cowards such ever be the proselytes of spain  leave them to scorn  fain would i turn my thoughts from this bad world  shake off the clogs of earth and for that great tribunal arm my soul where heaven not spain must judge me  but in vain my softened mind still hangs on those blessed days those years of sweet tranquillity and peace when smiling morn but waked us to new joys and love at night shed blessings on our pillow  duchess these hours are fled and never can return it is heavens high will and be that will obeyed the retrospect of past felicity plucks not the barbed arrow from the wound but makes it rankle deeper  come my juan here bid adieu to this infectious grief let us knit our constancy to meet the trial shall we be bold in words mere moral talkers declaim with pedant tongue in virtues praise yet find no comfort no support within from her bright energy  it comes  it comes i feel my breast dilate  the phantom death shrinks at the radiant vision  bright eyed hope bids us aspire and points the shining throne   spain i defy thee  duke o would she hew the elm and spare the tender vine  this stubborn trunk should brave her fury here is royal blood and blood long thirsted for  they cannot dare insatiate as they are remorseless savage with sacrilegious hands to violate this beauteous sanctuary  let me not think distraction  horror  oh it splits my brain rends every vital string and tears my heart mercy can grant no more  nor i petition than to fall dead this instant and forget it i look toward heaven in vain  gape wide o earth and bury bury deep this load of anguish  duchess be not so lost  hear oh hear me juan my lord my life my love  will thou not speak he heeds me not  what shall i say to move him for pitys sake look up  oh think braganza could spain behold thee thus   duke oh no louisa no eye shall see me melt  i will be calm still silent motionless  oh tough tough heart would i could weep to ease thee   duchess here weep here pour the warm stream into this faithful breast thy sorrows here shall find a kindred source which flows for every tear with drops of blood now summon all thy soul  behold he comes to thunder our irrevocable doom  enter ribiro ribiro o for an angels organ to proclaim such gratulations as no tongue can speak nor mortal breast conceive  joy boundless joy  duke am i awake  thou can not mean to mock me  ribiro i shall go wild with transport  on my knee i beg you to forgive the cruel shock this tongue heaven knows with what severe reluctance so lately gave to all your dearest hopes  duke no let me take that posture for i swear though yet i know not why my lightened heart beats freer and seems eased of half its burden  forgive my strong impatience  quickly tell me  ribiro still ignorant of our intended vengeance velasquez is returned  our gallant friends were wronged by rash suspicion   duke heard i right or is it illusion all embracing him thus let me thank thee louisa then is safe  fountain of mercy these late despairing arms again enfold her my queen my love my wife   duchess flow flow my tears take bounteous lord of all this melting tribute my heart can give no more for all thy goodness  duke and now disclose this wonder  ribiro thus my lord when at the appointed time our two brave friends were hastening to almada near the square velasquez and his followers crossed their steps their course seemed toward the river  struck with fear and ignorant what cause at that late hour could draw him from the palace straight they changed their first intent of joining our assembly and unobserved pursued the attending train think what these brave men suffered when they saw the tyrant climb his barge and push from shore their swords were half unsheathed both half resolved to rush at once and pierce him to the heart  but prudence or our fortune checked their hands  duke it had been certain ruin  but go on   ribiro an instant passed in thought they seized a boat and following anxious hung on all his motions mendoza saw them thus  then hurrying back filled us with consternation at the tidings  duchess nor was it strange  it wore a dreadful aspect but fear interprets all things to its danger  ribiro he crossed the river where jagos fort commands the narrowing stream the governor attended at the gate a while there passed in short but earnest converse they took leave with hasty strides velasquez reimbarkd the vessel to the shore she left returned and her proud master sought again the palace  duchess could not our valiant friends discover ought that might reveal his purpose  ribiro madam  no to have inquired too near were dangerous besides their haste to reassure our hopes pressed their return  but thus we may resolve he apprehends some danger imminent he sees above his head the gathering cloud but knows not when twill burst in thunder on him  duke thanks gentle friend  alas i tremble still as just escaped from shipwreck i look round and though i tread on earth  firm solid earth see with broad eye the threatening surge far off scarce can i credit my conflicting sense or trust our preservation   duchess thy glad tale has raised me from the gulf of black despair even to the topmost pinnacle of joy yes we shall conquer  all these dangers past will serve but to enrich the future story our childrens children shall recount each fear and from the mingled texture of our lives learn to revere that sacred providence that guides the strife of virtue  duke o louisa i thought i knew the extent of all my fondness that long acquaintance with thy wondrous virtue had given thee such dominion over my soul time could not add to my trascendent passion but when the danger came it waked new fires presented thee in softer loveliness and twined thee closer here  ribiro my lord ere this our friends expect me   duke let us fly to meet them i long to pour into their generous breasts my cordial greeting  duchess go my dearest juan to them and all commend me such rare zeal merits more recompense than our poor thanks can at the best requite for souls like theirs ill brook the indignity of soul surmise and virtue wronged demands a double homage  exit duchess duke if the good augury of my breast deceive not no more such terrors will appal our souls but guilt alone shall tremble  come ribiro exeunt  scene changes to the castle of almada almada and several conspirators as before with mello and roderic almada again our hopes revive  the unloaded stem shakes the wet tempest from its vigorous head and rears the swelling harvest to our sight  mendoza after the chillings of this aguish fear methinks i breathe more free  the vital stream in sprightlier tides flows through its wonted course warms my whole frame and doubly mans my heart  almada and may the generous ardor spread to all  observe me friends  our numbers must divide into four equal bands all to attack at the bells signal the four palace gates so every passage barred the foe in vain may strive to unite and overwhelm our force myself with the brave few who have sworn to follow will rush impetuous on the german guard who at the northern entrance hold their station  the fort be roderic and mellos care with ferdinand henriquez and antonio  mendoza carlos and their gallant troop must seize the regent margaret and secure the counselors of spain as hostages for the surrender of the citadel  mendoza letters to every province are dispersed importing this great change and all are ready to shake to earth the intolerable yoke nay distant india in her sultry mines shall hear the cheerful sound of liberty again fair commerce welcomed to our shore shall loose her swelling canvas to the winds and golden tagus heave once more to meet her but see the duke   enter duke almada your unexpected presence like a propitious omen cheers the night and gives a royal sanction to this meeting  duke my wish surpassed my speed  a call like this might imp the tardiness of feeble age the general perseverance in our cause transcends all gratitude  but these wronged virtues   to mello and roderic mello pray forbear the painful error brought its punishment ribiro bore our duties to your grace  duke he did and soon will join us  on our way he left me with design once more to view the posture of the guards  for still we fear some dark impending mischief from velasquez  almada whatever fortune waits upon our swords your highness must not share the common hazard lest in the tumult some inglorious chance deprive your country of its last best bulwark  duke and should i merit to be called her bulwark or rank with men like you  could i submit to hear and not partake the glorious danger  almada pray be advised  in this i must command  duke then be it so  but yet should ought betide to claim the interest of thy princes arm i cannot wrong our friendship to suspect you will forbear my summons to the field  almada trust your almada  lo the night wears fast nor are our scattered numbers yet returned  duke welcome ribiro what intelligence  enter ribiro ribiro the worst if we delay  oh had your eyes beheld the sight that blasted mine  duke what fight  ribiro lemos is seized this moment  and pizarro the ready tool of fell velasquez crimes leads him to prison  duke soon well wrench the gates and from their gloomy caverns draw to light all that remains of those unhappy men whom unarraignd unheard the tyrants nod consigned to horrors nature shakes to think of  almada his triumph will be short  the subtle fiend may league with hell to thwart us  but in vain his fate or ours must quickly be decided  ribiro even now it seems his demon whispers him his audit is at hand and scares his soul anxious at this late hour he walks his chamber nor seeks the seasons rest  and still more strange the palace guards stretched by their glimmering fires their arms cast by lie wrapped in thoughtless sleep  duke anon well rouse them with so loud a peal that deaths dull ear shall hear it  almada corea soon as our work begins your hardy tribes must through the streets proclaim don juan king press toward the palace should our friends give ground sustain their fainting strength  corea we will not fail  almada the general suffrage to thy sword ribiro commits our master work a deed so envied that every trenchant steel of portugal did not thy gallant zeal demand it first would strike to share the glory  ribiro pointing to his sword this shall thank you and if it reek not with his hated blood exchange it for a distaff  almada friends i mean not by gloomy presage to allay your ardor we must not look to fortune in this cause but on ourselves rely for sure success the least disorder in our bold approach the least repulse may drive our engine back one brave mans rashness or one cowards fear turns all our fairest hopes to shame and ruin  duke now to our stations  yet ere we depart this honest pledge the soldiers short embrace the sweet remembrance if we fall for freedom will more than soften half the pains of dying but if we meet in stronger clasps renewed will double all the joys of victory  end of the fourth act act v scene i the apartments of velasquez in the royal palace velasquez alone why am i haunted by these phantom fears it cannot be my fate it is natures weakness the spirits raised too high like billows puffed by sudden storms lift up our little bark then slipping from their burden sink as fast and leave it wrecked and foundring  enter pizarro velasquez have you as i commanded questioned lemos  pizarro just now i left him  velasquez has the slave confessed  pizarro with sullen calmness he defies your power or answers but with scorn  velasquez well find the means to make him speak more plainly to bring down this daring spirit  he is dangerous and under the fair mask of public virtue combines with proud almada and the rest in dark confedracy against my state  pizarro he is my lord the masterspring that moves the factious populace  velasquez i know it well but i have taken such care as shall unhinge their illcontrivd designs ere noon tomorrow don garcia with the spanish veterans from saint jagos fortress shall pour in and bend these stubborn necks to due obedience how will their disappointed fury rave to find their royal demagogue braganza the idol their vain worship raised so high low levelled with the earth  i wonder much ramirez not returns  nights latest watch will soon be told  pizarro perhaps he but delays for better welcome to behold the effect of the dire venom and to glad your ears by telling how your enemy expired  velasquez it may be so i cannot doubt the effect poison administered will do its work and this most speedily it is swift perdition yet though this hour cuts off my greatest foe if my firm soul were capable of fear i might distrust the promise of my fortunes  pizarro wherefore my lord  velasquez i almost blush to tell it tired with the travail of this anxious night i threw me on my couch and tried to rest i tried in vain  my vexed lids scarce closed or when a momentary slumber sealed them strange visions swam before their twilight sense  but why retrace the hideous phantasy yet still it hovers round me still remains a fearful reverence of the past illusion  pizarro such reverence but degrades a noble mind and sinks its vigor to an infants weakness beldams and priests infuse these idle fears and turn the milk of nature to its bane noise at a distance  velasquez heard you that noise did thou not mark pizarro the monk has kept his word  it is juans knell his followers who shouted him at noon now wail his death  my genius now has room their sorrows are my triumph and proclaim assured success to my aspiring soul  pizarro sure it is the din of clashing arms  again  it comes this way   enter officer with his sword drawn velasquez ha bleeding  speak know you the cause  speak instant speak   officer too well the raging multitude have forced their way their cry is where is the tyrant  where is velasquez don juans at their head and guides the storm  velasquez juan alive eternal silence seize thee impossible  officer these eyes my lord beheld him  saw his raised arm   velasquez ha am i then betrayed perdition catch ramirez  you pizarro collect my scattered train  i will forth and meet the rebels sword  pizarro be not so rash nor venture singly  exit velasquez  officer he rushes on his death two of my soldiers are already slain striving to bar the outward palace gates where like a tide the frantic people press bearing down all before them  pizarro hence begone the uproars louder  wake the sleeping grooms  bid them bring arms  alarm the magistrates  send to the guard and draw them to the square  exit officer reenter velasquez velasquez ruined undone all is lost  the streets are thronged with raging citizens  a furious band of armed portugueze just now are mounting fates bloody book is opened and i read my dreadful doom yet i will not tamely yield but grapple to the last with destiny  pizarro all is not lost  perhaps some means are left  velasquez just at the gate i met the dastard monk struggling for entrance  scarce his breath sufficed to tell me that our purpose had miscarried and juan lives  i stabbed him to the heart the best reward for unperforming fear  pizarro think not of him  but save yourself by flight  velasquez where can i fly  i am beset devoted  our foes like famished bloodhounds are abroad and have us in the wind  pizarro resolve at once  the posterns yet unforced that way escape disguise yourself and fly to juans palace it is but the terrace length  implore his mercy it is the foolish weakness of his nature to spare where he may punish  velasquez ask my life no rather let me perish  hold  his wife  perhaps alone unguarded  if i fall i will leave a scorpion in the traitors breast shall make him curse the hour he roused my fury exit  pizarro alone now let the tempest rise  oh fickle fortune this moment mounted to thy giddy top now whirled to earth and grovelling  hark  they come  ribiro entering with others search all the chambers  if the villain scape our works but half accomplished   pizarro pass no farther  ribiro this is the tyrants bosom counselor where is thy master spaniard  pizarro safe i hope from lawless rage like thine and still will live to punish this outrageous violence  ribiro insolent slave  and yet i like thy courage it is vain to strive deliver up thy sword i will not force thee to betray thy master perfidious as he is  even in a foe i can discern a virtue and esteem it gonsalez guard him safe  the rest disperse and leave no place unsearchd  he must be found but by your loves i charge you kill him not rob not my sword but leave that stroke for me  exeunt severally scene changes to the duke of braganzas palace enter duchess an attendant following duchess no ines no i love my husband much but more his honor could i press his stay in tame inaction here to wait the event while almost in his sight his crown and glory hung on the doubtful fate of others swords would he have heard me no i knew him better soon as almadas danger reached his ear who twice repulsed could scarce renew the charge swift as a javelin cuts the whistling air he snatched his sword and breaking from my arms rushed to the fight and joined the warring throng  ines that favoring power which has so often preserved will not forsake him now  duchess o grant it heaven go ines to the terrace and observe if any friend for sure i may expect it bring tidings from my husband exit ines would this arm this feeble arm had strength to second him the conflict here is worse  my restless heart swelled with eventful expectation throbs and feels its bounds too narrow  fear on fear like light reflected from the dancing wave visits all places but can rest in none the distant shouts that break the morning sky lift up a while my mounting thoughts to heaven then sinking leave them to fall down as low in boding apprehension  welcome welcome enter mendoza what of my lord  mendoza he bad me fly to greet you himself a while detained to stop the rage of cruelty and carnage  duchess he returns unhurt victorious to these happy arms  mendoza all all your fondest wish could form he brings crown conquest all  oppression is no more pierced by a thousand wounds the giant dies while freeborn men with fearless gaze walk round and view the monsters bulk  duchess i would know more  was it a dear bought triumph must we mourn the fall of many friends  mendoza scarce one of note but lives to share our joy  the regent seized gave orders for the citadels surrender to save the threatened lives of the whole council whom sleeping we secured  poorly content to obey her
