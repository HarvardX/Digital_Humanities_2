the school for arrogance a comedy  the school for arrogance a comedy  as it is acted at the theater royal covent garden  by thomas holcroft  the second edition  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternosterrow  m dcc xci  preface the comedy of le glorieux by m nericault destouches is the basis on which the school for arrogance has been formed from that i have taken the plan several of the characters and some of the scenes difference of arrangement additional incidents and what i deem to be essential changes of character have all been introduced the count has but little resemblance to the original lucy and mac dermot none lady peckham is a new character and was first suggested by a friend who conceiving highly of the contrast which exists in life between the pride of rank and the pride of riches industriously sought to stimulate and rouse my imagination  the subject of the piece is greatly interesting to morals and highly worthy of the theater conscious of the great effects a perfect comedy might have produced i regret the imperfections of the present some good it will do i regret that it cannot do more persuaded as i am of the moral dignity of the stage i cherish an enthusiastic wish to see the dramatic art surpass even all its former sublime efforts among the pleasures of the imagination how frequently has its place been the first happy indeed should i be could my success add the smallest impulse to the exertions of genius ineffably happy would but this noble art once more boldly assert its rank and render itself not only the general love and delight of mankind but the veneration of the wise  it is with peculiar pleasure that i here acknowledge how much i am indebted to the conduct of mr marshal who in consequence of the prejudices which it was imagined mr harris labored under respecting me acted for a time in my behalf as the author of the piece though anxiously zealous for its success he still continued impartially attentive to the interests of all parties and sacrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good  the tribute of justice is also due to mr harris this tribute i am happy to have an opportunity to pay and that i may now be consistent as i always have been in my private and public language to mr harris i will here insert a copy of a letter which i wrote to him when the comedy had been twice performed  sir i have patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you that moment i hope is now come i should be guilty of injustice were i any longer to delay expressing my sense of the propriety with which you have acted relatively to the school for arrogance after you had every reason to suppose it mine such conduct sir is highly honorable and is not only productive of the best effects but must secure the best and most permanent applause that you had conceived disadvantageous ideas of me i knew though i have no doubt but i shall ultimately convince you that even supposing me to be mistaken my motives have been laudable  a single phrase which relates entirely to myself is here omitted  with me you were irritated but you had the justice to forget the man and promote the interests of the piece this i hold it my duty to say to the world at large  i am sir your obliged humble servant t holcroft newman street feb         to thomas harris esquire mr harris kindly expressed the satisfaction which his own private feelings received from this letter nor can there be a doubt but that the propriety of his conduct under such circumstances will be as agreeable to himself and as pleasing to the public as it has been to me  newman street feb          prologue spoken by mr bernard in the character of a newshawker after sounding and calling great news without

can only subsist between equals   lucy but where is the inferiority   count madam   lucy you are above the poor the pitiful idea that wealth confers any claims   count perhaps it does not madam but beauty understanding wit in short mind confers ten thousand and in these i never beheld your peer   lucy very prettily spoken indeed and i am almost persuaded that you love me very dearly   count

to love   lucy you never recollect the dignity of your descent nor accuse mine of meanness you have too much understanding to plume your thoughts with turgid arrogance or to presume on the imaginary merit of an accident which none but ignorance prejudice and folly are so besotted as to attribute to themselves   count mankind have agreed madam to honor the descendants of the wise and the brave   lucy they have so  but you have too much native merit to arrogate to yourself the worth of others you are no jay decked in the peacocks feathers you are not idiot enough to imagine that a skin of parchment on which is emblazoned the arms and acts of one wise man with a long list of succeeding fools is any honor to you responsible to mankind for the use or the abuse of such talents as you feel yourself endowed with you think only of how you may deserve greatly and disdain to be that secondary thing that insignificant cipher which is worthless except from situation   count the feelings of injured honor madam perhaps may be too irritable they shrink from insult and spurn at contamination yet honor is the source of a thousand virtues the parent of ten thousand glorious deeds honor is generous sincere and magnanimous the protector of innocence the assertor of right the avenger of wrong yes honor is the patron of arts the promoter of science the bulwark of government the defender of kings and the savior of nations  indulge me then in cherishing a sentiment so noble   lucy indulge  applaud you mean honor with you never degenerates into ostentation is never presumptuous is no boaster is eager to earn but scorns to extort preeminence your honor is not that abject inflated phantom which usurps contested claims exacts submission which it does not merit offends irritates and incites disgust nay tarnishes even virtue itself you do not under the word honor seek a miserable cobweb covering for exorbitant pride   count madam accusation so pointed so    lucy nay now have not i

proper moment the presence of a third person might be some restraint on the workings of pride of the violent ebullitions of which i am in great apprehension   edm had i but met the count before he had

you madam   lucy yes i have  it is a pity nay indeed a shame that so famous an english family as that of the sheepys should become extinct   sir sam hem  there is no danger of that madam   lucy no  why it is too late in life for you to marry sir samuel    sir sam hem  yes madam no madam   lucy indeed so you  well i should like to know your choice  some staid body i imagine   sir sam madam  hem    lucy but i would not have her too old and disagreeable   sir sam hem i can assure you madam  she  hem  she is a very beautiful young lady   lucy you surprise me  oh then perhaps she is some lowborn girl who has more pride than understanding and is willing to sacrifice her youth and beauty to the silly vanity of riding in a coach   sir sam quite  hem  quite the contrary madam   lucy then she must be poor and must think of marrying you for the sake of your riches hoping you will die soon   sir sam madam  hem she is very rich   lucy is it possible   sir sam and i should flatter myself would not expect me to die too soon   lucy oh but she will young women never marry old men but with a wish to dance over their graves   sir sam hem   lucy perhaps the poor girl may  may have made a faux pas   sir sam hem her virtue is unspotted madam   lucy you amaze me young rich beautiful and virtuous what can her reason be for making choice of you why does not she rather marry some youth whose rare qualities resemble her own  oh i have found the secret at last she is an idiot   sir sam hem no madam  no  hem  i am afraid she has too much wit   lucy nay then sir samuel you are the most fortunate gentleman i ever heard or read of  but are you sure she is in love with you   sir sam hem n  not very madam   lucy no  oh ho i have unriddled it at last you have been bargaining for her with her father or her mother or  ay ay the poor young ladys consent has never been asked  and would you be so selfish as to seek your own single gratification and be contented to see her condemned to misery pining to death for the youth she loves and justly detesting the sight of you as the wicked unfeeling author of her wretchedness   sir sam hem looking toward the door madam i  hem  i wish you a good evening   lucy preventing his going another word sir samuel have you ever talked to the young lady on the subject   sir sam hem i  hem  i have and  hem i have not   lucy you never made a direct

to escape   lucy though you could form so unjust a project you never had the courage to insult the lady by an avowal of your guilt   sir sam hem guilt madam   lucy yes sir guilt  however sir she has perfectly understood your insinuations   sir sam madam   lucy she has infinite respect for filial duties but though she would beware of offending her parents i know her to be equally determined never to entail misery on herself nor to accept a husband whom she could neither esteem admire nor love   sir sam madam  i  hem  your servant madam   lucy between him and the door not till you first promise    sir sam forgetting his fear i will promise any thing madam   lucy that you will not render yourself more ridiculous by persevering in so absurd so unjust a pursuit   sir sam no madam i am quite ridiculous enough already   lucy nay more that you will not seek some less friended more enslaved or more timid young creature whom your misapplied wealth might command   sir sam whatever you please madam   lucy but that you will rather apply your superfluous hoards to the protection of youthful innocence   sir sam suffer me but to depart madam and i will bequeath my estates in perpetuity as you shall direct i will entail them on the magdalen or i will advertise for marriageable men and maids and you shall portion out my money among them i will  i will do any thing except marry or go a

dominion of prejudice so weak do you still repent of what you so long have deemed your condescension   count far otherwise madam there are beings so peculiarly favored of heaven and endowed with such high perfections both of body and of mind that they are superior to all the distinctions of men among whom they walk angels upon earth you are one of these and my misery is i never can deserve you

me to persist nay a second time to aid deception   lucy you did wrong  but which of us can say they never erred   edm ay who will stand forth and affirm that amid the rude whirl the confused doubts or the terrors of passion they never once have been betrayed into your crime for a crime i own it is and with consequences so wide so pernicious and so fatal that when it shall be extirpated from the earth that moment man will be perfect but in this poor worlds present state it is so far venial that painful humiliating thought no  the noblest the purest of us all cannot strike his heart and say  i never was a liar   lucy frail as we are and hourly as the arts of falsehood are practiced upon us to our detriment and often to our ruin those only are most free from guilt who shake contagion soonest
