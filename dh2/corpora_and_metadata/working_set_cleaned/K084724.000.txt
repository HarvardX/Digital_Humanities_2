theory of the moon in the astronomical lectures with its construction for london rome and stockholme by w whiston ma nb the inquisitive are desired nicely to observe whether in such places where the eclipse is plainly total there be not streaks of red light just before and after that total darkness and how long it is visible for if there be it will imply that it is an atmosphere about the moon

projected at the distance of the moon the elliptick parallels with their hours represent the cities of london rome and stockholme as placed at those hours at different times the principal strait line divided by dotts represents the path of the moons center ever the disk of the earth and by the hours in larger and those above and below in smaller characters the position of the center is determind at those times for those places respectively so that if with a pair of compasse we take from the proper scale the semediameter of the penumbra and carry it along the path till it first reaches to and then leaves the same minute on any parallel that is the very time of its begining and ending there and if at any intermediate time in both you make circles one with the moons semidiameter on its path the other with the suns on any of the   parallels the intercepted part will show the quantity of the eclipse at that time in the place to  which the parallel you we does belong and if you carry a square along the path till the perpendicular side cuts the same hour and minute there and in any parallel that is the middle of the eclipse there of all which you have examples in the scheme only note that the center of the penumbra at    after   and at   after    which are the beginning and ending of the general eclipse extends beyond the copper plate and is to be supplied by the ren at the intersection of the proper lines there to directed  the breadth of the entire penumbra or paitial eclipse upon this perpendicular plain appears by the construction to be no less than      minutes or geographical mibes on each side of the moons path or    0 miles in all which correspond to many more on the spherical surface of the earth nor is it all confind as you may see here to that surface but reaches off a greatway into the empty space beyond it northward the lines which distinguish that breadth on each side into    parts denote so many digits of the suns eclipses besides for the total shade and the places both as to long   lat where the sun will at any time be so much eclipsed and indeed i would willingly have procured a general map here to have showed over what countries and places the entire shadow would pass as doctor halley has given us a particular map of england for the passage of the total shadow over it but the nature of the construction does not admit of that projection such a thing cannot be truly represented any other way than by the copernicus where there is a real globe of the earth capable of a diurnal motion during the time of the eclipse the imposibility of which in all perspective projections of the sphere renders that designs otherwise impracticable nor can i determine by this construction whether the eclipse will be total at london or not because the circles of the sun and moon at the southern limit seem here exactly coincident but if we go by a construction according to our calculation the digits eclipsed at london will be hardly more than    and the shadow will go full  0 miles more northward than in dr halleys map  so that ye middle of the general eclipse in common or apparent time will be  0    after nine in the morning differing from dr halleys computation near   min but note that the construction is accommodated to the drs calculation  note also that hence the breadth of the shadow of total darkness will be    geographical miles and that its length on the oblique horizon of london will be near   0 miles as dr halleys description asserts  but it must be here observed that if in this calculation the that and  th new equations of the moon taken from s isaac newtons theory were neglected this calculation would be much nearer to dr halleys as it is now nearer to mr flamsteeds this eclipse if the air prove clear for exact observations will go agreat ay to determine how far those equations are just and how far they are necessary in the calculation of the new and full moons and of eclipses that happen

revolution of eclipses both solar and lunar mentioned by pliny not hist ii and by him only of all the ancients is the interval of     synodical months       days or     julian years with  0 days when the cycle or period contains   leapyears and with    days when with   hours    in which time the direct mean motion of the moon and her apogee in the ecliptic is nearly so much more and the retrograde mean motion of the nodes nearly so much less than entire revolutions as the mean motion of the moon from the sun upon which all mean conjunctions oppositions and eclipses properly depend exceeds the like entire revolutions which coincidences do therefore nearly restore the mean state of the moon it self its apogee nodes and lunations and produce an eminent revolution of correspondent new moons ull moons and eclipses after that interval perpelly  this appears by the following calculation of all these mean motions from the astronomical tables  mean motion of the sun or earth s years

from    signs 0   0 0        whence it appears that the difference of the mean motions of the apogee and of the nodes from that of the moon her self in the ecliptic in such a period is but small not more in the former case than            nor in the latter than        0   whence also it appears that the lunar apogee does in every such cycle differ but    of the entire difference      0    that the lunar node only differs in that cycle   of the entire difference 0     0     and that the anomaly of the sun it self differs only    of the entite anomaly  0     0     which quantities being generally small cannot occasion any great inequality in the times and circumstances of new and full moons or of eclipses nor by consequence greatly disturb the regular succession of the same in any single period nor indeed very greatly in several successive periods for since the mean motion of the moon from the sun is within a very small matter ever certain and invariable that revolution is always just and always determines the mean time of all conjunctions oppositions and eclipses rightly and since the other anomalies are but small and always come right again in length of time they cannot ever produce any very great anomalies in our calculations from them as will farther appear under the following scholia  n b this period for eclipses has of late been called both by mr flamsteed and dr halley the saros or the chaldean saros as if it were known and used by the old chaldeans and thence called by that name for which i know no sufficient foundation there is indeed a gross mistake of plinys number in suidas who thus applies this term     for     months as almost all the editions of pliny still have it and he calls that period by this chaldean name saros yet the chaldeans never that we find applied it to any other period than that of   00 years or days by which period alone all the antediluvian reigns are determined both in abydenus and berosus themselves from the ancentest records of that kingdom see my new theory the later editions hypoth x lem to the third argument and appendix to the essay toward restoring the true text of the old testament p  0        scholia   we may here observe that since the limit for eclipses of the moon is about     0   00 on each side of the node as is the limit for eclipses of the sun about     0   000 if we divide  00 the limit of the moons eclipses by            which is the difference between the revolution of the moon to the sun and of the node above given we shall have nearly twenty five for the number of cycles after a central lunar eclipse in one of the nodes before the moon goes off the shadow of the earth entirely at the same node and   0 years           0 or double that number  00 years for the time that the moon begins to enter the ecliptic limit on one side till it goes out of it on the other during which long interval there will still be eclipses of the moon each period and if we divide  000 the limit of the suns eclipses by the same number     we shall have nearly    for the number of periods after a solar central eclipse at the middle of the earth in one of the nodes before the penumbra goes off the north or south parts of the disk of the earth entirely at the same time i e   0 years           0 or double that number    0 years from the time that the moon in any such period begins to enter the ecliptic limit on one side till it goes out of on the other during which longer interval there will still be somewhere eclipses of the sun each period after which respective long intervals of time there will be no such eclipses for much longer intervals    since the utmost latitude of the moon that can permit any lunar eclipse is about    and the same utmost latitude that can permit a solar eclipse is about    if we divide the first number by    or the last by    the numbers of revolutions for the ecliptic limits we shall have about         for the mean alteration of the moons latitude in each single period all along and this both for solar and lunar eclipses which latitude will be south during the one half of the long period of the ecliptic limits beforementioned and north during the other half gradually increasing and as gradually decreasing perpetually as in the following table  a table of the mean latitudes of the moon each single cycle either north or south beginning at an eclipse in one of the nodes without any latitude at all  latitudes for    cycles in lunar and    in solar eclipses cycles                                                                      0                                                        0                               0  0                            0     0                   0                            0                                              0       since the principal alteration in the quantity and duration of total eclipses of the sun arises from the difference there is at any time between the real distances and apparent diameters of the sun and moon at the time of such eclipses that quantity and duration must depend on the difference of their mean anomalies which gives us that difference of distances and diameters and must therefore answer in each cycle one with another to the differences of those mean anomalies during that interval which in the sun comes to  0   0 or      of its entire anomaly and in the moon to     or   of its entire anomaly and since the whole mean excentricity of the moon is somewhat above three times as great as that of the sun or as  000 to    00 the differences of the suns distances and diameters will be but a little greater in each period one with another than those of the moon    when therefore the anomalies of the sun and moon are of the same species i mean both ascending or both descending their distances and diameters will one with another increase or decrease nearly in the same proportion and the quantity and duration of total darkness will alter but little in such a period but when those anomalies are of the contrary species that is the one ascending while the other descends they will alter considerably so that if the sun be descending and its apparent diameter increasing while the moon is ascending and its apparent diameter decreasing the eclipse of the sun will each succeeding cycle afford a smaller total shadow till at last it afford no total shadow at all but the eclipses become annular and if the sun be ascending while the moon is descending the contrary will happen and the total shadow grow greater perpetually from which circumstances of the sun and moon in each revolution of the cycle duly considered we may nearly determine whether any succeeding correspondent eclipse will afford us a greater or less total shadow or whether the eclipses will be only annular    from the like circumstances we may also nearly determine whether such eclipses will come somewhat sooner or later than that of the mean revolution of the period before us for if the earth be much nearer its aphelion than the moon its apogaeon at the end of any cycle and by consequence if the earth then revolve comparatively slower and the moon swifter than ordinary the meeting of the luminaries will be accelerated and if the earth be much remoter from its aphelion than the moon from its apogaeon the contrary will happen and the moon will be later than ordinary ever it overtake the sun so that in the former case the eclipse will come a little before and in the latter a little after the proper conclusion of that period    since the motion of the node backward in one of these periods does not quite reach to the conjunction or opposition that node must every cycle go forward with respect to the lunations and eclipses and at the ascending node the moon will pass more southward and at the descending node more northward successively thus at the solar eclipse may     0  the moon near its ascending node had greater northern latitude than it will have at the next corresponding solar eclipse may         and thus at the total solar eclipse april         the moon near its descending node had less northern latitude than it will have at its corresponding great eclipse may           since the motion of the moons apogee forward is greater in one of these periods than that of the lunations that apogee must also go forward every cycle and if at any one solar eclipse that apogee be in quadrature with the sun after it had been in conjunction the moon will the next period descend by going backward in its eclipses toward the perigee and if at any one such apogee it be in the quadrature after it had been in opposition it will the next cycle ascend the reverse of all which is true in lunar eclipses    the place and motion of the sun in its ellipsis is so easily known and that for many ages by bare memory and reflection that a few words will suffice the sun is now farthest from the earth eight days after the longest day and nearest to it eight days after the shortest and its motion about   degree in    years whence it is evident that it has for all the past ages of astronomy been about the summer solstice in our apogee and about the winter solstice in our perigee if i may use the trms of the ptolemaick system nor is it therefore any wonder that the greatest total eclipses of the sun have happened still in the summer and the geatest annular ones in the winter half year since the farther the sun is off in the winter the less must be its apparent diameter and by consequence the greater the excess of the moons diameter above it on which excess alone the greatness of such eclipses depends and the reverse is equally evident in the case of annular eclipses in winter nor indeed is it very strange that annular eclipses are in these parts of the world so rarely observed since they most usually happen in winter days which being short must afford us a proportionably small number of them to the inhabitants of the other side of the equator the reverse must happen but those eclipses very rarely come to our notice    since this period reaches only from the middle of one general eclipse to another without regard to the position of any particular place on the earths surface arising from the diurnal motion we must remember that if an eclipse of the sun happens at any particular place considerably before noon it will come sooner and after noon later than the proper conclusion of this period though it must be noted that eclipses of the moon being absolute in their own nature are here wholly unconcerned and no way subject to any acceleration retardation or alteration on account of the diurnal motion of the earth   0 the principal alteration of the time of the day in all eclipses depends on the excess of this period above an even number of days which is   hours and    so that the cycle does naturally put every correspondent eclipse later than the foregoing almost   hours or one third part of a day which thing by reason of the intervening diurnal motion greatly alters all eclipses especially solar not only as to the bare time of the day when but also as to the places on the earth where such correspondent eclipse will be visible     if therefore we join three of these cycles together those odd hours and minutes will amount nearly to a whole day and will therefore nearly bring the middle point of the correspondent eclipses to the same time in the same place and in part with the same circumstances as before which a single cycle cannot possibly do only with the anticipation of  0 in time which three single cycles therefore of       days or of    years with    or    days i call the grand cycle and this will be i think of the greatest and readiest use in remote eclipses of any other period whatsoever  thus for example there was a total eclipse of the sun on black monday as it has thence been called ever since march         about ten a clock in the morning total i say it was in the north of ireland and the northwest of scotland though not so at london ot the remoter parts of england and scotland to this if we add one cycle the time of the next correspondent eclipse will thus be discovered y d h to a d      march 00       00 00 add     0         sum    0 april 00           so that the correspondent total eclipse ought to have been a d    0 april the  th    past   aclock in the evening and because the earth was then a small matter nearer its aphelion than the moon its apogaeon the time would be a little anticipated on that account but then because this eclipse was toward evening it would be much more retarded on that account than anticipated on the other and the main part of the eclipse would happen after sunset and be here invisible  to this time if we add another cycle the next correspondent eclipse will in like manner be discovered y d h to a d    0 april 00 0          add               sum      april 00           0 so that the next correspondent total eclipse ought to have been april  0th    after one in the morning and was therefore to be sure utterly invisible to us here to this time if we add another cycle we have the next correspondent total eclipse thus y d h to a d      april 00           0 add     0 0        sum   0  may 00 00    0     so that the next correspondent total eclipse was to have been a d   0    past nine aclock in the morning which is not much before the time when it was observed here and was no other than that famous eclipse which was total at cadiz barcelona marseilles geneva bern and zurich and became very remarkable for the raising of the siege of barcelona during that total darkness though i have been informed by several there present that it came to both armies wholly unexpected till the great darkness of the sky forced them to attend to it now this affords us also a remarkable instance of the near approximation of our grand cycle both as to time and place for if instead of tracing this correspondent eclipse through the distinct cycles we had at once taken our grand cycle of    years and    days we had come immediately to this eclipse and by allowing the anticipation of  0 had been within about  0 of the calculation at london  to this time if we add another single cycle we shall have the next correspondent eclipse thus y d h to a d   0  may 00 00    0     add     0 0        sum      may 00    0     00 so that we ought hence to expect the total eclipse next may       past   in the afternoon and because both the position of the sun and moon in their ellipses and the more considerable alteration from the time of the day which is here much farther in the evening than the last was in the morning oblige us to suppose about  h retardation we hence justly expect that this eclipse will be the nearest total at london about  0 past six in the evening as the exactest calculations do determine     if we would now trace a few lunar eclipses by this cycle we may do it according to the following examples  a d       feb    about    past  0 aclock at night mr flamsteed observed the middle of a great and total eclipse of the moon at greenwich proceed therefore as is already directed to find the next correspondent eclipse of the moon thus y d h to a d       february 00     0    00 add       0        sum       00 febr 00             so that this first correspondent total eclipse of the moon ought to have been feb          00    past six aclock in the morning or in the daytime and so must needs have been in great part to us invisible  y d h to a d       00 feb 00             add     0 0        sum        march 00 0  0      0 so that the next correspondent total eclipse of the moon ought to have been march            after two aclock in the afternoon which was in the daytime also and so must equally with the former have been here invisible  y d h to a d        march 00 0  0      0 add     0 0        sum      march 00     0 0     so that the next total correspondent eclipse of the moon is hence to be expected a d      march     h past  0 aclock at night which is about an hour and half sooner than the calculation which difference we shall presently find to be near the greatest difference that can happen  this may also be equally obtained by one entire grand cycle of    years and    days with the forementioned anticipation of  0 which from feb           0h    brings us directly to march           past  0 aclock at night or to somewhat above an hour and half before the calculation  n b as to the proper quantity of the several alterations arising in each period which ought to be allowed for they are nearly these the moon and sun being about    in diameter and the digits of their observation being    while the difference of the moons latitude as we have seen is about      or the twelfth part of those diameters it is plain that the mean natural alteration of every period in the same circumstances is about one digit though less in the lesser and greater in greater latitudes which in the moon whose eclipse is to all spectators the same holds constantly and though the diurnal motion of the earth removes all particular places so much each period as to render this rule less observable in solar eclipses yet after each grand period which nearly restores their former position it will hold in a good degree there also i mean so as to alter about   digits therein but besides that of the digits eclipsed we ought also to see what alteration in time may happen to each period now as to the inequality of the suns motion it is as we have seen  0  and its greatest velocity is at the earths perihelion and its least at its aphelion its greatest alteration therefore must be in aphelio and perihelio and is the difference of the equation belonging every where to the addition of  0  and is here    which space the earth goes in about  0 of time so that the difference of time on this account must each period be some quantity less than  0 and as to the inequality of the moons motion it is also greatest at the perigee and apogee and its greatest alteration at the extreme eccentricities of its orbit is the difference of the equations at      in perigee and apogee according to those extreme eccentricities    which the moon usually goes in somewhat less than  0 so that the difference of time on this account must each cycle be some quantity less than  0 minutes also  and now we come to the principal alteration in time that can happen in eclipses though it belongs only to those of the sun and that is the time of the day when they happen in any particular place now because the center of the moon usually goes over an entire diameter of the disk of the earth in about three hours and an half part of which is almost always before and part after noon while the odd hours of a small cycle  h    may reach equally from a forenoon to an afternoons successive eclipse it is possible such an eclipse may appear an hour and three quarters later than the period it self would determine it though usually this alteration will not be near so great especially when the latitude of the moon is very considerable but then it is so easy to allow very nearly for this inequality upon a little consideration that it ought not to be objected against the accuracy of this period if for six hours from noon we allow about an hour and half and for two hours three quarters of an hour we shall not err very much from the true time  corollary if we would know what is the greatest inequality in digits and time in a grand period made up of three common ones or of    years    or    days besides the constant anticipation of  0 we must say it may possibly though it will very rarely be almost thrice the quantities already stated for a single cycle excepting the last and principal difference peculiar to solar eclipses which is never much greater than that already mentioned  n b if any are not contented to know these matters by such approximations but desire the utmost accuracy they must either make use of dr halleys equations fitted to this cycle when published or rather make use of mr flamsteeds or dr halleys most accurate astronomical tables when published with that trigonometrical calculation afterward which i publish and exemplify in this paper in the former part of which work this cycle with its proper equations will at least save us the one half of our calculation if it will not bring us it self to that utmost accuracy which indeed is hardly to be expected from it  so that upon the whole if we duly consider the particular circumstances of the sun and moon with those of the aphelion apogee and node and with the times of the day or night when the cycle ends and rightly apply them to this single cycle and to this grand cycle we shall be able nearly to determine the correspondent eclipses with very small trouble or calculation  ii the plane in which the center of the moon moves in eclipses is not that of the ecliptic but of the orbit of the moon considered with the annual motion or it is a plane inclined to the plane of the ecliptic in an angle of about      which in the calculation of eclipses is usually styled the angle of the moons visible way this principal plane i call the lunar plane  iii this lunar plane cuts the sphere of the earth considered without its diurnal motion in a circle whose pole or vertex is distant from the pole of the ecliptic in the same angle this circle i call the lunar circle  iv in eclipses which happen at the solstices and in the nodes of the moons orbit the distance of these poles is exactly eastward or westward in those which happen at the equinoxes and nodes the distance is exactly north and south but in all other cases it is oblique  v the angle of that obliquity is always composed of the distance of the sun and moon from the solstitial colure with the distance of the same from the nodes and is sometimes the sum and sometimes the difference of those quantities  vi the distance between this vertex and the pole of the earth when eclipses happen at the solstices is the sum or difference of the two forementioned angles of inclination the one of the pole of the equator and of the pole of the ecliptic        the other of the pole of the ecliptic and of the vertex of the lunar circle       nearly but in all other cases a spherical triangle must be solved in order to find that distance of which hereafter  vii since the solstitial colure is a great circle that is also a meridian or passes through the poles of the earth and ecliptic and since besides the distance between the vertex of the lunar circle and the pole of the earth we shall want the angle included between the colure and that line this also must be obtained by the like solution of a spherical triangle of which hereafter  viii since the great circle that passes through the poles of the earth and of the lunar circle and that alone cuts both those circles and their parallels at right angles that meridian and that alone wherein that distance lies is perpendicular to the path of the moons center along the other and will determine the point in that path wherein  center of the shadow cuts that meridian at r ghtangles and approaches nearest of all to the pole of the earth and indeed lays the found o of our future calculations this meri i call the primary meridian  ix the angular distance about the pole of the earth of the meridian that is directed to the sun at the middle point of the whole eclipse from the primary meridian is composed of the sum or difference of the angle made by the solstitial colure and the primary meridian and of the complement of the suns right ascension at the middle of the general solar eclipse which angle is of the greatest consequence in our future calculations this angle i call the primary angle  x since the motion of the center of the shadow of the moon in solar eclipses is nearly even and nearly rectilinear since it is also in the plane of the lunar circle and is all one as if it were along a line that touched that circle at the middle of the general eclipse the point of contact we must divide each quadrant of  0 degrees into  0 or   0 unequal parts but so that the difference of the sines of those unequal angles may be equal and    or   0 of the entire radius that so the first sine 0 may be      00000 the second      00000 the third  00000 etc and this

may be discovered by tables made from the natural sines where those sines themselves as before differ equally or in arithmetical progression according to the duration of the whole eclipse or of total darkness and their cosines correspond to the distances from that path both which tables here follow for entire eclipses which are here supposed  0  long in the middle and the semidiameter of the

situation of that axis to its own circle are always right angles only diminished in the proportion of the minutes described by the annual motion during the continuance of the eclipse thus in our present eclipse which retains the center of the shadow near three hours upon the earths disk in which time the annual motion amounts to about   each of those right angles in strictness are to be esteemed only       and both together        only because the refraction of the rays of the sun through our atmosphere requires a somewhat greater increase of this angle than the annual motion requires its diminution i shall wholly omit it in all my calculations hereafter  xiii the angles made at the poles of the earth which show the difference of the two extreme meridians and limit the extent of the entire central eclipse by reason of the obliquity of the earths axis to that lunar circle are usually unequal to one another and more or fewer than twice  0 as the eclipse happens at different latitudes of the moon and times of the year  xiv the meridian that passes through the middle or central point of general solar eclipses is the same with that which passes through the center of the sun at the same time when the moon has no latitude and the eclipses are central in the plane of the ecliptic as also when they happen in either solstices otherwise the moons latitude being taken perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic and the nearest distance of the moons motion being taken perpendicular to the lunar circle while the meridians always pass through the poles of the earth these two meridians will generally speaking be different and their included angle no otherwise to be known than by trigonometry as will appear hereafter  xv the dimensions of the penumbra or entire eclipse and the extent of the total shadow on the earth are continually different according to the different elevations of the sun and moon above any particular horizon for as the moon is about the same distance from every place when it is in its horizon as it is from the earths center it self with regard to which center alone our first calculations are always made so when it is in the zenith of any place it is one semidiameter of the earth nearer it which semidiameter being usually   0 and at our next eclipse      of its entire distance as will appear hereafter will deserve an allowance nor will any lesser elevation of the moon be wholly inconsiderable in eclipses but in all accurate determinations thereof must be particularly computed in order to the distinct knowledge of the extent of such eclipses especially of the breadth of the total shadow therein accordingly we are to observe that this breadth of the total shadow will certainly be at this eclipse considerably greater over north america where the luminaries are greater elevated above the horizon than over europe where they are much nearer it as this calculation requires of which hereafter  xvi the figure of the entire penumbra or general eclipse and of the umbra or total darkness as they appear upon every country is different on account of the different obliquity of every horizon and will make ovals or ellipses of different species perpetually this in the vast penumbra is best understood by such an instrument as my copernicus or by the perusal of a very scarce book written by p coursier philos transact no     p     and cited by dr halley which distinctly treats of the intersection of a conical and spherical surface but in the smaller umbra or total darkness which is confined to a much narrower compass it very nearly approaches to the intersection of a conick surface with a plane which is a true ellipsis  xvii the species of that ellipsis depends on the suns altitude above the horizon at the time of total darkness as does the position of its longer axis on the azimuth of the sun at the same time nor is it at all necessary that the direction of this or any other ellipsis should be along either of the axes but may as well be along any other diameter whatsoever  xviii the direction of the center of the shadow is according to the direction of the moons motion along the plane of the lunar circle as compounded with the diurnal motion or with the direction and velocity of those parts of the earth over which it passes and will be hereafter brought to calculation and indeed this angle may be had either by finding the several points of the path of the moons way upon the earth in as many meridians as we please and drawing a curve line through those points or by solving a spherical triangle whose sides are the complements of the latitudes of two neighboring places equally distant east and west from the place you work for and whose included angle is the angle at the pole suited to the difference of their meridians and taking half the the two angles at the base the one internal and the other external for the angle desired of which hereafter  xix every ellipsis made by the oblique section of a cone has the intersection of the fig   axis of the cone c at some distance from the center of the ellipsis d and the proportion of those unequal divisions b c and c a are the same with that of the sides of the cone v b and v a as appears by the elem iii   elements of euclid whence it is evident that the proper center of the total shadow in eclipses of the sun or that made by the axis of the cone is not the same with the center of the elliptick shadow and that the proportion of its distance from that center may be easily determined by the proposition here referred to of which more hereafter  scholium this ellipsis when the sun is of a considerable altitude is almost an exact one but when the sun is near the horizon it will be very long and so less exact because the spherical surface of the earth is at that distance more remote from a plane  xx the perpendicular breadth of the shadow is neither that of the longer nor that of the shorter axis but that of the two longest perpendiculars fig   a b and c d drawn from the tangents parallel to the diameter d b along which the direction of the motion is the length of which perpendiculars will be hereafter determined  xxi the velocity of the motion of the center of the shadow is unequal not only on account of the difference of the moons own motion at the beginning and ending of the entire eclipse which indeed is very inconsiderable but chiefly by reason of the difference of the obliquity of the horizon all the way of its passage however since the several points may in all meridians be distinctly found by trigonometry as we shall show presently this inequality need create us no new difficulty in the determination of eclipses  xxii the number of digits eclipsed which are twelfth parts of the suns diameter with sexagesimal parts of the same digits are always to be estimated as distinct from the total shadow and may be discovered by the help of the foregoing table p     0    where the digits are already noted at every proper distance from the path of the moons center and where the intermediate fraction      is more exact than    but which by dividing that number      by    will give those sexagesimals without any farther trouble the application of that table will be taught hereafter  xxiii the distance of the vertex of the conical shadow of the moon which sometimes just reaches the surface of the earth as in total eclipses sine mora sometimes does not reach it as in annular eclipses and sometimes would overreach it if it were not intercepted as in total eclipses cum mora may be easily discovered at any time by the analogy following as p c the fig   semidiameter of the moon      geographical miles is to cv the distance of the moon from that vertex     000 so is r s     the smallest semidiameter of the total shadow which is the same as of the circular shadow it self to s v the distance of that vertex therefrom   0    which is thus        000     0     xxiv the determination of the circumstances of solar eclipses for any given distance from the path of the moons center either way has no new difficulty in it but is to be made just as is that for the center of the penumbra only the quantity of the distance of the vertex of the lunar plane from that circle will be different as the path of the moons center it self might be at another eclipse of otherwise the same circumstances  xxv if two bodies a and b set out together the one from a the other from b and move evenly forward in a known proportion as to velocity the point c will be determined where the swifter will overtake the slower and they will be coincident thus if the velocity of a fig   be to that of b as   to   the proportion of the lines a b to b c will be as   to   and if we add   to      we have the place c where the swifter will overtake the slower thus if their velocities be to each other as     to   the lines of their motion a b and b c will be as     to   so that if we take in the former case of a b and in the other     of a b and add it to a b we gain ac the distance of the point c from a  corollary if therefore a represent the center of the shadow of a solar eclipse as it is placed at the middle of the general eclipse and b greenwich at the same moment of absolute time and at a known distance from the middle point and if the velocity of the center of the

the center of the eclipse will overtake greenwich or the time when the eclipse will be at the meridian of greenwich and this whether the center and greenwich move along the same line as a b c or two different lines as a b c and a b c  xxvi the duration of solar eclipses is different according as their middle happes about six in the morning or evening or aout noon or about any intermediate time if that happens about six aclock morning or evening the diurnal motion then neither much conspires with nor opposes the proper motion of the center of the shadow and the duration is almost the same as it would be if the earth had no diurnal motion at all if that happens about noon the diurnal motion most of all conspires with that proper motion of the center and makes the duration of the eclipse the longest possible if it happens in the intermediate times the diurnal motion in a less degree conspires with the other motion and makes the duration of a men quantity between that of the other cases but if it happens considerably before six aclock in the morning or after six aclock in the evening the diurnal motion is backward and shortns that duration proportionably of the quantity of which

hence the angular motion of the center of the eclipse about the pole of the earth if there were no diurnal motion is  0      xii to find the time in which the center of the shadow will go over the diameter of the lunar circle  say first      0        0   i e as the number of minutes of a degree passed over in an hour to an hour so is the entire diameter of the disk from the calculation to the number of minutes for that passage  then say  0000       0        i e as the radius to the sine of        the distance of the lunar circle from its pole or vertex so are the minutes of the passage over the entire diameter to the minutes of the passage over this chord          xiii to find the proportion of the velocities of the center of the shadow and of the diurnal motion of the corresponding point of the earth at the time of the eclipse  say thus as      to        0     or as   to     so is the time of the center of the eclipses motion over the diameter of the lunar circle to the timeof the diurnal motions going from the entranceto the exit of the center  corollary hence the real angular motion of the center of the eclipse about the pole of the earth is no more than      0 for          0          0  xiv to find the latitude of any place over or near which the center of any shadow passes to any known longitude or time given and vice versa to find the longitude or time of the nearest approach to any such place to any known latitude this is no more than proceeding in the calculations as hitherto by taking any known meridian or time or else any known latitude for our examples  i shall therefore give three several examples in both cases because of the great dignity and usefulness of the problem viz for greenwich the meridian of the tables for dublin more westward and for paris more eastward  now i here suppose from the calculation and construction of eclipses that the middle of this general eclipse will happen may            past   aclock in the afternoon and that its center will cross the meridian of greenwich    past   upon which hypothesis i thus compute from the angle  00      h    deduct the primary angle  0    there remains the angle of the pole q p c        then proceed thus r  0 cs q p c          0     t p v    00    0     tp r         0        say then cs p v    00        0 cs p r                cs v c              0     0  0  cs r c

diff 00     n b my calculation differs from dr halleys scheme no less than a full degree of a great circle in the meridian if our difference of time which is about   be allowed and though we take the doctors own time yet do we differ in latitude    minutes or miles by which quantity the doctors scheme brings the center of the eclipse nearer to london and greenwich than this calculation the reason of which difference i by no means understand time will discover which determination is most accurate  dublin is about      westward in longitude from greenwich let us find the latitude of the center of the shadow when it crosses the meridian of dublin we must proceed thus as     to     so is      to     deduct then from the angle at the pole used for greenwich this difference of these angles                   which is our angle at the pole for dublin so that if we use the former figure with that angle we compute as before r  0 cs q p c             0  t p v    0    0     t r p    0

         now                    then r  0 cs q p c                t p v    0    0     t r p       0          say then cs p v    0        0 cs r p                cs v c              0     0 0   cs r c              0  deduct r p        remt  p c       ergo lat         n b by such calculations we may determine the latitude of the center of the shadows way from its entry upon till its exit out of the disk of the earth to every known meridian a specimen of which i intend to give presently for the several east and west longitudes from london in the eclipse before us and another specimen in the eclipse sept         if the latitudes be given as for the meridian of greenwich       for dublin       for paris       the case will be that of a spherical triangle when all the sides are given and the longitude or time is an angle sought thus in the foregoing figure for greenwich v c        is the side against the angle sought v p     0 and p c   0    from which data we thus discover the angle

difference of the angle at the pole in time say then                 which is the difference in time of the meridians of greenwich and dublin  for paris thus vc        r  0 v p     00 s      0   p c

difference in time of the meridians of greenwich and paris  corol   the latter branch of the problem determines the hour and minute when the center of the eclipse crosses the meridian at any assigned latitude and by a very small allowance when the very middle of the eclipse or of total darkness happens in any place very near the same  corollary   the same branch determines the true difference of meridians in all places over or near which the center of the eclipse passes and so the distance east and west from any known meridian whatsoever thus because the meridians of paris greenwich and dublin do hence appear to be different as to the angles of the pole from the primary meridian in the foregoing angles             and       respectively it is plain that the respective longitude of paris and greenwich when reduced from angles of the pole to the difference of meridians is      and that of greenwich and dublin      and by consequence of paris and dublin      which is no other than the foundation of my grand problem of discovering the geographical longitude of places by solar eclipses from the latitude given of which more hereafter  xv to find the duration of a solar eclipse along or near the path of the moons center in any place whatsoever  from the motion of the moon from the sun gain the duration of the entire eclipse or the time of that centers passage over the diameter of the penumbra if there were no diurnal motion during that time thus  as the horary motion of the moon from the sun which is in angular measure       and is given in the calculation to an hour or  0 in time so let the diameter of the penumbra there given also in angular measure      0 be to a fourth number which will be the number of minutes required in decimals thus     0      0  h 0 but then because the diurnal motion of the earth must be compounded with this rectilinear motion of the moon and that as we have already stated it this eclipse will cross the meridian of greenwich    past   aclock in the evening the one part of the duration of the eclipse being before and the other part after that time both intervals must be unequally affected by the diurnal motion and we must then take the former halfduration       distinctly and since the diurnal motion of greenwich is in a larger parallel than that of the center of the general eclipse while its obliquity to the path of the shadows center increases their respective motions will nearly keep the same proportion all along and so we may safely omit the consideration of them both we have also already discovered that the velocity of this centers motion is here to that of the velocity of the diurnal motion as      to      or as     to   and because the eclipse begins about    before      after   balances the same and these    minutes are almost all one as if there were no diurnal motion at all so that we have only       capable of retardation in the first half the middle time of which will be about  0 after   we must therefore look into the table p        for the arc    o its supplement      corresponding to    of the sines where the difference of half a degree is instead of     as about noon no less than   0 which multiplied by     comes to      so that the motion is here retarded a   th part say then as    to    so is     to     which     or       is to be added to the    before excepted for the duration of the former part of the eclipse        the middle of the second part will be about        backward beyond  0 that is    of the arc which corresponds to    of the sines where the difference of half a degree is      this multiplied by     gives     so that the retardation is as     to     or   to     say then as     to     so is     to            which is the duration of the latter part of the eclipse and added to the former part of the duration gives us the whole duration   0       h      without the consideration of the elevation of the luminaries above the horizon which a small matter enlarges that duration of which hereafter  n b if we would be still more precisely nice we may distinctly allow for the difference of the parallels and the different obliquity of the direction of which p       before which yet are here omitted as very inconsiderable  xvi to find the duration of the total darkness along the path of the moons center if the luminaries were in the horizon  say as the moons motion from the sun in an hour or  0 in the calculation        is to those  0 so is the difference of the diameters of the sun and moon in the same calculation       to a fourth number which will be the entire duration of the total darkness if the luminaries were not at all elevated above the horizon in decimals thus     0           xvii to find the altitude of the sun above the horizon

the axis of the penumbra  when the parallax of the moon is       which is near its mean quantity the moons distance is  0 semidiameters of the earth and one second on the disk of the earth as viewed at the distance of the moon or on the disk of the moon viewed at the distance of the earth is exactly one geographical mile and  0 or one minute is one degree upon the disk of the earth or moon but when the moons parallax as in the calculation of this eclipse is       whose sine is       000000 or      of the radius nearly one second is less than a mile and that in the proportion of     to  0 so that about    geographical miles correspond to  0 or one minute and accordingly      such miles will correspond to       which in that calculation is the semidiameter of the penumbra or the utmost perpendicular extent of the eclipse  n b we may always make use of the foregoing tables page        for the perpendicular distances from the path of the moons center at all durations of the eclipses and of total darkness by still calling the radius of every penumbra  000 equal parts or miles and the radius of every umbra or total shadow  0 such parts or miles and using them accordingly and this without any other inconvenience than the supposition of other than geographical miles which inconvenience by the reduction of them to geographical miles afterward will always as here come to nothing  xx to find the alteration there is in the extent and duration of eclipses and of total darkness on account of the elevation of the luminaries at that time above the horizon  this is ever as the radius to the sine of the suns altitude as compared with the particular distance of the moon at that time thus at the middle of this eclipse at greenwich the altitude of the sun has been found to be    0 whose sine is   0  0000 which divided by     is equal to of the whole and in the semidiameter of the penumbra as well as umbra amounts to about   miles every way thus also at the middle of the eclipse in north america where it is central at noon the sun will be about    above the horizon whose sine is     000 which divided by     is  0 nearly which in the same semidiameters amounts to about    miles every way and for the duration at greenwich add to the common duration already found or to  h       the      part of the same or about of a minute both ways which is about   in the whole which will bring the entire duration from  h      to full  h    and for total darkness will add about   0 of the whole total darkness   0 and increase the duration from      to       but for the alteration in north america which is about    both ways or     in the whole this will there increase the entire duration      and from  h       bring it to  h  0    and for the total darkness will add about    0 of the whole or bring the      to       xxi to find the species and dimensions of the ellipsis made by the total shadow at the same places and altitudes  the shorter axis of the ellipsis which is the same with the diameter of the conick shadow it self in a plane perpendicular to the axis is to the longer as the sines beforementioned or at greenwich as   0  to  0000 and at north america as     to  000 and since that horter axis is in the calculation    minutes or miles of    to a degree they must be equal to  0 geographical miles which by the last problem must be increased to    and to     respectively the golden rule will therefore soon show the length of the longer axis of the shadow in both places  sine rad miles miles for greenwich   0   0000        for north america      000          xxii to determine the central point in the elliptick shadow for greenwich at the middle of the same eclipse  b lemma xix and in its figure as v b to v a so is the sine of b a v            to the sine of a b v   0        and so is b c to a c and componend as               to     so is b c  c a      to c a which therefore is equal to     also as               to     so is b c  c a      to b c which therefore is equal to      for                  and                  whence the parts of the longer axis being found the larger c a      miles the lesser b c      miles the half of which d c is the distance between the central point of the shadow d and the center of the ellipsis c    miles  xxiii to determine the angle of direction of the total shadow over the meridian of greenwich  this to be done either by construction upon drawing the curve line of this motion through the several points where by calculation the center of the shadow crosses the meridians of paris greenwich and dublin and measuring the angle it makes with the several meridians or more exactly for greenwich by solving the triangle fig    p v o where the arc v o is equally distant west as paris is east from greenwich is to be found by the method already made use of thus  paris angle at the pole        angle for o v at the pole is less by twice the difference of the angles at the pole for paris and greenwich       and                    first then find the arc v o  compl latitude for o as in probl xiv by this analogy  r  0 cs q p c                t p v    00    0     t p r                 then say cs p v    00

two sides are       and       find the arc p r as usual thus r  0 cs o v r 0              t v o           0    t v r        0        from       remnt      pr then for the angle upon say s p r 0  0           s v r          0     t o v r 0        0           0   t v p o   0   00          and for v o r s v o          0     s v p o                s up                          s v o p      0                0  half       compl        so that the acute angle v g o which the course of the center of the shadow makes with the meridian of greenwich is       and by consequence the angle it makes with the parallel of latitude there is         or   degrees moe than in dr halleys scheme  corollary the longer axis of the total shadow at the meridian of greenwich makes an angle of       with the direction of the shadow  for if from the angle that the directin of the center of the shadow makes with the parallel of greenwich       we deduct the angle that the longer axis makes with the same parallel which is the azimuth formerly discovered  0    there remains this angle        xxiv to d termine the perpendicular breadth of the total shadow when that shadow is nearest to london or when the central point is about the meridian of padsto in cornwall  this problem is in an ellipsis of    miles broad and     miles long whose longer axis makes an angle with the direction of the shadow of       to determine the length of the greatest perpendicular that falls on that diameter along which the direction of the motion is for twice that perpendicular is the breadth required now i have actually drawn this ellipsis or total shadow for my map of this eclipse and i find by that construction that the breadth of the total shadow over england is about     miles or  0 miles broader than in dr halleys scheme time will probably discover which is nearest the truth  n b this total shadow increases so greatly in length as it goes eastward that it will reach from paris to the utmost boundary of the sunsetting at once and though the center of the shadow by my calculation will end   east of the meridian of london in the latitude of      or in the alps not far from milan and turi yet by reason of the extension and breadth of the total shadow and the refraction of the rays of light near the horizon it seems probable to me that all switzerland and lombardy as far as trent mantua cremona and parma nay perhaps as far as venice padua bononia ferrara ravenna and florence may at the same time be invelopd in the total shadow and that the sun may set eclipsed at all or most of those places at once  xxv to determine the digits eclipsed and the duration of the eclipse or of total darkness at any given distance from the path of the moons center and vice versa these digits and durations if we do not consider the diurnal motion are immediately found to any given distance in the tables p        thus if the digits be   or duration  0    the first table gives us the distance of    0 miles and vice versa if the distance be known to be    0 miles the same table gives us   digits and  0    duration and the like is true of the total shadow and the distance or duration in the second table thus also we learn from the map of this eclipse that the nearest approach of the total shadow to london will be about  0 geographical miles which  0 miles in this obliquity of the motion is about    perpendicular miles so that           of a digit is the quantity of the rim of light that will be seen at london when the eclipse is greatest and by consequence the digits there eclipsed will be       0 nor does it appear to me that the total darkness will come nearer to london than  0 miles although dr halleys scheme brings it within   or   miles as for the duration of the entire eclipse here it will be much the same as if it were central and has been already determined to  h    and for the total darkness along the path of the center between exeter and plymouth its duration will be as before stated      n b as to the alterations which will arise in more considerable distances from the path of the moons center proceed thus first find the minutes of duration corresponding to any given distance in miles e g    0 thus  000    0        0  or as  000 miles the radius to    0 the sine so are the number of minutes for the semidiameter of the penumbra to the number of minutes for that sine now       the present length of the greatest distance     0    0    then compute every thing as if the center of the shadow were  0    latitude or nearest distance and as if the chord of that arc over the earths disk were the path of the moons center and the chord of the distance from the center of the penumbra were the diameter of the penumbra and all will be discovered by the rules before going without any new directions whatsoever only if this distance be the contrary way to the present example we must here make use of addition instead of substraction  n b upon confulting the french ephemerides of des places recommended in some degree by cassini himself i find that he determines the eclipse at paris thus  h beginning may    n s 0  0  00 middle 0        end 0     00 whence the duration there is 0     00 digits eclipssd  0    0 latitude of the moon at the middle    difference from me in digits 0     in latitude 0   0  if these digits and this latitude be right dr halley and i and those english astronomers that have computed and constructed this elipse who all i think do agree that it will be to at paris and that for two or three miuutes also are prodigiously mistaken for if des places be in the right copenhagen and stockholm will stand much fairer for the pretense to a total eclipse than either dublin london or paris time will certainly determine who are in the right  n b if we add the duration of the eclipse considered without regard to the diurnal motion to the time of the center of the shadows passing over the entire disk we gain the entire duration of the eclipse in general thus h to    0    add         sum         therefore the general eclipse by the meridian of london h begins ii       middle v    00 end vii       duration  h       eclipse at london begins v    00 middle vi    00 end vii    00 duration  h    00 digits eclipsed       0 duration of total darknes between exeter and plymouth 0     n b dr halleys times are still about   sooner than mine and his general duration about   and his duration at london about   longer  n b i cannot tell the reason why my original calculation of this general eclipse which has been carefully made according to sir isaac newtons famous theory of the moon does here so much differ from dr halleys determination as   in time especially since both those methods did very well agree in the last celebrated total eclipse apr         it is time alone that can determine between these two methods of calculation  n b i have lately been showed an exact scheme of this next eclipse according to mr flamsteeds own tables and determination and made in his lifetime wherein the digits eclipsed are       0 exactly according to my determination in this paper  a proposal for the discovery of the longitude of the several places of the earth by total eclipses of the sun it is humbly proposed that observations be made in all places where solar eclipses are seen of the exact duration of the same by either viewing the beginning and ending thereof through a telescope with a glass smoaked in the flame of a candle for saving the eye of the observer or else by casting the suns image through such a telescope upon white paper and viewing the first and last impression of the moons shadow upon it and that the hour minute and second of some pendulum clock be carefully noted at the same time and that when the same observations are transmitted for the uses of geography the latitudes of the places be also set down and transmitted at the same time that the like observations be also made in all places where such eclipses are total and visible of the exact beginning and ending with the duration of total darkness by the like comparison of a pendulum clock or other pendulous body that vibrates seconds or half seconds and with the latitude be transmitted in the same manner and for the same uses how by the help of these   a table of the latitude of the center of the total shadow at the eclipse may

of observations lately made with dippingneedles in order to discover the longitude and latitude at sea upon the receipt of the liberal assistance of his most excellent majesty king george their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales and many other of the nobility and gentry my kind friends i sent last year four several dippingneedles to sea with frames hung near the center of motion in gimbols to avoid the shaking of the ship and with proper instructions to the masters of the vessels and this in order to discover the state of magnetism in the several parts of the globe and to find whether accurate observations could be made at sea and to determine whether the fundamental theory i laid down from former observations would hold or not viz that magnetic variation and dip are all derived from one spherical magnet in the center of our earth with an irregular alteration of the variation according to the different degrees of strength of the several parts of the loadstone as compounded with a very slow revolution from east to west and with a regular alteration of the dip nearly according to the line of sines from the magnetic pole to the magnetic equator the axis of that equator being sufficiently oblique to its plane all which is the case of spherical loadstones here now having already received four journals from four several masters employed i take this occasion of returning my benefactors hearty thanks for their assistance and of giving them and the public some account of the success of these observations and what consequences are naturally to be drawn from them with the difficulty hitherto met with in the practice at sea and the proper remedy for the same in future trials  captain james jolly set out in july      for archangel with one of my dippingneedles on board he for some time met with such difficulties in the practice as confined to the frame i had given him that he was not at first able to make any good observations at all but after some time he took the needle into his own cabin and without any approach to the center of motion or any contrivance for avoiding the shaking of the ship at all having a clear and full gale all along but without any stormy weather he made me    very good horizontal observations from the latitude of    quite to archangel i say horizontal observations only as i desired him the needle by an accident before he went being rendered incapable of making any other with sufficient accuracy in this space the needle altered its velocity very greatly as i expected it would and   vibrations which at first were performed in about   0 beyond the northcape came to   0 till toward archangel it gradually returned to about      captain othniel beal set out about the same time for boston in new england with the same instrument and made four observations of the dip both by the vertical and horizontal vibrations and by the dip it self three upon the open sea and one in the haven of boston which in some small manner differed one from another but in the main agreed and kept the due analogy i expected he greatly complained of the shaking of the ship till in boston haven he made a nice observation both ways which did not greatly differ though the greatest part of of his observations by the dip it self were somewhat more agreeable to analogy than the other the reason was i take it that as he assured me he always took great care to avoid the shaking of my frame which frame though it very much avoided the slower and greater oscillation of the ship yet made a quicker but lesser oscillation it self which fault i was sufficiently sensible of just before the ships were going away but was not able then to obviate as i am prepared to do hereafter after captain beal had made and sent me these observations he pursued his voyage to barbados and thence to charles town in south carolina at both which places he made observations but the best at barbados for before he came to carolina he observed the axis of the needle to shake which made him take the dip there otherwise than he ought to have done which is the natural occasion that the dip there did not so well agree to analogy as the rest however upon my receipt of his first journal with the four first observations especially the exact one at boston i formed a more exact theory of the proportion of the alteration of the dip in the spherical magnet of the earth and found it at this distance of the earths surface not far from that in my spherical loadstone at the distance of about   0 of an inch from its surface viz not exactly as the line of sines where at the middle of the line the angles are  0 and  0 but rather as    to    which rule therefore is what i now propose as much nearer than the other by which proportion i determined long beforehand the dip at barbados of    or    as many of my friends can witness and when captain beal delivered me the paper of this observation at barbados before i opened it or in the least knew what dip it contained i foretold to him from that theory the very same dip which both himself and his paper immediately assured me to be true and whose truth as he informed me afterward was confirmed by another observation made a little before in the open sea of about     captain tempest also about the same time set out for antegoa and st christophers with the same instrument and frame in his letter daed last january he greatly complains of the shaking of my frame and proposes an hint how it might be avoided which method of its avoidance i had long before thought of and provided for accordingly and which has been a full year ready for practice those observations of his that i have yet received for i have not heard from him since january but hope soon to here farther were but three and all at open sea and but one of them made both the ways that i desired and indeed seem the least agreeable to analogy of any of the rest only since that single observation which was also made by the horizontal vibrations and vertical oscillations agrees very well to that analogy since they all three are about the same quantity of   or   degrees exceed that analogy and since very near the same place where the third observation was made i have a double observation of captain beals to correct the same i rather conclude that captain tempest made a mistake and placed the wrong edge of the needle upward in all the three observations which would naturally occasion such a difference when i receive the rest of his observations or his needle again i shall be able to judge better of that matter however even these observations agree in gross with all the rest to the gradual decrease of the dip as you go nearer to the equator though as they stand at present they do not determine the accurate proportion of that alteration so well as the others  captain michel also long after the rest set out for hamburgh with the same instrument though now without the frame which he was not willing to incumber himself with and i suspected that in its present contrivance it did more hurt than help the nicety of the experiments i also by him sent a letter to the reverend mr eberhard who was the occasion of my studying this matter and was then pastor of altena close by hamburgh desiring that he would there make the experiment very exactly and give me a particular account of it but i have not yet received his answer  now the observations here mentioned as well as those many others i had by me before do seem to me in general evidently to afford us the following inferences    that there is one spherical loadstone and but one in the center of our earth and that this loadstone like other spherical loadstones has but one northern pole contrary to dr halleys hypothesis    that this northern pole is situated contrary to the same hypothesis also a great way to the east of our meridian and indeed as i before had determined about the middle of the distance between the north cape and nova zembla captain jollys numerous observations prove this most fully while in sailing toward that point his horizontal vibrations greatly increased in number and when he turned almost at right angles as he went down to archangel they soon diminished and yet so little after some time that it was evident he then sailed not far from a parallel to that northern pole and not very many degrees from it neither exactly according to my expectations    that the absolute power of the internal magnet is considerably different in different places and that without any certain rule as it is upon the surface of our terrellae or spherical loadstones here this the various number of seconds to a vertical oscillations and all the accounts in the other observations fully prove and by consequence this must cause different variations in different places as is the case of our terrellae    that there no where appears in open seas any such irregularity in the dip as we sometimes meet with near shores or at land and by consequence that dr halleys grand objection against the discovery of the longitude by the dippingneedle taken from an observation of his own concerning such an irregularity near the shore at cape verd and from his own hypothesis of the four magnetic poles is utterly groundless nor indeed shall i e at rest tilli have sent a dippingneedle to hudsons bay on purpose to determine this dispute about the four poles for that voyage being almost directly toward his second northern pole all the way and about the same distance all the way from mine if this voyage afford much the same dip it will demonstrate that there is but one northern pole and that it is nearl where i place it but if that dip greatly increase it will demonstrate a sond pole somewhere in those parts of america where dr halley places it and to this decretory experiment do i appeal for a final determination of this question the doctor seems to me to draw his inferences from the variation which no way proves any such double poles as being full as sensible on our terrelle which have no more than single ones while he avoids all observations from the dip which are still against him and which are alone capable of discovering the exact place of such poles either upon the surface of the earth or of terrellae however when one set of experiments with a dippingneedle sent to hudsons bay will certainly determine this matter it is a vain thing to go on in the way of controversy about it  in short the observations hitherto made show that the foundations i go upon in this discovery of the longitude and the latitude at sea are true and right that the terrestrial magnetism is very regular and uniform in the open seas that the latitude in the northern parts may even without any avoidance of the shaking of the ship in ordinary calm weather be in good degree thereby discovered already and that if i can sufficiently avoid the shaking of the ship which i am now endeavoring and have great hopes of performing both latitude and longitude may by this method be discovered in the greatest part of the sailing world i say nothing here of another method of trial which i am also pursuing and which depends like this on the avoiding the main part of the ships agitation and if effected will be more easy and universal than this but as to giving any farther account of that to the public unless it succeed i have no intention at all  n b the original journals are all in the hands of my great friend and patron samuel molyneux esquire secretary to his royal highness the prince of wales and fellow of the royal society which journals when i have completed the rest of the observations i hope to procure i intend to publish entire for the more full satisfaction of the

                    00       0  n b i take the northern pole of the terrestrial magnet to be about the meridian of archangel in the latitude of    its equator to be nearly a great circle intersecting the earths equator about   degrees eastward of the meridian of london and in its opposite point and that its utmost latitude northward is in the gulf of bengall about    degrees and as much south in the opposite point in the great south sea and that the souther pole is nearly circular its radius  0 degrees of a great circle and its center in a meridian eastward from ceilon about   degrees and about    latitude  n b london is nearly          0 distance from the north pole of the magnet whence its dip will be at     which is certainly so in fact boston in new england is       whence its dip will be about       which captain beal found to be so in fact barbados is about         0  distant from the equator of the magnet whence its dip ought to be about    as captain beal also found it to be in fact st helenais about         whence its dip ought to be about     0 as dr halley found it to be in fact and so every where in the main ocean at considerable distances from the shores  n b if the dip of any needles be somewhat different at london add or substract a proportionable part of the dip elsewhere and you will have nearly the true dip at any other place with that needle thus if your needle differ from the other   or   0 and show the dip at london       instead of       which is itsproper dip in this table and you require the true dip by this needle for boston in new england southward which in the table is       proceed thus because the equal distance of boston from the magnetic equator is    parts of  0  the like distance of london from that equator deduct   0    0           out of the tabular dip       the remainder is       for the true dip at boston with that needle thus if you want the true dip by the same needle at dronthem in norway northward because the equal distance of dronthem from the magnetic pole is     parts of     the distance of london from that pole deduct                     out of the tabular dip     0 and the remainder       is the true dip at dronthem with that needle and so in all other cases whatsoever  n b the table before set down supposes that the true dip differs according to such a line of sines whose middle point gives    on one side and    on the other and is made by adding or substracting   to the complement of the dip found by the natural sines for every  0 of equal distances from the equator or pole  n b if any desire to calculate by trigonometry the distances of all places from the magnetic equator of poles and the distances of that equator and those poles in every particular case both made use of in the foregoing calculations it is thus to be done  in the fig    triangle b l a we have b l the colatitude of london b a the colatitude of the magnetic north pole and the included angle a b l  the distance of the meridian of that pole from the meridian of london to find the angle q a m and the side a l then in the triangle q a m we have the angles q a m and q m a and the side a m  the distance of the magnetic pole from the magnetic equator to find a q so we have the proportion of a l to aq q e i  but since the data are not yet sufficiently exact for the calculation measuring is sufficient  finis to fold
