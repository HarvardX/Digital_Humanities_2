mr wards practice of physic as it relates to the public impartially considered  in a letter to thomas carew esquire member of parliament  quod si quam audax est ad conandum tam esset obscurus in agendo fortasse aliqua in re nos aliquando fefellisset verum hoc percommode cedit quod cum incredibili ejus audacia singularis stultitia conjuncta est cic in ver london printed for j roberts at the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxli  price   d  mr wards practice of physic impartially considered sir minehead dec       0 the truly generous noble and indefatigable spirit you have exerted on the behalf of the commonwealth during your sitting in parliament has drawn upon you the trouble of this application you have shown not only inclination but ability to do real service to your country by promoting and carrying on several bills which will greatly contribute to the public good and transmit your name with honor to posterity you are a true patriot in the purest sense of the word and as such i dont doubt but you will think the following pages highly worthy of your serious consideration and if you find any hint in them fair reasonable and calculated for the interest of your fellow subjects you will gladly improve it and readily concur in building upon it such an wholesome law as may redress the grievance complained of i think it will be easily granted that the health of the body is full as valuable as the property of estates how difficult would it be for any person to believe that our legislature is of that opinion who should observe that there are so many good laws enacted by every parliament for the defense of the one and scarce ever any care taken of the preservation of the other indeed within a long series of years the parliament has been most graciously pleased to cast an eye toward the health of the people by an act impowering physicians to inspect apothecaries shops by an act for preventing the retailing spirituous liquors and by an act for the encouragement of the publication of mrs stephenss remedies however these instances few as they are prove that the honorable house does not think the health of the nation entirely below their care and consideration and therefore we ought to suppose that the reason why acts of parliament for the like good purposes are not more frequent is that the house is not applied to on such subjects in a proper manner that the grievances the people labor under are not fairly and plainly laid before the members or practical methods of redress are not pointed out  the health of a people can only be preserved by all the wholesome laws the wisdom of a legislature can contrive to prevent luxury debauchery and every kind of immorality which infallibly produce diseases or by frequent inspections into the state of physic in their country because abuses will daily creep into every society or set of men who find themselves under no restraint from any apprehensions of being called to an account for their method of treating mankind in their most momentous concernments though the first part of this general plan is highly worth your consideration yet i shall beg leave to say a few words to you in regard to the latter only  the reformation of the state of physic in general is greatly wanting in this nation and i believe most warmly wished by every honest man even of the faculty itself but though general reformations may be as difficult as they are desirable yet some crying enormities may themselves point out the method of their own redress  if we consider the public humor of the good people of england for these last twenty years one should be apt to conclude that certain odd conjunctions of the heavenly bodies brought on epidemical follies as well as diseases how have shakespeare johnson otway and all the plays capable of delighting the mind instructing the head or mending the heart been totally neglected or coldly received while dear harlequin charming devil has filled all our affections triumphed over our judgments and emptied our pockets during an era like this when such crowded audiences composed of the great vulgar and the small gave such plain demonstrations of their polite taste and profound wisdom is it to be wondered that there should appear from the malign influences of the same stars marks of an epidemical madness in other parts of the town as well as in the theater no dr faustus will have the honor to be handed down to posterity as the illustrious contemporary of a mapp a tailor and a ward the historian of our days will be able to inform his readers that the infatuation was so general that friend mead and pellet were as much eclipsed by this bright constellation as shakespeare then was by a more happy genius a gentleman who with surprising activity could turn himself into all shapes and appear to be any animal but what he really was such are the irresistible charms of delusion such the happiness of being deceived that all our applauses rise in proportion to the artfulness of the imposition and the difficulty of discovering the cheat  let mrs mapps bones rest in peace though she tortured so many in the days of her fame  let the dexterous dr tailor be able to purge the visual ray of our neighbor nations that they may see their true interest to consist in treating great britain with honor and respect  mr ward is the only medicinal meteor which yet continues to shine amongst us whose fame has raised him to the highest degree of esteem and admiration with the gay and the polite on whose authority and judgment thousands and tens of thousands of the lower part of mankind swallow his medicines with implicit faith and are said thereby to receive most wonderful cures in almost incurable distempers the influence of this gentlemans reputation being now become so very extensive his manner of practicing physic cannot be thought a subject unworthy the notice and consideration of the legislature i am sure sir you will afford it your attention for a few minutes as it is of importance to the service of the public to which i well know how much every moment of your time is dedicated  i shall by no means take upon me to determine whether the numberless deaths laid to this gentlemans charge by his opposers or the unparalled cures he is said to have performed by his admirers come nearest the truth what he owns himself and what all his friends allow may i hope be taken for granted he confesses with great candor that he is wholly ignorant of the history and nature of diseases that he understands nothing of anatomy or the animal economy and that he only pretends to some knowledge in chemistry by which art he has discovered a few medicines of greater efficacy in particular cases than those in common use among regular physicians suppose then that what this gentleman asserts is true and that he has such powerful chemical secrets in his possession must they not be capable of doing as much harm when ignorantly and promiscuously administered as they would be of doing good in the hands of a person duly qualified to know in what cases how and when properly to apply them will that noble christian charity which from this gentlemans known moral character cannot but be believed to be the sole motive of his great bounty to the crowds of poor people who daily attend him make amends for his dealing out these powerful medicines so indiscriminately to all who shall pay him the compliment of being willing to swallow them do the multitude of patients whom he never saw before or will see afterward want no attendance during the violent operation of their physic no person acquainted with the nature of their medicines to relieve or correct any accidents which so often attend the most common and gentle remedies surely it must appear to every unprejudiced person that the most useful drugs under such management must be a sore evil and therefore that nothing can be more uncharitable than thus to deceive and hurt a multitude under the specious pretense of charity but however faulty this gentlemans method of practice may be yet his medicines may in themselves and under proper direction be extremely valuable let us grant that they are so is it not then incumbent on those who have the good of the people at heart to endeavor to render these valuable secrets a public benefit which under their present circumstances are so great a calamity every man ought to be rewarded for his discovery of any thing that may be beneficial to society mr ward should not be desired to part with his property and his nostrums are undoubtedly such without a reasonable equivalent the parliament of great britain is able to grant him this equivalent and they have a right to demand the knowledge of his secrets on just and equitable terms an englishman who possesses a piece of ground which interrupts the making a river navigable is obliged to part with his property for the good of the community surely mr wards property in his secrets is not more inviolable than what every man has in his own land and therefore it cannot be looked upon as any hardship if he should be forced to part with them on like conditions should such a demand be made upon him by parliament should the reward appointed be obainable only by the proof before competent judges of his medicines when divulged performing the same cures on fair subjects which they are now said to do on his private patients and should he refuse to stand that only test what could be concluded from such a refusal but that he did not believe in his own conscience that they would perform what he and his friends do now persuade the world to believe that they will do would not such a refusal be a just and equitable ground for the parliament to forbid his farther dealing out these medicines of which they would have reason to believe that he had himself no opinion and by a wholesome law to prevent hi majestys subjects from being any longer cheated of their money if no robbed of their lives but as thi gentlemans great cures are so wel attested by many persons of fashion whose knowledge in such matters cannot be disputed i have no reason to fear that he would at all suspect the efficacy of his medicines in all the desperate cases which he now so confidently undertakes he will therefore undoubtedly submit them to an impartial trial with the greatest cheerfulness especially as he will over and above the reward appointed by parliament be sure of gratifying his most charitable disposition in the satisfaction of knowing that whereas before only some thousands of his countrymen enjoyed the fruits of his labors then he will become a general good to mankind the honorable gentlemen who now talk of his medicines as divine and of his cures as little less than miraculous will all most heartily join in promoting this publication they will congratulate their country on the inestimable possession of these secrets which but for the care of our legislature might have slept in the single breast of their author and have been buried with him in oblivion to the irreparable loss of all future ages  as the number of inhabitants is the riches of a nation while so many brave men are losing their lives abroad in the service of their country let us not suffer those who remain at home to be daily thinned either by the improper application of mr wards medicines under his present administration of them or for want of their being made more universally useful by a speedy publication  the gin act is a glorious instance of the tender care of our parliament for the lives and healths of our people to whom that pernicious liquor was promiscuously and sometimes charitably retailed by such who preferred their own wicked gains to the welfare of all human creatures  mrs stephenss act is a plain proof of the true sense your honorable house has of the great benefit of making any useful discoveries in physic and it is likewise a proper precedent of the manner in which such publications should be made and of he tests and trials such discovered medicines must undergo in order to ntitle their authors to their due reward what may be a reasonable sasfaction for mr wards doing this signal service to his country i cannot guess at if his medicines will perform the cures openly and fairly which are now attributed to them i think the parliament cannot pay too much for the knowledge of them or mr ward receive too great honors from a grateful people but should this gentleman be so blind to his own interest as to refuse to become this public blessing on any terms can he expect to enjoy the warm affections of hi countrymen to whom he will appea so charitable and so hardhearted a the same time should he refuse t comply with the generous desire  the parliament could he complain  they should exert their just authorit if he refuses to save millions he cannot surely think himself illtreated  the guardians of the public if  should be forbid to destroy even his thousands  but to you sir i humbly submit the consideration of this important point i call it important and what concerns the lives of so many of the innocent and the ignorant deserves to be so called i speak as a friend to mr ward as well as to my country i propose a method by which instead of being the idol of a few he shall become the darling of a whole people by which he shall remove that huge load of scandal which now lies upon him to the great chagrin of his enemies who shall pine with envy at the brightness of his glory the black list of his private murders which is now maliciously handed about by physicians and their emissaries shall whiten into a pompous register of public cures performed by his medicines on the miserable objects who had been delivered over to the iron jaws of death by the ignorance or indolence of those doctors falsely so called who have had no opportunity of understanding physic but their having been bred to the profession by this means this worthy gentleman shall be freed from that labor and toil with which he now serves his country in his private capacity he shall do even more good and yet as is most meet and fit he shall be able to retire from the world full of days and honors he shall spend the few last years he has to come in dignity and ease enjoying the calm evening of a wellspent life conversing with nature in the most endearing intimacy to which he has arrived by torturing her ten thousand ways till he made her confess those very secrets which he has now communicated for the public good and which shall draw down blessings on him and his posterity through all future ages  i beg therefore sir for my sake as your fellowcitizen for mr wards sake who can do us all so much service and for your countrys sake whose interest you have so sincerely and warmly at heart that you will think seriously on this matter what you see to be right i know you will vigorously pursue and to your good conduct the whole is submitted by sir  your most obedient humble servant philanthropos
