tempestuous sea  ariel comes upon the stage air arise arise ye subterranean winds arise ye deadly blighting fiends rise you from whom devouring plagues have birth you that in the vast and hollow womb of earth engender earthquakes make whole countries shake ye eager winds whose rapid force can make all but the fixed and solid center shake come drive you ship to that part of the isle where nature never yet did smile   myself will fly on board and on the beak in the waste the deck in every cabin i will flame amazement sometimes i will divide and burn in many places on the topmast the yards and bowsprit will i flame distinctly then meet and join joves lightnings the precursors of dreadful thunderclaps more momentary and sight outrunning are the the fire and cracks of sulfurous roaring the most mighty neptune shall seem to siege make his bold waves tremble yea his dread trident shake exit repeated flashes of lightning and claps of thunder scene ii a part of the island near prospero s

confederates with the king of naples my inveterate foe who for homage and certain tribute agrees to extirpate me from my dukedom and to confer fair milan on my brother this settled and an army levied one night fated to the purpose did anthonio open the gates of milan and in the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self in fine they forced us out to sea in a rotten unriggd boat where they left us to the mercy of the winds air in pity neptune smooths the liquid way obsequious tritons on the surface play and sportful dolphins with a nimble glance to the
