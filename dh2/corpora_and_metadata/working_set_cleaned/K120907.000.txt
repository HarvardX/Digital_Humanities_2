the banby apes or the monkeys chattering to the magpye  in a letter to a friend in london  the sixth edition corrected    london printed and are to be sold by r mawson at the bible and star over against st magnus church near london bridge price   d  enterd into the hallbook pursuant to act of parliament    the banby apes or the monkeys chattering to the magpye in a letter to a friend in london bany june   dear friend this day a messenger on a highflying sorrel horse came post from dr sl and rode as if the devil drove him to signify to our myr that he designed to visit us upon which the wild frantic fiery zealous magistrate summoned his brethren the aldmen to meet at the common hall but before they were all assembled another messenger brought advice that the champion was just at hand so that mr myr and those with him went to the towns end clad in old fashioned formalities to meet him they found him very well guarded by a vast rabble and mob crying with loud acclamations nonresistance nonresistance mr myr etc headed by one that records congratulated him upon his deliverance etc and then the public entry was ordered as follows  first came the bellman and sexton of the town with staves in their hands  then two pursivants bearing pendants with the drs crest pope clement the xis head and his motto in these words unlimited passive obedience  then a herald carrying his coat armor being a field sable charged with three cardinals caps each with a golden band  then followed two old women one having a bundle of addresses on her back and a paper on her breast with this inscription we defy all antimonarchial antiepiscopal and almost all atheistical and popish principles the other was covered all over with pamphlets of diverse sorts before her was the elegy on highchurch passive obedience and the champion pleading his own cause but on her bum the effigies of ben hy with his head downward  then the sergeant of the town with a mace on his shoulder  then came mr myr with a book in his hand upside down according to custom entitled the perils of false brethren both in church and state  then the aldmen two by two having the collections in their hands  here followed a young damsel who had a promise from the highch faction to have any thing she requested whereupon she desired the head of benj h which she brought in a charger  then   men with red hats having beads in their hands with this inscription on their foreheads nunc aut nunquam  then an old man with a long beard clothed in pure white raiment having the drs effigies in metzotinto in one hand and in the other a trinklet resembling a crufix  then followed the old women with green branches in their hands  then a woman preciously decked sitting  as near as i could guess upon a scarletcolourd beast having abundance of names written in capital letters mystery etc  then came the highchch idol  in garments as black as his deeds on a sorrel horse  after him    tinkers beating on their kettles that the spectators might know what latitude they were in  then a vast mob hollowing hooping and playing the devil  in this order he was conducted to his inn where he was again congratulated and presented with wine in fine the evening concluded with ringing of bells bonfires drunkenness and all manner of lewdness  the champion left this town next morning and set out for wck where he was again met and congratulated by the monkeys in their formalities they entreated him to tarry some time with them but he declined it and pursued his journey to the next corporation for you must know he expects the same honors to be paid him wherever he goes which how strange soever it may seem to some is no new thing for he is not the first that has been waited on by a corporation in their robes for in the reign of q eliz a fellow who wore his hat buttoned up on one side and a feather therein like a toothdrawer with a rose and crown on his breast for a badge got a license to make a show of a great ape about the country and coming to a certain town whether banbury or not i cannot tell they beat a drum about to give notice that there was a very witty ape to be seen but the townspeople being poor thought it not worth their while to see this sight upon which the fellow was enraged and was resolved to put a trick upon them and thereupon sends the following warrant to the worshipful the mayor  these are to require you and every one of you with your wives and families upon sight hereof to make your personal appearance before the queens ape who is a person of rank and quality and of vast parts he having been bred at an university and is to visit most parts of the kingdom that by his conversation with the queens subjects he may be the better enabled to discover their fidelity and loyalty hereof fail not at your peril  when mr mayor had opened the warrant he who always did what he pleased holds it topsie turvy and after some thoughts thereon sends his maid to the further end of the town for a shoemaker to come and read it when he heard the contents he summoned his brethren the aldermen to the town hall to consult of this weighty affair where they sat looking on one another for some time not knowing what to say at length the youngest alderman standing up said gentlemen if i may speak without offense i will give you my opinion in this matter  speak on says mr mayor for though you are but a young officer you may speak as much sense as any of us  well then says he my humble opinion is that this apefellow is a saucy knave and only designs to make our town ridiculous for was it ever known that a warrant should be sent without either name or date to a mayor of a town who is the queens lieutenant and that he and his brethren their wives and children should be commanded to appear before a jackanapes my council is therefore that you take him and his ape and whip the whole tribe out of town which will be much to your credit and reputation the words were scarce spoke ere a grave alderman replied hold friend you have spoke little less than treason remember it is the queens ape  true brother quoth the mayor therefore it behooves us to take care what we say in this troublesome business  marry says another grave senior we may see by the feather in his cap and the badge he wears that he is the queens man and who knows what an injury he may do us poor men in the country for contemning the warrant therefore let us ene go and see the ape it is but   d apiece and no doubt but the queen will tak it well when she hears we have shown so much reverence to her ape  upon this speech the assembly resolved to pay the ape a visit and ordered the town clerk to acquaint the queens man therewith  next day the mayor and aldermen in their robes  the sergeant carrying the mace before them their recorder being at the head of them with whole droves of townsmen and their wives etc attended the ape at his inn where they found him sitting on a table mr mayor presented him with wine  off his hat and made a leg but page did not mind him next came mrs mayoress in a  apron and made pug a fine low courtisie upon which he put out his  and made a mouth  i  quoth she i think in my conscience the queens ape mocks me  sirrah says the mayor i see thy sawciness and i will make thee to know that the woman whom thou mockest is my wife an ancient woman and a midwife and one who is old enough to be thy mother and thereupon going to his tutor sir said he do you allow your ape to abuse my wife  no quoth he  truly says the mayor there is sufficient witness that saw him make mops and mows at her  the tutor thereupon gave poor pug half a dozen smart lashes with his whip which made his teeth chatter upon which mr mayor cried out enough enough good sir you have done like a gentleman i desire you never to give correction any more in your wrath and when the play is done be pleased to come along with your ape to our town hall both of you to take a small supper with me and the rest of my brethren the aldermen  but to return to our champion after he had visited several corporations and given audience to the mob who were wonderfully taken with this new rareeshow he dispatches a trumpeter to covry to give notice of his coming  the bells immediately rung for joy  but that availed him nothing for the monkeys did not appear in their robes which was a great mortification to him and those of his faction however he was met by  0 or    stiff sons of levi on sorrel nags attended by a few butchers and barbers who made a purse and bought two hogsheads of ale which were set in the public street where the rabble got shamefully drunk in toasting a health to their beloved idol  finis
