general view of the agriculture of the west riding of yorkshire  general view of the agriculture of the west riding of yorkshire with observations on the means of its improvement  by messrs rennie broun and shirreff  drawn up for the consideration of the board of agriculture and internal improvement  london printed by w bulmer and co mdccxciv  advertisement the following valuable communication respecting the present state of husbandry in the west riding of yorkshire and the means of its improvement drawn up for the consideration of the board of agriculture is now printed merely for the purpose of its being circulated there in order that every person interested in the welfare of that county may have it in his power to examine it fully before it is published it is therefore requested that any remark or additional observation which may occur to the reader on the perusal of the following sheets may be written on the margin and transmitted to the board of agriculture at its office in london by whom the same shall be properly attended to and when the returns are completed an account will be drawn up of the state of agriculture in the west riding from the information thus accumulated which it is believed will be found greatly superior to any thing of the kind ever yet made public  the board has adopted the same plan in regard to all the other counties in the united kingdom and it is hardly necessary to add will be happy to give every assistance in its power to any person who may be desirous of improving his breed of cattle sheep etc or of trying any useful experiment in husbandry  to the reader it is requested that this paper may be returned to the board of agriculture as soon as may be convenient  it is hardly necessary to add that the board does not consider itself responsible for any fact or observation contained in these reports which at present are printed and circulated for the purpose merely of procuring additional information and of enabling every one to contribute his mite to the improvement of his country  february      to sir john sinclair bart president of the board of agriculture sir in compliance with your request we have surveyed the west riding of yorkshire and from the annexed report we trust the board will receive satisfactory information respecting the stock and husbandry of that important district  during our survey we used every means in our power to obtain accurate information of the different systems under which the practice of husbandry was carried on and made particular inquiries into the mode by which estates are managed as well as the nature of the connection that subsisted between landlord and tenant it is possible that from the extent of the west riding and the comparative shortness of time we could conveniently devote to this business that some parts of the country and some practices prevailing in it may have escaped our attention these circumstances will we hope be duly considered by those who peruse this report any mistakes we may have inadvertently committed we trust to the candor of the proprietors and farmers to excuse and to rectify  it gives us pleasure to acquaint you that in the course of our survey we experienced every possible politeness and attention all ranks in a manner vying with each other to promote the public undertaking entrusted to us agreeable to your desire a return is herewith made of those persons who gave us assistance and information  as very little has been written upon the general state of this disstrict and still less upon its agriculture these circumstances rendered drawing up the report more difficult than it would otherwise have been mr young in his northern tour made several excursions in the west riding but the time since elapsed makes his work however valuable in other respects of little use upon the present occasion mr marshalls treatise upon the yorkshire husbandry is almost wholly confined to the east riding no other agricultural writings relative to the district have come to our knowledge but it is proper to acknowledge that some information about the geographical and natural history of the riding is drawn from a publication called magna britannia as well as from the histories of knaresborough and halifax we are also indebted to several respectable individuals for a variety of local information which we gratefully acknowledge  as no interested motives can influence us upon this occasion so we hope the causes we have stated as obstacles to improvements and the remedies we have suggested for removing them will be impartially considered by the inhabitants of the district and if this report in any shape contributes to promote their prosperity and happiness we will account the time spent in making the survey most beneficially employed  we are with great respect sir your most obedient humble servants george rennie robert broun john shirreff  haddington east lothian january         map of west riding yorkshire sketch of the rout taken by messs rennie broun and shirriff in their agricultural survey of the west riding of yorkshire   introduction the west riding of yorkshire is situated nearly in the center of the kingdom and although an inland district yet from its numerous rivers and canals it possesses all the advantages of a maritime province it is    miles in length    in breadth and   0 in circumference contains    0 square miles or     000 statute acres and about  00000 inhabitants  the west riding is bounded on the east by the river ouse on the north by the north riding on the west by parts of westmoreland lancashire and cheshire and on the south by the counties of nottingham and derby it is divided into nine wapentakes or hundreds and contains    market towns the chief of which are leeds sheffield wakefield halifax doncaster and rotheram besides a very great number of populous villages  the face of the country is in many parts strongly irregular in the western and northern divisions of the district a considerable portion is hilly and mountainous but in these situations it is intersected with numerous vales carrying grass of the richest quality the remainder is chiefly a flat with no more risings than serve to variegate the prospect the whole district is almost completely enclosed with stone dikes and hedges which are kept in the most perfect condition and there are few open fields except where the ground is common or waste  the nature and quality of the soil in this extensive district differs materially there are all sorts from the deep strong clay and rich fertile loam to the meanest peat earth it is impossible to say without an actual mensuration which particular kind most prevails vicinity to great towns and superior culture have no doubt rendered a considerable part that was originally barren fertile and productive in general it may be said that a large moiety is of a quality naturally favorable to the purposes of husbandry and under a proper system of management will amply repay the farmer for his trouble and expense  the climate is in general moderate in the eastern parts of the riding it is not esteemed so healthy being subject to fogs and damps from its low situation the harvest over the greatest part may be styled early commencing usually by the middle of august and except in backward seasons is finished by the end of september in the western parts which are upland and hilly the harvest is nearly a fortnight later than about pontefract and doncaster and from their vicinity to the irish channel a great deal more rain falls than in the eastern parts of the riding  the west riding is eminent for the number of its great and navigable rivers  st the ouse which takes ths name at york being formerly called the eure and in its course to the humber receives all the other rivers that run through the district  dly the don or dune which is navigable nearly to sheffield and of great advantage to the trade of that neighborhood  dly the calder which flows along the borders betwixt this riding and lancashire and running east the country falls into the air five miles beyond wakefield  thly the air or air a large river issuing from the mountain penigent which with the aid of canals is navigable to leeds bradford and skipton this river holds on a long course quite across the riding and falls into the don near snaith  thly the wharfe which has its rise at the foot of the craven hills and after a course of more than  0 miles across the riding keeping a great way at an equal distance of  0 miles from the air discharges itself into the ouse besides these principal ones there is a number of rivers of less importance  the establishment of manufactures in the west riding has been the principal cause of its present wealth it is difficult to ascertain the period when they were first introduced but there is reason to suppose it was about the beginning of the fifteenth century camden in his britannia fixes the introduction of manufactures to have been during the reigns of henry the eighth and edward the sixth this era may however be suspected for there is a copy of a courtroll as we were informed still extant dated at the court of the prior of jews held at halifax on the thursday after the feast of st thomas   henry the fifth      wherein richard de sunderland and joan his wife surrender into the hands of the lord of the manor an enclosure at halifax called the tenter croft which is a strong presumption that manufactures were carried on there before that period  the country chosen for carrying on these manufactures is admirably adapted to that purpose the raw materials are abundant on every hand and coals which are indispensably necessary are plentiful and cheap the ground in the vicinity of the manufacturing towns has in general been originally barren and in many parts little better than waste but from the great increase of population and the additional quantity of manure occasioned by the manufactures the soil is now equal in value to that of places originally more fertile  it appears to us that manufactures have had a sensible effect in promoting agriculture in this district by them a ready market is afforded for every particle of provisions that can be raised without which agriculture must always be feeble and languid they have no doubt raised the rate of wages considerably this always follows of course where trade prospers and is a sure sign of wealth but they have at the same time raised the value of the produce of land which much more than enables the farmer to pay the increased rate of wages  from all the inquiries we could make we did not find that the effects of manufactures were detrimental to agriculture by rendering hands scarce for carrying it on in harvest the manufacturers generally leave their looms and assist in reaping the crop we could not hear of any season but what there were sufficient to answer the demand except in      at which time the manufacturers had orders to an uncommon extent even then this scarcity was no further felt in the west riding than by a great rise of wages although we were informed that in the east riding a very heavy loss was sustained  having now given this short description of the west riding of yorkshire it remains only in this place to add that it is by far the most valuable of the three districts into which that county is divided and whether it is considered with respect to magnitude fertility of soil local advantages manufactures or population it will be found deserving the most minute attention and worthy to be ranked with any province in the kingdom  without entering into a minute detail for which we had collected the materials should the board at any time wish for it we shall at present restrict ourselves to the giving of a general view of the present state of this important district and of the obstacles to and the means of its improvement  i present state of the agriculture of the district the husbandry of the west riding differs so materially that it is absolutely necessary before discussing its particular parts to give a few preliminary observations tending to explain the respective systems that prevail in the several parts of that extensive district   st there is the pasture lands where grass is the chief object and where cultivation by the plough is only considered in a secondary light  the parts of the riding where this system prevails are at least one third of the whole from ripley to the western extremity of the riding almost all the good land is in grass and where corn is raised it is only upon the inferior soils during the time we were in that part of the country we hardly ever saw a plough and a stack of corn was as great a rarity upon the higher grounds there are immense tracts of waste which are generally common among the contiguous possessors and pastured by them with cattle and sheep some of them are stinted pastures but the greatest part are under no limitations the consequences of which are  the grounds are oppressed the stock upon them starved and little benefit derived from them by the proprietors   dly there are the lands adjoining to the manufacturing towns the greatest part of the ground is there occupied by persons who do not consider farming as a business but regard it only as a matter of convenience the manufacturer has his enclosure wherein he keeps milk cows for supporting his family and horses for carrying his goods to market and bringing back raw materials this will apply to the greatest part of the land adjoining to the manufacturing towns and although much ground is not in this case kept under the plough yet comparatively more corn is raised than in the division above described   dly those parts of the riding where tillage is principally attended to and grass only considered as the mean of bringing the corn husbandry to perfection  if we run an imaginary line from ripley southward by leeds wakefield and barnesley to rotheram we may affirm that the greatest part eastward of it till we come to the banks of the ouse which separates the west from the east riding is principally employed in raising corn about boroughbridge wetherby selby etc there is about one half of the fields under the plough further south about pontefract barnesley and rotheram there is twothirds and to the eastward of doncaster to thorn and snaith threefourths of the land is managed in a similar way there is not much waste in this division and what is in that situation is capable of great improvement   thly the common fields these are scattered over the whole of the last division but are most numerous in that part of the country to the eastward of the great north road from doncaster to boroughbridge it is impossible even to guess at the quantity of land under this management in general it may be said they are extensive and from the natural good quality of the soil and the present imperfect state of culture great room is afforded for solid and substantial improvement being effected upon all land coming under the description of common field   thly the moors these besides the large tracts that abound in the first division mostly lie in the southwest parts of the riding above penneston and sheffield upon them sheep are chiefly bred and afterward sold to the graziers in the lower parts of the country a great part of them is common which lays the proprietors under the same inconveniences as are already pointed out and which might easily be remedied by dividing and ascertaining the proportion which belongs to the respective proprietors  having finished this introductory sketch we proceed to give a comprehensive view of the result of our inquiries during the survey  proprietors  a considerable part of the landed property of the west riding is in the hands of small freeholders and copyholders but there are likewise a great number of extensive proprietors few of the latter reside upon their estates at least for a considerable part of the year and the management of them is chiefly devolved upon their stewards or factors  size of farms  a great majority of farms are comparatively small and there are very few of that size which in some other counties of the kingdom would be considered as large ones the size varies so much that it is not easy to fix upon an average upon the arable lands we heard of none exceeding  00 acres and for one of that extent there are a dozen not fifty in the grass division of the county they are still smaller and we often heard the occupier of  00 acres styled a great farmer  leases  the greatest part of the land is set without lease or which is the same thing the occupiers are removable upon six months warning the leases which in the common acceptance of the word can be considered as such are of different durations from   to    years but threefourths of the riding are possessed from year to year and this practice which to us seems destructive of all good farming is upon the increase the duke of norfolk and several other proprietors much to their honor act otherwise and are convinced of the propriety of giving the farmer a security of reaping the fruits of his improvements  we shall in another part of this work endeavor to show the ruinous consequences to agriculture that proceed from giving no leases and how absurd it is to expect the ground is to be improved by persons who may be removed from their possessions whenever the proprietor or more properly speaking his steward is disposed from whim or caprice to do so  covenants  the covenants that prevail betwixt landlord and tenant are many and various we were favored with copies of some leases and had opportunities of seeing others in the hands of the possessors we shall give an abstract of the clauses in some of them now lying before us  in one the covenants are as follows  the landlord sets the ground for  0 years and gives entry to the land on the  d day of february and to the houses upon the   th of may the rent to be paid in equal portions at the first terms of whitsuntide and martinmas thereafter reserves the liberty of hunting and fishing on the premises and the property of all mines and quarries and the iron ore coal lead or other minerals contained in them reserves liberty to go into the enclosures to cut and dig trees of all kinds with access to carry them off the tenant obliges himself to pay all taxes as well parliamentary as other ones already imposed or to be imposed during the currency of the lease without defalcation from the rent obliges himself also to eat all his bay and straw upon the premises and to dung a part of his meadow ground every year agrees not to plough any of his old pasture under a penalty of l  0 per acre nor to have above onefourth of his farm under the plough at one time  the lease also contains a great many clauses about attending courts repairing fences grinding malt and corn etc etc etc which it is unnecessary to mention  in another we observe the following conditions restricted from ploughing any of the meadow or pasture land obliged to fallow the third part of the tillage land annually and to lay two chalders of lime upon every statute acre to pay all parliamentary and parochial taxes at present existing or that may be laid on during the currency of the lease to keep up all fences roads bridges etc upon the farm to pay the rent within twenty days after it becomes due under forfeiture of the lease to pay a penalty of l  0 for every acre not managed agreeable to the covenants over and above the rent   conditions of a third lease entry to the farm at candlemas rent payable at whitsuntide and martinmas thereafter no bay or straw to be sold no meadow or pasture to be ploughed without consent of the proprietor when land is sown down for grass to be done with    bushels of fine hay seeds and  lbs of dutch white clover per acre tenant removable at   months warning   in other leases we saw the tenant is expressly prohibited from breaking up all grass lands that have lain   years which renders the situation of the pasture and meadow fields as immutable at the laws of media and persia were of old in short the very nature of most of the subsisting covenants are destructive to improvements and as it is well said in the journal by mr potter at tadcaster  a good farmer will manage much better wanting them and as for a bad farmer they never will mend him  rent  it is difficult for us to say what may be the real rent of land we could not with propriety push the farmer upon this point when he was ignorant what use we were to make of his answer and even where we got sufficient information of what was paid the landlord we found there was a long train of public burdens over and above which were not easily computed there is in the first place the land tax which is uniformly paid by the tenant and generally amounts to   s per pound upon the real rent  dly the tithes which are levied in so many various ways that it is impossible to say what proportion they bear to the pound rent much depending upon the actual state of the farm and not a little upon the character and disposition of the drawer upon arable lands where they are annually valued the payment in money may be from   to   s per acre in some cases more  dly the roads the expense of which to the tenant is about l   per cent upon the rent  thly the poors rates for which no fixed sum can be set down the lowest we heard of was    d in the pound and the highest   s   d but from the very nature of the tax they are continually fluctuating  thly the church and constables dues which are about   s in the pound  from all these things it may be supposed that in many places the sums payable by the farmer to the church the public and the poor are nearly as great as the nominal rent paid to the landlord it will appear surprising to many that rents are higher for grass fields than for those under the plough this is however actually the case and we account for it in the following manner when in grass few or no tithes are paid at least the burden is comparatively light the want of leases and the restrictions do not operate half so severely upon the grazier as upon the corn farmer the grass farmer has few improvements to make he goes on in the same course from year to year and the want of a lease though it keeps him from the certainty of possession yet does not hurt him so far as to cramp his operations at settle and skipton we found land let so high as  0 s and  0 s per acre while from the best accounts we could receive in the corn country  0 s and  0 s was considered as a high rent and in many places it is much lower  tithes  this is a most important subject which we shall afterward have occasion to mention at present it is only necessary to observe that they are collected in various ways in some parts the small tithes are only drawn in kind and a modus is taken in lieu of the great ones in other parts it is the custom for the titheowner to send a person before harvest to value the tithes in the parish and afterward to deliver an estimate of their value to the farmer giving him the alternative of paying that sum which for various reasons is generally agreed to or having the tithes drawn in kind  poors rates  this is another burden upon the farmer which has of late greatly increased in a country such as the west riding of yorkshire where employment abounds for persons of all ages and even for children who are able to do any thing it excites great surprise that the poor should be so numerous and the rates so excessive the subject is important and well deserves the attention of those concerned as for our parts we do not pretend to understand the laws by which the support of the poor is regulated nor have we the least knowledge upon what system the workhouses are kept we have heard of workhouses in norfolk and other parts of the kingdom that under proper management have either supported or nearly supported themselves we feel very sensibly for the infirmities of old age and are fully of opinion that due attention ought to be paid to the distresses of our fellow creatures who are unable to support themselves this is a christian duty and ought never to be forgotten but we have reason to suspect the provident support held out by the poors laws is often the cause of making the lower ranks more thoughtless and extravagant in the days of health and strength than they would otherwise be holding out large funds is the sure way to increase the number of the poor we speak from our personal knowledge when we say that in the northern parts of the island where employment is not only scarce but wages not half so great the lower ranks by being temperate and frugal well bring up large families and are very seldom a burden upon the parish where they reside we know of country parishes where the number of souls is near  000 and the rental of the ground more than l  000 where the annual charge of the poor does not exceed l  0 and of this sum not one half falls upon the land as it is mostly collected on sunday at the church doors in scotland there is no law against settlements no restrictions against building cottages wherever a man can procure ground to build upon nor no bars thrown in the way of common people marrying and yet the number of poor who are a burden upon the parishes is comparatively small from these things there are reasons for concluding that the english poor laws stand much in need of revision and that the laws against settlements and building cottages have not prevented the increase of the poor but are only detrimental to sound morality and real religion  rotation of crops  there are many rotations of crops adopted but the one most generally practiced is turnips barley clover wheat where the turnips are properly cleaned a better one cannot be followed upon all soils fit for this rotation but this succession of crops also takes place upon much land that cannot be farmed in this manner to advantage upon other lands where only two crops are allowed to a fallow wheat and beans or wheat and oats are generally the crops in the western parts of the riding oats is the principal crop which is indeed very proper so long as the plough is confined to the higher grounds  the grasses that are cultivated are red clover when it is to be followed with wheat and white clover and hay seeds for pasture sometimes hay seeds are sown by themselves and a good deal of sainfoine is cultivated in the neighborhood of tadcaster and ferrybridge as for the old rich pastures about skipton settle and other places it is not easy to say what they have originally been sown with there appears among other grasses a great quantity of what is usually called honeysuckle grass which we suppose to be the same plant sold under the name of cowgrass by the london seedsmen most of the vale of skipton has been  0 years in the same situation as at present and the proprietors do not seem anxious for changing it the quantity of hay seeds sown upon an acre is very great no less than threequarters probably some people may sow less but we had accounts from some very judicious farmers that the above when sown with   lbs white dutch clover afforded them the best pasture indeed none of them can say what these hay seeds are they may be weeds or other noxious trumpery this they could not explain  there is very little ryegrass sown the people in general have a mortal aversion to it and the clover crops from a want of this mixture make exceeding bad hay the old pastures are therefore frequently cut which makes a hay of great repute and is generally used over the whole riding  turnips  although the turnip husbandry prevails over a great part of the riding yet the proper cultivation of them is not attended to so carefully as it ought except by a few individuals they are universally sown broadcast and most imperfectly cleaned we understand that it is not much more than twenty years since they were hoed at all and that the introduction of this most necessary practice was principally owing to the indefatigable exertions of that truly patriotic nobleman the late marquis of rockingham it may readily be supposed that a people who so lately thought hoeing unnecessary will still think an imperfect hoeing sufficient which we are sorry to say is too much the case indeed it is only by drilling and horsehoeing that large fields of turnips can be kept in proper order at a moderate expense we saw some fields very well dressed and carrying good crops particularly upon mr beaumonts estate near wakefield in the neighborhood of rotheram and at snaith but the greater number were full of weeds in some places too thick in others very blanky and would not be considered as half a crop where the management of turnips is well understood  rape or coleseed  it did not appear to us that rape was much cultivated in any part of the west riding and it is only on the eastern parts that any quantity is sown at all it is raised both for feeding sheep and upon account of the value of the seed although we apprehend in the last case it will be found a very scourging crop there are two ways in which it is consumed by sheep first by sowing it in july and feeding it off both before winter and again in the spring in which method it is an excellent preparation for barley secondly it is sown upon the wheat stubbles that are next season intended for turnips the land is ploughed as soon as the wheat crop is got off which is usually before the end of august and it is eaten in spring previous to working the turnip land both these modes are excellent and deserve imitation when rape is intended for seed it is sown about the  st of august upon land fallowed and dunged it is cut in the month of july thereafter by which means it remains near a whole year on the ground  winter tares  tares are sown in many places particularly about sheffield and rotheram and are excellent spring food for horses before the clover crops are ready they are sown from september to the  st of november and by being cut in april and may afford sufficient time to prepare the ground for turnips as they are found to answer so well we cannot but recommend the cultivation of them upon all rich warm soils the maintenance of horses being at that time particularly expensive  flax  considerable quantities of flax are raised in that part of the riding next the river ouse which is a very proper soil for it we were favored with a list of the claims given in this year to the clerk of the peace for the west riding from which it appears that the bounty allowed by parliament for encouraging the growth of flax is claimed for no less a quantity than   000 stones upon a proper soil nothing will pay the farmer better than flax and if care and attention are bestowed on the pulling of it and due pains afterward used to the scutching and cleaning there is no doubt but flax of as good quality may be raised at home as what is imported from the baltic or holland  enclosures  almost the whole of the west riding is enclosed except the common fields and moors and too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the perfect state in which the fences are kept the enclosures are however generally too small at least for cornfieldsd and are the means of wasting a great part of the land it did not appear to us that either the convenience of water or uniformity of soil had been much studied in planning them out the advantages of enclosing are great and manifold the rent to the landlord is immediately raised at least onefourth and how could this be paid if more corn and grass were not produced than by open field management they enable the farmer to practice a more improved system by introducing the grass husbandry in all its perfection and the improvement of all kinds of stock is necessarily great  we often asked the question does enclosing decrease population and were uniformly answered that it certainly increased it can it even be supposed that a practice which enables the farmer to pay more to his landlord which is the means of increasing food both for man and beast will ever lessen the number of the people it affords employment for additional hands from the great increase of labor necessarily required by this improved system which must consequently tend to augment population these things are so obvious to every person acquainted with the subject or who will take the trouble to examine the present state of the common fields and wastes that we would hardly have mentioned them if some popular writers particularly the late dr price had not attempted to show that the number of the people in this island was decreased and assigned enclosing as the principal cause  farm houses and offices  the greatest part of these are very inconveniently situated being generally crowded into townships or villages and not upon the fields the farmer has to cultivate it is sufficiently plain that the nearer the farmer is to his fields the more work he will perform and at less expense  this has lately been more attended to than formerly but great room is still left for further improvement in this respect as nothing tends more to promote the happiness and comfort of the farmer than by having his farmstead properly constructed and conveniently situated we shall here take the liberty to throw out our opinion on the subject  the farm house and offices should be placed as near as possible in the center of the farm provided good water can be had in plenty which always ought to be first inquired after the farmyard or foldyard should be a long square proportioned to the size of the farm and the number of buildings intended to be erected the dwelling house should stand at one of the ends of the yard fronting the south the barns upon the west side the stables and byres upon the east and sheds etc on the north side for holding husbandry utensils this affords complete conveniences of all kinds and keeps every thing within the reach and sight of the farmer which is an object of great importance and the yard by being enclosed on all sides keeps the dung in a proper state for fermenting and affords shelter to whatever cattle may be wintered there  we do not admire the large barns we saw at several places particularly those of messrs walkers at rotheram and mr drummond at baubey which are liker churches than barns the building such edifices at first is very expensive and the interest of the money originally laid out when added to the sums required for keeping them in repair must be great while at the same time they are productive of no real good to the farmer  we are clearly of opinion that corn can never be kept so well in a house as when properly built and stacked in a yard it will always be found healthier and drier in that case than when kept long in the house which it must necessarily be wherever large barns are used besides in backward seasons corn can be got much sooner ready for the stack than the barn and it is an important article in the economy of farming to have corn as soon out of danger as possible  it is said housing of corn saves expense this we doubt it will take as many people to put it into the barn in harvest as afterward and the difference of expense betwixt harvest and common wages will build it in the yard at any rate the expense of the barns and the danger of the corn turning moldy in them far more than exceeds every possible advantage that can be derived from this practice  we do not think corn in the yard can be built more easy and convenient than in round stacks these may be made of any size and from their shape and construction they allow air to penetrate into the heart with greater facility than when built in the present form we thought much unnecessary trouble was bestowed upon heading and covering both hay and corn stacks over the whole riding the straw is laid on in very great quantities and with as much accuracy as if it were thatched for a dwelling house as for the roping it is as strongly applied as if the stacks were to stand twenty years we are far from condemning these practices merely because they are accurate corn ought always to be properly secured but we think them a wasting of labor and expense and that the corn would be as well defended from the weather if half the trouble was saved  cottages  there is a very great want of dwelling houses for husbandmen and laborers and this deficiency may be traced to the poors laws for its source the farmer from a dread of heavier rates falling upon him keeps as few houses as possible and hence almost the whole of farm servants are young unmarried men who have board in the house while those that are styled daylabourers reside in the villages this practice is very troublesome to the farmer it decreases the number of people employed in husbandry and has for its certain attendant a great rise of wages  we venture to recommend that proper houses should be built for farm servants contiguous to every homestead this will not only promote the welfare and happiness of that class of men by giving them an opportunity of settling in life which is not at present an easy matter but will also be highly beneficial to the farmer himself as he will at all times have hands within his own bounds for carrying on his labor and have them of that description that are generally esteemed most regular and careful  wages  this is an important article to every corn farmer in the west riding as wages for these some years past have greatly increased we suppose the wages of a house servant of which kind as already said most of the ploughmen are may be estimated from l    to l  0 a year including maintenance there is a practice which prevails over a considerable part of this district of giving them drink both forenoon and afternoon be the work what it will which is a ridiculous custom and ought to be abolished without loss of time what can be more absurd than to see a ploughman stopping his horses half an hour in a cold winter day to drink ale we suspect the practice is so deep rooted that it will not be easily removed without a compensation this ought to be done at once as being like the tithes an encouragement to idleness and from wasting much time a great obstruction to improvements  provisions  are abundant over the whole riding though from the extensive demand from the manufacturing towns they are high in price butchers meat upon an average is about   d per pound but often more during the spring and early summer months the corn markets are full as high as in any part of the island there not being any thing like a sufficient quantity raised within the riding for the consumption of its inhabitants in the grazing parts where very little corn is grown they are supplied from places at a distance which no doubt causes a considerable increase in the price potatoes are in abundance though very inferior in quality the cheapest articles of provisions are poultry for which reasons might be easily assigned  fuel  this most necessary article is plenty and comparatively cheap in those parts where any scarcity exists they can be supplied without any material inconvenience by means of those numerous navigable rivers and canals that intersect the whole country  woods  there is a great deal of oak and ash wood grown in the west riding which meets with a ready market at the shipping and manufacturing towns the woods appear to be under a very proper system of management which will be seen from a paper relative to them in the appendix there are also large quantities of logs and deals imported from the baltic which at a future period might be rendered unnecessary if scotch firs and larches were planted upon the waste grounds  manures  this is a subject that deserves particular attention as it is upon the solid foundation of manuring that every good system of husbandry must be built  the manures used in the west riding besides those generally used in other parts of the kingdom are bones horn shavings and rape dust and from the accounts we received their effects are highly beneficial with regard to the lime husbandry and the collection and application of home made dung we are of opinion that the present practice is very faulty and defective as this is an important subject we will give our opinion upon it at some length   st in the pasture parts of the country the hay is consumed upon the field and from its being thrown indiscriminately upon the ground the dung may be said to be in great measure lost at least the value of it is much reduced in comparison to what it would be if the hay was eaten at home in the house or the yard and the dung carefully collected together in a heap so as fermentation might properly take place we decidedly condemn the eating hay in the field as occasioning great waste of that necessary article independent of the loss sustained by the improper application of the dung   dly the home made dung in the above parts of the country is generally laid upon the rich pasture fields which have been cut that season for hay and not upon the tillage lands we have doubts whether dung can ever be applied with equal propriety as upon well wrought fallows if the dung exceeds the quantity necessary for the fallows which in few situations will be the case it ought to be laid upon other parts of the farm which are under the plough and not upon the grass fields which when properly laid down will sufficiently improve themselves these observations apply to those parts of the riding that are first described in the introductory sketch to this result  in the corn districts dung is applied with more judgment it being generally laid upon the fallow or turnip brick or break though even there it is sometimes laid upon the grass we are of opinion a great deal more dung might be accumulated if the stubbles were cut lower than is presently done barley and oats are generally cut with the scythe which so far obviates this argument but wheat which is the prevailing crop is always cut with the sickle  from not seeing the crops upon the ground we cannot say to a certainty what proportion of the stubbles might be left but from a careful examination of the stubbles we suppose it at least onethird this not only occasions a great loss of grain as all the straggling heads are thereby left but also deprives the farmer of a large portion of home manure some time ago an experiment was made in east lothian to ascertain the difference betwixt high and low cutting four ridges of wheat were cut which were of equal length and breadth and apparently the same in quality two of them were cut close by the ground and the other two considerably higher though not so high as in many places of the west riding the measure of each two ridges was a very trifle more than a quarter of a scotch acre which is onefifth more than the english statute measure the low cutting was done by   shearers in   hour    minutes the high cutting in    minutes by the same hands the wheat was threshed separately and the corn and straw measured and carefully weighed  l s d result    shearers   hour    minutes at    d per day being the rate of wages that week and   d for victuals is   s per day 0     the high cutting by the same hands    minutes at ditto or   s per scots acre 0     difference of expense 0   0 one and onequarter pecks more wheat upon the two ridgeslow cut than upon those cut high at   s   d per peck is 0        stones of    english pounds more straw at   d per stone 0     0   0 from which deduct the difference of expense in cutting 0   0 0   0  benefit derived from cutting low being   s the quarter of an acre or    s per acre   as the dry stubble left upon the field will never ferment it is therefore of no use to enrich the ground and occasions great inconvenience when the land is ploughed down  the farmer is also often deprived of a due quantity of dung by keeping too many cattle we venture to lay it down as a rule that no greater number should be kept than is necessary to reduce the straw to putrefaction when more are kept although the quality of the dung may be improved yet the quantity is curtailed  the lime husbandry seems to us to be practiced upon very improper principles whenever we speak against the general practice we wish to be diffident but we are so much dissatisfied with the manner in which lime is applied that we cannot refrain from expressing our sentiments upon it  the farmer is too often obliged by the covenants subsisting between him and his landlord to throw lime upon land where in the real sense of the word it is truly thrown away it must appear exceedingly absurd to any person who knows the manner in which lime operates and the number of years its effects continue that the farmer should be obliged to lime his land every third year whether it needs it or not this is in effect done by every lease where two crops are only allowed to a fallow and where it is covenanted to lay lime upon that fallow the specified quantity is in many cases so small being sometimes one chalder or a chalder and a half that it never can produce effects adequate to the expense or indeed any expense at all it may be said that by frequently laying on small quantities that a sufficient dose is given at last this argument is plausible but it should be remembered that the effects of the first partial liming is probably wore off before the second comes to its assistance and that if the first is stimulating and fermenting the land the second is only a prodigal waste of expense  but why oblige the farmer to lay lime upon his land at all if it be for his interest he will do it without any obligatory clause in his lease if it is not for his interest a burden is laid on his shoulders that can give benefit to none it is surprising proprietors should insist upon this for lime has never been understood to improve the real value of the soil but is generally considered as a stimulus or used to procure a temporary exertion  we were particularly anxious to ascertain the quantity of lime laid upon an acre and we found it to be in different places from   chalder or    bushels to  00 bushels some people may use rather more but from  0 to  0 bushels per acre may be regarded as an average a quantity very inadequate in our humble opinion to the intended purpose  lime in the west riding is principally applied to fallow and spread upon the ground immediately before the last ploughing we judge unless in some particular situations it would be used with greater advantage upon the grass fields for instance instead of laying it upon the fallow preparatory to turnips or upon the clean summer fallow let it be laid upon the clover crop which is the third of the usual sequence or upon the pasture lands previous to breaking them up for corn the land is generally at that time in a situation proper for the operation of lime and it can be applied at different periods with less trouble and inconvenience to the farmer  watering or floating land  in many parts especially in the manufacturing district great improvement is made upon the grass fields by watering or floating them mr walker at crownest is the most particular in this respect and has his water so admirably disposed that he can float the greatest part of his fields whenever he thinks convenient we do not pretend to be acquainted with this branch of husbandry but in some places we were told its advantages were equal to a top dressing of manure  draining  this most useful practice ought never to be neglected by the farmer as where the nature of the soil and situation of the ground requires it no money can be so advantageously expended in our survey of the west riding we found draining was assiduously attended to in many places but that in others it was either totally neglected or imperfectly performed in particular that useful measure of clearing out the water furrows upon the tillage fields which is absolutely necessary upon most soils was very negligently executed as soon as possible after a field is either ploughed or sown the whole furrow along the end of the field betwixt and the headridge together with such parts of the field itself where the water from want of level cannot get off should be dug of a proper depth and perfectly cleaned out this lays the field in such a situation that the greatest falls of rain run off immediately and a due attention to this practice constitutes in a material manner the difference betwixt the good and the bad farmer  hollow drains are filled up in various ways in some places the shoulder drain prevails this is done by digging the bottom of the drain narrower than the top and covering it with the surface sod which may do in some cases where the sward is strong but never can be fully depended upon where they are filled with stones sometimes the largest are set upon their edge casting inwards till they join which leaves a small vacuity for the water running and they are then filled up with small stones in other places this is done with bricks but where plenty of materials allow it we never could discern a more efficacious method of filling drains than by doing it with round land stones thrown in indiscriminately which if care is taken that no earth is mixed amongst them and the top well covered with straw before they are filled up will run longer and be less liable to interruption than when a vacuity is left by either setting the first stones upon their edge or by walling the sides and covering with flat stones and at the same time is considerably cheaper  paring and burning  our information on this head was various and contradictory in some places the practice is prohibited unless with the consent of the proprietor in others it is deemed the best method for breaking up all grass grounds and is not supposed to waste the soil in any shape our opinion is that upon some grounds paring and burning may be good management particularly upon rough coarse sward which cannot otherwise be easily brought into a proper state of cultivation but that upon the whole it is a practice that should be gently used as it tends in a material degree to exhaust and impoverish the soil the expense of paring and burning of land with spreading the ashes is from    s to    s per acre  horses  there are not many horses bred except in the eastern parts of the riding the size of those employed in the western parts is generally small but they are hardy and capable of great fatigue in other parts of the riding they are large and sufficiently able for any field operations those used in the wagons are strong and well made  cattle  the stock of cattle may be classed under four different heads there is the short horned kind which principally prevail in the east side of the riding and are distinguished by the names of the durham holderness or dutch breeds there is the long horned or craven breed which are both bred and fed in the western parts and also brought from the neighboring county of lancashire these are a hardy sort of cattle and constitutionally disposed to undergo the vicissitudes of a wet and precarious climate there is another breed which appears to be a cross from the two already mentioned and which we esteem the best of all a great number of milk cows of this sort are kept in nidderdale and the adjacent country which are both useful and handsome they are perhaps not altogether such good milkers as the holderness cows but they are much hardier and easier maintained they are at the same time sooner made ready for the butcher and are generally in good order and condition even when milked beside these there are immense numbers of scotch cattle brought into the country which after being fed for one year and sometimes two are sold to the butcher beef of this kind always sells higher in the market than that of the native breed and from the extent of population there is a constant demand for all that can be fed  sheep  there are so many kinds of sheep both bred and fed and they have been so often crossed that it is not easy to describe them the sheep bred upon the moors in the western part of the riding and which we presume are the native breed are horned light in the fore quarter and well made for exploring a hilly country where there is little to feed them but heath and ling these are generally called the peniston breed from the name of the market town where they are sold when fat they will weigh from    lb to    lb per quarter they are a hardy kind of sheep and good thrivers when brought down at a proper age to the pastures in the low parts of the country they feed as cleverly and are as rich mutton as need be we suppose crossing ewes of this sort with a bakewell ram would produce an excellent breed for the low country pastures as the bakewell kind have exactly the properties that the peniston wants  there are great quantities of scotch sheep from teviotdale etc fed in the country numbers of ewes are also brought annually from northumberland which after taking their lambs are fed that season for the butcher many two years old of this kind are also fed upon turnips and in the southern parts there are a good many of the flat ribbed lincolnshire sheep which are ugly beyond description  upon the waste commons scattered up and down the riding the kind of sheep bred are the most miserable that can be imagined as they generally belong to poor people and are mostly in small lots they never can be improved this will apply to the whole of the sheep kept upon the commons that are not stinted the numbers that are put on beggar and starve the whole stock in many parts of the riding a superior attention is now beginning to be paid to this useful animal by selecting rams of the best properties and breeds which it is to be hoped will be more and more attended to  wool  from the extent of the woollen manufactory in the riding it may be necessarily supposed there is a constant demand for wool of all sorts prices however owing to the stagnation of trade have decreased considerably this season from the best information we could procure it has fallen from    to    per cent and good wool may now be purchased at   d and   d perpound averdupois weight  common fields  the system under which that part of the riding composed of common fields is managed cries out for immediate improvement it has been already said in the introductory sketch that these fields are numerous and extensive and that the husbandry practiced upon them is uniformly bad hence land rises in value the moment it is divided and free scope allowed to the genius and talents of the farmer they are generally of the best soil and yet from what we learned they carried the worst crops every hour lost in accomplishing a division of them brings a loss upon the public greater than can be estimated  waste lands  a considerable part of the west riding is waste land and moor it may appear rash to guess at the proportion but we think it may be computed at onesixth part of the whole the quantity is lessening every day as enclosure bills are frequently passed for that purpose but still a great deal remains to be done there are many parts of these wastes capable of great improvement if divided and enclosed but the far greatest part would not repay the expense of enclosing at same time it is our opinion that larches and scots firs would thrive in many situations wood of these kinds is much wanted and we apprehend would pay the proprietor well and contribute to the public convenience at any rate as the wastes are mostly common the proportion belonging to each proprietor ought to be ascertained which would enable him to improve his share in the manner he may see most advantageous  ploughs and carts  in nothing are the farmers of the west riding more deficient than in the construction and management of their ploughs and wheel carriages these are essential articles in the practice of husbandry and are generally most perfect where the best farming prevails  the same plough with a few trifling alterations is universally used over the whole district it is generally called the dutch or rotheram plough and was first made by a mr joseph foljambe about  0 years ago who got a patent for it the fault of this plough lies more in the manner it is yoked than in the principles upon which it is made the practice of yoking horses in a line which prevails over a considerable part of the district renders it necessary when putting in the beam to turn it considerably to the furrow in order to give the plough what is technically called land owing to this the horses draw in a contrary direction to the share and coulter which consequently makes the plough go very unsteady and from the difference betwixt the direction of the draught and the head upon which the share is fixed the force of the resistance must necessarily be increased  notwithstanding the necessity of turning the beam toward the furrow is entirely owing to the yoking horses in a line yet so forcible is custom that even when horses draw abreast the ploughs have all more or less of this crooked beam we observed that the sock or share is much shorter and broader in the point than those we are accustomed with which must make them difficult to work in all gravelly soils and even in clays when they are dry  the half of the mould board is of cast metal the upper half is wood which is very proper as it is only the under side that wastes with the work  the prevailing practice over more than one half of the district of yoking horses in a line is truly absurd a horse never works so easy nor draws so fair as when going abreast or in pairs if land is in that situation as not to bear a horse upon the unploughed part it is unfit for laboring and ought not to be touched but this cannot be sustained as a reason for this practice for we repeatedly saw three horses in a line sometimes four ploughing tender clover leys every person knows the power of old customs and prejudices and we can only assign this for such an absurd practice  we apprehend every part of plough work may be accomplished by two horses if they are of sufficient strength and properly maintained we speak from what we see daily done on our own farms and those of our neighbors where land fully as strong as any we saw in yorkshire is constantly ploughed with two horses and the furrow generally taken deeper there is no question but where the land is hard and stiff so much cannot be done in a given time as upon lighter soils but this argument will have the same weight whatever number of horses are yoked all we contend for is that two good horses yoked abreast in a plough properly constructed are able to labor any ground when it is in a proper situation for being wrought  it is proper to notice that owing as we suppose to ploughing in a line the work is often very badly performed there is scarcely a straight ridge to be seen except in a very few places the land is generally kept too flat nor being properly acclivated to defend it against the winter rains we observed this particularly betwixt thorn and snaith where notwithstanding the soil is upon a wet bottom yet the ridges are narrow and not raised at all at the same time the land near these places was full straighter and neater ploughed than any we had seen  we often remarked in the course of our survey that the land was in general ploughed too shallow which not only curtails the pasture of the plants but also exposes them to be hurt by drought in one season and drenched by moisture in another we would lay it down as a rule never to be departed from that all land ought to be ploughed in direct proportion to its depth and that where the soil will admit it ought to be done substantially  farm carriages  these are carts and wagons of various sizes the carts in general are badly proportioned being too long in the body and straight which makes them heavy upon the back of the horse in going down hill and the contrary extreme in going up they are difficult to unload when driving out dung or performing any home work and often the sides fold inward in place of casting out to the wheel which makes them hold much less than they would otherwise do they are drawn by two three and four horses and are very unhandy about a farm the wagons are both upon broad and narrow wheels they are destructive to the roads and in our opinion of no advantage in carrying on the work of the husbandman  we suppose that a cart much shorter and at same time broader with sides throwing out and of a size to be drawn by two horses is a much better machine for the farmer than the one presently used if a person will attentively consider the unequal manner in which horses do work they will soon be convinced of the impropriety of yoking too many together we think the lighter the cart and the fewer the horses the more will proportionally be drawn at same time a great saving is afforded in the important articles of tear and wear  oxen  very few oxen are wrought in the west riding and these only upon the farms of landed proprietors we know working of oxen is a popular topic but from what we could learn upon this subject the practice is not likely to become general from their being almost universally given up in those places where they were formerly in repute a suspicion arises that working them is not attended with profit those who object to the use of oxen say that there is nothing saved but the original cost of the ox which from the difference between the value of their labor and that of a horse is soon compensated at same time it is a business of infinite difficulty to get persons to work them this is a point however that cannot be decisively determined without much investigation and inquiry particularly in those parts of the kingdom where the practice is still continued  roads  the utility of good roads is at first sight so evident that we need hardly say this subject deserves particular attention in the west riding there are a great number of very good roads and likewise a number that are indifferent from what we could learn they are generally under good management and the funds well applied in many places of the district particularly near the manufacturing towns materials are bad to this circumstance more than any impropriety of management we attribute their insufficiency at same time the ingenuity of the surveyors was conspicuous in burning free stones and brick to supply the want of harder materials  as these burnt materials make at the best but a very imperfect covering and need to be frequently repeated it occurs to us that hard stones might be brought by water carriage from the more eastern parts of the district this might probably be expensive at first but we are convinced would be found cheapest at the long run from halifax to wakefield the road is in the most miserable situation and if it was so when we traveled it in the end of october it must be nearly impassable during the winter months this is a very public road and no expense ought to be spared to render it good and sufficient  we apprehend the weight of the numerous wagons that pass over this and other roads in the manufacturing part of the country must always render them bad so long as they are repaired with soft materials we saw some roads that had been newly covered with burnt stones and bricks crushed down at once by the weight of these carriages let us suppose rain to fall and remain in the track or rut so made another wagon comes and cuts down still further and a third puts them in as bad condition as before they were repaired by these wagons an endless expense is created to the public and still bad roads are the consequence  there was nothing gave us greater satisfaction than the paved foot paths upon the sides of most of the roads in the manufacturing part of the country this shows an attention to the comfort of foot passengers that is very laudable we have noticed in the journal these foot paths are also made bridle roads a practice which can only be excused by the peculiar badness of the main road  the roads are a very heavy article of expense to the farmer and here as well as in most other parts of the island the burden is chiefly laid upon the occupiers of land it cannot be properly called a part of the rent as if the work is rightly laid out full value is received from it the farmer travels the road with more case and convenience to himself and is enabled from the improvement made by his labor and money to carry more corn to market and to return with a heavier load of dung than he could do if the roads were in their natural state road expense therefore cannot be viewed in the same light as tithes and poors rates for these can in no sense of the word be considered as paid for value received  it has often appeared surprising to us how the support of the by roads should be thrown upon the possessors of land and persons of almost every other rank allowed the benefit of them free of all charge whatever in many cases those who pay least for the making good roads have the greatest share of the profit the turnpike laws are not founded upon such false principles but every person by them is obliged to contribute his share of the expense for supporting the roads in a direct proportion to the use and benefit he receives from them  the statute labor paid by the farmer for the support of the roads is six days labor of a team with three horses or four oxen and one horse and two able servants for every l  0 of rent or less or more proportionally together with an assessment in money of   d per pound upon the rent or higher if the justices see necessary statute labor is also paid by the inhabitants and occupiers of tenements woods tithes and hereditaments the surveyors are nominated annually upon the   d september at a meeting of the inhabitants of each parish or township who make up a list not exceeding ten persons whom they think fit for that office which is given in to the justices who appoint one or more out of the list as they see necessary the surveyor or surveyors collect the assessment see the work properly executed and when their time in office is expired they lay their accounts before another meeting of inhabitants and afterward before a justice of the peace who may pass or postpone them to the special sessions to whom every person who thinks himself aggrieved may appeal  this mode of managing the roads appears more eligible and proper than what is practiced in many other parts of the island  in making up the list of surveyors the inhabitants place the person they wish appointed first and the justices generally appoint accordingly if the surveyor is deficient in his duty he is fined in a sum not exceeding l   nor less than l   for every neglect and as he must produce his accounts at a vestry meeting he can hardly escape if culpable the auditing the accounts annually is a very proper step and prevents that disorder and confusion which has been well known to have taken place in some other counties  manufactures  it is unnecessary to speak here of manufactures further than as they are connected with agriculture it will appear from many passages in the journal that they are of material advantage toward promoting good husbandry and that to them the west riding is indebted for its present flourishing state a considerable portion of the land is occupied by persons whose chief dependence is upon manufactures we are not in this case to expect the same attention to the minutiae of farming as from those who make it their sole occupation their minds and capitals are generally fixed upon their own business and land is solely farmed by them as a mere matter of convenience or amusement in the vicinity of the manufacturing towns great numbers of milk cows are fed and there is a constant demand not only in those places but over the whole riding for milk and the articles of cheese and butter which are produced from it  agricultural societies  in our progress through the west riding we could not learn after the minutest inquiry that a single society subsisted for the improvement of agriculture we heard of three that were formerly established for that useful purpose viz at sheffield bautry and doncaster but these for some time past have been discontinued  as improvements in agriculture very often locally take place and are slow in traveling from one part of a country to another we should esteem the institution of societies upon proper principles an excellent method for disseminating knowledge in this science if these societies were to correspond with one another every new improvement either in cultivation stock or husbandry utensils that was devised in one part of the country would be immediately known in its most distant parts for want of these means of communication at present the great body of farmers are almost as ignorant of what their brethren in other counties are doing as if they lived in a foreign land  in constituting agricultural societies we are far from recommending an intermixture of proprietors and farmers together it is absolutely necessary for many obvious reasons they should be separate without dwelling upon these it may only be said that in presence of his landlord the farmer is too ready to be diffident and will not propose his opinions in that free and unrestrained manner he would do if only amongst the company of his brethren and equals we heard of the sheffield society where gentlemen clergy and farmers met promiscuously the consequence of which was that the latter were in a manner prohibited from mentioning improvements in case they should be a watchword for the one increasing the rent and the other raising the rate of tithes  ii obstacles to improvement having given a comprehensive view of the present state of husbandry in the west riding we shall now proceed to point out the obstacles that in our humble opinion stand in the way of its further improvement these we consider to be want of leases injurious and improper covenants betwixt landlord and tenant payment of tithes in kind or by annual valuation and the smallness of farms many other causes of less consequence might be pointed out but these are the great and leading obstacles and it is unnecessary to pick at pebbles while mountains are in the way  want of leases  that celebrated agricultural writer arthur young in his political arithmetic published twenty years ago has said that the improvements which have taken place in england have been almost owing to the custom of granting leases and that in those countries where it is unusual to grant them agriculture continues much inferior to what it is to be found where they are usual if this doctrine be admitted and in our opinion it is founded upon principles that cannot be disputed the general custom of not granting leases in the district we are now treating of must deserve reprehension and if we are to judge of its husbandry by the rule here laid down we would be under the necessity of declaring that however flourishing the country may be and however much it may be improved in every branch of its agriculture still if leases had been granted and a security thereby offered to the farmer for enjoying the fruits of his labor these improvements would have increased and consequently the interest not only of the public but also of the proprietors themselves would have been materially promoted this is an important subject and well deserves the attention of every landed gentleman in the kingdom  before a farm can be put in proper order a considerable time must elapse and much money must be expended the fruits of improvements are not gained all at once and a number of years are required to accomplish the best digested plan suppose for instance a person entering to a farm that was worn out and exhausted by long and successive tillage and that he wishes to refresh the land by laying it down to grass it will be six years at least before he can go over it all with fallow and unless he sow it down clean he is neither doing the land nor himself justice if he continues it in grass five or six years more which is little enough time for ground so exhausted it will be found that near twenty years must take place before he receive the reward for his improved cultivation and to receive this reward he has a claim both from his superior management and as an incitement to his future industry but what security has he for this reward or what incentive has he to industry if he sits upon the premises by virtue of an annual lease in the midst of his career he might be interrupted by a six months warning and the toil of his hands and the fruits of his improvements go to another these are not imaginary apprehensions but arguments founded upon real and solid principles and which will operate less or more upon every farmer according to his situation and circumstances  again we shall suppose a farmer wishing to improve his breed of sheep the first step he has to take is to hire or purchase rams at an extravagant rate or otherwise he will not get them at all if he is removable upon six months warning sentence may be pronouncing against him when his ewes are but lambing and all his schemes of improvement blasted at once as a reflection upon his precarious settlement would probably make the former farmer continue in the usual routine of cropping his exhausted fields and taking what he could find in the old beaten path so similar considerations would probably influence the other to refrain from improving his flock in such a manner as he would otherwise do which is not only detrimental to his interest as an individual but a great loss to the public at large  from these things we hope it will appear that before any real and solid improvements can ever be effected by the farmer he must have the security of a lease for affording him time to reap the fruits of these improvements there is in the course of farming as much often laid out upon a single acre of ground as many succeeding crops can repay in this case where the farmer has a lease he looks to a future period for being reimbursed if he has none can it ever be expected that any man of common sense will throw away his money by improving another persons estate and cast himself upon the mercy and discretion of his landlord for time and opportunity to gain it back again the farmer who would do this is not guided by the same principles that influence the rest of mankind  the higher a farm is improved the greater the quantity of manure laid upon it the cleaner the fields are the richer the pastures and meadows the completer the fences and the more convenient the buildings and offices are all circumstances that may operate against the farmer who has no lease and be the means of alluring a covetous neighbor to attempt wresting his possession from him or may be used as arguments by a designing steward for raising his rent such being the case every considerate man is deterred from expending a halfpenny more than he is necessarily obliged to do and therefore it follows that the withholding leases is a real and certain obstacle in the way of farther improvements  we might also mention arguments of another kind for granting leases which however contemptuously they may be considered by others have great weight with us the farmer who sits without a lease has scarcely the privilege of thinking and acting for himself we were informed the tenants on an estate in the northern part of england had got warnings of removal merely because they had turned methodists there are not many landlords that find fault with their tenants for being religious this instance is only given to show upon what trivial grounds removals are made it is needless to bring forward arguments in support of this proposition for it cannot be contradicted we have often heard it said that the liberty enjoyed by the farmer and the security afforded by the constitution to his property were the principal causes why agriculture flourished more in this island than in other nations we beg leave to inquire where is the liberty enjoyed by the farmer who sits without a lease his words and actions are under the most absolute subjection to another who carries along with him a never failing argument upon all occasions let the abject situation of such a man placed under a capricious landlord be considered his best actions may be misinterpreted he is exposed to every indignity without daring to complain or if the spirit of a man gets up in him what security does the constitution afford to his situation the custom of the country in allowing what is called tillage and half tillage to the outgoing farmer is no reimbursement for any improvement he may have made the time of entry is at candlemas and the incoming tenant enters to the wheat that is sown and to the labor done upon the farm by his predecessor the former of which must be carefully improved and attended to while every possible advantage is taken of the latter for these things as well as the manure laid on and the grass seeds sown the preceding year he is allowed this practice is rather against the outgoing tenant as he receives no more than he actually expended and another person reaps what he had sowed his time personal industry and all other improvements go for nothing if he has made improvements the fruits of them are wrested from him by an arbitrary removal another farm cannot always be got and he may be turned upon the wide world without the hopes of redress a prudent man will reflect upon these things and if he is so critically situated will often rather part with his natural rights than expose himself to misery he may have a numerous family his farm may be doing well with him he may have contracted an affection for his natale solum and be uncertain if he makes a change how he is next to be put up the picture may be still higher colored but from the above we contend that the want of a lease precludes the farmer from acting as a free agent and renders his property insecure and precarious  covenants or restrictions  that covenants in a lease are obstacles to improvements cannot be disputed for the very nature of a covenant supposes that the practice to be regulated by it had arrived at its ne plus ultra and could not be mended these covenants subsist more or less in every lease we heard of and the shorter the lease the more numerous they are in annual leases there appears an absolute necessity for them as the farmer from having no certain prospect of enjoying his possession would otherwise be tempted to disregard every branch of good husbandry  it will hardly be alleged in defense of this practice that agriculture has already arrived at its utmost pitch of perfection and that improvements in that art can be carried no farther we will not suppose that any person acquainted with the subject will offer such defenses the very appointment of the honorable board for whose consideration this is drawn up is a public testimony that the practice of husbandry may still be improved but how is this to be done if the farmer who is the first wheel of the agricultural machine be restricted in his management if the crops he is to sow be marked out by the drawer of his lease how is more approved rotations to be introduced the fact is that all good farming is local and must in a great measure be regulated by the soil and the weather it is therefore absurd to lay down in a lease particular rules for a number of years practice as from circumstances many fields are often both richer and cleaner after carrying   or   crops than others after two consequently without leaving every thing to the wisdom and judgment of the farmer the ground can never be properly cultivated nor made to produce its greatest value  restrictions in a lease necessarily suppose that the framer of them possessed more knowledge of farming than he whose operations are thus to be directed we leave the public to judge whether this can actually be the case or not leases are often copied from one generation to another without paying any attention to more recent improvements how is it possible for an attorney or his clerk to lay down rules for the farmers direction allowing it is the steward or even the proprietor himself that dictates these rules we are warranted to say it is naturally impossible they can be wisely and judiciously framed laying aside the consideration of their fettering the farmers mind and clogging his operations such restrictions or rules may from alteration in markets be unprofitable and from the vicissitudes of seasons improper to be executed  every farmer knows from experience that the proper manner of cultivating any land is only to be learned from an intimate acquaintance with the nature of its soil and that what is very good management upon one farm is often very bad upon another the covenants suppose all to be alike that grass is of equal benefit on all lands and that the same quantity of lime should be administered to a light loam as to a strong clay besides in framing these covenants it is taken for granted that a person from a cursory view is at once able to determine upon the best mode of management for the endurance of a whole lease or in other words that his judgment is equal to that of the whole tenantry of an estate in short covenants are inimical to all good husbandry they sink the farmer into a state of insignificance they contract his mind and lock up his ideas from searching after new schemes which is the only method by which improvements can ever be found out and therefore it follows that a continuation of covenants is highly detrimental not only to the public good but even to the interest of the proprietor himself by lessening the rent that a superior cultivation arising from a spirit of improvement would be able to pay  we are ready to admit that general rules of management are very proper in leases such as to keep the farm under a husbandlike management to consume all the straw raised upon it and to sell no dung these restrictions we will allow and every good farmer will follow them whether he is obliged or not nay we will go farther  if leases of a proper duration were granted it is very reasonable that the property of the landlord ought to be protected by restricting clauses for the   years previous to their expiration but after all it will be found that no clause can be inserted besides the general ones already mentioned that will serve to enhance the value of the land but obliging the farmer to leave a proportional quantity of such land in grass at the expiration of the lease other clauses serve only to distress the farmer but will never promote the interest of the landlord  tithes  the next obstacle to improvements is the collection of tithes in kind or by an annual valuation and they are a burden upon agriculture that must ever damp the operations of the husbandman indeed where the tenth of the actual produce is drawn it is peculiarly exceptionable the titheholders may have a right by the laws of the land to the tenth part of the natural produce of the earth this we are not to contest but is it not an impediment to cultivation that they shall also receive the tenth part of the farmers labors and the tenth of the additional crop produced by the improvements he has made whereby two stalks of corn have grown where only one grew before surely not unless the drawer is at the tenth of the expense occasioned by these improvements otherwise he not only draws a tenth of the natural produce of the earth but also a tenth of the superior cultivation and additional manure bestowed upon the land and more than that a tenth of the farmers industry merit and abilities  we have already stated that sometimes the tithes are paid according to an annual valuation although at first sight this may appear as so much more rent and is in fact considered by a number of people in that light yet it operates much more severely upon the farmer than the same sum agreed upon by him in the lease to be paid this we will now endeavor to substantiate  the rent paid to the landlord is a known definite sum which neither falls nor increases whatever crops are raised by the farmer if by good cultivation or strength of manure he raises ever so luxuriant a crop he only pays the same rent to the landlord as if the ground had produced a more inferior one therefore the farmer so far as he is concerned with the landlord receives the fruits of his superior management but with regard to the titheholder the case is very different he comes before harvest inspects the fields and finding them carrying rich crops increases the rate of the tithe accordingly instead of paying   s per acre as perhaps he used to do he is now obliged to pay  0 s or    s merely because he has managed his land in a manner superior to his neighbors the case is exactly in point if we suppose the landlords rent was to be fixed by the goodness of the crops the fatal consequences of which need no illustration but whatever detriment this might occasion to improvements it would not be a bit heavier than the other the landlord has as good a right to a share of the extraordinary cultivation manure industry merit and abilities of the farmer bestowed upon the fields he cultivates as the titheholder can possibly claim  smallness of farms  the last thing we have to state as an obstacle to improvements in the west riding of yorkshire is the general small size of farms which necessarily occasions the ground to be cultivated by persons whose minds and stocks are incapable of carrying on spirited undertakings  the proper size of a farm is a question upon which theorists have often disputed in our inquiries we wish to be regulated by practical principles and although we are fully convinced that a farm of extent operates as a spur to activity and diligence yet we are not advocates for any system that would monopolize the lands of any country by throwing them into the hands of a few  an improved system of husbandry requires that the farm upon which it is to be carried on should be of some extent or else room is not afforded for the different crops necessary to complete a perfect rotation of management the farmer who practices husbandry upon proper principles should not only have his fields under all sorts of grain but likewise a sufficient quantity of grass and winter crops for carrying on his stock of cattle and sheep through all the different seasons of the year by laying out land in this style the economy of a farm is so regulated that too much work does not occur at one time nor any occasion for idleness at another this when the expenses of farm culture are so extravagant as at present deserves particular attention but cannot in the nature of things be justly and accurately arranged where the farm is of small size  it may be imagined that the arrangement of farm labor and the cultivation of the ground whatever the size of the farm may be is but a rule of three question and that the smallness of the possession only reduces the scale upon which improvements are to be carried on in some senses of the word this may be true but will the result of the question be favorable to improvements upon  0 acres labor may not be afforded for half a team the enclosures would perhaps be a few acres and the farmer would go to market to buy a single beast thereby affording opportunity for spending half the year in idleness wasting the ground by a number of fences and occasioning more expense than the whole profit would repay these things are the necessary consequences of arranging farm management as a rule of three question and are great drawbacks upon the profits of farming  besides an improved system of husbandry requires the farmer should be possessed of an adequate stock a thing in which small farmers are generally deficient it is an old proverb the truth of which we have too often seen exemplified that the poor farmer is always a bad one allowing he has knowledge he cannot reduce it to practice for want of the necessary means of putting it in execution the smallness of the west riding farms and the precarious situation of the farmers condition arising from want of leases as well as the trammels under which he is obliged to work have in a great measure thrown capitals into another line before an alteration of these things takes place persons of abilities and possessed of stock will be tempted to look down upon the profession and agriculture will not be carried on in its most improved state  with regard to the question whether large or small farms are generally best managed we apprehend very few words will suffice who keeps good horses and feeds them well who makes the completest fallow takes the deepest furrow and ploughs best who has the greatest number of hands and sufficient strength for catching the proper season by which the crop upon the best of grounds is often regulated who drives the most manure and raises the weightiest crops we believe in the general these questions must be answered in favor of the large farmer if so it follows that the prevalence of small farms in the west riding of yorkshire retards its improvement  it is a popular doctrine that large farms are unfriendly to population and that they ought to be discouraged we suspect this is founded in prejudice and will not stand the test if accurately examined no doubt if farms are increased in size the number of farmers are lessened this is granted but with regard to the great scale of population we are clearly of opinion it is not affected if a more superior practice is carried on upon a large farm than a small one this must be accomplished by employing a greater number of hands what therefore is lost in one class is gained in another besides we have often noticed that upon large farms most married servants are kept which affords encouragement to the increase of population upon a small farm from  0 to  00 acres what is the farmer to do he has not sufficient business for employing his attention and the smallness of his possession will not allow him to be idle he therefore must work with his hands which brings the question precisely to the same issue as if all work was performed by hired servants independent of the arguments we have adduced that more work is executed and more hands employed upon a large farm than upon the same extent of land divided into a number of small ones  iii improvements suggested agriculture is the parent of all the arts and the practice of it may be considered as a standard for the flourishing of others it has for some years past been a principal object in the several governments of europe to frame laws and regulations for its encouragement and the establishment of a board for promoting agriculture and internal improvement shows it is not neglected in our own country we have already presented to the consideration of that honorable board a state of the husbandry in the west riding of yorkshire and also pointed out for their information the principal obstacles which are in the way of further improvements we now proceed to suggest how these obstacles may be removed and what alterations ought to be introduced into the husbandry of the district  the improvements we suggest are  st that all land should be let upon lease  dly that the covenants that presently subsist betwixt landlord and tenant should be discontinued  dly that the payment of tithes should be fixed by a permanent valuation  thly that a general bill should pass for dividing the common fields and waste grounds   these we account the leading articles of improvement without which no material encouragement can be given to the husbandry of the district in the hopes that the board of agriculture will consider them in the same light we shall proceed to recommend  thly more approved rotations of crops  thly breaking up the grass fields and frequent changes of corn and grass  thly drilling and horsehoeing beans and turnips  thly planting the waste grounds   many other articles of lesser importance might be added but as most of them are already noticed in the foregoing parts of this work we shall not now enter upon them   st that all lands should be let upon lease  we have often had occasion in the preceding pages to show the baneful consequences attending want of leases and how few real improvements will ever be introduced into the practice of agriculture so long as the farmer has no security for enjoying his possession more than one year we therefore recommend as a necessary step to encourage good farming that leases should be granted of a proper duration this would not only operate in favor of the farmer but would likewise be the means of increasing the rentroll of the proprietor for no man will ever pay as much for an acre of land while he is removable at pleasure as when a permanency is granted him upon all lands already in a state of cultivation we apprehend    or    years are very proper terms for the continuance of a lease they afford the farmer time and opportunity to make improvements and to receive a proper return for the money so laid out without depriving the landlord farther than necessary of any advantages that might arise to him from a progressive increase in the value of his grounds without this security no farmer will engage in any expensive or spirited management and the state of the country will remain for ever precisely as it is   d that covenants or restrictions should be discontinued  if leases are granted of a proper duration there will remain little occasion for covenants betwixt landlord and tenant or restrictions upon the management of the latter if it is thought necessary for protecting the landlords property to restrict the tenant for the three last years of the lease we see little harm that would arise either to individuals or the public from that measure our ideas of a lease are that it is a mere bargain betwixt landlord and tenant wherein the former for a valuable consideration conveys over to the latter all his rights in the premises for a specified number of years and that it ought to be left to the wisdom and abilities of the farmer to manage the land in such a manner as he may think most proper for enabling him to make good his engagements to the landlord if leases were granted upon these principles a great deal of unnecessary trouble would be saved to both parties improvements would increase with rapidity and the peace comfort and happiness of that useful body of men the farmers be materially promoted  our opinions upon the clauses that should be inserted in a lease are plain and simple and we beg leave to state what the heads should be  landlord agrees for a specified rent to be paid at the terms of candlemas whitsunday and lammas after the crop is off the ground to set such a portion of land for    years and to put all the houses offices and enclosures upon the premises in habitable and fencible situation  tenant agrees to pay rent as aforesaid and to forfeit his lease if payments are not made within six months after they fall due with interest for the intervening time to manage the land in a husbandlike manner and not to sell straw or dung off the premises to support all the houses and fences during the continuance of the lease and to leave them at its expiration in a habitable and fencible condition to leave one fourth of the farm in grass at least three years old and likewise a sixth part of the remainder as fallow to the incoming tenant upon allowance being made him by valuation of neutral persons and if any difference arise either during the lease or about the situation of the houses and fences at the conclusion such difference to be referred to arbitrators mutually chosen if land was set agreeably to this method the management of an estate would comparatively be an easy task to what it is at present and while no injury was done to the landlord the condition of the farmer from being uncertain would be respectable and happy  we may offer another argument for meliorating the situation of the farmer and that we hope is a laudable one without a lease and bound up with fetters on every hand his interest in the welfare or prosperity of his country is not equally strong whatever takes place a shorter lease than an annual one cannot be granted in a few words the best security for the peaceable deportment of any man is to place him in a situation that will be much affected by a change  the farmers over great britain are a numerous body of men and in every agricultural county their influence over the lower ranks must and will be considerable we speak from our feelings when we say their general situation well deserves attention if landlords neglect their own interest as well as that of the public and persist in setting land without lease and under absurd and pernicious restrictions the subject deserves to be taken up by the supreme legislature itself it may be asked would you interfere with private property and restrain individuals from managing their own concerns as they saw fit certainly if that management is detrimental to the public good to compare great things with small  parliament have already interposed their authority in a case nearly similar by the act of regulating the number of outside fares upon stage coaches commonly called mr gamons act the legislature very laudably interfered with the management of private property in order that the lives of the passengers might not be sacrificed for private gain the only difference in the two cases would be that in the one the coachmans profit was lessened by the regulation whereas in the other the income of the landed proprietor would be increased by enforcing the measure now recommended  we neglected to mention in its proper place that the period fixed for the farmers removal is both improper and inconvenient  we believe that candlemas is the general term over the west riding and that the incoming tenant then enters to the farm precisely in the state it stands that the wheat and grass sown for that crop and all the labor by that time performed immediately becomes his upon paying his predecessor the value of the labor manure and seed expended we apprehend if these articles can be properly ascertained there is no injustice done to the outgoing tenant as he would receive the same advantages at his entry it might however happen from this custom that a farmer would never cut the crop he had sown himself for where he had no lease an unlucky concurrence of accidents might give him an annual removal at any rate the practice is not eligible for it cannot be supposed that after a warning is given the outgoing tenant is to pay the greatest attention to the ploughing or sowing a crop he is not to reap besides it interferes with the time for which servants are hired and if a person cannot find another farm at once what is he to make of them we are also of opinion that it is not the best time of the year for disposing of stock we look upon the custom of removing from the houses at whitsunday and the last crop belonging to the outgoing tenant as practiced in scotland to be far more convenient and advantageous to both parties as it does not oblige the incoming tenant to have any unnecessary interference with the property of his predecessor  tithes  the commutation of tithes has been long and ardently wished for by every real friend to the prosperity of his country and till this is accomplished agriculture must always struggle with great difficulties we would be the last persons that would wish to injure private property of any kind or trench upon the rights of so respectable a body as the church of england whose learning character and merit require no fresh eulogiums but surely if the mode of collecting that property is injurious to the public welfare and detrimental to its prosperity some other method ought to be devised by which this tax might be paid without occasioning such injury  we have heard of many plans for reforming the tithe system and all are attended with considerable difficulties we are decidedly against giving land in lieu of them as there is too much land in mortmain already in the kingdom we shall mention two schemes any of which will remove the obstacle occasioned by tithes to improving agriculture and will be attended with beneficial consequences to the titheholders themselves   st let all the tithes be valued by proper persons in each parish under the authority of a board instituted for that purpose this valuation to remain unalterable and be the rule of payment in all time coming this would make proper compensation to the holders whether laymen or ecclesiastics and would remove the complaints of those who compare the present mode of payment to the taille or old land tax of france which was collected by the different intendants according to the goodness of the crop   dly there is another plan which we think best of after the tithes are valued as aforesaid let them be offered to the respective proprietors of land at  0 years purchase which every man who knows his own interest would gladly accept in order to be quit of them the purchasemoney where they belonged the clergy to be vested in government stock in name of the particular parish from whence it is produced and the interest regularly paid to the incumbent where tithes are the property of laymen the purchasemoney might be immediately paid into their own hands  considering the subject in a moral point of view every well disposed person must lament that the collection of a tax purposely given for the support of religion should be the means of creating disrespect for its ministers there are no arguments necessary to prove that where the clergyman differs with his parishioners upon this subject the usefulness of his office is totally frustrated which makes not only the practice but even the profession of religion be disregarded  division of the common fields and waste grounds  the common fields in the west riding afford greater scope for practical improvements than any other department of its husbandry and are at present generally under most wretched management this the proprietors must be sensible of but the expense of a particular act of division intimidates many from applying to parliament for its interposition it would therefore be of great utility that a general bill was passed for that purpose as is already the case in scotland leaving it to the judge ordinary of the bounds to put it in execution when application for that purpose was made by any of the proprietors it would be necessary in this bill to define the extent of manorial rights and to settle the proportion to be allowed for tithes in case they are not previously regulated if the fields are divided we see no necessity to force the proprietor to enclose whether he will or not as is done at present in consequence of the powers vested in the commissioners appointed to execute the respective enclosure bills if the proprietor is attentive to his own interest he will do it himself without compulsion and at the same time do it more frugally than when it is executed under a public commission  with regard to the waste grounds which are very extensive they ought to be divided wherever they are common at present they are of very little profit to the different proprietors being in general vastly overstocked unless where they are stinted pastures which is not frequent if each persons proportion was duly ascertained he could manage his own part as he saw most conducive to his interest if it was worth while he would enclose and improve if it answered for planting he might improve it in that manner or he would manage it as uninclosed moors have hitherto been treated in other parts of the kingdom  as we have mentioned the scots laws for dividing commons we give the following extract of the act of parliament passed in      for regulating that business  all commons excepting those belonging to the king in property or royal burghs in burgage may be divided at the instance of any individual having interest by summons raised against all persons concerned before the lords of session who are empowered to discuss the relevancy to determine upon the rights and interests of the parties concerned to divide the same amongst them and to grant commission for perambulating and taking all other necessary probation to be reported to the lords and the process to be ultimately determined by them declaring that the interest of the heritors having right in the common shall be estimated according to the valuation of their respective lands and properties and that a portion be adjudged to each adjacent heritor in proportion to his property with power to the lords to divide the mosses if any be in the common among the parties having interest or in case they cannot be conveniently divided that they remain in common with free ish and entry whether divided or not  introducing more approved rotations of crops  if leases of a proper duration are not to be granted and if the practice of binding up tenants with strict covenants is continued it would be perfectly unnecessary to suggest any improvement in the mode of cropping the ground as however willing the farmer may be to adopt new practices he is in a manner prohibited from doing so by the conditions under which he holds his possession but entertaining the sanguine expectations that these invincible obstacles to good husbandry will soon be removed we proceed to point out such alterations as in our humble opinion are proper to be introduced into the husbandry of the district  viewing the present state of farming in a general manner it appears that the land in the west riding is cultivated in two separate and distinct ways and not managed so as to make improvements in one branch contribute to the advantage of the other the fields which are laid down in grass continue in a state of pasture a greater number of years than is necessary for refreshing them after being exhausted with corn crops while the fields kept under the plough are hackneyed and worn out by successive crops of corn without receiving any collateral assistance but what is given them by fallow and manure with some passing clover crops  we consider it as essential to good husbandry to connect these different systems and that the ground in no other way can be kept in a perpetual state of fertility and made to produce its utmost value while we decidedly condemn the keeping land exclusively in grass we as warmly reprehend the contrary extreme of persisting uniformly in raising crops by the plough the last named practice may be said to have necessity upon its side whereas no excuse can be offered as a palliation for the other  upon the supposition that the system of keeping lands continually in grass will be departed from and that the farmer will be allowed to cultivate his fields in such a way as he thinks most beneficial we shall give our opinion upon the most advantageous method of cropping a farm or in other words show how it may be kept in continual good order so as to enable the possessor to pay the highest rent while at the same time it is understood he is to receive a proper recompense for the expense and labor he is at in cultivating it  the first thing that is absolutely necessary for farming land well is to lay it clean and dry where land is foul carrying either quickens or other weeds it is impossible artificial plants such as corns and grasses can thrive the ground is bound up and the food that should go for the support of the plants sown by the husbandman is exhausted by these natural inhabitants of the ground the crops therefore are scanty being stinted in their produce and inferior in their quality every good farmer will therefore use his earliest efforts to make his land clean this he will do by complete summer fallows or by fallow crops adapted to the different soils he possesses and having once accomplished his purpose he will studiously endeavor to preserve it in the same husbandlike order  that land may be kept clean a powerful assistant is gained from having it previously laid dry or in a proper situation for carrying off the superfluous water that falls upon it from the clouds or rises from the veins of the earth by springs or from being situated upon a wet spongy bottom this is done by ridging the land sufficiently high for defending it against falls of rain by casting out the water furrows provincially griping the land and by digging hollow drains which when covered carry off the superabundant moisture and occasion no loss of ground these two things laying the land dry and keeping it clean are in the power of every farmer although they are more difficult to execute in some situations than in others but there is another principle requisite for bringing farming to its greatest improvement which is to keep the land also rich this is often not in the power of the best farmer to command and must in a great measure be regulated by local situation or by the particular quality of the land he possesses  having premised these things which we consider to be the fundamental principles of good farming we shall now throw out our ideas upon the way in which a farm should be managed and the particular crops most advantageous to be raised upon different soils  upon all gravelly sandy and sharp soils allowing there may be a degree of hardness in them we recommend the turnip husbandry to be assiduously practiced upon such soils turnips may be introduced every fourth or fifth year in those parts where cutting the clover crop for hay is attended with profit they come in with propriety every fourth year but in many situations we judge it as advantageous in place of sowing the barley crop with red clover to sow it with white clover trefoil and rye grass and to pasture it for two years with sheep as red clover is found from experience not to answer well when too often repeated this gives the ground a proper cessation from tillage invigorates its powers prepares it for carrying a weighty crop of oats with very little collateral assistance from manure and allures nature with variety which is always agreeable  a farm managed in this style will consist of five bricks or parts  st turnips the first half of the turnips that are consumed to be sown with wheat the last half with barley and both sown with grass seeds pastured the third and fourth years with sheep and limed if thought necessary upon the sward or with the turnip crop as is thought most advantageous fifth year broke up for oats which will always be found in this way a profitable crop  a farm managed in this manner and the west riding land from being mostly enclosed is admirably calculated for it will pay both proprietor and farmer better than most other soils expenses of management which is a great consideration are comparatively trifling and no foreign manure when once the rotation is properly arranged will ever be needed  the same mode of cropping although not with equal advantages may be carried on upon all loamy soils unless they have too great a portion of clay in them but if the farm is of a mixed nature and has both dry gravel and loam in it we recommend that the turnip brick may be so arranged as to take in both soils and that those upon the loam be eaten off first and the land ridged up immediately which will both lay it dry and afford opportunity for correcting the stiffness and adhesion it may have contracted by the pressure and poaching of the sheep  upon land where clay is a principal component part or where the bottom is wet we cannot recommend the cultivation of turnips at all as often the profit gained from them is lost upon the following crops the same objection holds against cabbages rape or any other plants that are to be eaten off in the winter months  lands of this nature are more difficult to manage than those already described and from being cultivated at a greater expense are never able to afford so much rent to the proprietor allowing the crops raised upon them should be as productive as those raised upon the dry soils beans is the only crop that can be introduced for cleaning the ground but although these are an excellent assistant they can never preclude a complete summer fallow from being absolutely indispensable  a farm of this sort ought to be divided into seven bricks or parts and the following rotation is in our opinion most advisable   fallow with dung   wheat   beans drilled and horse hoed   barley sown with grass seeds   pasture   pasture   oats   in order that a proper season for sowing the wheat upon such soils may not be missed we recommend it to be sown by the middle of september crops early sown though they never yield proportionably to their bulk yet are generally most productive per acre and it is an important matter upon all clay soils that the seed should be put in dry wet harrowing not only dibbles in the seed beyond the power of vegetation but also poaches and binds the land by which the plants are prevented from stooling or tillering and gives an encouragement to the growth of any quicken that may be left in the ground the beans should get two furrows the first across and particular pains afterward taken to waterfurrow the land the seed should be put in as early as possible after the land is in a situation to stand a second ploughing as the quantity and quality of the crop depend much upon an early seed time barley may be sown after two furrows as if proper attention has been given to the bean crop the preceding year the ground should be in good order and spring ploughing upon clay land is always critical  in the above rotation a proper arrangement of labor is made for the whole season the part destined for wheat is prepared during the summer months the first furrow given for the beans as soon as the wheat is removed next the barley land is fallowed down then one of the pasture fields ploughed for oats and the first furrow given to the next years summer fallow this concludes the winter operations and in the spring begin with the bean seed next sow the oats and finish with the barley seed which concludes the work of the season and allots to each particular period a proper quantity of work without hurrying too much at once which ought always to be regarded especially upon clay soils as a material object  the thin poor clays are the most difficult to farm of any kind of land and nothing can be done upon them to the purpose without the aid of a superior quantity of manure to what can be raised upon the premises at same time it is perfectly unnecessary to lay a great quantity of manure of any kind upon them at once for they possess a quality so corroding that the aid so given to vegetation is soon wasted and lost where local situation will allow we recommend such land to be kept in   bricks and cropped as follows   fallow   wheat   oats   pasture   oats   this rotation will pay very well if manure can be got sufficient to cover the fallow brick the pasture should lie only one year as land of this kind does not improve in grass and the oats will be found superior in such a case than if the grass had been older  in order that the rotations above recommended be followed out to the utmost advantage it is absolutely necessary to pay particular attention to the fallow or the turnip crop substituted in its place as many different opinions prevail relative to the manner in which a fallow should be conducted we beg leave to state our sentiments upon that head  upon all clay soils and upon such only we understand a complete summer fallow to be necessary the first ploughing ought to be given during the winter months or as early in the spring as possible which promotes the rotting of the sward and stubble this should be done by gathering up the ridge which both lays the ground dry and rips up the furrows as soon as seed time is over the ridge should be cloven down preparatory to cross ploughing and after lying a proper time should be harrowed and rolled repeatedly and every particle of quickens that the harrows have brought above should be carefully picked off with the hand it is then proper to ridge or gather it up immediately which both lays the land in proper condition for meeting bad weather and opens up any fast land that may have been missed in the furrows when the cross ploughing was given after this harrow roll and gather the root weeds again and continue so doing till the field is perfectly clean  we observe that the celebrated mr marshall in his treatise upon the yorkshire husbandry recommends a practice quite different in his opinion ploughing is only necessary and taking out live roots by the harrow and carrying them off is an evident impropriety mr marshall lately used similar arguments to one of us who had the pleasure of a personal conversation with him we shall therefore do our best endeavors to obviate his arguments  frequent turning over the ground although absolutely necessary while the process of fallowing is going on can never eradicate quickens couchgrass or other root weeds in all clay soils the ground turns up in lumps which the severest drought will not penetrate or at least not so far as to kill the plant contained in the heart of them when the land is ploughed again these lumps or clods are simply turned over and no more and the action of the plough serves in no shape to reduce them or at least in a very imperceptible manner if ever there was a season for making good fallow by ploughing it was last year viz      there was hardly a drop of rain the whole summer the drought was excessive and attended with an almost continued sun shine notwithstanding all these advantages the fallows which were not properly reduced in the beginning of the season took on a growth as soon as moisture came about the beginning of harvest even when they were completely harrowed and rolled it was found difficult to extirpate couch as the dryness of the ground did not allow it to part so well from the clod as in seasons more moist  if this was the case in such a dry season as last what would the consequences be if the fallows were at all times to be wrought with the plough without attempting to drag the roots to the surface by the operation of harrowing in wet weather the land might appear black above for a few days but the enemy being still in the house would soon make his appearance by carefully gathering all the root weeds when the land is reduced by harrowing which on many soils is only practicable after the roller is used an enemy is converted into a friend for if the stuff so gathered is accumulated into a heap frequently turned over till it rots and mixed with lime a most excellent compost is produced  there is very little danger that clay land will ever be too much reduced by the different harrowings and rollings proposed to be given as the last furrow if taken deep will raise a mould sufficient for covering the seed and for protecting the wheat during the winter upon such soils nothing but frost will reduce and mellow the land perfectly and we have seen the necessity of leaving fields of this description to be wrought in the spring from the absolute impossibility of eradicating or killing the couch till reinforced by this powerful auxiliary  we shall just mention another argument in favor of gathering root weeds  that in no other way can the purpose for which fallowing is intended be so cheaply attained every furrow that is given will at least stand the farmer   s per acre and if hand gathering will save one single ploughing its expense is amply repaid while at same time we contend that more root weeds are taken off by gathering them once than will be destroyed by a couple of ploughings allowing the season to be ever so favorable  we have heard of some other writers that condemn clean summer fallow altogether as an unnecessary waste of rent and labor which in their opinion might be saved and the ground kept in perfect good order by a proper rotation of crops we apprehend upon all clay soils this is impossible as every farmer who possesses such soils knows by experience the difficulty of keeping them clean even with the assistance of summer fallows they are so often ploughed wet from necessity that a sourness and adhesion are contracted which cannot be corrected without exposing it to the hot summer sun and reducing it by frequent ploughing and harrowing no crop can be substituted in place of fallow for turnips are destruction itself drilled beans as is already said will do well as an assistant to fallow but however much this crop may tend to keep land clean that is already in good order we apprehend from the necessity of sowing them early they will never answer as a substitute for one of the most radical of all improvements  a clean summer fallow  but want of fallows is not the fault of the yorkshire husbandry there they prevail to a much greater extent than necessary and unless where turnips can be introduced occasion great drawback upon the farmers profits if good land be fallowed properly can it ever be supposed necessary to repeat it after carrying only wheat and beans when this practice is too often repeated it also loses much of its effects as the superior advantages arising from a first fallow are known to all farmers and while we condemn the system that would throw out the beneficial practice altogether we are as decidedly against an unnecessary repetition of it  sowing down land for pasture  we have in many places of this work described the manner in which the ground is sowed down for pasture and mentioned that hayseeds are the grasses most generally sown the quality and kind of these hayseeds are not easily ascertained for the very sowers of them in most cases are absolutely ignorant of their properties to us it appears they are sown in a wanton and unnecessary extent and that good pasture could be got from sowing grasses of other sorts the qualities of which are better known and which would be easier eradicated when the ground is broke up for tillage  the grasses that in our opinion are most profitable to the farmer for pasture are white clover trefoil and rye grass perhaps where sheep pasture is intended a small quantity of rib grass is not improper the quantities of the above seeds that we recommend for making at once a good and close bite are    lb white clover    lb trefoil and one bushel of well cleaned rye grass for a statute acre we are much mistaken if these will not at once fully cover the ground and from their springing at different periods fresh grass is always afforded to the stock the expense of sowing an acre in this way will upon an average of prices be from fifteen to sixteen shillings  where grass is intended for a hay crop very different management is required in this case thick sowing weakens the plants and deprives them of their vigor and strength    lb of red or broad clover and half a bushel of rye grass is prefectly sufficient and with these quantities we have often seen as strong grass as could stand clover by itself always makes bad hay although we are ready to acknowledge that rye grass is detrimental if wheat is intended to succeed but considering the clover as a crop intended for eating green or for making hay there is a necessity for giving it a body and strength by a small intermixture of rye grass and the above quantity is sufficient  it remains to mention that wherever grass seeds are sown it is indispensably necessary that the ground be in a proper state of culture and reduced as fine and equal as possible or else the one half of the seeds will be lost for want of attending to these precautions great loss is often sustained as not only the crops of grass are rendered small and scanty but a failure in this respect is detrimental to the succeeding rotation  drilling beans and turnips  the present mode of sowing beans and turnips broad cast is pernicious and renders two crops which are well calculated for cleaning the ground instruments of its destruction beans and turnips are the only two crops that can be drilled to advantage wheat barley and oats are found both better in quality and quantity when sown broad cast and the reasons are these  when drilled they are too much exposed to the weather and are liable to be broke down and thrashed with every gale besides they tiller or stool as long as any interval is left which necessarily causes the grain to be unequal while we are warm advocates for drilling and horsehoeing beans and turnips we cannot recommend the practice farther  we have reason to suspect that the intricate nature and expensive cost of a number of drill machines have deterred a number of farmers from adopting this mode of husbandry we venture to affirm that the simpler the machines are the better and that a bean drill which is made by every common wright for   s   d and a turnip one for about double the price sowing one row or drill at a time will be found of more real utility than all the expensive complicated patent machines in the kingdom  when beans are drilled we recommend an interval to be left of    or    inches and where turnips are meant as a complete fallow about  0 or    inches these admit a small plough drawn by one horse perfectly well which with the addition of the hand hoe is the cheapest and most effectual way of cleaning these crops  horsehoeing beans and turnips has this advantage that it is the fault of the farmer if his fields under these crops in the most adverse season be foul and dirty it is well known that beans from being an open plant at the root give opportunity to weeds thriving amongst them which in a dry season such as the last will ruin them altogether by horsehoeing the intervals at proper periods and running the hand along the drill they are constantly kept clean and a well managed field of them or turnips will necessarily be as clean as the same crops in a garden  breaking up the grass grounds  we have already mentioned that a considerable portion of the west riding is continually kept in grass and a stranger would be apt to think from the vigilance with which it is preserved that estates were entailed with that burden upon them as this exclusive system is in our opinion detrimental to the public we shall now attempt to show that breaking up these grass grounds could in no shape hurt the proprietor but on the contrary would materially promote his interest  does ploughing the ground in a proper manner reduce the natural value of the soil or in other words will it hinder land from carrying grass when it is laid down again so far from that it is often found necessary to convert pasture into tillage merely that better crops of grass may be afterward produced land when uniformly kept in one course tires for want of variety and a farmer might as well expect his land to carry wheat every year by the force of manure as look for grass of equal value for a continued space of time it is found that the two first years of grass when the land is sown down properly afford a greater return than the same number of subsequent years they are considerably earlier therefore of greater value and from the youthful vigor of the plants a large additional quantity of pasture is procured  but allowing for argument sake that the land when in grass continues in a progressive state of improvement still a considerable sum is lost to the proprietor from not ploughing his fields we hold that land after it has lain a certain number of years in grass is able to pay an extrarent this by continuing it in the same state is totally lost because if it were ploughed for some years and then sown down clean in good heart it would carry more grass than ever  a very great loss is sustained by the public from the practice of this exclusive system it requires no figures to show that by breaking up land at proper intervals a great deal more corn would be raised an additional quantity of manure procured for enriching barren soils and much employment consequently to the people at large these are important matters and should be seriously weighed by every proprietor who keeps his estate principally in grass  it may be asked if the grass grounds are broken up how are cattle to be fed for supplying the butcher we answer by laying down the old ploughed fields which would be as much benefited by a cessation from ploughing as the other renovated by it we apprehend as much grass would be raised in the way we are describing as ever while at the same time the quantity of corn would be greatly increased  with regard to the western parts of the riding where there is at present nothing but grass we are dubious whether we can recommend cultivation by the plough in the same extent the climate is wet and corn husbandry must be precarious but we are convinced of the propriety of raising as much as is necessary for supporting the inhabitants corn has already been cultivated there for all the low fields have at one time or other been ploughed and we suppose the climate would then be similar to what it is at present we have no doubt but that by sowing grain very early it might all be harvested in proper time fallow wheat might be sown by the end of august or first of september which with dutch or poland oats would always make an early harvest but before any of these rich fields can be broke up the tithe system must undergo a change as it would be a notable affair for a tithe holder to have a tenth of the weighty crops they would produce from respectable authority we learned that the payment of tithes was in a great measure the cause of laying these fields totally in grass and that they continue to operate as a prohibitory restriction against breaking them up  planting the wastes  if the wastes were divided we are fully convinced that much improvement might be made by planting scots firs and larches upon many parts of them these kinds of wood are at present held in little repute and are indeed scarcely known in the west riding as a great deal of fir wood is at present imported from the baltic they might in time render that in a great measure unnecessary they would answer for roofing cottages for fences and many other useful purposes the subject deserves attention and we are humbly of opinion that the far greatest part of the moors in this district can never be improved in any other way  conclusion we have now finished this report in the course of which we have been under the disagreeable necessity of attacking many practices and customs which we think pernicious and destructive to the improvement of agriculture while we have spoken upon these subjects in a style that may be probably thought warm we have never entertained the most distant idea of giving personal offense the proprietor may perhaps think at present that by withholding leases he gives no discouragement to agriculture and that covenants are necessary to prevent his property from being injured we have attempted to show the pernicious consequences these practices have upon agriculture and that it is impossible for the farmer to introduce solid improvements till these obstacles are removed  with regard to the tithe holders they are perhaps of opinion that the full value of them is as much their property as any landed freehold would be and therefore may stand justified in their own sight for a rigorous collection we have attempted to prove that a collection in kind or by an annual valuation is hurtful to agriculture by operating as a tax upon the farmer proportionally to his merit and abilities and that the public good requires that a general valuation of them should take place we have further shown that this valuation would not lessen the present amount of the tithes although it would prevent them from being a continued and increasing burden upon the possessors of land and that a payment in this manner would not only be conducive to the public good but also promote the welfare and utility of the clergy themselves  with regard to the interests of that useful body of men the farmers we have endeavored to show how much their situation would be meliorated and the practice of agriculture improved by the proprietors granting leases of a proper duration free of these useless restrictions and covenants that now subsist in agreements for land whether annual or for a greater number of years  these things we humbly submit to the consideration of the board of agriculture and we entertain the sanguine hopes if the improvements we have suggested are sanctioned by their approbation that this sanction will have great influence in correcting the abuses we have described and contribute to improve the husbandry of the west riding of yorkshire by which means the interest of the landed proprietor will be augmented the peace and happiness of the farmer increased and consequently the public good materially promoted  postscript a very ingenious paper upon the management of cows in the neighborhood of london has been laid before the board of agriculture by baron dalton a foreign nobleman and from the accurate calculations therein given it appears keeping cows in the house is more profitable husbandry than pasturing them in the fields as is commonly done during our survey of the west riding we made repeated inquiries whether any such practice prevailed in that district the result of which were it was only done by a few cowkeepers in towns who had little or no land by a letter received since our return from mr stockdale at knaresborough we were informed that this practice was common at leeds we therefore wrote to a gentleman there desiring him to inquire if it was found beneficial the following is a copy of his answer  leeds jan         sir there are a few cows kept in the house all summer and the way in which they are managed is by giving them grass fresh cut and watering the ground as the grass comes off with the urine from the cows the urine is preserved by a cistern placed on the outside of the cow house and is conveyed to the land at almost all seasons but the most profitable time for doing it is march april and may by which means and the addition of horse dung applied during the winter months the field may be cut   or   times during the season i am told   acres of land will in this method maintain  0 cows and the winter they are fed with grains from the brewers which are very high in price being   s   d per quarter it will take about four pounds worth of grains to maintain a cow for the winter months and two pounds for grass during the summer so the expense of a cow for the whole year is about six pounds  i kept    cows one winter which were fed upon turnips and oat straw and never got a mouthful of hay they yielded me  0 gallons of milk per day which six years ago sold upon the spot to the retailers from leeds at   d per gallon they carried it a mile and sold it out at   d and   d per gallon but it is now advanced to   d and   d  i must notice to you that the taste of the turnip is easily taken off the milk and butter by dissolving a little nitre in spring water which being kept in a bottle and a small teacup full put among   gallons of milk when warm from the cow entirely removes any taste or flavor of the turnip  in the management of cows a warm stable is highly necessary and the currying them like horses not only affords them pleasure but makes them give their milk more freely they ought always to be kept clean laid dry and have plenty of good sweet water to drink i have had cows giving me   gallons of milk at a meal when within  0 days of calving and did not upon trial find any advantage by allowing them to go dry two months before calving the average of our cows is about   gallons per day after quitting the calf  if this statement affords the board of agriculture any information worthy their notice i will be happy at being the instrument of it and all i have said is from experience you have my sincere wish for the laudable work you are engaged in being crowned with success and i am etc   in addition to the above very sensible letter we may add that one of us for some years has kept his cows in the house upon red clover and rye grass during the summer months they are put out to a small park in the evening after milking for the convenience of getting water and tied up in the house early in the morning one acre of clover has been found to go as far in this way as two when pastured more milk is produced and the quantity of rich dung made in this method is supposed to compensate the additional trouble of cutting and bringing in the grass  appendix to the agricultural view of the west riding of yorkshire appendix no i account of the division of the forest of knaresborough by robert stockdale esquire the forest of knaresborough till the year      consisted of a great extent of ancient enclosed land comprised within eleven constableries or hamlets to which belonged a tract of upwards of  0000 acres of common whereon knaresborough and several other towns not within the eleven constableries claimed and had exercised a right of common and turbary equally with the owners of property within these eleven constableries this waste in its open state yielded the inhabitants fuel and pasturage for their sheep horses and stock of young cattle and some opulent yeomanry profited exceedingly thereby but to the necessitous cottager and indigent farmer it was productive of more inconvenience than advantage if not to themselves at least to the public at large who was by that means deprived in a great measure of the exertions of the farmer and the labor of the cottager and their families for it afforded their families a little milk yet they would attempt to keep a horse and a flock of sheep the first enabled them to stroll about the country in idleness and the second in the course of every three or four years were so reduced by the rot and other disasters that upon the whole they yielded no profit  in    0 after various struggles an act was obtained to divide and enclose this extensive waste and the powers thereof committed to no less than five commissioners and three surveyors all or most of them unequal to the undertaking from whom both great delay and expense were incurred after four years had elapsed an amendment of this act became necessary which was obtained in      thereby a sixth commissioner was named who had been appointed a surveyor by the first act and who had thought proper to execute his duty by a deputy in      the commissioners made out a description of their intended allotments and in or about the year      they executed their award which unfortunately is deficient in every essential requisite but with all these inconveniences the generality of proprietors to whom allotments were made and particularly the small ones set about a spirited line of improvement the poor cottager and his family exchanged their indolence for active industry and obtained extravagant wages and hundreds were induced to offer their labor from distant quarters laborers of every denomination carpenters joiners smiths and masons poured in and met with constant employment and though before the allotments were set out several riots had happened the scene was now quite changed for with all the foreign assistance labor kept extravagantly high and the work was executed defectively and in a few years many enclosures almost prostrate and of course required making a second time all these circumstances taken together were a heavy load upon the allotments and in general rendered them very dear purchases the forest however got in a great measure cultivated and rendered a wonderful increase of product to the public though at the expense of individuals a public or turnpike road was opened through the center of the forest which opened an easy communication between knaresborough and skipton in craven and the manufacturing towns in the northeast of lancashire and though scarce a single cart was before seen in the market of skipton not less than  00 are weekly attendant on that market at present  in consequence the product is increased beyond conception the rents more than trebled and population advanced in a very high degree indeed the lands both ancient and those newly enclosed being exonerated from tithe a full scope was given to spirited cultivation and to the credit of small proprietors they took the lead and brought their small shares first into the completest state of cultivation i wish it was in my power to say as much of the large proprietors but facts will not warrant it on the contrary i know of very few men of independent fortune or others to whom large tracts were either assigned as their stipulated share or acquired by purchase under the clause for sale to defray the expense of the act who have made any improvement or scarcely effectually ringfenced their property  many impediments prevented their activity first what was to be done must be committed to the care of servants or agents secondly the extravagance of wages by reason of the want of inhabitants and above all the impossibility of letting large tracts as farms where it must be a series of years before any returns could be expected or even winter provision obtained for their working horses these obstacles operated to a total neglect or desertion and in consequence large tracts indeed at this hour are in their wild uncultivated state  it i may be allowed to offer my sentiments how to turn these tracts to better advantage i should advise building a number of cottages with suitable small outbuildings and laying to each not more than  0 acres of land tempt individuals by suffering them to live rentfree for the first seven years but obliging them to break up two acres annually till the whole was improved then fix a reasonable rent and add  0 acres more for the me term and conditions and so proceed gradually till the whole of such part as would admit of cultivation was gone through the land thus improved would be considered by the inhabitants as the work of their own creation and nothing but cruel treatment by their landlords would drive them away in a few years population would improve and that once locally obtained every other difficulty would vanish  several considerable tracts of this forest have fallen to my lot both as assignments in right of former property and by purchase most of them were of the worst strata being either confined bogs or cold steril clay mixed with white sand and the surface pared off for fuel little profit could be expected from such kind of property but nevertheless i attempted improvements which many condemned me for and i frankly confess my expectations were not gratified though i still flatter myself my efforts are not wholly useless as my errors may probably enable others to benefit by shunning the like plan  i will state the means i first took and then point out the errors or propriety of them and afterward give a short account of my present mode of management  when i first took possession of the clay parts so injured as stated by being pared for fuel i was eager to get my ringfences completed and thereby was led to give extravagant wages and by employing strangers had them badly executed these men wanting subsistencemoney while completing a contract were generally in advance before their labor and rarely finished them even in their own defective mode and the work particularly stone fences was to do over again this was folly i then purchased oxen to plough with and ploughed as deep as possible by which means stones were ploughed up where none were expected which would have made the fences and saved a great deal of the former expense of leading from a distance had i now to begin i should first plough as deep as i could with oxen collect the stones raised thereby and make a broad case of a fence at least  0 inches and raise the wall no higher than the stones would serve to surround the allotment and rest satisfied therewith till the next ploughing whereby more stones would arise which i would use in raising the wall gradually to its proper height by this means the walls would be more substantial and raised at onethird of the expense  after the first deep ploughing i left it in that state a year exposed to frost and heat then harrowed well and ploughed across and added three chaldron or nearly  00 bushels of lime per acre to make the land fall and correct the acidity and in the spring following sowed with oats after a third ploughing and the next year pease or vetches then fallowed and limed as before and took two crops to each fallow so limed until i found the repetition of lime did harm instead of being of advantage in place of this i now take one crop to each fallow have better crops and save two guineas per acre by withholding the lime which cost me    s per chaldron by this means i get only six crops in twelve years but which produce more than eight crops by the other mode keep the land in better condition and save eight guineas before expended on lime probably lime may be again necessary at a future day but i am confident that with some sorts of lime you may use it till the land will neither produce corn nor grass the quality of lime varies much we have two sorts one burnt near ferrybridge and another at and near knaresborough where the heaps of the first are laid there is always the best crop but where the heaps of the other are laid you will frequently find the land steril for several years the first sort is burnt from compact strong stone the other from a porous marly stone at proper intervals i sow with grass seeds eat them the first year with sheep and lay all my foldyard compost on the grass except where some small parcels that will grow turnips demand it but this kind of clay land will neither answer well long in tillage nor in grass but must be frequently changed by treating this cold clay soil in this mode building small houses and barns and working with oxen i have improved the land so as to be able to let it at  0 s per acre but i must observe that had it been titheable the tithe alone would have utterly precluded my efforts for the value of the tithe would often have been more than my profit  in making my subdivisions i divided them into  0 enclosures as nearly as possible and the year preceding the planting quick wood or white thorns i prepared the ground where the fences were intended by frequent ploughings and planted potatoes in the autumn after these were gathered i made a ditch breasted the caw with stones and planted the wood behind the caw taking care to have the ditch on the higher side of the fence so as to intercept the water before it reaches the roots of my quickwood and as warmth and shelter are desirable seize in all high exposed situations within my fences i make a border plantation about  0 feet wide fence this off with quickwood and also fill my subdivision fences with forest trees most adapted to the soil for though these may ultimately prove injurious both to the fences and the land yet when that begins to be the case they are easily taken down and serve for stakes and bindings when the hedges require cutting as water is not always to be had in every situation where it is wanted i make a square or round pond where the fences intersect one another so as to make one pond serve to supply four closes thus plan of agricultural enclosures  by this means i can either plough or pasture any close without inconvenience and if the strata be ever so open or porous yet other ponds are easily made retentive by digging them deep then laying a covering of lime or lime ashes at the bottom and sides which will prevent worms and moles working afterward puddle it well with earth and water and when that is got dry pave with small stones the inlets out of each close for the cattle to drink at and then open ditches to let water into the ponds and if well executed they will afford a due supply of water during any dry season a farm of this unkindly soil and high situation will turn to best account in having it occupied in regular courses of onethird arable onethird meadow and the remainder pasture stocked with young breeding stock and by changing the land from meadow to pasture and pasture to arable in due succession and always wintering as much or more stock than you can support in summer you will of course raise considerable portions of dung and thereby ultimately improve the soil this plan is however to be far exceeded in rapid improvement where inhabitants abound so as to enable you to let your property in small parcels by building small yet such buildings as are calculated to answer the purpose of any established manufactory  in the cultivation of my boggy allotments i was equally erroneous in my first outset for i rushed hastily to effect a drainage and pursued the advice and plan of one very well versed in that operation where the defects were only surface water or day springs my drains were judiciously placed well cut properly filled and ample bottom apertures left but unfortunately the nature of the springs or water was of the same hard incrustinating quality as the dropping well at knaresborough and this soon adhered to the sides and every obstructing particle within the drains so as to block them up i was then obliged to open them and suffer them to remain open at least for a considerable time even some of them yet emit such hard water as not to allow of covering this occasioned much expense and some delay but having got the surface water off i pared and burnt and took rape or turnip and a succession of oats and fallow till i could get it into a state for grass and then i sowed such parts as were become firm by draining with hay seeds and a species of clover called cow grass being our native honeysuckle grass which is perennial and having a solid stem does not contain so much fixed air as red clover and consequently never blows cattle  in this state it has remained eight or ten years is very good pasturage and will even feed a scotch bullock such parts as were too boggy to be totally corrected i have made into willow garths and plantations of other aquatics which thrive tolerably well and in a few years i have no doubt will yield considerable profit i still keep draining them where defects appear and when i am fully convinced the covered drains will not require opening again and that the land will bear the operation of the plough i will turn the swarth down roll and then sow with oats before i harrow afterward harrow the seeds in and roll again the next autumn winter fallow and in the succeeding spring prepare the land for turnips and in the year following if the land is sufficiently clean sow oats and hay seeds cow grass and white clover and then convert it to pasturage  when the land which is of a loose black earth was last in turnips it happened to be a very frosty hard winter yet i observed that the turnips that grew thereon were less affected by the weather and lasted good longer in the spring than any that grew on much better soils and this i have since often noticed on land of the same quality in other situations  no ii account of the vale of skipton in a letter from a gentleman in that neighborhood nov  th     gentlemen it would have given me particular pleasure as a sincere wellwisher to your undertaking if i could have acquitted myself more successfully in the inquiries you honored me with but i shall give you the best information in my power  with regard to the ancient state of this vale i do not find upon inquiry that there has been any material alteration or improvement for the last century or more in some parts of craven though not near this town i understand that even within the last forty years there was a considerable portion of land in tillage the ploughing was then performed by four or six oxen and one or two horses and i am informed that mode of husbandry answered very well craven was then famous for a breed of long horned cattle particularly oxen but since the introduction of scotch cattle and grazing into the country the long horned breed and of course the tillage has been neglected one cause of this is the easy expense that attends this mode of husbandry with one servant and two horses a farmer can very conveniently manage seven or eight hundred acres of land indeed most of the grazing farms in this vale are very large often three or four are united under one occupier  the earl of thanet is the principal proprietor of land in skipton and i am told is not willing that his fine land should be ploughed but it would certainly be a great advantage to the neighborhood if a proper mixture of grazing and tillage could be introduced for though the country is not or ever will be populous while the present mode of husbandry and monopolizing farms prevail yet corn is generally higher in craven than in most parts of the kingdom because so very little is produced if you suggest to them that the uplands may be kept in tillage the reply is that they are so much exposed to mists and the situation so cold that corn particularly wheat cannot feed or ripen this may be in part just but the stronger reason with them seems to be that the uplands are very useful to them upon their present plan to prepare the lean cattle for the better pastures which some say would be too rich for them in that state nor would their improvement at first be equal to such keeping  the extent of the vale of skipton cannot be accurately ascertained indeed a very small part bears that name being generally included in the vale of the river air which extends from leeds in a northwest direction to the source of the river about thirtyfive miles is upon the average about a mile broad in some places more yet not so much i think as to add a quarter to the average grazing is the general mode of occupation in this vale except in the neighborhood of the manufacturing towns where convenience will command a higher rent than the grazier can afford to pay six pounds per statute acre and sometimes more will be given for land in such situations  grazing will not answer to half that price  the greatest improvement i hear of is in the mode of draining which is now done with stones above and below and walled with them on each side the price of this work for a yard deep is about   s   d per rood of seven yards including the stones a cart load of which will complete a rood and is worth about   d at the quarry there is likewise a kind called a shoulder drain practicable only in clay lands which is made by using a narrower pointed spade at the bottom which leaves a kind of shelf or shoulder on each side to prevent the earth with which it is filled from falling to the bottom the uppermost spadeful is first laid in with the turf downwards it is then filled with the mould the surplus as there is always some is either made into a compost with lime or spread immediately upon the land the price of this sort of draining is about   d per rood at a yard deep and so on in proportion the drains before these abovementioned were introduced were usually covered with brushwood or perhaps straw or rushes  it is worthy of notice as it appears to me of great service to the land as well as very profitable to the occupier that most of the principal graziers take all their stock out of some of their best pastures in the beginning of july and put nothing in them till about michaelmas when they are equal or superior to the best fog indeed they call this fogging their pastures the favorite grazing stock here are the black scotch cattle some sheep but on the lowlands very few and on the uplands and moors not very numerous  it is much to be wished that the propagation of this useful and profitable animal was more attended to  price of labor a man servant about ten guineas per year with board and washing in his masters house a woman about five guineas with the same day laborers in husbandry about   s or   s   d per day finding their own victuals about ten years ago   s or   s   d was the common price the advance owing to the introduction of the cotton manufactory into a country so little populous they work from six to six in summer and from eight to dark in winter  price of provisions for the last year beef mutton veal and pork about   d per pound of    ounces butter about   s or   s   d per pound of    ounces wheat about   s per winchester bushel oats    or  0 s per quarter  the climate and weather are unfavourable we have sometimes very cold east winds in the spring for three months often to the middle or end of may in autumn we have very often heavy and continued rains from the west owing to our situation among so many hills from the same cause we have frequent thunder storms in summer  our roads are very much improved of late the canal which is carried through this valley seems to have taught us the possibility of making tolerably level roads even in a mountainous country several excellent ones have been made within the last five years the materials chiefly limestone broken to about the size of an egg  tithes are generally collected in kind and are very reluctantly and ill paid since the introduction of grazing into the country they are reduced in an astonishing degree the lands which are most profitable to the occupier are least or indeed not at all so to the clergyman  he must either submit to this or involve himself in a tedious and expensive law suit for agistment tithe perhaps against an obstinate and powerful combination of the farmers and landowners it is the opinion of the most intelligent people here that the present mode of collecting tithes is one principal cause of the high price of corn large quantities are continued in grass which would be ploughed to advantage if a certain and general commutation for tithes could be established i wish the above hints may be of any service to your business if you think me capable of further information i shall always be happy to contribute my assistance to so laudable an undertaking i am etc  no iii information received from messrs tweedal and noble stewards to mr beaumont relative to his woods and sheep  transmitted by mr thomas hague farmer at bullcliffe sheep the herefordshire sheep have had a better pasture than what the shetland sheep have had but they have not made so much improvement as might have been expected nor have they fatted their lambs so well as what a peniston ewe does upon the same ground we are of opinion that with a herefordshire tup and a peniston ewe there would be a good stock produced for this country of which we are making a trial it is also thought that their wool will be very good  the shetland sheep have improved a good deal in size but do not make themselves fat nor has their wool improved in fineness but has grown longer we are of opinion that these sheep are more adapted for mountainous countries or drier land than what it is about this neighborhood  woods it is the custom in this part of the country when a wood is ready to go down to set out and leave as follows viz  every    years poles supposed to be left for a future fall being judged to be  0 years old which in  0 years more it is supposed would be timber trees  left on an acre upon an average    0 trees supposed to be  0 years old left on an average per acre   0 timber trees supposed to be  0 years old at the time they are ready to go down judged to be taken down on an average per acre   0   reasons why the underwood is not kept cut quite down viz the brush or underwood would not turn to any profit except that it stands for    years and then it is taken down along with the timber for different uses such as binding hedges making riddles burning for charcoal and many other uses the trees that are left are at such a distance from one another that they do not prevent any thing from growing but what will pay in twenty years time but if the brush or underwood was kept quite cut down it would neither be so well for the timber and younger wood that method having been tried it was found that neither the wood nor the bark made so much improvement owing to its being starved in the bottom when the underwood was not admitted to grow a tree left for a future fall is chiefly one that grows from its own stem and what we call a lording and perhaps only forty years old which to stand twenty years more in general pays better than to take it down at that age it is supposed when a fall of wood is ready to go down that with the poles underwood etc it is worth fiftyfive pounds per acre upon an average the value of wood set out to stand for a future fall is judged at the time of its being left to be upon an average worth eighteen pounds per acre the woodlands in general if they should be quite cleared of all the wood underwood etc and put into cultivation which would be at an enormous expense it is supposed would only upon an average be worth five shillings per acre   it remains to be added as another reason for taking down wood in the manner we do that by this method we have wood for all sorts of customers and as such can dispose of it to more advantage and convenience the small wood is used for laths baskets puncheons for coal pits hedge stakes etc the larger for husbandry implements of every description the large timber for housecarpenters shipcarpenters coopers etc etc  leases  it is the general opinion that a notice for a tenant to quit a farm ought to be two years instead of six months which is the practice in this part of the country and it is thought it would be more proper that at the time a notice is given by the landlord or tenant that the farm should be looked over immediately and a valuation made of the same so that a farm should be kept in the same condition for the two years as what it was at the time the notice was given and that there should be an additional allowance for land which has been laid down for one two or three years if the same has been pastured with sheep or cattle for at present there is not any allowance made for laying down the land but only for what tillage has been laid thereon and if the land has been once mown since manuring then an allowance is only made for half tillage but should the land have been mown twice after manuring then not any allowance at all is made to the tenant  no iv letter from dr hunter of york dated dec        gentlemen when i had the pleasure of seeing you at york i remember that our conversation turned upon the use of rape dust as a manure which the farmers round aberford in the west riding of this county employ for their barley and wheat crops their land is a thin limestone the rent per acre is not considerable but lies at such a distance from any large town that if it were not for this article the farmers could not procure manure sufficient for their corn lands the quantity used is two quarters for barley and three quarters for wheat it is sown by hand and harrowed in with the grain if rain falls within a few weeks after sowing the barley the crop is generally good but if no rain falls the benefit of the dust is lost without any advantage being gained in the succeeding crop for wheat it is always a certain manure in consequence of the wet season that follows the sowing of that grain the price of rape dust is    s to    s per quarter but from the improvements made in the mechanical powers employed at the mills the dust is not so good as formerly i do not think that sufficient attention is paid to top dressings when the soil is light a large quantity may be obtained by putting sawdust on the floors of the necessaries which should also be receptacles for excrementitious substances of all kinds in large towns sawdust can be obtained at a low price moor earth may be employed as a substitute  my numerous avocations in the line of my profession deprive me of the satisfaction of gaining much practical knowledge in agriculture what little i know may be found in the georgical essays published a few years ago i am etc  n b in the neighborhood of tadcaster it is said that the rape dust is as good in quality as ever it was formerly bought for   s but that is now worth    s or    s per quarter it will answer for two or three following crops barley requires four quarters per acre which should be thrown upon the land early in the spring before the barley is sown if soon after christmas the better three quarters per acre is sufficient for wheat to be laid on when the wheat is sown  the rent of land where rape dust is used is in general from ten shillings and sixpence to eighteen shillings per acre  no v extract of a letter from wm pain esquire of frickley near doncaster dated nov  0      gentlemen i last week saw your queries on the state of agriculture in the west riding inserted in the doncaster paper and have taken the liberty of answering them according to your request in the address that precedes them and having understood that the indefatigable president of the board of agriculture was desirous of obtaining a detailed survey of england i shall principally confine my replies to your inquiries to the parish in which i reside frickley cum clayton and the extensive and populous one adjoining it northward south kirkby yet these answers will i believe generally apply to the whole tract of country lying between the market towns of doncaster rotheram pontefract barnsley and thorn in diverse parts of which district i have resided and practiced agriculture as a freeholder not having been without the means and inclination of acquiring some intelligence in many departments of its rural economy as a true friend to the solid prosperity of my country i am a sincere well wisher to its agriculture as the only sound basis of its real and permanent interest and though i do not wish manufacture in general to be depreciated yet i am convinced that if a considerable portion of the public industry and capital which for some years past has been applied to the manufacture of foreign materials had instead thereof been employed in the cultivation of our extensive wastes the profits on the whole of such employment to the public would have been immensely superior on this view of the subject the institution of a board of agriculture may be important to the national welfare if the public spirited activity of true patriotism abounds in its members but if there is not a degree of that liberal principle sufficient to promote and obtain some modification of certain impediments to the extension of our agriculture the attention of the board to any other means of exciting and encouraging rural industry will ultimately be contracted by the mere expedients of the day and the labors of its useful members prove in vain  the soil of this district is of three kinds with their varieties viz  st a dry loamy hazle soil on a rock of soft gritstone  d a wet or clay soil which abounds most here  d a fine dry loam on a rock of limestone i think the climate more favorable and mild than in some other parts of the county with less rain  nearly threefourths of the lands are employed in tillage the other fourth part is chiefly clay land meadow and pasture but the practice of ploughing old swards and laying new ones prevails on all the soils red and white clover trefoil with common hay seeds not of the best sort and sainfoin on the limestone soils are cultivated as grasses the common rotation of crops on the drier soils is  st turnips  d barley  d clover or beans  th wheat on the wet or clay soils  st fallow  d wheat  d oats  th wheat sometimes the course is  st fallow  d barley or oats  d clover or beans  th wheat which is generally esteemed the better course in a few instances potatoes and cabbages are cultivated in lieu of turnips  summer fallowing is universally practiced on the dry soils and good spring dressings on the drier ones for turnips etc turnips are generally sown broadcast but the expertness of our hoers sufficiently compensates for the want of drilling that excellent mode of cultivation the hoeing of turnips has been practiced in this part of the country upwards of thirty years being introduced about that time into the township of wath upon derne by that excellent cultivator wm pain of newhill grange my late honored father as it was to the county by that truly patriotic nobleman and benefactor to his country the late marquis of rockingham yet i am sorry to observe this most beneficial practice is still much neglected in some parts of this riding particularly in the neighborhood of thorn and hatfield  the manures used here are  st farmyard rotten muck from eight to twelve  horse cart load of which are applied to the statute acre of fallow  d ashes about eight loads per acre  d soot chiefly as a top dressing for wheat from twenty to thirty bushels per ditto  th bone dust and horn shavings from three to five quarters per ditto  th dove manure ditto  th soap ashes ditto  th rapedust ditto lime is generally employed as a manure for the first fallow after an old lay apparently with success at the rate of two or three chaldrons per acre my own practice for turnips is one chaldron of lime well mixed with the soil and six loads of fresh muck or three quarters of dove manure per acre with full success this compound manuring i think insures its due operation on the soil in most cases better than the simple one and has many other advantages the sheepfold is not used here except on turnips which are generally eaten on the land by sheep  the common sort of both broad and narrow wheeled carts with three or four horses are generally used with a few onehorse carts scarcely any other plough is seen than the common single one the work is almost entirely performed by horses very little use is made of oxen at present though where they are employed they are found to answer very well and i have no doubt of their superiority over the heavy draft horses in point of real utility to the farmer i have used a pair of oxen several years in harness like that of the horses working them at the plough and on the road in every respect as we use our heavy draft horses and as far as i can judge they are equal to them for use though the pride of the drivers will never allow it however in the stage of fattening them we are all agreed that their beef is preferable to the carrion of an old horse the advantage to the community of working oxen on farms is beyond dispute or calculation  a considerable proportion of the arable land is uninclosed to the great obstruction of agricultural improvement the advantages of enclosing are numerous and importtant the liberal occupier of enclosed land whose mind is actively employed in the improvement and increase of his produce with whom innovation has no fault but when it is useless this man on enclosed land has not the vis inertiae of his stupid neighbor to contend with before he can commence any alteration in his management that he is clearly convinced will be to his advantage he is completely master of his land which in its open state is scarcely half his own this is strongly evident in the cultivation of turnips or other vegetables for the winter consumption of cattle they are constantly cultivated in enclosures when they are never thought of in the open fields in some parts and i know no township in this riding except that of wath upon derne where the turnips are cultivated in any degree of perfection in open fields at that place they have long been wisely unanimous on the management of their common fields and in selling the whole turnip crop by a valuation to a person engaging to stock them entirely with sheep on the land but even there they cannot apply their own produce to the improvement of their own stock nor have they it in their power to vary their management by the introduction of any grasses for more than one crop in their rotation both essential articles when the improvement of live stock particularly sheep is in contemplation this argument for enclosure might be very amply dilated on were i writing a treatise instead of a letter for it is clearly of importance to the cause  common fields are frequent the difference of value at present between common field and enclosed land of similar quality is about onethird greater in favor of the latter but if the spirit of improvement was a little more awakened this difference would be greatly increased  there are large tracts of waste land in the neighborhood i may extend this remark to the whole county lands now utterly lost to the community even in this rich and populous riding and be it mentioned to the utter disgrace of every thing in the country that after a long period of years in which this island has depended on foreigners for a part of its necessary consumption these lands are still waste they are a complete nuisance to every occupier who has the misfortune to border upon them whose enclosures are certainly exposed to the inroads of their pining inhabitants which you scarcely guess to be sheep but for the bits of ragged wool they carry on their backs the feats of activity of these animals are such that no fence can prevent their performing them these wastes are certainly capable of every improvement by enclosure which is their sine qua non  the rate of wages is low the price of necessaries considered and hands for the purposes of agriculture in its present imperfect state are not wanting  paring and burning are practiced generally on the breaking up of old lays the expense of which is from    s to    s per acre  proper attention is paid to the draining of arable lands but i cannot so fully answer for it in other respects  few leases are granted and i rather think few are asked for the nature of the covenants between landlord and tenant has a general reference to law and custom which secure to the landlord quiet entry on due notice with recovery of damages if any be done to the farm and to the tenant on quitting a fair valuation of his property and labor in the ground as fallows crops manure etc etc being part of his stock in trade it is an article essential to a good and spirited agriculture and which cannot be too much insisted on that the farmer be scrupulously allowed on quitting his farm a fully and fairly appraised valuation of his stock in trade it forms a security and bond of entire confidence equally to landlord and tenant a security which sets all leases parchments bonds and seals at defiance it secures to the landlord the payment of his just demands with a certain improvement of his estate and to the tenant an easy mind under the application of his ingenuity industry and cash to the prospect of increasing his produce and ameliorating his farm i wish this matter was more attended to i have seen many painful deviations from justice in this respect to the great injury of the cause an act of the legislature might probably extend this real benefit and promote the improvement of the lands already enclosed more than millions expended in the way of premium etc  there is no other obstacle to improvement but the payment of tithes in kind an obstacle the effects of which upon agriculture might be much diminished if not entirely removed if the members of the board could unite their labors in so important a cause with a sincere zeal and regard for justice and the religion of christ the obstacles to the improvement and enclosure of waste lands in many places amount nearly to a prohibition viz  st the tithes the dislike of which with the freeholders etc makes a very difficult commutation the absolute condition of their concurrence  dly manorial claims and powers  dly the heavy expense and trouble of obtaining acts of the legislature to which may be added the caprice partial interest and disinclinatton to all improvement of some of the claimants in many cases all these obstacles might be much lessened by a law specifying and explaining the claims and limiting the powers of tithe and manorial proprietors in such manner that their simple opposition should not hang in terrorem over the very threshold of every such enclosure and also facilitating and encouraging such applications to the legislature perhaps a general act of enclosure upon a good plan might be a wise and seasonable measure to liberate the active improvers from the torpid dominion of indolence and stupidity however the government can scarcely do wrong in this matter except by suffering the wastes to remain as they are  entirely owing to one or all of the obstacles i have mentioned very few indeed of enclosing bills have passed these twenty years in the whole district comprised between the towns i mentioned above notwithstanding the value of the lands and the great scarcity and smallness of farms in the few instances that have occurred their beneficial consequences to the stock of public industry and produce have been conspicuous  no vi extracts from a letter written by a farmer in the neighborhood of pontefract  dated dec         gentlemen the land betwixt doncaster and ferrybridge is chiefly limestone or gravelly soil all along the road there are many open fields which are capable of great improvement by enclosing sowing grassseeds and pasturing with sheep  the present tenants are in general poor and the farms small poverty causes a kind of stupidity to take possession of them and i have often spent my time in attempting to convince them of their errors but though many of them may be convinced it is not in their power to get out of the old mode for want of the one thing needful  the lands i allude to are chiefly in tillage the labor of which and the necessary manure eats the poor tenant up i beg leave to refer you to the letter abovementioned for my opinions upon this head  westward of this road we have useful land that can feed cattle and breed good sheep mr sail has done much good in these respects some of us are following him as fast as we can in the dishley breed but he has got the lead and i wish him success for he deserves it  common hayseeds are going out of fashion with the best farmers and clovers and rye grass daily gain ground sainfoin is very useful in barren or poor lands and in good seasons as great crops of it are produced as we can have of other grasses upon our most fruitful soils happy it is for the occupiers of such land it was found out we have a very indifferent breed of cattle if gentlemen would send good bulls amongst their tenants and let them serve their cows gratis it would i think be the only probable means of attaining success in this most essential point  there is no land watered here but many situations are well adapted for that purpose i myself have  0 or  0 acres which i have long wished to float but as i have no lease the expense deters me i have been at dishley several times and am well satisfied as to the utility of watering grass land i have had thoughts of applying to mr bakewell for a man to superintend the work he is so great a friend to the public that i make no doubt but he would readily do any thing to forward such improvements but as i have already said the expense deters me  the succession of crops we have after fallows is barley clover and wheat turnips are taken wherever the land is proper for them but we have not much of that kind hereabouts upon strong lands we sow wheat after fallow then beans and conclude with wheat or oats tares are now coming in fashion  oxen are not much used for work here and never will become general they are thought too slow by the active farmer though i approve much of them thinking the question of them and horses to be an essential one as mr cully justly observes  there are many fields open over the country which would be far more valuable if enclosed also several common wastes to which the same observations will apply  the advantages arising from enclosing are obvious by an increase of labor and an increase of food both of which are for the public good it produces disadvantages to none unless it be a few individuals in the village where i live and where we have had no enclosure bills the increase of poors rates has been incredible i am not very old and can remember the time when we had only one poor woman upon us at   d a week but for these some years back the expense of supporting the poor has been from l   0 to l   0 a year and this chiefly paid by tenants not renting above l  000 all together  wages are much advanced i have two laborers which cost me not less than l  0 a year in short the expense of labor is become unsupportable draining is used often among us perhaps more might be done if it was not a heavy expense paring and burning are also used and are without doubt an excellent practice on some lands i have no notion it wastes the soil which is the chief objection our young agriculturalists have against it the expense is from  0 s to    s per acre  the modern farm houses and offices are much superior to those formerly built i would have every farmer reside in the middle of his farm and every house and homestead built in an uniform and convenient manner  leases are not universal enough for the encouragement of experimental agriculture and the nature of the covenants is according to the liberal or illiberal disposition of the landlord one will smile upon the arts and lead rural industry by the hand whilst another casts a damp upon the honest heart by oppression and clips the wings of rising genius  with regard to improvements some have the will but not the power to make them others the power but not the will nothing but numerous and repeated examples can influence the ignorant and stupid those who have the inclination but not the means should be assisted by their landlords and pay poundage for it where land is to be watered this should particularly be the case for it will enable the tenant to pay interest with a smile  cabbages might be grown upon many lands improper for turnips and if planted with intervals of four feet as at dishley the ground would be kept clean at little expense i have found them exceedingly useful no land should lie dormant for a year and if no man ploughed more than he ought he would always be enabled to turn his fallow brick to some useful purpose  no vii as many disputes often arise in dividing common fields and waste lands about the extent of manorial rights and also about the extent of the claims of those who have servitude upon them we here insert some decisions of the scotch court of session given in consequence of the act      for dividing commons which we have been favored with by mr john craw writer in haddington  in the division of commonties between a proprietor and others having servitudes the proprietor ought to have a fourth part allocated to him tanquam praecipium as the value of his property and the remainder ought to be divided proportionally conformably to the act      amongst the neighboring heritors who have possessed the same as commonty allowing the proprietor likewise a share in that division effeiring to his lands

praecipium by those who had servitudes that the rights were derived from the pursuers predecessors and were a burden upon his property that there was no foundation upon the act      for pursuing a division unless in the case of common property that the defenders must be allowed to enjoy their servitudes as stipulated to them that the proprietor was empowered to confine them to ground sufficient for their servitude but that further he could not go the lords found the defenders having rights of servitude are entitled to have a proportion of the commonty set apart to them equivalent to these rights   d jan      wigtown  in a process of division upon the act      at the instance of a superior against his vassals to whom he had granted servitudes of common pasturage on a moor which was his

st       no viii the following extracts from two letters written by a farmer in the west riding contain so much natural good sense expressed in forcible language upon the obstacles to improvement and the means necessary for rectifying the practice of husbandry in that district that we have given them a place at same time we beg leave to observe that this gentlemans sentiments so far as they go are nearly similar to those we have formed in consequence of our survey  being desirous to encourage an undertaking which has for its object the improvement of agriculture and of course the general benefit of the public i have ventured to communicate my thoughts to you upon some of the most important obstacles to that useful science which i thought might be more clearly done upon paper than in the short time i had the honor to spend with you i will begin my observations upon the third of your queries the lands in this part being chiefly occupied by small farmers they are deprived of making that improvement which a man of property with two or three hundred acres of land can do a small farmer not having room to change his land from tillage to seeds and pasture with sheep which is the grand improvement of the land in this part he lets a small portion lie in grass to keep his milk cows and horses and the rest perpetually in tillage excepting now and then a little broad clover by this method it gets wore out requires a heavier dressing of manures more working by the plough and harrows and becomes so fixed and cemented together the greater part of our land being of a clayey glutinous nature that it is deprived of receiving the benefit of the sun and air which is the principal life of vegetation whereas by laying down with red clover and white and yellow clovers alternately and occasionally a few grass seeds the soil is kept in a freer state the fibrous threads of those seeds running among the soil communicate the warmth of the sun and air in every part render the soil more malleable easier to work and in a better state for the reception of any kind of grain these advantages it receives from the culture of seeds exclusive of the rest and manure which is scattered upon it by that most provident of all cattle sheep as great a portion of which i should recommend to be kept upon every farm as is consistent with this mode of management they enrich the soil more than any other cattle and give employment by their fleece and the most approved food in their carcass to our manufactures another obstacle to improvement here is that a small farm is not worth the attention of a man of ingenuity and property and this together with the refusal of leases and arbitrary clauses prevents men of property from educating their sons in this line of business every man therefore that experiences these oppressions and who can give his son a fortune to stock   0 or  00 acres of ground if he is a lad of genius puts him apprentice either in the mercantile line or some of the genteel professions i know this sort of reasoning will draw upon me many enemies and it will be objected that by laying a number of small farms together you will depopulate a country far be it from me to deprive any man of his property or to wish to do any thing that may tend to decrease population on the contrary it is my wish to promote it convinced that the riches of a country depend upon it i would not deprive the old farmers of their land i would have them educate their sons in the useful manufactories and as they die lay them together or convert them into manufactories where properly situated and lay a sufficient portion of land for their convenience and the rest lay together for the purpose of farming four farms of  0 acres each laid together under proper management would be made to produce onefourth more for the public market than in separate allotments and i think it will be generally confessed that in a country like this abounding with men of property ingenuity and enterprise that there generally will be found employment in our manufactories for as many inhabitants as there can be found provisions to support consequently more land is made to produce and more it will tend to increase population i shall next beg leave to repeat my method of management which though you have seen and i verbally communicated to you i think may here be more clearly described  upon sand land loamy sand or dry hazle soils i cultivate turnips dressed with bones mixed with a portion of fold manure as communicated to you next barley red clover and wheat then turnips barley white and yellow clovers pasturing with sheep one or two years then wheat and so on upon clay and wet soils after fallow wheat red clover wheat or oats then fallow wheat or barley if the fallow be limed we always sow wheat if fold manure sometimes barley as i change the tillage as much as possible next small seeds as above mixing a few grass seeds and pasturing with sheep one two or three years as convenient or apparently most useful i then plough out for wheat or oats if laid more than one year oats i have found this from  0 years experience to be the most beneficial method of cultivating land having brought some poor soils to considerable greater value within that period the farm i occupy is but small   0 statute acres and though as well managed  0 years hence as any in the circuit and as heavily manured did not then feed more than  0 sheep upon grass and  0 upon turnip upon an average i can now fatten  0 sometimes  0 upon grass and  00 or   0 upon turnip and get onefourth more corn than was formerly raised besides some increase of other cattle here however ought to be understood the great expense i am at in artificial manures these adding to the natural ones in a very considerable proportion last year i spread on eighty pounds worth of bones forty pounds worth of lime and ten or twelve pounds worth of soot and rape dust upon this small farm besides the natural manures it produced and upon an average it costs me at least l  00 per year in different sorts of tillage this ought to be considered as a principal means of improvement and is more by one half than is bought upon an average by the general run of farmers  i come now to speak of the necessity of leases which with the forementioned thoughts on small farms will give answer to your   th question the greater part of this country is either tenanted at the will of the proprietor that is from year to year or upon leases clogged with arbitrary clauses such as being restrained from ploughing out certain pleces of ground under heavy penalties or confined in some measure to one mode of management which restrains the genius of the farmer and ties him from experiments and every useful improvement there may indeed be a few men found who will exert their abilities and risk their property under a yearly farm yet the generallty will not for out of the whole of my acquaintance and i know a great number or clever farmers whenever i have asked them why do you not manage such a plece of land so and so how much more would it be made to produce the answer always is we are tenants at will and fear advantage would be taken of our improvements this i presume will appear to every one a natural conclusion there are two clauses which i think necessary in this country where tillage is so dear and where they are at an inconvenient distance from great towns that manure cannot be replaced and that is to be restrained from selling of the hay and straw from the premises and four or five years previous to the end of the term to lay down onethird of the ground in a good husbandry style these in my opinion are all the restraints necessary for the security of the proprietor and i think would not militate against the farmers interest but leave him at full liberty to pursue his improvements  lime husbandry which was more practiced some time past than at present for it is found that where lands have been long under the plough and often dressed over with it which has been the general practice for a century past it has very little effect the old  used no other tillage till very lately but what was made in the farmyard and many of them no other yet always liming their clay land fallows and sowing wheat  oats beans or broad clover and again wheat they have thus fallowed and  again and again for  0 or  0 years together laying on the rate of about   0 bushels of knottingly stonelime upon an acre which will be two  horse cart loads this stone is brought from near pontefract about    miles by water since we got the navigation it is burnt by the river side about   miles distance from us it costs at the kiln about   d per bushel the expense of conveyance from the kiln to the land to average a circuit of six miles will be about   d per bushel and the expense of watering and spreading nearly d so that the whole expense will be about   d per bushel or l   for a statute acre this is collected during the summer and spread on at any convenient time a little before wheat sowing  but in my opinion this time is too late as i find the sooner it is spread on in the spring and the oftener it is ploughed afterward the more intimately it gets mixed with the earth having perfectly absorbed its own air and water the better it fertilizes the soil and fits it for the produce of a crop the season of laying it on is not however regarded by the generality of farmers nor scarcely any other property respecting it but convenience for their other employments the most improved method i am acquainted with and which i find to answer best is to lay upon clay soils about   0 or  00 bushels of knottingly stonelime upon an acre this stone upon being analyzed is found to be mixed with a strong sand about onethird of its weight for we have two sorts of lime of very different properties the earlier in the summer it is laid on the better for the fallow to receive a few ploughings afterward it also answers best to be laid on the first fallow after seeds as the fresher the land the greater its effects i think it not prudent to lime two fallows together except there has been an interval of rest and other manures spread on in the mean time nor do i find it answer upon old ploughed wore out soils hence arises the philosophical opinion of some ingenious farmers that lime possessing neither oils nor salts acts only as a stimulus or forcer to other manures bringing such vegetative qualities as are in the soil into more powerful life and activity upon dry land that is proper for turnips i lay  0 or  00 bushels of emsall lime per acre this is mixed with a strong clay about the same proportion as the other of sand there is some cautilus quality mixed with this lime that if too great a quantity be laid on instead of assisting it destroys vegetation but about this quantity is helpful it stiffens the straw makes it stand firmer at the root and heavier in the ear i do not use this as a complete but only an assistant dressing betwixt fallows laying it on in the autumn before the last crop before fallow as soon as possible after the preceding crop is reaped i then plow down and sow with either wheat or oats to either of which it is helpful and the following year will be more serviceable to the turnip crop than if spread on the same summer this lime costs about the same price as the other it is to be observed that these lands are kept altogether fresh by being sown with seeds and pastured with sheep every other fallow and always dressed with bones or fold manure or both for turnips  the sheep that are kept in this extensive county are as variable as the soil and climate and in some degree suited to each most of them have made and are yet capable of great improvement those bred above peneston are well adapted to those uncultivated barren mountains where they have little to feed upon but ling or heath and are perhaps the least capable of improvement of any other but as you have seen them i need not be particular in describing them i imagine their fleece taking ewes wethers and hogs together will average about   or   lb which will be worth   s   d of late years a little more those bred upon york wolds are very numerous and far the best in the county it being a dry flinty limestone soil and capable of cultivation by growing turnips for their winter support they raise some of them to good weights    or    lbs per quarter when fatted those farmers occupying large districts of land can keep great flocks which makes it worth their attention to improve them and great improvement some of them have made by crossing with bakewells rams and breeding from the best northumberland ewes this has rather decreased the weight of the fleece but improved the staple and given them a property to feed much quicker and fatter those sheep will weigh when fat from    to    lb per quarter in proportion as they are supported with food and the fleece upon the best walks will average   lb or better which this year is worth about   s those on the poorer walks from   to   lb worth from   s   d to   s   d  what are bred in this neighborhood upon waste grounds are of small consequence they are the worst in the county being bred from all sorts and belonging chiefly to poor people in small lots of  0    or  0 each will never be bettered till the lands are enclosed we have a few gentlemen farmers begun to breed from northumberland ewes and bakewells rams which i think makes far the best and most profitable stock but for want of room nothing of consequence can be done here in the breeding line the chief practice of our farmers is to buy ewes at peneston or from york wolds or northumberland at michaelmas fatten the lamb in the spring and the ewe afterward changing every year being near a manufacturing country full of opulent tradesmen and merchants lamb always bears a good price being worth   d per lb nearly on an average all spring and summer where there is room to breed a few of our own best ewe lambs every year of the above sort to keep up a stock in proportion to the size of the farm i believe it most profitable as stock bred upon our own soils if of a proper sort will fatten their lambs and themselves too much sooner than those brought from any other part the fleece of these where gentlemen have brought them to tolerable perfection will be   lb average and   s   d or   s  in respect to horses very few are bred in this neighborhood scarcely any for sale the farmers and manufacturers breed a few for their own use as such every man gets of a sort that is most likely to be adapted to his own business some galloways worth at   years old from l  0 to l    some half bred horses fit for either plough or saddle about    hands worth at   years old from l    to l    and a few of the heavy black ones which will be worth from l    to l  0 if free from blemishes those will get to    hands high but the east riding is the circuit for horses there the best road and coach horses are bred in england and of any price almost from  0 to  0 guineas at   years old this circuit is by no means adapted to the breed of horses sheep is my favorite stock with a few good short horned heifers of the northallerton or darlington sort  in respect to the value of land it is a very dubious question to answer we have much let for the convenience of trade but i shall only speak to that let for the purpose of farming this is rented from   s   d to  0 s per statute acre subject to every other encumbrance which in some places from tithes poors rates highways and other taxes is very considerable where they have a manufactory amongst them the poors rates only will be   s in the pound rent i think more than twothirds of my neighborhood is of a wet clayey nature unfit for turnips the average rent of these lands may be about    s per acre and the dry turnip soils about    s per ditto as to the produce good farmers will average from    to  0 bushels of wheat per acre  0 or    bushels barley    or  0 bushels oats and  0 bushels beans small farmers and indifferent managers which occupy i suppose  fourths of our lands will not average more than  0 bushels of wheat  0 bushels barley    bushels oats and  0 bushels beans thus have i communicated to you my opinion upon your different questions to the best of my knowledge observation and experience and where i have erred it is an error in judgment which i should be glad to be corrected in you are at liberty to make use of my name in any way you think proper for though i should draw upon me the reproach of the haughty and ignorant farmers i regard not the censure of such narrow and contracted minds conscious that it is a duty which every man owes to himself and mankind to exert himself for the public welfare and being convinced that nothing is more necessary nor can tend more to promote the general interest than the object you have in view you have therefore my sincere wishes for its success i am etc  no ix account of the rotheram plough by joshua walker esquire at clifton the following is the general outlines of the history of this useful implement of husbandry  it was invented by a mr joseph foljambe of eastwood near this place about seventy years ago for which he took out a patent he afterward sold the patent right to a mr staniforth of firbeck in this neighborhood who at first gave the farmers the privilege of using his ploughs for   s   d each he afterward attempted to advance them to   s or   s   d but this not meeting with the approbation of the farmers a combination took place and the validity of the patent was contested and set aside upon the ground of its not being a new invented plough but a plough improved since the first introduction of this plough the only improvement on it has been the lengthening the head or sock which keeps it steadier to its work a certain indication that the inventor or improver of ploughs had well digested his plan before he made it public the ploughs in use before the introduction of the new one were such as are now used in that part of this district called the levels between doncaster and thorn which require four horses to do the work done by two  the dimensions and construction of the plough will appear sufficiently evident from the following drawing and description  diagram of the rotherham plough dimensions of the rotheram plough ft in from the end of stilt b b to point of the share c     whole length from the end of beam a a to ditto of ditto c   0

where mr tailor lives are about   s   d in the pound in this parish they are more than double on account of the number of poor in the town of rotheram and those thrown upon the parish by the manufactories and collieries  no x extracts from the correspondence of mr parkinson at doncaster addressed to mr broun in answer to your request concerning the sheepfarming of this neighborhood  a great part of this country is not proper to breed upon yet sheep ought to be kept by every farmer for improving his land and in my opinion the most profitable way is to buy draft ewes in september and to feed their lambs after that keep on the mothers till fat as our clay soils are liable to rot sheep by floods etc the farmer by this method will not run any risk for if his sheep take the rot they will if managed properly be ready for the butcher at all times the turnips upon the clay should be eaten early in the season to make the most of them and those upon the limestone and sandy soils afterward  i will now describe the kind of sheep proper to be bred on the sand and limestone farms and these i think are the dishley or as they are commonly called the bakewell breed the properties of which are well known their wool may be considerably improved it being in general of too short a kind and producing various sorts in one fleece viz mossy on the back hairy on the thighs or breech and fine and soft on the shoulders and necks which causes one part to be sold at bury st edmonds and the other at halifax to make the most of it  it is the opinion of some that long wool injures the carcass i do not believe it or at least it is scarcely perceptible therefore i would have the wool on these sheep to be of a fine combing quality nine or ten inches long bearing a very even top as that prevents both loss of wool and labor by not having the tag end to cut off the weight of the fleece to be from eight to twelve pound if properly fed if not it will perhaps be only from five to seven pound the carcass to weigh from  0 to    pound per quarter with common food extraordinary feed from    to  0 pound  we have a sort of sheep from northumberland that feeds well and pays a great deal of money i had last year  0 ewes from that country bought them october      put them to a dishley tup and kept them on till december       profit as follows l s d sold the wool for   0 0    lambs at    s      0   ewes at  0 s  0 0 0    ditto at    s    0 0      0 prime cost     0 0 profit  0    0  this year i have  0 ewes which are not yet sold one of their lambs aged four months weighed    pound per quarter which sold in sheffield market at   per pound or l      s   d besides skin etc  the sheep at present bred in this country i mean those bred upon the commons are not worth describing their fleeces weigh from one to five pound but very few so much the carcass will feed from nine to fifteen pound per quarter  general run about twelve pound it is my opinion several thousand pounds are annually lost in the neighborhood of doncaster for want of a more improved breed of sheep  i think the dishley sheep are generally too small their bone and shape are beautiful but their skin or pelt is too thin for bearing the cold they can neither stand the extremities of heat nor cold and it is sometimes found necessary to clothe them where this breed is newly introduced the wool of the northumberland sheep stands in need of great improvement upon many of them the staple is much too short and some carry a hairy sort of wool not profitable the carcass though not so inclined to feed as the dishley sheep yet being far larger pays very well  the durham or tees sheep if improved might pay very well but from what i have seen i think little attention has been paid to them every flock being of various sorts both in respect of wool and carcass there is a number of them pretty good but a greater number not so i am of opinion a careful and knowing observer of sheep would raise a fine breed from the dishley ram and tees ewes sheep are an animal difficult to bring to perfection as both wool and carcass are to be attended to but one thing i am clear in that the best carcasses will produce the best wools like as good land affords good grain  it is too often little considered how much may be raised from land under good management it appears to me that it would be a good scheme for the board of agriculture to take a farm into their own hands and show by improved practice what might be done this would be of great utility as to driving any thing into old farmers it is easier to make new ones there is land near doncaster now let at   s per acre which if managed in a proper manner and fed by sheep would pay  0 s and where the sheep that are bred never sell higher than    s or    s might be fed to  0 s and  0 s  the usual produce per acre where a rotation of turnips barley clover and wheat is adopted is as follows  upon poor sands   quarters of barley   of wheat  turnip and clover precarious upon clay soils   quarters barley   quarters wheat   quarters beans  clover and turnips both good upon limestone   quarters barley   quarters wheat   quarters beans  clover and turnips good loamy land   quarters barley   quarters wheat pease   quarters  clover and turnips good  the mode of cultivation however is very irregular as the farmers have no leases they make hay when the sun shines and often crop the ground as long as it will carry i know a great many farmers who keep their land in a poor state to prevent the owners from advancing it  draining very little known in this part of the country the wet lands improveable but the dry lands much more so  with regard to the poor sands betwixt this place and bautry which are at present in a very shabby state my opinion is that the best way of going to work with them would be first to begin with a good turnip fallow and  0 loads of manure of two tons each to the acre which may be had at doncaster at   s per ton as they have scarce any themselves this will produce a good crop of turnips which ought to be eat off with sheep and the land sown with barley and seeds  quantity of seeds   peck of rye grass    pound white clover and    pound trefoil i would pasture it with sheep for two years break it for wheat or rye and return to turnips my reasons for this are rye grass is a very good winter plant and scarce can be eaten too near in the spring when grass is of most value if it run to a bent it exhausts itself for that season and is worth nothing till autumn trefoil is more early than white clover therefore with these mixtures three different springs are got many farmers like red clover i do not except for cutting and i think it much the better of a little rye grass red clover on many soils stands but for one year therefore is very improper seed for pasture which those sands should be applied to as much as possible to fasten them all artificial grasses should bear two years eating at least the expense of seeds being great but none will scarcely bear more than three years no poor sand or limestone ought to be pastured longer than it will keep a sufficient number of sheep to leave a good top dressing when ploughed up by reason the land is then losing what was put into it before and returning to its natural state in time a hotbed will come to earth manure mixed with soil causes fermentation in some measure like yest put amongst wort and will soon go off and cease to operate  the land in its present state of cultivation lets high though worth double the sum if properly managed sheep are much wanted as there is no improvement equal to the sheepfarming it is both the cheapest and best upon all dry soils if the farmer could only be made to understand he had a sort of inheritance in his farm which can no way be done but by giving leases it would be of general utility to the kingdom at large the farmers are the first and the grand machine of all improvements and therefore ought to have every possible encouragement given them i never was in any part of the country where the people were more flat to improvement than in this neighborhood i apprehend the cause is this a great many gentlemen live in it consequently near their tenants and are curbs upon their ingenuity most experiments are costly and the farmer is afraid his landlord will look upon his attempts to improve as acts of extravagance  such as hiring a dishley ram for  00 guineas the season and other things of the same kind  there is an absurd idea some men have that the scheme i have adapted for the sands will diminish the quantity of grain i say no  it will only add to it for an acre managed in the way i have described will produce as much as two do now as for the small mutton and fine wool that would be lost by my scheme there will always be plenty of the former on the mountains for the tables of the great and if lambs are clipped they will produce fine carding wool which does away these objections  no xi during our survey a journal was regularly kept wherein was inserted the whole information received at the different places we visited which was always taken down as nearly as possible in the words of the persons who gave us the intelligence considering the great extent of the west riding the different qualities of soil and the various modes of cultivation adopted the following abridgement of its contents in which a number of observations daily made by ourselves are included will we hope present to the public as just a picture of the present state of husbandry in that district as could well have been accomplished had any other method been adopted  october   th      received our commission from sir john sinclair president of the board of agriculture to draw up an account of the stock and husbandry of the west riding of yorkshire and to inquire into the state of manufactures so far as they were connected with the agriculture of that district  october   d set off from east lothian and arrived at boroughbridge on the   th  borough bridge is a market town situated upon the great north road and about half way betwixt london and edinburgh it elects two members to parliament in consequence of a peculiarly qualified burgage tenure and was first summoned to send members by queen mary in      it is a town of small extent enjoys the benefit of inland navigation from the river eure which passes this place and is navigable to rippon here we received the following information relative to the husbandry of the neighborhood  the land generally belongs to small proprietors and farms are of various sizes soil good mostly deep loam and the rent about  0 s per statute acre besides public burdens which may be about    s more rate of wages    d per day for winter half year and    d for summer with extra allowance in hay time and harvest wheat cut with the sickle at   s   d and   s per acre harvest early generally over by the end of september a great part of the land kept in grass rotation upon the clay land two crops and a fallow and these crops are wheat and beans the fallow limed with    bushels winchester measure per acre and the dung chiefly applied to the grass upon light land the rotation is turnips barley clover and wheat sometimes oats in place of wheat mr fretwell drills turnips but the general practice of the neighborhood is to sow broadcast where the soil is proper for it the turnips are eat upon the ground with sheep which is considered as most advantageous some cattle bred but not a fourth part of the necessary quantity those that are bred are chiefly for cows the males being killed when calves few or no sheep bred mr fretwell and mr fletcher buy their ewes from northumberland bought them this year at    s per head sold the lambs at    s

the enclosures small difference of rent betwixt open and enclosed land ten shillings per acre some waste unimproved common in the neighborhood which ought to be divided and enclosed no land is watered here  prices of corn this year higher than usual but markets in general steady what corn is more than necessary for home consumption is disposed of at knaresborough market and from thence carried to the western parts of the county corns mostly stacked in the fields as there is found less loss by vermin than in the stackyard some threshing machines in the neighborhood roads in good order the byeroads supported by the statute work which consists of   s from each householder and six days labor of a team of three horses and two laborers from the farmer for each  0 l of rent with an assessment of   d in the pound upon his rent paring and burning is only practiced upon the waste lands expense about    s per acre the first year it is sown with rape seed produce from two to five quarters per acre generally about four quarters price at present thirty guineas per last but very fluctuating expense of reaping and threshing about  0 s per acre if stacked and threshed in winter but according to the general practice it is impossible to calculate the expense the whole neighborhood being gathered to the threshing when it is done in the field in this mode it is a perfect feast where all comers are welcome but this good old custom is fast going out and the thriftier practice of stacking it in the yard and threshing it in the winter introduced in its place  the straw of the rape is sold to the soap boilers at about   s per acre the plough used here is of the rotheram kind drawn with two horses upon light land and three upon clay a ploughman works his horses only labors generally  0 hours per day when the season allows the want of leases one great obstacle to improvement most part of the farmers are upon yearly leases filled with innumerable restrictions and leases of this kind are as good as none  from boroughbridge we proceeded to copgrove the seat of henry duncombe esquire m p for the county upon the road to copgrove we passed several common fields which appeared to be of good quality but under execrable management the far greatest part of the land was enclosed and the grass very rich those enclosures adjoining to mr duncombes house particularly so  the information received at copgrove was to the following purport  soil in general light well adapted to turnips carrots and other drilled crops the whole parish of copgrove possessed by mr duncombe but there is a considerable number of small proprietors in the neighborhood the majority of the farms are small not exceeding   0 acres the land is employed both in pasture and tillage about twothirds in pasture of the tillage part onethird annually under fallow and turnips taken upon it mr duncombe drills a few but they are otherwise universally broadcast two crops of corn allowed to a fallow and these crops are either wheat and oats or oats and wheat mr duncombes steward thinks it best to take outs first mr duncombe sometimes sows rape upon the fallow eats it off in autumn with sheep and sows it with wheat at other times after eating it in autumn lets it stand till spring when it is eat again with sheep and sown with barley or oats when land is sown down for grass if intended only to stand one year red clover is sown by itself if for sheep pasture white clover yellow clover and rib grass and if for meadow white clover and hay seeds the stock kept upon the pastures are a mixture both of sheep and cattle a considerable part of the fallow is limed the turnips all dunged and the remainder of the dung laid upon grass horses chiefly employed in the plough being found most expeditious though a few oxen are also kept harvest generally commences about the middle of august and is finished before michaelmas the land is mostly enclosed there being but few open fields the value of the land is increased onehalf by enclosing enclosures in general small average not above  0 acres enclosing not injurious to population some common fields which are very detrimental both to the

tenants are mostly under covenants and restrictions some of which are detrimental both to the interest of landlord and tenant no manufactures here but a number of cotton mills in the neighborhood as they are lately established their effects are not yet known no agricultural societies the dutch or rotheram plough is used by mr duncombe  arrived at knaresborough  waited upon robert stockdale esquire from whom we received a great deal of valuable information the forest of knaresborough consisting of   000 acres was divided in consequence of an act of parliament passed in    0 and his account of this transaction as published in the appendix to this survey will throw great light upon the system by which common lands are at present divided and enclosed  knaresborough is a market town of great antiquity and formerly a place of considerable strength it is almost encompassed with the deep river nid and strengthened by a castle situated upon a craggy rock whence the name of the place is supposed to be derived it has a weekly market on wednesday at which great quantities of corn and provisions of all kinds are sold a good deal of linen is manufactured in this place and neighborhood but little or nothing done in the woollen way  information received here from mr william bramley steward to sir jo coghill bart  soil about knaresborough part light upon a clay bottom and a considerable part a deep rich loam the majority of proprietors small and generally occupy their own land the fields about the town mostly in grass and employed in feeding milk cows the cows are chiefly of the holderness breed farther west they are of the long horned or craven kind which are hardier and answer better for the soil and climate when land is broke up from grass two crops of oats are taken then fallow which is sown with wheat or barley and grass seeds sheep both bred in the neighborhood and bought at the adjoining fairs wool sells at about  0 s   d per stone of    lb avoirdupois three fleeces to the stone general rotation of crops  fallow wheat beans and oats but some take only two crops after fallow the fallows are limed   chalders or    bushels to the acre

about michaelmas if the season answers beans in march or as early as possible oats in april and barley immediately afterward land almost wholly enclosed and supposed to be worth   s more rent per acre than the same soil in open field enclosures from   to  0 acres thinks it would be of great utility to enclose all the common fields and that enclosing can never have a bad effect upon population a

wages high in harvest   s per day for men and    d for women hours of labor in summer from six to six but in harvest do not enter till eight oclock paring and burning greatly practiced expense    s per acre a good deal of wood in the neighborhood provisions plenty beef and mutton at   d and   d per lb avoirdupois farmhouses not very good and stand in need of improvement a number of leases granted some for   others for    and a few for    years thinks it would greatly promote the interest of both landlord and tenant if the whole of the lands were under lease thinks also that covenants or restrictions upon the tenant during any part of the lease except the three last years are a great hardship and very detrimental to good farming no agricultural societies in this neighborhood but the farmers in general seem fond of improvements  we also received answers to the queries from mr stockdale where his information agrees with mr bramley it is unnecessary to repeat it the substance of his answers is therefore only given  the soil and climate vary according to situation exposure vicinity to rivers and towns as also to the quantity of lime composts and other manures that are used farms are in general small and divided nearly into equal portions of arable and grass all kinds of clover and grassseeds are cultivated a mixed stock of horses cattle and sheep are kept upon the pastures the breeds by no means properly attended to except by some particular persons very little land is watered but many situations would admit of it fallowing practiced invariably upon strong soils and even upon all such as are not friendly to the turnip husbandry turnips when eat by sheep seldom fail to improve the ground and secure a succession of good crops but redclover when too often sown is found not so good a succession as trefoil and white clover or even beans occasionally introduced in its stead lime is principally used as a manure when stabledung cannot be obtained compost dunghills are now more attended to than formerly but not so much as they ought to be many of the common fields are enclosed annually under particular acts of parliament and by them population has been greatly increased the extent of waste land is very great in this wapentake and principally depastured by half starved sheep horses and young cattle it may be improved in various ways as the commons in this district differ much in soil exposure and other circumstances the land is not so much drained as it ought to be the drains are mostly filled with stones and covered very few filled with wood or straw if the soil be sound and strong it is common to turn the first sod with the grass side downwards letting it rest for support on a piece of the bottom of the drain on each side not thrown out this is called a shoulder drain and in strong land answers well and is done cheap paring and burning is practiced and found to answer well in all sour rushy land and is done by men with a push or breast spade in some parts of the country wood abounds and where it is attended to thrives well the roads are in general good those are best which are made wide not too much raised in the middle and the stones broke small by which means they unite and bed firmer the farmhouses and offices when made in consequence of new enclosures are usually placed near the center of the farm and are well constructed few leases are granted which is to be lamented as it can never be expected that improvements will be made where the tenant has no certainty of reaping the benefit of them the people certainly have a great turn to improvements and were reasonable leases given would make a rapid progress therein the intermixture of property a great obstacle to improvement if a general enclosure bill could be obtained and tithes commuted it would obviate a great many of the present impediments and contribute more to extensive and general improvement than any other measure  we had the pleasure to fall in at knaresborough with mr bainbridge steward to lord loughborough from whom we received a variety of important information made use of in its proper place the poors rate is generally   s in the pound in this neighborhood which raises a suspicion that the funds are either badly administered or that the laws themselves are founded upon wrong principles by information received from other sources it appeared that a person in the workhouse fares full as well as if he derived his subsistence from his own labor a method of management inconsistent with sound policy and highly inimical to virtue and industry amongst the lower ranks  visited harrowgate country about that place wild and uncultivated in the division of knaresborough forest a tract of land about  00 acres was set apart for the use of the company who resort there  arrived at ripley sir john ingilby a great friend to improvement in this neighborhood unfortunately from home the land here mostly belongs to small freeholders  farms about   0 acres in extent but a great deal larger upon the poor lands rents in the vicinity of ripley  0 s per acre besides public burdens about a third of the land kept in tillage no clover sown no land watered wheat and oats the general crops and two crops to a fallow onethird of the tillage land annually limed and   chalders or    bushels applied to the acre harvest later than in the lower parts of the country nine quarters of friesland oats per acre sometimes got upon fresh land land all enclosed rents increased by enclosing enclosures from   to    acres no common fields little waste land laborers   s per week ploughmen  0 l per annum with a free house and fuel very little land pared and burned roads good farm houses might be improved seldom any leases granted but the want of them thought a great loss as the farmers have thereby no encouragement to improve their lands strict covenants betwixt landlord and tenant which are thought detrimental to both one of the greatest obstacles to improvements here is confining the tenants to keep their lands in old pasture grass  from ripley to paitleybridge the face of the country alters exceedingly a great deal of woodland road very unequal and great part of it shaded with trees on each side there is a fine valley or strath of land called nidderdale or netherdale as we approached paitly in the midst of which runs the river nid and the whole dale appeared exceeding populous land in the dale all enclosed mostly with stone dykes observed a number of fine cows pasturing in the fields something of a cross betwixt the holderness and craven breeds indeed we saw scarce any other stock but milk cows great quantities of butter being made in the dale farms very small and almost wholly in grass some turnips and those taken great care of for we noticed in several fields the tops cut off and the turnip carrying home to be built in the barn little hay and as for corn we have not seen one stalk since our departure from ripley  paitley is a fine thriving place it being market day when we were there the town was much crowded and the shambles presented a sight which declared that the inhabitants were in no danger of starving for want of butcher meat a great deal of linen is manufactured in this place and neighborhood the yarn is generally bleached before it is woven which we were told makes the cloth much stronger than when it is wove before bleaching much butter is also salted here and sent to york for the london market one person alone exports from  00 to  00 firkins annually of    b per firkin  the price for which it is contracted at is    s per firkin a cow in the dale produces about   firkins during the season but upon the higher grounds only   firkins we learned that wool is greatly reduced in price this season fine wool    l per cent below last year and inferior qualities at least    l per cent a number of hogs are fed upon oatmeal and sold to the lancashire manufacturers at   s per stone of    pound the hams are generally sent to the london market as nothing will do with the lancashire people but the fattest part of the beast  at this place we spent the evening with  moss esquire and received from him the following important accounts of the husbandry of nidderdale  the climate bad very wet and the harvest late some large estates but the greatest part in the possession of small freeholders land occupied by small farmers who are also manufacturers miners or people engaged in trade  generally kept in grass and pastured with milk cows no land watered but thinks it may be useful in many cases oats the principal crop best management a fallow and three crops and turnips taken to the fallow plough of the rotheram kind land all enclosed except the moors enclosing a great advantage approves of small enclosures on that wet cold climate and thinks enclosing has greatly increased population planting in certain places would be a great improvement  the moors incapable of improvement otherwise wages very high owing to the mines and manufactories  average   s per day thinks paring and burning advantageous but it is not much practiced a great demand for wood to the mines and the quantity not adequate beef and mutton   d per pound wheat   s   d per bushel barley   s  0 d oats   s beans   s   d corn generally brought from knaresborough and rippon as little is raised here in proportion to the demand land let both upon lease and at will length of leases when granted    years the linen manufacture doubled within these    years lead mines carried on to a great extent thinks manufactures have served agriculture very much sheep fed in the dale are of the mug breed those in the moors of the scotch kind is of opinion it would be of advantage if all the lands were under lease  from paitleybridge to grassington we went through a large common which appeared very improveable observed large flocks of sheep mostly of the scotch breed of bad quality and condition examined the lead mines in the neighborhood which are numerous and valuable before we arrived at grassington the land improves in quality and is all enclosed a large woollen mill here which formerly did much business but since the stagnation of trade occasioned by the war has done little few or no turnips are cultivated about this place and the most part of the people employed in the mines  substance of information received at grassington  land chiefly possessed by small proprietors and mostly occupied by them some extensive commons consisting of many thousand acres  one of them lately divided and the consequences beneficial oats the principal grain that is sown but almost the whole of the neighborhood is in grass and employed in feeding cattle and sheep for the skipton market lime produces great advantages upon the moors small tithes only drawn and a modus taken for the great ones very few leases granted but the gentleman from whom we had this information was of opinion that the want of them was a great bar to improvements  leaving grassington we crossed the hills and arrived at settle the far greater part of the way for we cannot call it a road lay through uncultivated moors considerable parts of these moors appeared very improveable we went through a large extent of stone enclosures which we understood to have been common and lately divided but did not see the vestige of a house for more than  0 miles so could make no inquiry whether the enclosing had produced beneficial consequences or not  at settle the low grounds are all enclosed and the fences in the most complete state the greatest part of the land is in grass which for quality and verdure can hardly be exceeded land in the neighborhood of settle sets at  0 s and l  per acre it appears well worthy of it for we received a well attested account of a  0 acre close that fed in       0 head of cattle and  0 sheep indeed the richness of the soil is hardly credible to those who have not seen it and the possessors seem unanimously to think that it is of greater value when kept in grass than to break it up and cultivate with the plough  settle fair being upon the day we were there had an opportunity to see a great show of cattle of the county breed they are universally long horned and seem in shape skin and other circumstances to be nearly the same as the irish breed we learned that there has not been the same attention shown of late to keep the breed pure by selecting proper bulls as formerly we are however of opinion that the breed of long horned cattle which prevails over the western part of the island is admirably adapted from the thickness of their skin and hardiness of constitution to undergo the vicissitudes of this climate and that the short horned breed upon the eastern coasts would never answer in this part of the country  we received the following answers to the queries here from david swale esquire  the cultivated lands in the lower part of this district consist of excellent feeding pastures the higher grounds are rushy and spouty occasioned by neglect of draining a mode of improvement which has answered in a surprising degree when applied judiciously the soil of the low grounds generally rich mould of the loamy and hazle kinds the higher lands mostly turbary or clay in this district there is a number of freeholders from and under l  0 a year to l   or  00 the greatest proprietors are the duke of devonshire lord thanet lord grantham thomas lester esquire edward parker esquire and several others the lands of good quality are generally employed in feeding the tillage land is of an inferior sort and lies in higher situations black oats are principally sown turnips are but little cultivated the cattle that are bred are of the long horned kind the grazing stocks principally consist of scotch cattle and sheep most of the high land is injured by water and the want of fencing there are considerable commons consisting of many thousand acres capable of great improvement by enclosing and draining this mode of improvement is checked by the necessity as the law now stands of having them divided by act of parliament as such commons have many proprietors the rotation of management upon the higher grounds is mostly laying them down after three years ploughing for three years more without any other cultivation than pasturing it with a breeding stock in low situations turnips are cultivated and clover would answer but is not adopted here which is probably owing to the high price the land bears in higher situations these crops are very uncertain and depend upon the weather fallowing is very little practiced oxen were formerly used but horses are now generally employed the ploughs carts etc are of the kind commonly used in the country the land is generally enclosed except the outmoors or commons considerable advantage has arisen from enclosing and the value has increased where cattle or sheep are pastured the stock grows better and although the quantity of wool is not so great yet its quality is finer the extent of waste lands is great and the improvement by fencing and draining might be considerable some might in that case be converted into pasture land others into arable and others into planting with a promising prospect of success paring and burning upon the high lands is much exploded as wasting the soil where it can be ill spared this district in most parts wants wood of late there has been a good deal planted which promises well but this article is not so much attended to as might be wished it would be of great utility to have the tithes properly regulated obstacles to improvement are short leases and the great scarcity of coal which might be remedied by lords of the manors making trials to discover them and by holding out rewards and granting favorable leases to such persons as are willing to adventure in those undertakings poors rates very high here not less than   s   d per pound rent  at settle we had also the good fortune to fall in with mr barbeck banker there who took the trouble to introduce us to several intelligent farmers the substance of whose information we now proceed to give  soil in the neighborhood of settle of a hazle mould upon a dry bottom climate wet land chiefly in the natural possession of small proprietors farms small from l  0 to l  00 a year several commons but the stock upon them stinted all the low lands are in grass and pastured with large cattle of their own breed and the higher grounds by scotch cattle and sheep the sheep that are bred here are called the mallam breed wool disposed of at huddersfield and wakefield and sold this season at  0 s   d per stone of   lb   fleeces to the stone the wool of the scotch sheep from teviotdale sold at   s per stone and   fleeces made a stone the salve used for smearing them is one gallon of tar and   lb of butter which serves from    to  0 sheep a great quantity of the high grounds capable of improvement oats almost the only grain cultivated no summer fallow no turnips no red clover and but very little barley lime very sparingly applied plough of the dutch kind and drawn by four horses in a line think planting would thrive well upon the moors and is much wanted laborers high   s per day all the summer months with victuals in haytime and harvest draining advantageous and much practiced done with walls and covered paring and burning not thought good farming farms both set upon leases and at will leases from   to    years no manufactures but spinning cotton which has not as yet proved detrimental to agriculture no agricultural societies but think the people have a turn for improvements  left settle and proceeded to ingleton the land all enclosed and near wholly in grass which was of the richest quality no turnips to be seen since we left patelybridge and hardly a blade of corn in short for these some days from the plenty of grass and scarcity of corn fields we were ready to conjecture that the inhabitants of this part of yorkshire lived upon butcher meat altogether  information received at ingleton  a large common in the neighborhood which is stocked with sheep by the farmers around and which would be of great advantage to have divided land mostly possessed by small proprietors and almost totally kept in grass a good deal of wool spun here for the bradford market  leaving ingleton we proceeded for dentdale the most western extremity of the county upon the road we called upon bryan waller esquire at maisongill from whom we had the following accounts of the husbandry in his neighborhood  soil a strong loam and from the wetness of the climate unfit for ploughing  generally possessed by small proprietors and partly set upon leases of     and   years land set here by the customary acre   acres of this measure being equal to   statute acres small tithes paid in kind and a modus taken in lieu of hay the farmer allowed but to plough a small part of the land often but eight acres where he possesses a hundred ploughing more practiced formerly but breeding and feeding cattle is now thought more profitable no turnips cattle fed in the house during the winter months upon hay which renders beef very high in the spring a number of scotch cattle wintered upon the pastures which are disposed of by midsummer  the commons are stocked with scotch sheep the large breed being thought above the pasture cattle that are bred here are all of the long horned kind no land watered here  thinks it would be hurtful in this cold country very little fallow and no attention paid to the plough lime applied to the pasture grass and mixed with earth and cow dung  the remainder of the dung laid upon the field that has been cut for hay plough wrought with three horses often sour and all yoked in a line land all enclosed except the commons partly with hedges and partly with stone dykes  enclosing has increased rents greatly a great deal of waste land in the moors which he cannot say is improvable as planting is not found to answer wages high  laborers   s   d per day and victuals during haytime and harvest some of the lands are drained  shoulder drains have been found to answer upon mossy soil where it is improper to put stones but in general all drains are built with walls and covered with flags thinks paring and burning not good farming wood very scarce in this part of the country farm houses rather stand too much in the villages and therefore inconvenient some cotton mills which employ a good number of hands  no other manufactures does not think the people trouble their heads much about improvements and thinks the present stock of sheep well adapted for the soil and climate  continued our journey to dent  a great deal of good land but the general quality of the soil thin and moist bottom learned that there was a considerable quantity of butter salted in this tract and disposed of at skipton upon our road this day saw two rams in an enclosure chained together which is an excellent scheme to make them settle arrived at dent after a tedious and disagreeable journey having in the course of it passed through a small part of lancashire and traveled about eight miles in the county of westmoreland  we entered dent dale from the west and proceeded down the dale to the town of dent which is nearly in the center this dale is entirely surrounded with high mountains and has only one opening from the west where a carriage can enter with safety it is about    miles in length and from one and a half to two miles in breadth the whole dale is enclosed and viewed from the higher grounds presents the picture of a terrestrial paradise  at dent we received the following information relative to the state of the dale  estates are small and chiefly in the natural possession of the proprietors enclosures small and mostly in grass no farms above l  0 a year and none but yearly leases granted sheep mostly from scotland few cattle are fed but a great number of milk cows are kept and large quantities of butter and cheese produced the hills in the neighborhood of the dale are all common and dividing them among the different proprietors it is supposed would be attended with beneficial consequences a considerable quantity of stockings wrought by women upon wires which are disposed of at kendal very few turnips cultivated hay being the chief dependence in winter small tithes only drawn in kind and a modus taken in lieu of the great ones  returned from dent to ingleton where we met agreeable to appointment with mr ellershaw of chapel le dale about four miles from this place mr ellershaw gave us the first account of watering land which is done by him and several of his neighbors to great advantage he floats it early in the spring which not only rots the moss but enriches the land considerably the commons here are all stinted every man who enjoys a privilege upon them being restricted to the quantity of stock he is to put on them there is not much land limed in the neighborhood and what is done is applied very sparingly few or no leases granted and where they are but of short duration tithes drawn in kind but mr ellershaw thinks it would be for the peace and interest of the community to have them valued no turnips raised sheep generally of the scotch kind wool sold at   s   d per stone this season some stockings knit for the kendal market  visited settle again on our road to skipton from mr yorks steward at long preston we learned that they had pared and burned a great deal of the higher grounds which had turned out well and had tried wheat but found it did not answer oats is now their principal crop after them the land is fallowed and limed and laid down with grass seeds their management in other respects being similar to the rest of the country it is unnecessary to repeat it at gargrave half way between settle and skipton we saw most excellent fields of grass it is impossible to say what sorts of seeds had been sown or whether any had been sown at all they seemed a mixture of all sorts of hayseeds but richer grass cannot grow  arrived at skipton this place which stands in the middle of the district of craven is for distinction usually called skipton in craven  at skipton there is a large house employed in sorting and combing wool about  000 packs are bought each season from lincolnshire nottingham leicester and rutland shires after it is sorteo and combed it is spun at the companys mills at linton and addingham in the neighborhood and made into stuffs viz shalloons calimancoes and all sorts of double goods the noyles from the combing are used for the duesbury and rochdale trade  we received the following information from mr hales steward to the earl of thanet  the proprietors in the vale are the duke of devonshire lord thanet and a number of small freeholders farms of different sizes but the majority rather small soil deep and rich the whole vale almost in grass being from the wetness of the climate accounted unfit for corn what land is ploughed is upon the higher grounds and oats the principal crop few or no turnips cultivated all the vale enclosed enclosures small cannot say whether enclosing has affected population or not as it is such a long time since the vale vas enclosed no common fields here but thinks wherever they are they ought to be divided wages high  laborers from    d to   s per day women   s not much paring and burning  does not approve of it very little wood but thinks a great part of the moors might be planted to advantage provisions high beef being at this time   d and often   d and   d corn brought here from richmond in the north riding roads good farm houses in general well situated lord thanets estate upon lease of    years duke of devonshire grants none lord thanet formerly granted leases for    years and the estate was much improved other estates where leases have not been granted are not half so much improved the covenants laid down by lord thanet are only to fallow lime and manage in a husbandlike manner no manufactures except some cotton mills which have done no harm to the agriculture of the country grass lands in the vale set from  0 s to  0 s per acre and some at l  plough yoked with three horses  no oxen used thinks it would be for the general good that leases were always granted and also that the payment of tithes was regulated upon proper principles  the management from paitleybridge to the western extremity of the county is almost uniformly the same and grass the sole object the people unanimously think that corn will not pay so much rent as grass therefore raise very little except upon the higher grounds and at the same time lay all their manure upon the rich fertile fields in the vale by this means they are reduced to the absolute necessity of purchasing corn at an advanced price from other places where more attention is paid to the cultivating it from what we could learn a great deal more corn was formerly raised than now which is evident from tithes having decreased fourfifths in value within these thirty or forty years  we learned from the rev mr wethnell that the husbandry at keightly is much in the same style as here only rather more corn raised and that the moors and highgrounds are used for breeding cattle  from skipton proceeded down wharfdale to otley for the first four miles the soil is barren moor and perfectly unimproveable unless planting will answer which from the highness of the situation is very doubtful unless the larch will prosper at addingham the soil turns good and the whole way to otley remarkably rich at sir james ibbelsons at denton there are fine large haughs of grass and the enclosures larger than we have seen in yorkshire saw some corn fields upon the road but not in good order and a few fields of fallow not half wrought observed some turnips the first we have met with for a long time examined a plough the first we have seen these four days and it appeared to be of the dutch or rotheram kind but of wretched construction the field it was lying in was full of quickens  provincially whickens the land almost wholly enclosed  at otley we received a variety of information  we give the substance of it   soil very good climate dry some large proprietors but a greater number of small ones farms chiefly small few above l  0 rent land mostly employed in pasture and sown with white clover and hayseeds little land watered but understood some people have done it to good effect when land is broke up from grass three crops are taken and then a fallow few turnips are cultivated some lime used harvest early land all enclosed and thought much more valuable than when open field wood much scarcer than formerly but a great deal of the waste land might be planted to advantage tithes compounded at   s and   s per acre rent of land here  0 s per acre and all public burdens want of leases greatly complained of some cotton mills which have done good by employing young people a common lately divided in the neighborhood which has turned out well  arrived at leeds  leeds is situated on the river air it is a very ancient and populous town and was of considerable repute during the saxon government the woollen manufactory has flourished here for several ages which has both enriched the inhabitants and increased the value of all the land in the neighborhood  the following is the most accurate accounts we could procure of the state of husbandry near leeds  the soil variable  a great part of it good generally loam upon a clay bottom climate dry land possessed by small proprietors and mostly occupied by manufacturers a few of what are here called large farmers having from  00 to   0 acres of land land employed partly in pasture partly in meadow and a proportion in tillage but ought to be all in grass upon account of the great demand from leeds for milk some clover and ryegrass sown the stock kept upon the pastures are cows and horses belonging to the manufacturers part of the land watered and turns out well grains cultivated are wheat barley oats and beans also some rape and turnips which are generally sown broadcast a few beans are drilled fallowing much practiced large quantities of potatoes raised and a great demand for them much lime is used and both grass and fallow dunged an excellent manure is got from the sizing boilers waste which is the bones and remains of sheep feet cows feet and sloughs of horns horses only used  seed time and harvest early land mostly enclosed and rents greatly raised thereby enclosures from   to   acres and the smallest ones most valuable being possessed by clothiers who have no use for large ones enclosing in a manufacturing county must increase population very little waste land but what might be improved by dividing and enclosing wages  masons    s to    s per week carpenters the same millwrights    s to    s and day laborers   s to    s journeymen clothiers each from   s to    s per week ploughmen l    per annum with victuals and beer very little paring and burning unless where commons are newly divided  the expense from    s to    s per acre not much wood as land can be used to far greater advantage otherwise provisions high  beef   d and   d and much higher in spring roads in general but tolerable owing to their being let to undertakers who neglect them houses for manufactures well constructed and a great many more wanted few leases  when granted their duration from   to    years the nature of the covenants in them is that the tenant pays all taxes keeps all in repair is bound not to break up any grass land under penalties that run from   s to l 0 per acre and to have at least twothirds of the farm in grass upon the tillage part he must not take above   crops without fallowing and all the fallows must be limed  broad cloth and other different manufactures are carried on here which have greatly increased rents there are no agricultural societies but the people have a great turn for improvements  the expense is not regarded several enclosure bills have passed for moors in the neighborhood which have produced the most beneficial consequences tithes both small and great drawn in kind but the general opinion is that a compensation in money in place of them would operate as a great encouragement to improvements it was also the opinion of our informers that a general enclosure bill upon proper principles would be of great public utility as by it they said much expense would be saved to individuals houses would be provided for manufacturers and the people prevented from emigrating  left leeds and proceeded to bradford rather more corn land than we have as yet seen during the survey but all in bad order a good deal of oak wood about kirkstall abbey about   miles from leeds observed a plough at work and drawn by   stout horses all in a line the plough of a very indifferent construction and taking a very ebb furrow not the depth of what   horses will do when yoked properly abreast  the land very much damaged by the large sweep the horses took when turning saw another plough upon a soft moor going with   horses  a very ebb furrow but the straightest we have as yet seen in yorkshire indeed in those parts of the country we have hitherto surveyed ploughs are so scarce that they may almost like horses at venice be shown as a curiosity  information got at bradford  the nature of the soil various some parts being rich loam and others of a cold watery quality climate healthful land is possessed by small proprietors and occupied by small farmers and manufacturers it is almost all in grass and the seeds sown are mostly those called natural hayseeds cows are the principal stock that is kept where the land is in tillage wheat and beans are sown in small quantities but oats are the principal crop some good farmers adopt the modern rotation of turnips barley clover and wheat fallowing is practiced but often in a very slovenly manner and the rotation in that case is wheat oats and oats or wheat beans and oats the country is all enclosed enclosures small few exceeding   acres and by them the country has both been enriched and the land improved laborers wages   s per week ploughmen l    per annum with victuals lodging and washing paring and burning only practiced where heath ground is broke up few leases are granted those that are are generally for    years and the covenants are to lime all the fallows not to take more crops than   to keep the premises in repair not to sell hay straw or manure provincially tillage and not to assign no practices can be pointed out here that would be of advantage in other districts the inhabitants having both their minds and capitals fixed upon trade  arrived at halifax  the whole country from bradford to this place being almost a continued village roads bad ever since we lest leeds and materials very scarce observed most of the roads are provided with a footpath paved with free stones which is a most useful measure but strange to tell every person upon horseback uses the footpaths the first person we saw going upon these large polished stones at full speed we thought wrong in the head and every moment expected his horse would come down and break the riders neck but a short time convinced us that it was the universal practice  halifax is a large and populous town and is situated upon the river calder it stands upon a gentle descent from east to west which makes it pleasant and convenient the houses are in general built of brick though freestone appears to abound in the neighborhood and as little attention appears to have been paid to the laying out the town at first the streets and buildings are rather irregular and confused the woollen manufacture has here flourished for near three centuries and though the soil in the neighborhood has been originally barren and probably for that reason was chosen as a proper place for carrying on manufactures yet the industry of the people has been so great as to improve almost every spot near the place thereby making good the old proverb that a barren soil is an excellent whetstone to promote industry  the parish of halifax is in the warpentake of morley and consists of    townships or hamlets the parish is of great extent and supposed equal in size to the whole county of rutland it is about    miles in length and    in breadth from this extent it clearly appears that the ground must have been a barren waste and the population of small amount when the parish was formed  several parts of the parish afford coals which are absolutely necessary for carrying on that extensive trade for which this neighborhood is famous the air is good and chiefly blows from the west and southwest and often attended with heavy falls of rain but as there is but little level land in the parish the rain which falls soon runs off and of consequence the country is clean and dry which contributes both to the ease and health of the inhabitants  we observed some fences of a very uncommon kind in this neighborhood large flag stones of   feet height set upon their end are fastened in the ground which make a fence both complete and agreeable we cannot speak to the expense but as stones of that kind are here in plenty we suppose a fence of this kind will be comparatively cheap  the cloth hall at halifax is a large building the area being  00 feet in length by   0 in breadth part of it is   stories high the remainder   stories and it contains no less than     different rooms where the manufactures of the town and neighborhood are exposed to sale it is open each saturday at  0 oclock and is shut by    oclock a bell is rung when the market commences and ceases and those who purchase before or after market are liable to a penalty the original cost of the building was l   000 and we were informed that the value of goods in the hall is never considered at less than l  0000 at a time  waited upon william walker esquire at crownest near halifax and examined his improvements which are executed with singular taste and ingenuity mr walker waters his ground with great success and it is all laid off with great attention for this purpose all his enclosures are in perfect order and his farm offices in the neatest condition  mr walker was so kind as to favor us with the following accounts of the husbandry in the parish of halifax  the soil varies much but in general is naturally poor proprietors both large and small farms mostly small and occupied by manufacturers for the convenience of keeping a cow or two for the use of their families and conveying their goods to the mill and to the markets the land is principally in meadow pasture grass and is sown with natural hayseeds ribgrass and ryegrass and where it is not used for the manufacturer as mentioned above it is pastured with a mixed stock of horned cattle and sheep great advantages are found to result from overflowing the meadows at proper seasons and particularly in time of floods land is generally fallowed after the third crop sometimes turnips are taken upon the fallow then barley clover wheat or oats a small quantity of wheat is sown and very few beans the lands except the heath moors are mostly enclosed but there are doubts whether any advantages at all have resulted from enclosing the waste lands in this parish the size of enclosures are in general from   to   acres enclosing in this parish has certainly had no tendency to decrease population the extent of waste ground if we include the heath can scarcely be guessed at it is however very considerable and there is some worth the expense of enclosing for cultivation at any rate it is worthy of consideration whether it is not a desirable object that each freeholders property be ascertained that such as are inclined to improvement may do so by planting or otherwise wages high husbandmen get from    d to  0 d per day in time of harvest   s great attention is paid to draining which is done in a complete manner with stones a very inconsiderable quantity of woodland in this parish price of provisions butter    d beef   d and   mutton   and   d veal   d and   the roads are very bad the houses and offices are built for the accommodation of the manufacturer not of the farmer leases are granted for various terms from   to    years but very frequently no leases at all are granted the principal manufacture here is woollen and worsted goods and some cottons manufactures are the grand object of persons of all descriptions and the land is divided into small farms in aid of the manufacturer there are very few who attend in any degree to the cultivation and improvement of the ground which is regarded only as a secondary object  set off for wakefield the soil appeared thin for a considerable part of the way and rather of an inferior quality at dewsbury the ground turned better and a number of fine fields appeared upon the banks of the calder below this place the road from halifax to wakefield in most shocking condition and the heaviest stage we have traveled observed the materials are of bad quality and that to render them harder a great part of them are burnt before they are laid on the road also that clay was burnt into a kind of brick and used likewise for repairing the roads want of proper materials is a local disadvantage for which the road surveyors can never be blamed they seemed however to us to be carrying on the repairs upon bad principles instead of filling up the old ruts which were very deep and levelling the surface a new covering was laid indiscriminately on which will never bed firmly or consolidate in any situation besides the repairs were carrying on at an improper season for the roads appeared to receive considerable damage from driving the materials  saw   large strong horses this afternoon drawing a light break harrow which might have been easily worked with two the horses go uniformly in a line and seem much stronger than any we saw in the northern parts of the riding  wakefield is a large well built market town and possesses a considerable share of the clothing trade it is very populous and has two market days weekly at which great quantities of cloth wool corn and provisions of all kinds are sold it stands upon the river calder which by an act of parliament school was made navigable as far as this place a canal is at this present time making from hence to barnsley  from wakefield to pontefract the soil is much drier and corn fields more numerous passed a large common field which appeared in very bad order arrived at pontefract and met with a number of intelligent farmers from whom we received much information they all concurred in one sentiment with regard to tithes viz that it would be a material encouragement to improvements if they were commuted also that every common field in the kingdom ought to be divided provisions very high barley sold in the market this day at  0 s per quarter  information received at pontefract about the cultivation of liquorice from mr hally seedsman and nurseryman there  the soil most proper for liquorice is that of a deep light sandy loam it is trenched three feet well dunged and planted with stocks and runners in the months of february and march on beds of one yard wide thrown up in ridges with alleys betwixt them and the beds hoed and handweeded the first year a crop of onions is taken in the alleys and the tops of the liquorice cut over every year the ground is trenched when the liquorice is taken up and all the fibers cut off a considerable quantity more than  00 acres is cultivated in this neighborhood it is a very precarious plant often rotten by wetness and also hurt by sharp frosts in the spring and dry weather afterward rent of the land upon which it is cultivated about   l per acre  mr halley also cultivates rhubarb and has done it to advantage the quality is ed good and he lately received a medal from the society of arts for the culture of it land about pontefract of very fine quality sets from  0 to  0 s per acre and is kept early in equal proportions of pasture and tillage  waited upon mr green at cridling park near ferrybridge mr green rents this farm from one of the colleges at cambridge is a complete farmer and keeps his land in good order but is surdly restricted by his lease from breaking up old grass here we received the following information  soil of various qualities limestone clay and sand being the prevailing ones upon the limestone the following rotation is adopted  st fallow  d barley  d clover  th wheat upon the clay  st fallow  d wheat  d beans  th wheat or oats upon the and turnips barley clover and wheat both estates and farms generally large and the farms kept in equal proportions of pasture and tillage does not water his land but wishes it was in his power as he thinks the practice advantageous a great deal of lime used about    bushels applied to the acre and repeated every fallow the fallow also manured with stable and pigeon dung ploughs of the dutch kind and wrought sometimes with two horses abreast at other times with three abreast and often with four yoked in pairs seed time and harvest early land all enclosed and the size from   to    acres advantages of enclosing great and population increased by it some common fields which would be greatly improved by dividing and enclosing very little waste land servants wages  0 s per week and find themselves in victuals and from   s to   s when kept in the house paring and burning only practiced upon the commons that are taken in and upon old coarse land expense from    s to    s wood sufficient to serve country purposes provisions high beef and mutton about one penny per pound higher in the spring months than at this time of the year farm houses and offices might be greatly improved some leases granted for    years but the practice of giving them from year to year is fast coming in which is both a loss to the farmer and a bar to improvements thinks restrictions in the lease a hardship upon a good farmer the people have a turn for improvements thinks that a general enclosure bill would be of material advantage to the public  proceeded southward for mr gills at natton the lands upon the road of good quality and well farmed fallows clean saw some very large fields of wheat making a vigorous appearance  information from mr gill  soil generally of good quality part of it gravel the rest clay upon a wet bottom about twothirds of the ground kept in tillage and onethird in pasture red and white clover sown with ryegrass breeds a few horses and feeds both cattle and sheep rotation  fallow upon which turnips are taken barley clover and wheat sometimes oats uses a good deal of lime but applies only  0 bushels to the acre brings great quantities of bones from sheffield which is at  0 miles distance and lays on  0 bushels per acre costs from    d to    d per bushel besides carriage plough of the dutch kind and wrought mostly with two horses abreast but sometimes with four in strong land carts of the ordinary construction of the country and drawn by three horses land all enclosed which mr gill thinks of great advantage size of enclosures from   to    acres thinks small enclosures very hurtful there are several common fields in the neighborhood which should be divided and enclosed very little waste land wages of a ploughman l    per annum and victuals a good deal of land is drained big stones being set in the bottom of the drain leaning toward one another and filled up with small stones paring and burning practiced here but the landlords consent must be got  expense  0 s per acre roads generally good and well managed but materials bad funds are   days labor of a team for l 0 rent and   d per pound assessment upon the rent no leases granted which he thinks retards improvements tithes paid for in money at the rate of   s or   s per acre sheep in this neighborhood are either of the scotch kind or purchased at peniston from the moors in the western parts of the county the wool of the former sells for about   d per lb the other   d people have a turn for improvements and know no obstacles but the want of leases and payment of tithes  having a letter for mr spencer stanhope of cannon hall we went there but unluckily he was from home being with the west riding militia at tinmouth barracks called for the steward  who gave it as his opinion that it would be for the public interest that all land was set under lease with proper restrictions we are not fond of introducing into this work subjects that are not connected with agriculture or the state of the country but the inscription which we saw under the picture of a dog in the hall here was so remarkable that we cannot help inserting it  rover a hound the property of john spencer esquire in the year      being very mangy and suspected of madness was condemned to the gallows where on   th august he was hanged for the space of a quarter of an hour by thomas beck the huntsman being let down and some small symptoms of life appearing in him he was tucked up for another quarter of an hour and then thrown into a coal pit  0 yards deep from which he was extracted on the   th november by the said thomas beck alive and in good health  he was twelve weeks and five days in the coal pit   arrived at bretton hall the seat of mr beaumont and experienced the greatest attention from that gentleman he was at the trouble personally to show us a part of his large estate which is farmed in as complete a style as any in yorkshire saw very fine broadcast turnips at mr brooks one of mr beaumonts tenants they were remarkably clean a thing rather uncommon in this country were introduced to several of the tenants whom we found sensible industrious men they were busy sowing their clover leas with wheat their young grasses were making a most vigorous close and equal appearance mr beaumont has a good deal of wood upon his estate which is very thriving and profitable farmhouses and offices are excellently constructed and well situated understood the late sir thomas blacket mr beaumonts fatherinlaw was very attentive to these matters and although he granted no leases was otherwise a kind and indulgent master  examined mr beaumonts flock of sheep those of the shetland breed are not doing well whether the climate is against that kind or not we cannot say but the fact is they are not thriving in body and their wool is fallen off  the ryeland or hereford breed are doing but middling and the peniston or country breed best of all it will be a curious fact if it turns out that the original breed of every country is best adapted to the nature of the soil and climate saw some good sheep at mr hagues one of mr beaumonts tenants mr hague had three sorts one from the duke of newcastle in nottinghamshire one of his own breed and the other of the peniston we thought his own excellent mr hague has got a tup of the bakewell sort with whom he is to cross his own ewes which we thought would produce a capital breed  saw two threshing machines of the small construction each drawn with two horses and making clean work one of them was threshing wheat the other oats and the draught appeared quite easy to the horses  went and viewed a large cloth manufacture at netherton upon mr beaumonts estate the whole progress is here carried on from buying the wool to finishing the goods every thing appeared carried on in a regular manner by mr bryant the manufacturer wool chiefly from norfolk and sussex with some spanish mr bryant has  0 acres of land adjoining his manufactory which he has highly improved by bruised bones and the refuse of the boiled size used in his manufactory  from mr beaumonts steward and tenants we received instructing information relative to the husbandry practiced upon his estate is would take too much of this journal to give the whole of it must therefore content ourselves with an abridgement  the soil is variable chiefly hazle kind of earth mixed with clay and a loamy sand both retentive of water some parts dry and sharp well adapted for turnips which are generally cultivated upon all the fallows and eaten with sheep proprietors here are mr beaumont mr wentworth mr stanhope etc size of farms from   0 to  00 acres land chiefly in tillage onethird only kept in pasture several rotations of crops are practiced  st fallow wheat oats and barley  d turnips barley clover and wheat often hayseeds and white clover is sown with the barley upon which sheep are pastured for two or three years no land watered but thought advisable when opportunity allows manures used are dung lime rape dust and lately a great deal of bones mr hague says bones answer best on the turnip land  00 bushels of bone and four loads of dung mixed with good earth is laid upon a statute acre quantity of lime applied to the acre generally about  0 bushels rape dust one chalder per acre price l      s besides carriage rape often sown for sheep feed but not cultivated for seed at least what is done is in very small quantities carriages with broad wheels are used for the fields and narrow wheels for the roads ploughs used are of the dutch or rotheram kind yoked sometimes with two horses abreast at other times three in a line no oxen used wheat sown from the beginning of october to the end of november sometimes to february after turnips but that season not approved of spring corn in march and april harvest variable generally commences about the   th august and over by michaelmas land chiefly enclosed enclosing of great advantage and thought to be onefourth more value than open field enclosures from two to twenty acres average about ten acres enclosing thought to increase population a few common fields in the

every l 0 rent and   d a pound assessment but this rate may be raised higher by the justices if they see necessary farm houses and offices good and well constructed for serving the purposes of husbandry some manufactures creeping in which are raising wages the people here have a great turn to improvements and have no obstacle but want of leases which from the kindness of their landlord is little felt there is no restriction upon their management that is hurtful but one which prevents them from breaking up their grass land that has lain six years without the landlords consent  mr slinger at emly woodhouse upon mr beaumonts estate practices the drill husbandry both for wheat pease and beans but does not think drilling at all times and in every situation advisable mr slinger uses a machine for threshing his corn which he thinks does the work much better than is done by the flail and which machines are particularly necessary here since wages became so extravagantly high no want of hands in this neighborhood to cut the crop in the year      the scarcity was great in the east riding but felt here no farther than rising wages an enclosing bill lately passed for dividing land near wakefield but as it is not yet put in execution cannot say how it will operate  are unanimously of opinion that all commons ought to be divided as they know some that formerly carried only some beggarly sheep now improved into good fields  arrived at barnsley  barnsley or black barnsley is a town of considerable size and situated in the wapentake of staincross it carries on a considerable trade in wire and has a manufactory for bleaching and weaving linen yarn which is in a flourishing state there is a weekly market held here where corn and all sorts of provisions are sold it being market day when we were there had an opportunity to see the quality of the different grains wheat and barley good but the oats very indifferent which in general we found to be the case over all the west riding  at barnsley we received information from several persons relative to the agriculture of the neighborhood  soil generally clay and gravel climate mild the greatest part of the land in the hand of small proprietors size of farms  0 acres and upwards greatest part of the land in tillage pasture sown with white clover trefoil and hayseeds some red clover which is ploughed down for

bone manure plough of the dutch kind   horses commonly yoked in a line and sometimes   upon the clay land land mostly enclosed the enclosures from   to  0 acres some common fields but thought onethird less in value than enclosed lands paring and burning practiced  thought useful when old grass land is broke up country sufficiently wooded both with oak and ash the people have a turn for improvements if they were not prevented by want of leases and injurious covenants betwixt them and their landlords  the land to the southward of barnsley of the finest quality being either a clay or a loam fit for turnips and a great proportion of it kept in tillage mr hemmingway at wombwell gave us an account of his practice which is very correct he keeps about onefourth of his farm in pasture which is sown down with white clover and hayseeds sometimes sows red clover by itself pastures it in the spring and then lets the crop stand for seed sows white clover for the same purpose and has often   bushels red per acre and   bushels white if good in quality a bushel weighs    lb employs his pasture to support his farm stock and in feeding ewes and lambs  ewes of the long woolled kind from northumberland

moorish soil near the latter place a market for sheep is held and large quantities of those that go by that name are sold weekly they are bred on the moors to the westward of peniston and on those of cheshire and derbyshire  prices at present low and sale dull had a meeting with several farmers who communicated to us the following information concerning the husbandry of the adjoining country  the climate cold and backward to vegetation soil very variable but mostly wet and spongy and a great deal of moor carrying little but heath proprietors small mr bosville of gurthwaite the representative of one of the oldest families in the county being the only large one farms likewise small except upon the moors in the vicinity of the town about one half is ploughed but in the moors there is little or no tillage at all the stock is sheep and long horned cattle of the derbyshire breed which are smaller than the craven breed little grain is cultivated except oats and a small quantity of wheat dung chiefly applied to the meadow land that has been cut for hay and   chalders of lime per acre laid upon the fallows plough wrought with   horses yoked in a line few oxen used seed time and harvest late sometimes november before the harvest is concluded some land about the place enclosed but to the westward it is all common moors which ought at least to be divided and every mans property laid by itself a great deal of the land needs draining but the proper method of doing it not well understood farmers generally debarred from paring and burning but thought a great means of improvement upon some lands few proprietors grant leases but it would be for the advantage of the farmer to have them  the rev mr horsefall in answer to this question said if he was a farmer he would lay out his money more frankly under the security of a lease than if he had none many restrictions are in the leases or yearly bargains  some farmers thought to need them but an active industrious man hurt by limitations  left peniston for sheffield most of the way the soil indifferent  saw some patches of turnips but none of them good road to sheffield high and very unequal fine country to the northward and abounding with oakwood  sheffield is situated upon the river don and has long been a staple place for cutlery ware of all kinds it is a populous town containing not less than  0000 inhabitants the lord of the manor is the duke of norfolk who likewise possesses a large estate in the neighborhood  information from mr peach at the angel inn who occupies several farms  soil generally of a deep clay and from the quantity of manure very rich  climate moderate some great proprietors such as the duke of norfolk but a number of small freeholders in the neighborhood most part of the farms are small and the duke of norfolk is reducing their size as fast as the leases expire for the convenience of the inhabitants about a third part of the land is kept in tillage grasses sown for pasture are white clover and hayseeds and red clover and a little ryegrass for cutting rotation practiced by mr peach is after breaking up his pasture land  oats winter tares oats again frequently wheat pease and then summer fallow which is ploughed as often as possible limes most of the fallows from derbyshire with   fivehorse wagon loads per acre the prime cost of which is l    s carriage l   0 s in all l     s

gives them victuals also enclosing a great improvement and increases population no common fields here but thinks them bad things a great deal of waste land within a few miles of the town which would be valuable if divided and enclosed leases generally granted here  the duke of norfolk grants them for    years where they are not granted thinks there is no encouragement to improve thinks there should be no restrictions in any lease but for the last   years  provisions high beef and mutton   d veal   d and much higher in spring is not fond of paring and burning unless in particular situations drains a great deal in wet bottoms lays brushwood first and stones above roads generally bad but more attention paid to them since the mailcoach came this way  thinks the agriculture of the neighborhood is greatly improved by trade and manufactures they provide a large quantity of additional manure and a good market for the produce which much more than compensates for the increase of wages occasioned by them  waited upon john booth esquire of brushhouse about three miles from sheffield who obligingly favored us with the following information  soil in this neighborhood a hazle loam well calculated for turnips  climate middling  average gage of rain    inches in a season which is about a medium betwixt what falls in lancashire and on the east coast large proprietors are the duke of norfolk earl fitzwilliam and countess of bute but there is a number of small freeholders farms small in the neighborhood of sheffield from  0 to  0 acres near that place threefourths of the land is in pasture and at a greater distance about onehalf some red clover and ryegrass is sown but the general practice is to sow white clover with hayseeds the pasture grass is chiefly stocked with milk cows and a few sheep which are mostly of the peniston breed little land is watered but approves of it when it can be conveniently practiced rotation of crops most approved of is turnips barley clover and wheat fallow practiced but not on a large scale unless in case of turnips a great deal of bone dust used  0 bushels to the acre at    d per bushel but has done it to the extent of  0 bushels per acre with advantage ploughs with two horses abreast does not approve of the large carts and wagons and thinks carts of a smaller construction of more utility to the husbandman wages for laborers are  0 s per week and a free house mowing corn from   s to  0 s per acre grass   s no want of hands for harvest work approves of paring and burning on old grass land expense    s per acre country not sufficiently wooded a great deal more wanted duke of norfolk has about   00 acres of wood in this parish cuts once in    years and leaves a number of trees of different ages each cutting  thinks if the waste lands and moors were divided planting upon them would thrive and do well roads might be greatly improved surveyors recommended by a vestry meeting and reports made of the work annually farm houses and offices improperly constructed and badly situated often built at random without any attention paid to the situation or convenience of the farm most part of the proprietors here grant leases and think it impossible to practice good farming without them thinks many of the covenants in the leases are destructive to improvements manufactures of great use to agriculture no agricultural societies here at present but remembers one formerly at sheffield which subsisted for a number of years several enclosing bills have lately passed for fields in this neighborhood which have produced very beneficial consequences thinks people have a turn for improvements  information from mr odey at darnhill near sheffield  soil in general loamy and inclined to moisture and the land in the immediate vicinity of sheffield chiefly employed in pasture hay and gardens all grains cultivated but no regular rotation little land fallowed in this neighborhood manures used are stable dung lime and bone dust fresh land when taken up is sown with wheat then beans and continued under the same crops as long as possible difference betwixt common field and enclosed land of similar quality l    per cent paring and burning practiced even upon the stubbles which are often pared every year the country not sufficiently wooded owing to the great demand from the manufacturers leases generally granted from    to    years restricted in general by them to keep twothirds in grass manufactures have a good effect on agriculture but the manufacturing interest preponderates so much here that agriculture becomes only a secondary object thinks that tithes are a hardship and a great bar to the improvement of agriculture when mr odey first occupied this farm only four loads of wheat were produced upon the acre but now owing to the improvements made by him at a great expense twelve loads are produced  bone dust or as it is here called hand tillage is used to great extent upon all the fields for twenty miles round sheffield bones of all kinds are gathered with the greatest industry and are even imported from distant places they are broke through a mill made for that purpose are sometimes laid on the ground without any mixture but it is supposed most advantageous to mix them up with rich earth into a compost and when fermentation has taken place is the proper time to lay them on the ground we also heard of another manure which can never be more than a local one viz the refuse of hogs bristles from the brush manufactories one gentleman informed us that he had manured four acres with this refuse and that its effect greatly surpassed that of street dung which the rest of the field had been covered with  leaving sheffield we came to rotheram which is a place famous for iron works examined several farms in the neighborhood which are generally in good order particularly that of mr tailor at canklaw mills this farm is held upon a lease of    years from the duke of norfolk and appears under excellent management  mr tailor deals largely in the turnip and grass husbandry his land intended for turnips next season had when we were there november  th got three ploughings and appeared almost as clean as many summer fallows his enclosures are in capital order all hedges being neatly dressed and completely fencible keeps a great many sheep which are of the dishley breed and his pastures are of fine quality being as close at the bottom as if  0 years old although but newly sown down  at aldwark near rotheram we received the following information from mr wigfull  the soil about two or three miles round this place is in general a rich hazle loam and the climate is warm and dry the principal proprietors are the duke of norfolk duke of leeds earl fitzwilliam earl of strafford mr foljambe and the messrs walkers but there are also a great number of small proprietors farms small in size being mostly from  0 to  0 acres and kept nearly in equal proportions of pasture and tillage the grasses cultivated are chiefly white clover and hayseeds red clover is sown by itself and reserved for seed not many cattle or sheep bred in the neighborhood but a good number of horses since they advanced in price all kinds of grain are cultivated here and the general rotation is fallow or turnips barley clover and wheat the manures used are stable dung rape dust bone dust horn shavings etc land mostly enclosed which mr wigfull thinks has increased the value of land onefourth the wages here are high ploughmen  0 s per week besides drink laborers eighteen pence and two shillings per day farm houses and offices are very improperly situated they ought to be placed if possible in the middle of the farm and not in a corner as at present the public roads are generally good but a number of the by ones are in miserable order manufactures of iron and steel are carried on in the neighborhood to great extent which are found to produce good effects upon agriculture by increasing the riches of the country and consequently affording a ready market for every article the farmer raises the people have a great turn for improvements but their genius is cramped for want of leases and by injurious restrictions laid on them by the proprietors tithes are generally drawn here in kind both small and great mr wigfull suggested that it would be a great improvement in other places of the country to introduce the sowing winter ares which are excellent spring food for horses when their keep is very dear and was likewise of opinion it would be a great improvement in his own neighborhood if the corn was cut lower which would not only take the crop up much cleaner but also be the means of accumulating a large additional quantity of manure  mr wigfull was of very great service to us during our stay in the neighborhood and was the means of introducing us to a large company of intelligent farmers at the house of mr john hall at icklea from whom we received most interesting information we here give an abstract of it  the majority of farms are small and about twothirds of them kept in tillage a variety of grasses are sown such as red and white clover trefoil rye grass and above all hayseeds these seeds when intended for pasture are sown very thick no less than eighteen pounds weight white clover and three quarters of hayseeds to the statute acre cattle are of the long horned breed but most of the pasture is eat by sheep of the bakewell kind which breed is fast spreading in this part of the country very little land watered here but the practice thought advantageous and in proper situations esteemed of equal value to a top dressing of manure all sorts of grains are cultivated red wheat especially rotation turnips upon the dry land otherwise summer fallow barley clover wheat oats or pease four crops generally taken to a fallow a great deal of lime used applied at the rate of one hundred bushels per acre expense  0 s almost the whole land enclosed which is supposed an advantage equal to onethird and is the means of increasing population paring and burning much practiced expense    s per acre  farm houses and offices in general very badly constructed and improperly situated people have a great turn for improvements but are prevented by the following obstacles want of leases restrictions in the mode of management which hinders the farmer from exerting his abilities and introducing new practices and tithes when taken in kind mr hall informed us that the tithes of wheat were sometimes commuted for fifteen shillings per acre when the landlords rent was only twelve shillings mr hall has a rape mill and manufactures a great deal of oil which is generally sold to lancashire purchases rape seed in the east riding and norfolk present price l   per quarter and five quarters often raised upon an acre  having a letter from sir john sinclair to earl fitzwilliam we proceeded to wentworthhouse but unluckily his lordship was in northamptonshire delivered the letter to mr bounds his chief steward who paid us every attention and from whom we received full information relative to the management of his lordships large and valuable estate mr bounds was at the trouble of bringing some of the principal farmers in the neighborhood to us from whom we received full and accurate answers to the different queries we had circulated the following is the substance of the intelligence we received  soil variable both clay upon a wet bottom and a hazle loam farms small not many above l  00 rent and chiefly kept in tillage not above a fourth part being in pasture grasses cultivated are natural hayseeds white clover and tresoil little red clover sown both sheep and cattle fed upon the pastures the cattle are generally of the craven breed sheep partly of the polled sort and a good many from the moors above peniston general rotation of crops is turnips barley clover and wheat where the land is strong it is clean summer fallowed and sown with wheat at michaelmas of all the manures that are used bone dust is sound to have the most effect  0 bushels applied to the acre and often bought so high as  0 d per bushel ploughs and carts are of the common sort the carts are   feet in length   feet   inches in breadth and   feet   inches deep and will hold   chalder or    bushels generally drawn by   horses in a line few oxen wrought lord fitzwilliam uses some but the farmers use horses from their being most expeditious land mostly enclosed the advantages of which are great being estimated equal to l    per cwt the enclosures are small being regulated by the size of the farms few townships but what have common fields and these ought to be divided not much waste land but what is of this kind is highly improvable wages very high ploughmen l    a year besides victuals drink and washing laborers   s per day in summer and    d in winter drains of various sizes and filled with stones but the extent depends upon the goodness of the farmer a good farmer always drains where necessary a bad one neglects it in all situations paring and burning practiced upon strong rush land but thought bad husbandry upon light soils a good deal of wood in the country but from being too early cut woods are turning weaker and weaker cut one in    years a part being left each cutting some trees left to the age of  0 years a few particular ones longer mostly used in the collieries provisions at present high beef and mutton   d per lb wheat   s   d per bushel barley   s oats   s and beans   s farm houses and offices in general properly constructed for the size of the farms and stock kept leases seldom granted no agricultural societies but the people have a great turn for improvement the principal obstacle to which is paying tithes in kind there are few estates in the neighborhood exempt from paying both small and great tithes but they are more usually compounded for than drawn in kind the greatest benefits that have been produced from enclosing open fields and waste land are in those places where the great and small tithes have been commuted for either in land or money  from a paper communicated to us we can speak with precision upon the nature of the covenants that are here entered into by landlord and tenant  the tenant covenants to keep all the buildings and fences in repair to pay all parliamentary and parish taxes not to plough up grass land without consent of the landlord not to take more than   crops of corn before a fallow to lay    cart loads of dung upon every acre so fallowed not to sell any hay straw or other fodder from off the premises but eat and consume the same thereupon to spread all the manure arising from the premises upon some part thereof and leave the last years manure thereupon the landlord covenants to allow the tenant on quitting his farm which is by the custom of the country at candlemas what two indifferent persons shall deem reasonable for what is generally called full tillage and half tillage being for the rent and assessments of his fallow ground the ploughing and managing the same the lime manure or other tillage laid thereon the seed sown thereupon the sowing and harrowing thereof also for the ploughing harrowing manuring and managing any turnip fallow which he may leave unsown also for any clover seed sown on the premises and the harrowing and rolling in of such seed and for every other matter and thing done and performed in a husbandrylike manner on such fallow lands in the two last years of the terms also for the last years manure left upon the premises and for any manure and tillage laid upon the grass land  the custom of the country is now so well established for the tenant to have all the beforementioned allowances on quitting his farm that the land is at all times in a proper state of cultivation and the incoming tenant always prefers paying such allowances to the entering upon a farm in an impoverished and mismanaged state  wentworth house is situated between rotheram and barnsley and is one of the largest and most magnificent houses in the kingdom it is unnecessary here to give any description of it as mr young in his northern tour has already given a very just and complete account of it it is surrounded by a park which we were told consisted of   00 acres carrying grass of the most exquisite quality and upon which large droves of cattle sheep and deer are fed  returning back by rotheram we proceeded for parkhill the seat of michael angelo tailor esquire m p we were received by mr tailor with the greatest kindness walked over a number of the adjoining fields with him and received much valuable information from him respecting the husbandry of the neighborhood  the soil here is thin rather wet and upon limestone few turnips are cultivated and they are all sown broadcast mr tailor showed us a mill for breaking bones which are in great repute in this neighborhood and found to answer better upon limestone land than any other manure sixty bushels are applied to the acre has very little effect the first year but afterward operates for a considerable time  we think  0 or    years prime cost at the mill    d per bushel and the demand greater than can be supplied road from rotheram till we came near parkhill very bad and all cut into deep tracts a considerable part of it was almost impassable saw some common fields of good natural quality near a place we think called maltby which were under very bad management  substance of information received from mr arch tailor farmer at letwell near parkhill  the soil is a thin limestone and the climate moderate farms in general too small which mr tailor thinks is the cause they are occupied by a number of poor bad farmers as they are not worth the notice of a man of any property twothirds of the land is kept in pasture which is sown with common hayseeds white clover and frefoil and fed with the leicester breed of sheep and long horned cattle mr tailor does not think the long horned kind good for milk but considers them to answer best upon his thin wet ground mr taylors mode of farming is to plough six years and graze five years when he breaks up his swarth applies   chalders or  0 bushels of lime to the acre and sows turnips for the first crop  d barley  d clover or pease and beans  th wheat  th clean summer fallow  th wheat with grass seeds the first year of the grass it is pastured with sheep and manured in the following winter next year cut for hay from which a good crop of seeds is got  d  th and  th years it is pastured with sheep mr tailor said it was not usual to grant leases but thinks a farmer has no encouragement to improve wanting them lands in this neighborhood subject both to great and small tithes which mr tailor says damps every spirit of improvement mr tailor uses a great deal of bone dust  0 bushels of which mixed with some short manure is sufficient for an acre although it is a very expensive dressing yet as it is very durable he considers himself well paid for the application does not much practice paring and burning as he considers it to impoverish the soil the land is all enclosed and has been so for near one hundred years size of enclosures from   to  0 acres cannot say whether enclosing has decreased population or not being so long since it took place  from parkhill to bautry the road is good passed by sandbeck the seat of the earl of scarborough and found the name of the place corresponded with the nature of the soil  information at bautry  soil generally of a sandy nature well adapted for turnips carrots and other drilled crops the land is mostly in tillage and occupied by small farmers and tradesmen mr fisher informed us he sows red and white clover and ryegrass but that the greatest part of the pastures are sown with hayseeds the people having an antipathy to ryegrass rotation of crops here are turnips barley clover and rye which answers well upon soft sandy soil manures are dung and bone dust the fallows are limed with two chalders or sixtyfour bushels to the acre ploughs wrought with two horses abreast mr drummond here works oxen saw one drawing his watercart and working quite calm and docile the carriages generally used are upon sixinch wheels and drawn with three or four horses lands all enclosed which sets for double rent but the enclosures by far too small the land here does not stand much in need of draining but where it is wanted the drains are filled with brick paring and burning practiced upon new taken in land expense when done by the plough   s per acre    s when done by the hand and   s for spreading few leases granted mr fisher informed us he took a farm and upon the faith of its not being raised made considerable improvements but as soon as these improvements were discerned the rent was raised immediately  therefore mr fisher thinks the want of leases must always be a bar in the way of improvements the tithes are commuted at about   s per acre the great tithes belong to the duke of norfolk and the small ones to the clergy there was lately a society at bautry for improving agriculture which did much good but it has been given up for two years past  waited upon mr drummond here who is a complete gentlemanfarmer and has all his operations carried on in the most perfect and accurate style his fold yard is nicely constructed and his offices are numerous and convenient the fold yard is paved and having a gentle slope to the middle where there is a reservoir with a pump fixed into which all the moisture produced from the dung is accumulated and drove out in a barrel daily to his pasture fields care is at same time taken to keep every drop of water that falls upon the houses from going to the dunghill as spouts for carrying off the rain are placed round the whole fold mr drummonds attention to his manure cannot be too much commended as in many places not the least care is paid to collecting it properly in short we venture to recommend mr drummond as a most perfect pattern to every gentlemanfarmer although we have our doubts whether the expensive nature of his buildings are not too much for being followed in the common routine of husbandry operations  from bautry to doncaster the land is of a light sandy nature upon a wet springy bottom a great part of it has been lately enclosed and the fences in general not thriving turnips very bad and little care taken to have the land laid dry as we observed much water standing on the fields  doncaster is a neat clean town and there is a deal of fine land in the neighborhood of it  information received at doncaster from mr parkinson and mr foster  there is a great variety of soils in this neighborhood a good deal of a sandy nature part of it a white clay and others black earth or a fine sharp light loam the climate is mild and dry and both seedtime and harvest are early the farms are generally small and mostly kept in tillage the pastures have usually been sown with natural hayseeds but artificial grasses fast coming into practice few horses or cattle are bred and the improvement of sheep but just beginning to be attended to the rotation of crops upon the light land is turnips barley clover and wheat and often a crop of oats taken after the wheat because there are no leases upon the clay land a clean summer fallow barley clover and wheat and often wheat taken as the first crop in place of barley manures used are stable dung lime street dung bone dust rape dust and pigeon dung  about  0 bushels of the last laid upon an acre lime applied to the fallow from  0 to  00 bushels per acre  costs threepence per bushel no oxen are used but this supposed to be owing to the smallness of the farms land mostly enclosed which has produced great advantages enclosures from two to thirty acres but chiefly small there is a very large common field near doncaster of the finest land in england which is at present let at    s   d per acre that mr foster thinks would be worth l   0 s if divided and enclosed more than twenty freeholders concerned about it their common rotation is fallow barley wheat and rye and grassseeds are sown at different times with all the grains another common field is managed differently the rotation is greatly superior being turnips barley clover and wheat  the turnips all broadcast and the most part of them this season are bitter bad upon a third common field another rotation is adopted viz fallow one half of which is sown with wheat and the other with barley then beans and clover lastly wheat and there is a meadow field which after being cut for hay is pastured in common from the  0th september to the   th march  above   00 acres are under the above mode of management the proprietors are sir geo cook who possesses about onehalf mr wrightson who has oneeighth and a number of small freeholders very few leases are granted which both mr parkinson and mr forster think detrimental even to the interest of the proprietor himself as land in that case would set higher no manufactory here except one for coarse sacking but where they do prevail they are thought to have good effects in encouraging agriculture great improvements may be made upon the stock and land in this neighborhood mr parkinson is of opinion the horse for the team might be improved by the derbyshire breed and that the cattle might be improved by crossing the durham cows with the best of the craven bulls  with regard to sheep  the bakewell sort esteemed best for all the sandy and limestone pastures and a cross of the large tees ewes with the bakewell ram for the strong clay soils mr parkinson thinks the grass land is not sown down properly being hitherto sown with nasty rubbish called hayseeds whereas he is of opinion it should be done with white clover trefoil and ryegrass and where intended for cutting with red clover and a small quantity of rye grass thinks also that turnips should be drilled by which method the land is kept much cleaner and hoed at far less expense than when broadcast  waited upon william childers esquire at cantley lodge and examined his improvements the farm in mr childers own possession which is tithefree consists of   0 acres and by fallowing with turnips and laying down with plenty of grass seeds he has made uncommon and substantial improvements mr childers brings manure from doncaster and uses great quantities of lime he has also a marley clay in his own lands which he applies to the dry gravelly and sandy soils at the rate of  0 and  00 cart loads to the acre which produces good effects  from doncaster eastward to thorn the land is capable of greater improvement than any we have seen in yorkshire there is a great deal of common field superior in quality to most land and there is also large tracts of waste at hatfield there are very large common fields the rotation upon which is turnips barley clover wheat and barley and one of the fields not ploughed but kept in meadow grass we examined the turnip field which consisted as we were told of   0 acres and although of a soil exceedingly proper for that root they were a crop not worth  0 s per acre we heard afterward they were only valued at    s the turnips were quite small  few bigger than an egg and the ground in the most wretched and dirty condition it appeared to us they had not been hoed at all or at least very imperfectly a large proportion was covered with weeds and worse culture cannot be figured  if the cultivation was bad the manner of consuming them was still worse the whole   0 acres were eating at once and the stock appeared to be cattle and sheep of all ages and descriptions such management needs no comment it speaks for itself  betwixt hatfield and thorn there are great quantities of waste land and much under water upon the whole the land we have seen this day stands in the greatest need of improvement which cannot be done without a previous division the common fields to the eastward of doncaster are abominably crooked and unequal some parts of the ridges being twice the breadth of another and one solitary ridge of wheat often standing by itself  more wretched husbandry could not have existed a century ago  we received the following information at thorn  the proprietors are chiefly small copyholders holding of lady irwin farms mostly small and the greater part kept in tillage the pasture generally employed in supporting farm stock and a few cattle for the butcher the soil is chiefly clay and the climate moderate but foggy and damp rotation upon the farm land is turnips barley clover wheat and barley but in the common fields every man sows what he thinks best some rape is sown which is generally allowed to stand for seed the common fields here set at  0 s per acre besides public burdens but from the goodness of the land thought to be able to pay more if they were divided and enclosed a great deal of waste land in the three parishes of thorn hatfield and fishlock amounting at least to  000 acres which is all capable of great improvement wages high  ploughmen l    and victuals laborers   s   d and   s and no scarcity of hands the tithes are either drawn in kind or valued annually    s per acre is usually paid for corn fields and a small modus taken for grass hay and turnip  left thorn and proceeded northward to snaith  most parts of the land till we came within two miles of that place are exceeding wet and large tracts little better than in a state of nature the land though wet and marshy is generally rich strong soil  ridges much straighter ploughed than is generally the case over the west riding but kept by far too narrow and flat crossed the river don upon a wooden bridge a part of which turns upon a pivot and gives a passage for the numerous shipping that navigate this river as we approached snaith the soil turned as fine as could be wished  great quantities of turnips and those of good quality  snaith is a small market town situated upon the river air not far from its conjunction with the don the land round the place is of exceeding rich quality and but moderately rented we examined a farm occupied by mr john latham and found it exceedingly well cultivated mr latham upon his light lands practices a rotation that has already been often mentioned viz turnips barley clover and wheat but he follows out this rotation in a manner superior to most persons his turnip crop this year when so many other peoples have failed is good and are set to a jobber from leeds at l  per acre to be eat upon the ground his turnips although not drilled are all in rows about sixteen inches wide which enables him to hoe them with greater accuracy  his method to do this is to give the last furrow very broad which takes all the seed when harrowed into the furrow and so gives the field an appearance of regularity mr latham said this plan was fallen on by accident which indeed is often the parent of many improvements  when ploughing one of his fields some years ago he ordered his servants to finish it that night there being a feast in the neighborhood the ploughmen were anxious to be early at it and so gave a furrow much broader than usual when the young plants came up mr latham was surprised to see them in regular lines and inquired into the cause of it which pleased him so well that he has since continued the practice  mr latham sows rape upon his wheat stubbles that are next year to be turnips his method is to plough the field as soon as the wheat is carried off and sow the rape immediately which is generally got down by the middle of september and affords him feeding for his sheep in spring equal in value to  0 s per acre  a part of mr lathams farm is what is called warpland or land enriched with the sediment left by the river air when its banks are overflown upon such fields he does not venture to sow wheat as it stands in danger of being perished but from the richness of the soil great crops of spring corn are raised  mr latham is a most able and complete farmer his fences are all good the whole of his land clean his pastures rich and luxuriant we are happy to have this opportunity of expressing the high sense we entertain of his merit and abilities  from snaith to ferrybridge there are a number of common fields which were under no better management than those we have formerly described we saw a large common field of turnips to the eastward of kellington which were middling good but very imperfectly cleaned at least  0 acres were stocked off at once and cows bullocks young cattle and sheep were feeding indiscriminately saw also upon this road some fields of rape intended for seed which looked well  waited upon richard slater milnes esquire m p for york at his house at fryston from his information and that of others the following account of the husbandry in the neighborhood of ferrybridge is given  the soil is composed of limestone clay sand etc in the valleys and rich pasture and meadow lands near the rivers the land is chiefly possessed by large proprietors such as lord mexborough mr mills mr crow etc farms contain from  0 to  00 acres and mostly kept in tillage large quantities of red clover and sainfoin are sown for cutting which answer well and white clover trefoil and hayseeds are sown for pasture some lucern is sown but the quantity inconsiderable many horses are kept on account of the collieries lime works drawing vessels along the river air and other purposes besides that of husbandry which consume the red clover and sainfoin the pasture enclosures are generally stocked with sheep and the lands near the water side are eaten by milk cows  rotation of crops upon the clay land is wheat or barley upon the fallow and afterward oats or beans no more than two crops are taken to a fallow unless the land is of superior quality turnips are sown upon the tithe land and followed with barley clover and wheat the manures used are stable dung pigeon dung and sometimes bone dust a great quantity of limestone is burned at knallingley and brotherton which is laid on from two or three chalders per acre ploughs are of the usual kind kept in the country and generally drawn by two horses abreast carts with wheels of     and   inches broad and drawn by three and by four horses in a line are used very few oxen are wrought and those only by gentlemen land mostly enclosed but the enclosures thought too small enclosing is reckoned to produce the following advantages it enables the possessor to cultivate the land in a superior style which in its open state it was out of his power to do from such cultivation a greater produce is obtained and on the light soils the turnip clover and seed husbandry cannot otherwise be practiced to advantage provisions are cheaper here than in the manufacturing part of the country at least one halfpenny per pound roads both turnpike and by ones are in good condition sometimes the assessment for supporting them is    d per pound upon the valued rent much improvement has been made by draining and great attention paid to it the farm houses and offices are in general very inconveniently situated most of them are in villages which of course renders a number of them at a great distance from the land some leases are granted but it is not the general practice to give them for more than one year no modes of husbandry prevail here that would be of advantage to other places except sowing sainfoin which answers well upon all chalky or limestone land some bills have passed for dividing common lands which have produced great advantages plentiful crops have been raised at little expense and an opportunity given of laying down the old going land into grass also an exemption from tithes is procured by them  we proceeded to selby this is a populous market town situated upon the river ouse and was the birth place of king henry i on which account his father william the conqueror built an abbey here from john foster esquire we received the following important intelligence relative to the agriculture of this part of the country  the soil is various part of it sandy and part a hazle clay the climate is moderate the proprietors are lord petre the archbishop of york and a great many copyholders farms are small and kept in equal proportions of pasture and tillage all sorts of grasses are cultivated which are used both in breeding and feeding sheep are generally of the northumberland kind and the cattle of the short horned or holderness breed great numbers of horses are bred the rent of the land is from   s to  0 s per acre rotation of crops when land is broke up from grass flax is generally the first crop then rape afterward wheat and a fallow but no fixed rotation is kept ploughs of the common kind drawn by two horses are used but a number of oxen are wrought in the wagons there are no common fields in this parish but many in the neighborhood the difference of value betwixt open and enclosed lands is estimated at onethird or    per cent here is a considerable deal of waste ground which produces little or nothing at present but is capable of great improvement strict attention is necessary in keeping the ditches clean and letting the water off the fields which are greatly hurt by rain water stagnating upon them but as there are no spouts little other draining is required provisions are plenty and moderate roads tolerable great improvements have lately been made upon them farm houses and offices are well enough constructed but very improperly situated as they are mostly in villages a number of landlords do not grant leases which is destructive to good farming  mr foster informed us that woad for dyers is raised in the neighborhood of selby among red clover when it is in full bloom it is pulled by women and boys who go before the mowers it is placed in small heaps with the tops uppermost and when completely dried is put into the barn and sold to the dyers from    d to   s per stone woad grows well on all lands fit for turnips and is sometimes taken by itself as a crop  large quantities of potatoes are raised here they are all of the kidney kind and no less than seven or eight thousand tons are annually exported from the banks of the ouse for the london market  a great deal of flax is grown near selby which is almost all cleaned and dressed in the country a small proportion is allowed to stand for seed  we received the following information from mr james foster farmer at wiston  the soil is very indifferent there is warp occasioned by the sediment left by the overflowing of the river ouse there is loam or a mixture of clay and sand but not very deep and also some clay and sandy soils there are both large and small proprietors and none of the farms are large land is employed both in pasture and tillage generally in equal proportions there is not much ryegrass sown hayseeds being more esteemed sheep are both bred and fed on the pastures fleece weighs from   to  lb avoirdupois and sold to the manufacturers in the western parts of the riding at   d and   d per pound  the rotation of crops is fallow wheat beans and oats or turnips barley grass seeds and oats as suits the soil some rape is sown the land after being fallowed and dunged is sown about the first of september with half a peck or three quarterns of seed per acre the produce is from four to five quarters and sold from    s to  0 s per quarter mr foster sows a considerable quantity of flax the produce per acre is from    to  0 stone of   lb avoirdupois of rough dressed flax and sold from   s to  0 s per stone little or no seed is preserved the flax is all scutched by the hand there being no mills for that purpose in this part of the country dung is brought by water from hull prime cost and expense is nearly l   per acre lime is used in large quantities   0 bushels being applied to the acre expense l  0  there are no common fields he thinks on the general question that enclosing renders land of onethird more value wages run from    d to   s per day  no drinkings allowed excepting in harvest wheat is cut with the sickle at the rate of   s per acre but he is of opinion it would be a great advantage and profit to cut it much lower than is usually done supposing the expense should be more barley and oats are cut with the scythe  expense of cutting binding etc   s per acre there are few covered drains there being no springs but great occasion for ditching and griping to carry off the top water few leases are granted and mr foster thinks in the general that these are absolutely necessary where improvements are carried on he is of opinion he would be able to give more rent for his farm if he was not under restrictions and that no restrictions ought to exist in a lease but for the three last years  the people have a great turn for improvements and he knows of no other obstacles but the above two and the mode by which tithes are at present paid no enclosing bills have lately passed for land in this neighborhood but from the advantages he has seen take place in consequence of such bills he is of opinion that all the waste land in the kingdom ought to be divided immediately  we proceeded for tadcaster great part of the country is upon a limestone and lies very well but the ridges in general are too flat and no attention paid to letting off the water we saw several common fields after passing sherborn at which place great quantities of the winesower plum grows the country appeared very thinly inhabited few or no houses being to be seen till we arrived in the immediate neighborhood of tadcaster  at tadcaster we were recommended to a mr potter as one of the best farmers in that place and we found that his practice was accurate and correct in the highest degree we received the following information from him  the soil is a dry limestone the climate kindly and moderate the proprietors mostly have large estates but the farms are small few extending to  00 acres the greatest part of the land is in tillage not above onethird being in pasture the grasses sown are red and white clover trefoil and sainfoin ryegrass is out of repute and hayseeds fast following sheep are kept upon the pasture land and cattle fed upon turnips no land is floated or watered general rotation of crops is turnips barley clover and wheat often a crop of oats taken after the wheat the manures used are dung made upon the farm and gathered at tadcaster some lime brought by water from hull and horn shavings from york the ploughs are of the dutch kind and drawn by two horses abreast no oxen used but those kept by lord hawke the sowing of wheat commences about the end of september and continues all the month of october spring crops are sown as early as possible the harvest is early here are some common fields and mr potter supposes the difference of value betwixt open and enclosed land to be onefourth enclosures are small few exceeding ten acres there is a good deal of waste land some of which is under division and capable of great improvement the wages of a laboring man is   s per week ploughmen get l  0 per year besides victuals and washing the head man gets equal to l  0 per year hours of labor are  0 in summer and   in winter paring and burning are very seldom practiced a great quantity of the winesower plum grows in this neighborhood farmhouses and offices might often be more conveniently situated mr potter thinks it would be highly beneficial to the public interest that all land was set under lease and further thinks there is no necessity for imposing restrictions on the good farmer as he will manage much better wanting them and as for the bad farmer he cannot be mended by them the people here have a great turn for improving their lands but have no opportunity of doing this to purpose from the want of leases he thinks the small size of the farms serves to retard good management  we received also information from another gentleman about the husbandry in the neighborhood of tadcaster but as he only corroborates what mr potter has already said it is unnecessary to repeat it  waited upon mr beck steward to lord hawke upon his estate of scarthingwell and twton  his lordship has taken about   00 acres into his own hands and is very properly putting it into good order by fallowing manuring and laying parts of it down with grass seeds with a view to set it in proper sized farms to substantial tenants besides the manure raised on this farm his lordship has expended yearly above three hundred pounds in purchasing manure principally dung from the towns and villages in his neighborhood and by water from hull york etc we use the freedom to recommend to his lordships attention that the land now in hand will make four very complete farms and that after the outlines of each are marked out the farmhouses and offices should be placed as near as possible in the center of each farm keeping always in view the convenience of good water an attention to these things is an important object of agricultural economy and we now understand lord hawke has not only always had these ideas but that specific spots have long since been set out where the buildings will at a proper time be erected  we select from the information communicated by mr beck and lord hawke the following particulars  the soil is of many different kinds it is good loam in general there is also clay upon limestone strong clay upon a blue till hazle earth upon sand and about  0 acres of moss or peat earth upon lord hawkes estate about a fourth part is kept in pasture though less pasture in general is kept he cultivates sainfoin red clover and trefoil with white clover and hayseeds he bred   0 sheep last year and has this year increased his breeding ewes to   0 they are of the oxford and gloucestershire polled breeds they have a cross also of the bakewell and fowler breeds and the wethers are fed off when shearing at    s each he folds his ewes always from mayday to michaelmas he feeds also a few scotch and irish cattle the general rotation of crops is turnips barley clover and wheat his plan now adopted is to sow half his clover land with twelve pounds of red clover per acre to mow it once and then feed it the other half is sown with  lb of white clover   lb of ribgrass and  lb of trefoil per acre and fed but not mown by this rotation of crops red clover is sown but once in eight years on the same land his plan is to lay down one hundred and fifty acres to sainfoin the seed of which he sows with his barley and has sometimes sown it on a clean fallow when the ground laid down with sainfoin would have been broken up for wheat had it been sown with clover he breaks up an old wornout pasture ground and sows it in the spring following with oats after which it is fallowed and falls regularly into course instead of the ground sown down with sainfoin the manures used are rape dust pigeon farmyard and bought dung by lord hawke soot rape bonedust and farmyard dung by mr beck lord hawke ploughs with two oxen abreast without a driver and sometimes with horses but depends principally and almost entirely on oxen for his ploughing and harrowing his land in hand is all enclosed enclosures vary from   to  0 acres there are some small pastures from   to   we think small arable enclosures hurtful in a corn country and lord hawke is altering and enlarging the size of his fields from    to  0 acres mr beck is of opinion that enclosing is very beneficial and never can decrease population lord hawke had land in a common field for which he got only   s   d per acre and can let the same land when it is now divided and enclosed at  0 s wages are high house servants cost in board and wages l  0 per annum draining is much required here but for want of a law to oblige neighbors to clean out their contiguous ditches it cannot be done to advantage although lord hawke is attempting it and has induced many to drain with him paring and burning are practiced on old grass land and thought an excellent method of breaking up all coarse sward lord hawke approves of it on low grounds but on high ground thinks burning unnecessary and rather detrimental the old farmhouses and offices are badly constructed and inconveniently situated being built in villages but lord hawke has built for his own use a large farmyard conveniently formed and situated with a threshing machine a mill for grinding rapecake and stabling for twentyfive horses and thirtytwo oxen besides cow sheds barns for hay and corn etc the whole is walled in by walls nine feet high and coped with stone and divided by the barns stables etc into four yards two of which have ponds besides the pumps the stables for horses are placed on the east and west side of the farmyard which is free from buildings on the south and sheltered on the north by the barn and oxhouses which separate it from the principal stackyard this yard is divided from the two others by open haybarns tiled whith slate eaves and with chimnies also of brick to let out the steam the average of the boarded granaries amounts in length to one hundred and sixty feet and in breadth to twentyone there are trapdoors contrived in them to let down the corn when sacked into wagons which may be loaded and locked up at the same time the corn is stacked on wooden frames placed on stone pillars and caps lord hawke still proposes to make further improvements to it and to pull down a cottage now placed at the western extremity of it and build a house in its place for his steward the whole covers from an acre to two acres of ground mr beck is of opinion when land is set it should be by leases of    years at least and that shorter ones are productive of bad consequences to both parties as time is wanting to improve and reap the benefit mr beck thinks that restrictions in the lease where the tenant is a man of abilities and property are a bar to improvement but for the safety of the proprietor it is necessary that onethird of the farm be left in grass properly laid down after fallow or turnip with a sufficiency of seeds as might be mutually agreed upon  a particular species of plum grows here and in the neighborhood called the winesower it grows well both upon gravel and limestone is hardy a good bearer and answers upon any soil but does not bear so well nor its flavor so good on any as on limestone or gravel on a strong deep land the trees run too much to wood and do not bear fruit in proportion these plums blossom better than any other sort and are produced from suckers the fruit sells from    s per peck when sound and good to   s   d when cracked and damaged they are very easily hurt by rain  left tadcaster and took the road westward to harewood observed some common fields by the way the land in general is upon a wet bottom and from the late rains and the little attention paid to clearing out the furrows is in a very bad situation  we delivered a letter to mr samuel poplewell steward to lord harewood and received satisfactory information from him harewood is a neat little village his lordships residence is a little distance from it he grants no leases but is esteemed a kind landlord  the following is the substance of information received from mr poplewell  the soil is generally clay upon a bottom retentive of moisture the climate showery and wet land is chiefly possessed by large proprietors and occupied by tenants paying from l  0 to l  00 yearly rent it is employed both in pasture and in tillage in proportions nearly equal the pastures are mostly eaten by sheep which are purchased from northumberland their fleece sells from   s   d to   s many scotch and irish cattle are fed upon the sides of the river wharfe upon the tillage land two crops are generally taken to a fallow and turnips sown upon all the fallows proper for them mr poplewell drills his turnips and has never missed a crop since he practiced that method the manures used are home made dung rape dust malt coombs and dung and soot from leeds little lime is used excepting on new broken up land ploughs are generally drawn by three horses in a line no oxen are used for work excepting a few by lord harewood some rape is sown which is often eaten by sheep but sometimes stands for seed here are no common fields but there are some in the neighborhood which he thinks should be divided he estimates the difference betwixt the value of open and enclosed land to be at least    per cent he also is of opinion that it would be of great service to agriculture if all lands were set under lease and that if these were granted there would be no necessity for restrictions unless during the concluding years a bill passed about three years ago to divide a common in this neighborhood which has produced beneficial consequences and mr poplewell is of opinion most part of the waste land in the riding might be improved by planting scotch firs upon it  we arrived at wetherby which is a great thoroughfare on the london road here we received the following information  the soils in this neighborhood are limestone and strong clay there are a few small freeholders but the land almost wholly belongs to the duke of devonshire farms are generally small the most part not exceeding l  0 per annum rent is about  0 s per acre and the public burdens rotation of crops upon the limestone is turnips barley clover and wheat on the clay fallow wheat and beans the manures used are great quantities of rape dust price   s   d per bushel horn shavings from york soot and all the dung that can be collected at home lime is applied to the fallow  00 bushels to the acre it costs   s   d per chalder of    bushels ploughs are of the common kind and drawn by two horses upon the limestone and by three and four upon the clay land no oxen are used harvest is early begins generally about the first of august and is all finished by the middle of september the land is all enclosed the size of enclosures from   to    acres wages are high ploughmen that are masters of their work get fifteen guineas per annum besides victuals and laborers never less than    d per day and more in harvest no scarcity of hands to reap the crop excepting in the year      the corn is mostly cut with the sickle wheat is done for   s per acre provisions are plenty but high priced farmhouses and offices are improperly situated as they are all placed at the corner of the lordship  the duke of devonshire formerly granted leases but now intends to act otherwise which we were told would be a great bar to improvements the covenants that formerly subsisted were to keep twothirds in grass tithes are generally commuted here and   s per acre paid in their place  in our route northward we again visited boroughbridge and knaresborough and received additional information relative to the husbandry practiced in their respective neighbourhoods  we arrived at rippon  this is a place of great antiquity being it is said incorporated by king alfred and is a pleasant and well built town the river ure was made navigable to this place about twenty years ago and a number of vessels are employed thereon to the great convenience and benefit of this place and neighborhood  we received the following information from mr peacock at lendrick near this place  the soil near rippon is partly of a sandy nature and partly strong clay upon a limestone the climate healthy and moderate estates are generally large and farms of various sizes from  0 to l 00 yearly rent the lands are mostly in grass and meadows little more than the fourth part being kept in tillage artificial grasses are just beginning to be introduced into the husbandry of this neighborhood a few cattle of the short horned kind are bred and a good many long woolled sheep which when fatted at two years of age will weigh    lb per quarter the rotation of crops is turnips barley clover hayseeds and wheat upon the light and sandy soils and on the strong soils fallow wheat and beans lime and common dung with a little rape dust are the only manures used a large heavy plough drawn by   and   horses yoked in pairs is employed upon the strong lands upon the light soils a smaller plough drawn by two horses is used the country is mostly enclosed enclosures are from   to  0 acres mr peacock thinks land when enclosed is of double value to that of similar quality when lying in common field there are some thousand acres of waste or common in the neighborhood most of which is capable of great improvement wages for laborers are at   s per day in summer and from   s to   s   d in winter little of the country requires draining but where this improvement is necessary it is well attended to plenty of materials for this purpose being at hand the  price of butcher meat is   d per pound  farmhouses and offices lately erected are in general good and conveniently situated but those that have stood long are not so mr peacock thinks that the principal obstacles to improvements are the want of leases of a proper duration and the restrictions from ploughing up the old grass fields which effectually prevents any new systems of husbandry from being introduced  no
