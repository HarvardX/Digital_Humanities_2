has here a much more correct and complete copy of the dunciad than has hitherto appeared i cannot answer but some mistakes may have slipped into it but a vast number of others will be prevented by the names being now not only set at length but justified by the authorities and reasons given i make no doubt the authors own motive to use real rather than feigned names was his care to preserve the innocent from any false applications whereas in the former editions which had no more than the initial letters he was made by keys printed here to hurt the inoffensive and what was worse to abuse his friends by an impression at dublin  the commentary which attends this poem was sent me from several hands and consequently must be unequally written yet will have one advantage over most commentaries that it is not made upon conjectures or at a remote distance of time and the reader cannot but derive one pleasure from the very obscurity of the persons it treats of that it partakes of the nature of a secret which most people love to be let into though the men or the things be ever so inconsiderable or trivial  of the persons it was judged proper to give some account for since it is only in this monument that they must expect to survive and here survive they will as long as the english tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of queen anne and king george it seemed but humanity to bestow a word or two upon each just to tell what he was what he writ when he lived and when he died  if a word or two more are added upon the chief offenders it is only as a paper pinned upon the breast to mark the enormities for which they suffered lest the correction only should be remembered and the crime forgotten  in some articles it was thought sufficient barely to transcribe from jacob curl and other writers of their own rank who were much better acquainted with them than any of the authors of this comment can pretend to be most of them had drawn each others characters on certain occasions but the few here inserted are all that could be saved from the general destruction of such works  of the part of scriblerus i need say nothing his manner is well enough known and approved by all but those who are too much concerned to be judges  the imitations of the ancients are added to gratify those who either never read or may have forgotten them together with some of the parodies and allusions to the most excellent of the moderns if from the frequency of the former any man think the poem too much a cento our poet will but appear to have done the same thing in jest which boileau did in earnest and upon which vida fracastorius and many of the most eminent latin poets professedly valued themselves  a letter to the publisher occasioned by the first correct edition of the dunciad it is with pleasure i hear that you have procured a correct copy of the dunciad which the many surreptitious ones have rendered so necessary and it is yet with more that i am informed it will be attended with a commentary a work so requisite that i cannot think the author himself would have omitted it had he approved of the first appearance of this poem  such notes as have occurred to me i herewith send you you will oblige me by inserting them amongst those which are or will be transmitted to you by others since not only the authors friends but even strangers appear engaged by humanity to some care of an orphan of so much genius and spirit which its parent seems to have abandoned from the very beginning and suffered to step into the world naked unguarded and unattended  it was upon reading some of the abusive papers lately published that my great regard to a person whose friendship i esteem as one of the chief honors of my life and a much greater respect to truth than to him or any man living engaged me in enquiries of which the enclosed notes are the fruit  i perceived that most of these authors had been doubtless very wisely the first aggressors they had tried till they were weary what was to be got by railing at each other no body was either concerned or surpised if this or that scribler was proved a dunce but every one was curious to read what could be said to prove mr pope one and was ready to pay something for such a discovery a stratagem which would they fairly own might not only reconcile them to me but screen them from the resentment of their lawful superiors whom they daily abuse only as i charitably hope to get that by them which they cannot get from them  i found this was not all ill success in that had transported them to personal abuse either of himself or what i think he could less forgive of his friends they had called men of virtue and honor bad men long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them bad writers and some had been such old offenders that he had quite forgotten their persons as well as their slanders till they were pleased to revive them  now what had mr pope done before to incense them he had published those works which are in the hands of every body in which not the least mention is made of any of them and what has he done since he has laughed and written the dunciad what has that said of them a very serious truth which the public had said before that they were dull and what it had no sooner said but they themselves were at great pains to procure or even purchase room in the prints to testify under their hands to the truth of it  i should still have been silent if either i had seen any inclination in my friend to be serious with such accusers or if they had only meddled with his writings since whoever publishes puts himself on his trial by his country but when his moral character was attacked and in a manner from which neither truth nor virtue can secure the most innocent in a manner which though it annihilates the credit of the accusation with the just and impartial yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accuser i mean by authors without names then i thought since the danger was common to all the concern ought to be so and that it was an act of justice to detect the authors not only on this account but as many of them are the same who for several years past have made free with the greatest of names in church and state exposed to the world the private misfortunes of families abused all even to women and whose prostituted papers for one or other party in the unhappy divisions of their country have insulted the fallen the friendless the exiled and the dead  besides this which i take to be a public concern i have already confessed i had a private one i am one of that number who have long loved and esteemed mr pope and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings which we ever thought the least valuable part of his character but the honost open and beneficent man that we most esteemed and loved in him now if what these people say were believed i must appear to all my friends either a fool or a knave either imposed on my self or imposing on them so that i am as much interested in the confutation of these calumnies as he is himself  i am no author and consequently not to be suspected either of jealousy or resentment against any of the men of whom scarce one is known to me by sight and as for their writings i have sought them on this one occasion in vain in the closets and libraries of all my acquaintance i had still been in the dark if a gentleman had not procured me i suppose from some of themselves for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies the passages i send you i solemnly protest i have added nothing to the malice or absurdity of them which it behooves me to declare since the vouchers themselves will be so soon and so irrecoverably lost you may in some measure prevent it by preserving at least their which we have done in a list in the appendix titles and discovering as far as you can depend on the truth of your information the names of the concealed authors  the first objection i have heard made to the poem is that the persons are too obscure for satire the persons themselves rather than allow the objection would forgive the satire and if one could be tempted to afford it a serious answer were not all assassinates popular insurrections the insolence of the rabble without doors and of domestics within most wrongfully chastised if the meanness of offenders indemnified them from punishment on the contrary obscurity renders them more dangerous as less thought of law can pronouce judgment only on open facts morality alone can pass censure on intentions of mischief so that for secret calumny or the arrow flying in the dark there is no public punishment left but what a good writer inflicts  the next objection is that these sort of authors are poor that might be pleaded as an excuse at the old baily for lesser crimes than defamation for it is the case of almost all who are tried there but sure it can be none for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputation supplies the want of it in himself i question not but such authors are poor and heartily wish the objection were removed by any honest livelihood but poverty is here the accident not the subject he who describes malice and villainy to be pale and meagre expresses not the least anger against paleness or leanness but against malice and villainy the apothecary in romeo and juliet is poor but is he therefore justified in vending poison not but poverty itself becomes a just subject of satire when it is the consequence of vice prodigality or neglect of ones lawful calling for then it increases the public burden fills the streets and highways with robbers and the garrets with clippers coiners and weekly journalists  but admitting that two or three of these offend less in their morals than in their writings must poverty make nonsense sacred if so the fame of bad authors would be much better than that of all the good ones in the world and not one of a hundred had ever been called by his right name  they mistake the whole matter it is not charity to encourage them in the way they follow but to get em out of it for men are not bunglers because they are poor but they are poor because they are bunglers  is it not pleasant enough to hear our authors crying out on the one hand as if their persons and characters were too sacred for satire and the public objecting on the other that they are too mean even for ridicule but whether bread or fame be their end it must be allowed our author by and in this poem has mercifully given em a little of both  there are two or three who by their rank and fortune have no benefit from the former objections supposing them good and these i was sorry to see in such company but if without any provocation two or three gentlemen will fall upon one in an affair wherein his interest and reputation are equally embarked they cannot certainly after they have been content to print themselves his enemies complain of being put into the number of them  others i am told pretend to have been once his friends surely they are their enemies who say so since nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done but of this i cannot persuade my self when i consider the constant and eternal aversion of all bad writers to a good one  such as claim a merit from being his admirers i would gladly ask if it lays him under a personal obligation at that rate he would be the most obliged humble servant in the world i dare swear for these in particular he never desired them to be his admirers nor promised in return to be theirs that had truly been a sign he was of their acquaintance but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse than ignorance in the author of the essay on criticism be it as it will the reasons of their admiration and of his contempt are equally subsisting for his works and theirs are the very same that they were  one therefore of their affertions i believe may be true that he has a contempt for their writings and there is another which would probably be sooner allowed by himself than by any good judge beside that his own have found too much success with the public but as it cannot consist with his modesty to claim this as a justice it lies not on him but entirely on the public to defend its own judgment  there remains what in my opinion might seem a better plea for these people than any they have made use of if obscurity or poverty were to exempt a man from satire much more should folly or dullness which are still more involuntary nay as much so as personal deformity but even this will not help them deformity becomes an object of ridicule when a man sets up for being handsome and so must dullness when he sets up for a wit they are not ridiculed because ridicule in itself is or ought to be a pleasure but because it is just to undeceive and vindicate the honest and unpretending part of mankind from imposition because particular interest ought to yield to general and a great number who are not naturally fools ought never to be made so in complaisance to a few who are accordingly we find that in all ages all vain pretenders were they ever so poor or ever so dull have been constantly the topics of the most candid satirists from the codrus of juvenal to the damon of boileau  having mentioned boileau the greatest poet and most judicious critic of his age and country admirable for his talents and yet perhaps more admirable for his judgment in the proper application of them i cannot help remarking the resemblance betwixt him and our author in qualities fame and fortune in the distinctions shown to them by their superiors in the general esteem of their equals and in their extended reputation amongst foreigners in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate as he has had for his translators persons of the most eminent rank and abilities in their respective nations essay on criticism in french verse by general hamilton the same in verse also by monsieur roboton counselor and privy secretary to king george i after by the abbe reynel in verse with notes paris    0 rape of the lock in french paris      in italian verse by the abbe conti a noble venetian and by the marquess rangoni envoy extraordinary from modena to king george ii others of his works by salvini of florence etc his essays and dissertations on homer in french paris      but the resemblance holds in nothing more than in their being equally abused by the ignorant pretenders to poetry of their times of which not the least memory will remain but in their own writings and in the notes made upon them what boileau has done in almost all his poems our author has only in this i dare answer for him he will do it in no more and on his principle of attacking few but who had slandered him he could not have done it at all had he been confined from censuring obscure and worthless persons for scarce any other were his enemies however as the parity is so remarkable i hope it will continue to the last and if ever he shall give us an edition of this poem himself i may see some of em treated as gently on their repentance or better merit as perault and quinault were at last by boileau  in one point i must be allowed to think the character of our english poet the more amiable he has not been a follower of fortune or success he has lived with the great without flattery been a friend to men in power without pensions from whom as he asked so he received no favor but what was done him in his friends as his satires were the more just for being delayed so were his panegyricks bestowed only on such persons as he had familiarly known only for such virtues as he had long observed in them and only at such times as others cease to praise if not begin to calumniate them i mean when out of power or out of fashion as mr wycherley at the time the town declaimed against his book of poems mr walsh after his death sir william trumbull when he had resigned the office of secretary of state lord bolingbroke at his leaving england after the queens death lord oxford in his last decline of life mr secretary crags at the end of the south sea year and after his death others only in epitaphs  a satire therefore on writers so notorious for the contrary practice became no man so well as himself as none it is plain was so little in their friendships or so much in that of those whom they had most abused namely the greatest and best of all parties let me add a further reason that though engaged in their friendships he never espoused their animosities and can almost singly challenge this honor not to have written a line of any man which through guilt through shame or through fear through variety of fortune or change of interests he was ever unwilling to own  i shall conclude with remarking what a pleasure it must be to every reader of humanity to see all along that our author in his very laughter is not indulging his own ill nature but only punishing that of others to his poem those alone are capable of doing justice who to use the words of a great writer know how hard it is with regard both to his subject and his manner vetustis dare novitatem obsoletis nitorem obscuris lucem fastiditis gratiam i am  your most humble servant william cleland st jamess dec         dennis rem on pr arth i cannot but think it the most reasonable thing in the world to distinguish good writers by discouraging the bad nor is it an illnatured thing in relation even to the very persons upon whom the reflections are made it is true it may deprive them a little the sooner of a short profit and a transitory reputation but then it may have a good effect and oblige them before it be too late to decline that for which they are so very unfit and to have recourse to something in which they may be more successful  the persons whom boileau has attacked in his writings have been for the most part authors and most of those authors poets and the censures be has passed upon them have been confirmed by all europe character of mr p       gildon pref to his new rehears it is the common cry of the poetasters of the town and their fautors that it is an illnatured thing to expose the pretenders to wit and poetry the judges and magistrates may with full as good reason be reproached with ill nature for putting the laws in execution against a thief or impostor  the same will hold in the republic of letters if the critics and judges will let every ignorant pretender to scribbling pass on the world  theobald let to mist jun         attacks may be levelled either against failures in genius or against the pretensions of wriing without one  concanen ded to the auth of the dunc a satire upon dullness is a thing that has been used and allowed in all ages  out of thine own mouth will i judge thee wicked scribler  martinus scriblerus of the poem this poem as it celebrated the most grave and ancient of things chaos night and dullness so is it of the most grave and ancient kind homer says aristotle was the first who gave the form and says horace who adapted the measure to heroic poesy but even before this may be rationally presumed from what the ancients have left written was a piece by homer composed of like nature and matter with this of our poet for of epic sort it appears to have been yet of matter surely not unpleasant witness what is reported of it by the learned archbishop eustatbius in odyss k and accordingly aristotle in his poetic chap   does further set forth that as the iliad and odyssey gave example to tragedy so did this poem to comedy its first idaea  from these authors also it should seem that the hero or chief personage of it was no less obscure and his understanding and sentiments no less quaint and strange if indeed not more so than any of the actors in our poem margites was the name of this personage whom antiquity records to have been dunce the first and surely from what we hear of him not unworthy to be the root of so spreading a tree and so numerous a posterity the poem therefore celebrating him was properly and absolutely a dunciad which though now unhappily lost yet is its nature sufficiently known by the infallible tokens aforesaid and thus it does appear that the first dunciad was the first epic poem written by homer himself and anterior even to the iliad or odyssey  now forasmuch as our poet had translated those two famous works of homer which are yet left he did conceive it in some sort his duty to imitate that also which was lost and was therefore induced to be stow on it the same form which homers is reported to have had namely that of epic poem with a title also framed after the ancient greek manner to wit that of dunciad  wonderful it is that so few of the moderns have been stimulated to attempt some dunciad since in the opinion of the multitude it might cost less pain and oil than an imitation of the greater epic but possible it is also that on due reflection the maker might find it easier to paint a charlemagne a brute or a godfry with just pomp and dignity heroic than a margites a codrus a fleckno or a tibbald  we shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our poet to this particular work he lived in those days when after providence had permitted the invention of printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned paper also became so cheap and printers so numerous that a deluge of authors covered the land whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily molested but unmerciful demands were made of his applause yea of his money by such as would neither earn the one or deserve the other at the same time the liberty of the press was so unlimited that it grew dangerous to refuse them either for they would forthwith publish slanders unpunished the authors being anonymous nay the immediate publishers thereof lay sculking under the wings of an act of parliament assuredly intended for better purposes  vid bossu du poem epique chapter    now our author living in those times did conceive it an endeavor well worthy an honest satirist to dissuade the dull and punish the malicious the only way that was left in that publicspirited view he laid the plan of this poem as the greatest service he was capable without much hurt or being slain to render his dear country first taking things from their original he considers the causes creative of such authors namely dullness and poverty the one born with them the other contracted by neglect of their proper talent through selfconceit of great abilities this truth he wrappeth in an allegory ibid chapter    as the construction of epic poesy requires and feigns that one of these goddesses had taken up her abode with the other and that they jointly inspired all such writers and such works book   verse    etc  he proceeds to show the qualities they bestow on these authors and the effects they produce ver    to     then the materials or stock with which they furnish them verse    to     and above all that selfopinion verse  0  which causes it to seem to themselves vastly greater than it is and is the prime motive of their setting up in this sad and sorry merchandise the great power of these goddesses acting in alliance whereof as the one is the mother of industry so is the other of plodding was to be exemplified in some one great and remarkable action bossu chapter      and none could be more so than that which our poet has chosen the introduction of the lowest diversions of the rabble in smithfield to be the entertainment of the court and town or in other words the action of the dunciad is the verse      removal of the imperial seat of dullness from the city to the polite world as that of the aeneid is the removal of the empire of troy to latium but as homer singing only the wrath of achilles yet includes in his poem the whole history of the trojan war in like manner our author has drawn into this single action the whole history of dullness and her children to this end she is represented at the very verse    to  0   opening of the poem taking a view of her forces which are distinguished into these three kinds partywriters dull poets and wild critics  a person must next be fixed upon to support this action who to agree with the said design must be such an one as is capable of being all three this phantom in the poets mind must have a name k he seeks for one who has been concerned in the politic journals written bad plays or poems and published d bossu chapter   vide aristot poetic c   low criticisms he finds his name to be tibbald and he becomes of course the hero of the poem  the fable being thus according to best example one and entire as contained in the proposition the machinery is a continued chain of allegories setting forth the whole power ministry and empire of dullness extended through her subordinate instruments in all her various operations  this is branched into episodes each of which has its moral a part though all conducive to the main end the crowd assembled in the second book demonstrates the design to be more extensive than to bad poets only and that we may expect other episodes of the patrons encouragers or paymasters of such authors as occasion shall bring them forth and the third book if well considered seems to embrace the whole world each of the games relates to some or other vile class of writers the first concerns the plagiary to whom he gives the name of more the second the libellous novellist whom he styleth eliza the third the flattering dedicator the fourth the bawling critic or noisy poet the fifth the dark and dirty partywriter and so of the rest assigning to each some proper name or other such as he could find  as for the characters the public has already acknowledged how justly they are drawn the manners are so depicted and the sentiments so peculiar to those to whom applied that surely to transfer them to any other or wiser personages would be exceeding difficult and certain it is that every person concerned being consulted apart has readily owned the resemblance of every portrait his own excepted  the descriptions are singular the comparisons very quaint the narration various yet of one color the purity and chastity of diction is so preserved that in the places most suspicious not the words but only the images have been censured and yet are those images no other than have been sanctified by ancient and classical authority though as was the manner of those good times not so curiously wrapped up yea and commented upon by most grave doctors and approved critics  as it bears the name of epic it is thereby subjected to such severe indispensable rules as are laid on all neoterics a strict imitation of the ancient insomuch that any deviation accompanied with whatever poetic beauties has always been censured by the sound critic how exact that imitation has been in this piece appears not only by its general structure but by particular allusions infinite many whereof have escaped both the commentator and poet himself yea diverse by his exceeding diligence are so altered and interwoven with the rest that several have already been and more will be by the ignorant abused as altogether and originally his own  in a word the whole poem proves itself to be the work of our author when his faculties were in full vigor and perfection at that exact time when years have ripened the judgment without diminishing the imagination which by good critics is held to be punctually at forty for at that season it was that virgil finished his georgics and sir richard blackmore at the like age composing his arthurs declared the same to be the very acme and pitch of life for epic poesy though since he has altered it to sixty the year in which he published his alfred a true it is that the talents for criticism namely smartness quick censure vivacity of remark certainty of asseveration indeed all but acerbity seem rather the gifts of youth than of riper age but it is far otherwise in poetry witness the works of mr rymer and mr dennis who beginning with criticism became afterward such poets as no age has paralleled with good reason therefore did our author choose to write his essay on that subject at twenty and reserve for his maturer years this great and wonderful work of the dunciad u see his essays   testimonies of authors concerning our poet and his works now before we present thee with our exercitations on this most delectable poem drawn from the many volumes of our adversaria on modern authors we shall here according to the laudable usage of editors collect the various judgments of the learned concerning our poet various indeed not only of different authors but of the same author at different seasons nor shall we gather only the testimonies of such eminent wits as would of course descend to posterity and consequently be read without our collection but we shall likewise with incredible labor seek out for diverse others which but for this our diligence could never at the distance of a few months appear to the eye of the most curious hereby thou may not only receive the delectation of variety but also arrive at a more certain judgment by a grave and circumspect comparison of the witnesses with each other or of each with himself hence also thou will be enabled to draw reflections not only of a critical but a moral nature by being let into many particulars of the person as well as genius and of the fortune as well as merit of our author in which if i relate some things of little concern peradventure to thee and some of as little even to him i entreat thee to consider how minutely all true critics and commentators are wont to insist upon such and how material they seem to themselves if to none other forgive me therefore gentle reader if following learned example i ever and anon become tedious allow me to take the same pain to find whether my author were good or bad well or illnatured modest or arrogant as another whether his author were fair or brown short or tall or whether he wore a coat or a cassock  we purposed to begin with his life

that libel though in the subsequent editions of his key he left out this assertion and affirmed in the curliad p   and   that it was writ by dennis only  nor has an author been wanting to give our poet such a father as apuleius has to plato iamblicus to pythagoras and diverse to homer namely a demon for thus mr gildon m certain it is that his original is not from adam but the devil and that he wants nothing but horns and tail to be the exact resemblance of his infernal father finding therefore such contrariety of opinions and whatever be ours of this sort of generation not being fond to enter into controversy we shall defer writing the life of our poet till authors can determine among themselves what parents or education he had or whether he had any education or parents at all  proceed we to what is more certain his works though not less uncertain the judgments concerning them beginning with his essay on criticism of which hear first the the most ancient of critics  mr john dennis  his precepts are false or trivial or both his thoughts are crude and abortive his expressions absurd his numbers harsh and unmusical without cadence or variety his rhymes trivial and common  instead of majesty we have something that is very mean instead of gravity something that is very boyish and instead of perspicuity and lucid order we have but too often obscurity and confusion and in another place  what rare numbers are here would not one swear this youngster had espoused some antiquated muse who had sued out a divorce from some superanhuated sinner upon account of impotence and

bernard lintot  vo no less peremptory is the censure of our hypercritical historian  mr oldmixon  i dare not say any thing of the essay on criticism in verse but if any more curious reader has discovered in it something new which is not in drydens prefaces dedications and his essay on dramatick poetry not to mention the french critics i should be very glad to have the benefit of the discovery he is followed as in fame so in judgment by the modest and simpleminded  mr leonard welsted  who out of great respect to our poet not naming him does yet glance at his essay together with the duke of buckinghams and the criticisms of dryden b essay on criticism in prose  vo      by the author of the critical history of england and of horace which he more openly taxes preface to his poems p        as to the numerous treatises essays arts etc both in verse and prose that have been written by the moderns on this groundwork they do but hackney the same thoughts over again making them still more trite most of their pieces are nothing but a pert insipid heap of commonplace horace has even in his art of poetry thrown out several things which plainly show he thought an art of poetry was of no use even while he was writing one to all which great authorities we can only oppose that of  mr addison  spectator no      the art of criticism says he which was published some months since is a masterpiece in its kind the observations follow one another like those in horaces art of poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prosewriter they are some of them uncommon but such as the reader must assent to when he sees them explained with that ease and perspicuity in which they are delivered as for those which are the most known and the most received they are placed in so beautiful a light and illustrated with such apt allusions that they have in them all the graces of novelty and make the reader who was before acquainted with them still more convinced of their truth and solidity and here give me leave to mention what monsieur boileau has so well enlarged upon in the preface to his works that wit and fine writing does not confist so much in advancing things that are new as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn it is impossible for us who live in the latter ages of the world to make observations in criticism morality or any art or science which have not been touched upon by others we have little else left us but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong more beautiful or more uncommon lights if a reader examines horaces art of poetry he will find but few precepts in it which he may not meet with in aristotle and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the augustan age his way of expressing and applying them not his invention of them is what we are chiefly to admire longinus in his reflections has given us the same kind of sublime which he observes in the several passages that occasioned them i cannot but take notice that our english author has after the same manner exemplisyd several of the precepts in the very precepts themselves  he then produces some instances of a particular beauty in the numbers and concludes with saying that there are three poems in our tongue of the same nature and each a masterpiece in its kind the essay on translated verse the essay on the art of poetry and the essay on criticism  of windsor forest positive is the judgment of the affirmative  mr john dennis  letter to b b at the end of the remarks on popes homer      that it is a wretched rhapsody impudently writ in emulation of the coopers hill of sir john denham the author of it is obscure is ambiguous is affected is temerarious is barbarous printed      p     but the author of the dispensary  dr garth  in the preface to his poem of claremont differs from this opinion those who have seen those two excellent poems of coopers hill and windsor forest the one written by sir john denham the other by mr pope will show a great deal of candor if they approve of this  of his epistle of eloisa we are told by the obscure writer of a poem called sawney that because priors henry and emma charmed the finest tastes our author writ his eloise in opposition to it but forgot innocence and virtue if you take away her tender thoughts and her fierce desires all the rest is of no value in which methinks his judgment resembles that of a french tailor on a villa and gardens by the thames all this is very fine but take away the river and it is good for nothing but very contrary

pope for thy misfortune grieved with kind concern and skill has weaved a silken web and never shall fade its colors gently has he laid the mantle over thy sad distress and venus shall the texture bless etc   come we now to his translation of the iliad celebrated by numerous pens yet shall it suffice to mention the indefatigable  sir richard blackmore knight  who though otherwise a severe censurer of our author yet styles this a laudable translation in his essays vol   printed for e curl  that ready writer  mr oldmixon  in his forementioned essay frequently commends the same and the painful  mr lewis theobald  thus extols it censor vol   no    the spirit of homer breathes all through this translation  i am in doubt whether i should most admire the justness to the original or the force and beauty of the language or the sounding variety of the numbers but when i find all these meet it puts me in mind of what the poet says of one of his heroes that he alone raised and flung with ease a weighty stone that two common men could not lift from the ground just so one single person has performed in this translation what i once despaired to have seen done by the force of several masterly hands indeed the same gentleman appears to have changed his sentiment in his essay on the art of sinking in reputation printed in mists journal march  0      where he says thus in order to sink in reputation let him take it into his head to descend into homer let the world wonder as it will how the devil he got there and pretend to do him into english so his version denote his neglect of the manner how strange variation we are told in  mists journal june    that this translation of the iliad was not in all respects conformable to the fine taste of his friend mr addison insomuch that he employed a younger muse in an undertaking of this kind which he supervisd himself whether mr addison did find it conformable to his taste or not best appears from his own testimony the year following its publication in these words  mr addison freeholder no  0  when i consider my self as a british freeholder i am in a particular manner pleased with the labors of those who have improved our language with the translation of old greek and latin authors  we have already most of their historians in our own tongue and what is more for the honor of our language it has been taught to express with elegance the greatest of their poets in each nation the illiterate among our own countrymen may learn to judge from drydens virgil of the most perfect epic performance and those parts of homer which have been published already by mr pope give us reason to think that the iliad will appear in english with as little disadvantage to that immortal poem as to the rest there is a slight mistake for this younger muse was elder nor was the gentleman who is a friend of our author employed by mr addison to translate it after him since he says himself that he did it before vid pref to mr tickels translation of the first book of the iliad  to contrariwise that mr addison engaged our author in this work appears by declaration thereof in the preface to the iliad printed some years before his death and by his own letters of oct    and nov        where he declares it is his opinion that no other person was equal to it  next comes his shakespeare on the stage let him quoth one whom i take to be  mr theobald mists journal march  0       publish such an author as he has least studied and forget to discharge even the dull duty of an editor in this project let him lend the bookseller his name for a competent sum of money though to promote the credit of an exorbitant subscription gentle reader be pleased to cast thine eye on the proposal below quoted and on what follows some months after the former assertion in the same journalist of june   the bookseller proposed the book by subscription and raised some thousands of pounds for the same i believe the gentleman did not share in the profits of this extravagant subscription  after the iliad he undertook says  mists journal june         the sequel of that work the odyssey and having secured the success by a numerous subscription he employed some underlings to perform what according to his proposals should come from his own hands to which heavy charge we can in truth oppose nothing but the words of  mr popes proposal for the odyssey  printed by j watts jan  0      i take this occasion to declare that the subscription for shakespeare belongs wholly to mr tonson and that the benefit of this proposal is not solely for my own use but for that of two of my friends who have assisted me in this work but these very gentlemen are extolled above our poet himself in another of mists journals march  0      saying that he would not advise mr pope to try the experiment again of getting a great part of a book done by assistants lest those extraneous parts should unhappily ascend to the sublime and retard the declension of the whole behold these underlings are become good writers  if any say that before the said proposals were printed the subscription was begun without declaration of such assistance verily those who set it on foot or as their term is secured it to wit the right honorable the lord vifcount harcourt were he living would testify and the right honorable the lord bathurst now living does testify the same is a falsehood  sorry i am that persons professing to be learned or of whatever rank of authors should either falsely tax or be falsely taxed yet let us who are only reporters be impartial in our citations and proceed  mists journal june         mr addison raised this author from obscurity obtained him the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility and transferred his powerful interests with those great men to this rising bard who frequently levied by that means unusual contributions on the public which surely cannot be if as the author of dunciad diffected reports mr wycherley had before introduced him into a familiar acquaintance with the greatest peers and brightest wits then living  no sooner says the same journalist was his body lifeless but this author reviving his resentment libelled the memory of his departed friend and what was still more heinous made the scandal public grievous the accusation unknown the accuser the person accused no witness in his own cause the person in whose regard accused dead but if there be living any one nobleman whose friendship yea any one gentleman whose subssription mr addison procured to our author let him stand forth that truth may appear amicus plato amicus socrates sed magis amica veritas in verity the whole story of the libel is a lie witness those persons of integrity who several years before mr addisons decease did see and approve of the said verses in no wise a libel but a friendly rebuke sent privately in our authors own hand to mr addison himself and never made public till after their own journals and curl had printed the same one name alone which i am authorized here to declare will sufciently evince this truth that of the right honorable the earl of burlington  next is he taxed with a crime with some authors i doubt more heinous than any in morality to wit plagiarism from the inventive and quaintconceited  james moore smith gent  daily journal march         upon reading the third volume of popes miscellanies i found five lines which i thought excellent and happening to praise them a gentleman produced a modern comedy the rival modes published last year where were the same verses to a tittle these gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a mans works in his own life time and out of a public print  let us join to this what is written by the author of the rival modes the said mr james moore smith in a letter to our author himself who had informed him a month before that play was acted jan          that these verses which he had before given him leave to insert in it would be known for his some copies being got abroad he desires nevertheless that since the lines had been read in his comedy to several mr p would not deprive it of them etc surely if we add the testimonies of the lord bolingbroke of the lady to whom the said verses were originally addressed of hugh bethel esquire and others who knew them as our authors long before the said gentleman composed his play it is hoped the ingenuous that affect not error will rectify their opinion by the suffrage of so honorable personages  and yet follows another charge insinuating no less than his enmity both to church and state which could come from no other informer than the said  mr james moore smith  daily journal april         the memoirs of a parish clark was a very dull and unjust abuse of a person who wrote in defense of our religion and constitution and who has been dead many years this also seems most untrue it being known to diverse that these memoirs were written at the seat of the lord harcourt in oxfordshire before that excellent person bishop burnets death and many years before the appearance of that history of which they are pretended to be an abuse most true it is that mr moore had such a design and was himself the man who pressed dr arbuthnot and mr pope to assist him therein and that he borrowed those memoirs of our author when that history came forth with intent to turn them to such abuse but being able to obtain from our author but one single hint and either changing his mind or having more mind than ability he contented himself to keep the said memoirs and read them as his own to all his acquaintance a noble person there is into whose company mr pope once chanced to introduce him who well remembers the conversation of mr moore to have turned upon the contempt he had for the work of that reverend prelate and how full he was of a design he declared himself to have of exposing it this noble person is the earl of peterborough  here in truth should we crave pardon of all the foresaid right honorable and worthy personages for having mentioned them in the same page with such weekly riffraff railers and rhymers but that we had their everhonourd commands for the same and that they are introduced not as witnesses in the controversy but as witnesses that cannot be controverted not to dispute but to decide  certain it is that dividing our writers into two classes of such who were acquaintance and of such who were strangers to our author the former are those who speak well and the other those who speak evil of him of the first class the most noble  john duke of buckingham  sums up his character in these lines verses to mr p on his translation of homer and yet so wondrous so sublime a thing as the great iliad scarce could make me sing unless i justly could at once commend a good companion and as firm a friend one moral or a mere wellnaturd deed can all desert in sciences exceed   so also is he decypherd by the honorable  simon harcourt poem prefixed to his works say wondrous youth what column will thou choose what laureled arch for thy triumphant muse though each great ancient court thee to his shrine though every laurel through the dome be thine go to the good and just an awful train thy souls delight    recorded in like manner for his virtuous disposition and gentle bearing by the ingenious  mr walter heart  in this apostrophe in his poems printed for b lintot o ever worthy ever crowned with praise blessed in thy life and blessed in all thy lays add that the sisters every thought refine and even thy life be faultless as thy line yet envy still with fiercer rage pursues obscures the virtue and defames the muse a soul like thine in pain in grief resigned views with just scorn the malice of mankind   the witty and moral satyrist  dr edward young  wishing some check to the corruption and evil manners of the times calls out upon our poet to undertake a task so worthy of his virtue universal passion satyr   why slumbers pope who leads the muses train nor hears that virtue which he loves complain   mr thompson  in his elegant and philosophical poem of the seasons although not sweeter his own homer sings yet is his life the more endearing song to the same tune also sings that learned clerk of suffolk  mr williem broom in his poems and at the end of the odyssey thus nobly rising in fair virtues cause from thy own life transcribe the unerring laws   and diverse more with which we will not tire the reader  let us rather recreate thee by turning to the other side and showing his character drawn by those with whom he never conversed and whose countenances he could not know though turned against him first again commencing with the highvoiced and neverenoughquoted  john dennis  who in his reflections on the essay on criticism thus describes him a little affected hypocrite who has nothing in his mouth but candor truth friendship good nature humanity and magnanimity he is so great a lover of falsehood that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his cotemporaries he brands them with some defect which is just contrary to some good quality for which all their friends and their acquaintance commend them he seems to have a particular pique to people of quality and authors of that rank  he must derive his religion from st omers  but in the character of mr p and his writings printed by s popping      he says though he is a professor of the worst religion yet he laughs at it but that nevertheless he is a virulent papist and yet a pillar for the church of england of both which opinions  mr theobald  seems also to be declaring in mists journal of june         that if he is not shrewdly abused he made it his practice to cackle to both parties in their own sentiments but as to his pique against people of quality the same journalist does not agree but says may        he had by some means or other the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility  however contradictory this may appear mr dennis and gildon in the character last cited make it all plain by assuring us that he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions he is a beast and a man a whig and a tory a writer at one and the same time of the names of two weekly papers guardians and examiners an assertor of liberty and of the dispensing power of kings a jesuitical professor of truth a base and a foul pretender to candor so that upon the whole account we must conclude him either to have been a great hypocrite or a very honest man a terrible imposer upon both parties or very moderate to either  be it as to the judicious reader shall seem good sure it is he is little favored of certain authors whose wrath is perilous for one declares he ought to have a price set on his head and to be hunted down as a wild beast theobald letter in mists journal june          another protests that he does not know what may happen advises him to insure his person says he has bitter enemies and expressly declares it will be well if he escape with his life smedley pref to gulliveriana p        one desires he would cut his own throat or bang himself gulliveriana page      but pasquin seemed rather inclined it should be done by the government representing him engaged in grievous designs with a lord of parliament then under prosecution anno       mr dennis himself has written to a minister that he is one of the most dangerous persons in this kingdom anno       and assures the public that he is an open and mortal enemy to his country a monster that will one day show as daring a soul as a mad indian who runs a muck to kill the first christian he meets preface to rem on rape of the lock page    and in the last page of that treatise  another gives information of treason discovered in his poem page     of the preface by concanen to a book entitled a collection of all the letters essays verses and advertisements occasioned by pope and swifts miscellanies printed for a moore  vo       mr curl boldly supplies an imperfect verse with kings and princesses key to the dunc  d edit p     and one matthew concanen yet more impudent publishes at length the two most sacred names in this nation as members of the dunciad a list of persons etc at the end of the forementioned collection of all the letters essays etc   this is prodigious yet is it almost as strange that in the midst of these invectives his enemies have i know not how born testimony to some merit in him  m theobald  in censuring his shakespeare declares he has so great an esteem for mr pope and so high an opinion of his genius and excellencies that notwithstanding he professes a veneration almost rising to idolatry for the writings of this inimitable poet he would be very loath even to do him justice at the expense of that other gentlemans character introduction to his shakespeare restored in quarto p     mr charles gildon  after having violently attacked him in many pieces at last came to wish from his heart that mr pope would be prevailed upon to give us ovids epistles by his hand for it is certain we see the original of sapho to phaon with much more life and likeness in his version than in that of sir car scrope and this he adds is the more to be wished because in the english tongue we have scarce any thing truly and naturally written upon love commentary on the duke of buckinghams essay  vo      p        he also in taxing sir richard blackmore for his heterodox opinions of homer challenges him to answer what mr pope has said in his preface to that poet  m oldmixon  calls him a great master of our tongue declares the purity and perfection of the english language to be found in his homer and saying there are more good verses in drydens virgil than in any other work excepts this of our author only in his prose essay on criticism  one who takes the name of  h stanhope  the maker of certain verses to duncan campbell printed under the title of the progress of dullness   0       in that poem which is wholly a satire on mr pope confesses  it is true if finest notes alone could show tuned justly high or regularly low that we should fame to these mere vocals give pope more than we can offer should receive for when some gliding river is his theme his lines run smoother than the smoothest stream etc m thomas cook  after much blemishing our authors homer cries out  but in his other works what beauties shine while sweetest music dwells in every line these he admired on these he stamped his praise and bade them live to brighten future days battle of poets fol page     mists journal june         although he says the smooth numbers of the dunciad are all that recommend it nor has it any other merit yet that same paper has these words the author is allowed to be a perfect master of an easy and elegant versification in all his works we find the most happy turns and natural similies wonderfully short and thick sown the essay on the dunciad also owns page    it is very full of beautiful images  mr gildon and dennis  in the most furious of all their works the forecited character p   do in in concert hear how mr dennis has proved our mistake in this place as to my writing in concert with mr gildon i declare upon the honor and word of a gentleman that i never wrote so much as one line in concert with any one man whatsoever and these two letters from mr gildon will plainly show that we are not writers in concert with each other sir  the height of my ambition is to please men of the best judgment and finding that i have entertained my master agreeably i have the extent of the reward of my labor  sir i had not the opportunity of hearing your excellent pamphlet till this day i am infinitely satisfied and pleased with it and hope you will meet with that encouragement which your admirable performance deserves etc  chapter gildon     now is it not plain that any one who sends such compliments to another has not been used to write in partnership with him to whom he sends them dennis s remarks on the dunciad p  0 mr dennis is therefore welcome to take this piece to himself    concert confess that some men of good understanding value him for his rhymes and page    that he has got like mr bays in the rehearsal that is like mr dryden a notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse  to the success of all his pieces they do unanimously give testimony but it is sufficient instar omnium to behold this last great critic sorely lamenting it even from the essay on criticism to this day of the dunciad   the treatise of the profund is very dall and that mr pope is the author of it the writer of gulliveriana is of another opinion and says the whole or greatest part of the merit of this treatise must and can only be ascribed to gulliver gulliv p     i burnet homerides page   of his translation of the iliad  here gentle reader cannot i but smile at the strange blindness and positiveness of men knowing the said treatise to appertain to none other but to me martinus scriblerus  lastly we are assured in mist of june   that his own plays and farces would better have adorned the dunciad than those of mr theobald for he had neither genius for tragedy or comedy which whether true or not is not easy to judge in as much as he has attempted neither  but from all that has been said the discerning reader will collect that it little availed our author to have any candor since when he declared he did not write for others it was not credited as little to have any modesty since when he declined writing in any way himself the presumption of others was imputed to him if he singly enterprizd one great work he was taxed of boldness and madness to a prodigy i if he took assistants in another it was complained of and represented as a great injury to the public the london and mists journals on his undertaking of the odyssey  the loftiest heroicks the lowest ballads treatises against the state or church satire on lords and ladies raillery on wits and authors squabbles with booksellers or even full and true accounts of monsters poisons and murders of any hereof was there nothing so good nothing so bad which has not at one or other season been to him ascribed if it bore no authors name then lay he concealed if it did he fathered it on that author to be yet better concealed if it resembled any of his styles then was it evident if it did not then disguised he it on set purpose yea even direct oppositions in religion principles and politics have equally been supposed in him inherent surely a most rare and singular character of which let the reader make what he can  doubtless most commentators would hence take occasion to turn all to their authors advantage and from the testimony of his very enemies would affirm that his capacity was boundless as well as his imagination that he was a perfect master of all styles and all arguments and that there was in those times no other writer in any kind of any degree of excellence save he himself but as this is not our own sentiment we shall determine on nothing but leave thee gentle reader to steer thy judgment equally between various opinions and to choose whether thou will incline to the testimonies of authors avowed or of authors concealed of those who knew him or of

another at london in  vo and three others in   0 the same year but there was no perfect edition before that of london in  to       which was attended with the following notes we are willing to acquaint posterity that this poem as it here stands was presented to king george the second and his queen by the hands of sir robert walpole on the   th of march        the dunciad sic m s it may be well disputed whether this be a right reading ought it not rather to be spelled dunceiad as the etymology evidently demands dunce with an e therefore dunceiad with an e that accurate and punctual man of letters the restorer of shakespeare constantly observes the preservation of this very letter e in spelling the name of his beloved author and not like his common careless editors with the omission of one nay sometimes of two ees as shakspear which is utterly unpardonable nor is the neglect of a single letter so trivial as to some it may appear the alteration whereof in a learned language is an achievement that brings honor to the critic who advances it and dr b will be remembered to posterity for his performances of this sort as long as the world shall have any esteem for the remains of

poet which have as much of the ridiculum and the fustian in em as can well be jumbled together and are of that sort of nonsense which so perfectly confounds all ideas that there is no distinct one left in the mind further he says of him that he has prophesied his own poetry shall be sweeter than catullus ovid and tibullus but we have little hope of the accomplishment of it from what he has lately published upon which mr oldmixon has not spared a reflection that the putting the laurel on the head of one who writ such verses will give futurity a very lively idea of the judgment and justice of those who bestowed it ibid p     but the wellknown learning of that noble person who was then lord chamberlain might have screend him from this unmannerly reflection mr eusden was made laureate for the same reason that mr tibbald was made hero of this poem because there was no better to be had nor ought mr oldmixon to complain so long after that the laurel would better have become his own brows or any others it were more decent to acquiesce in the opinion of the duke of buckingham upon this matter  in rushed eusden and cried who shall have it but i the true laureate to whom the

been spared suffers by being contradicted or which is the same thing in effect by hearing another praised we should in compassion sometimes attend to him with a silent nod and let him go away with the triumphs of his ill nature  poor furius again when any of his cotemporaries are spoken well of quitting the ground of the present dispute steps back a thousand years to call in the succor of the ancients his very panegyric is spiteful and he uses it for the same reason as some ladies do their commendations of a dead beauty who never would have had their good word but that a living one happened to be mentiond in their company his applause is not the tribute of his heart but the sacrifice of his revenge etc indeed his pieces against our poet are somewhat of an angry character and as they are now scarce extant a taste of his style may be satisfactory to the curious a young squab short gentleman whose outward form though it should be that of downright monkey would not differ so much from human shape as his unthinking immaterial part does from human understanding  he is as stupid and as venomous as a hunchbacked toad  a book through which folly and ignorance those brethren so

in vogue has neither sense in his thoughts nor english in his expressions dennis rem on hom pref p   and p    etc  besides these publickspirited reasons mr d had a private one which by his manner of expressing it in page    appears to have been equally strong he was even in bodily fear of his life from the machinations of the said mr p the story says he is too long to be told but who would be acquainted with it may hear it from mr curl my bookseller  however what my reason has suggested to me that i have with a just confidence said in defiance of his two clandestine weapons his slander and his poison which last words of his book plainly discover mr d his suspicion was that of being poisoned in like manner as mr curl had been before him of which fact see a full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge by poison on the body of edmund curl printed in      the year antecedent to that wherein these remarks of mr dennis were published but what puts it beyond all question is a passage in a very warm treatise in which mr d was also concerned price twopence called a true character of mr pope and his writings printed for s popping      in the tenth page whereof he is said to have insulted people on those calamities and diseases which he himself gave them by administering poison to them and is called p   a lurking waylaying coward and a stabber in the dark which with many other things most lively set forth in that piece must have rendered him a terror not to mr dennis only but to all christian people  for the rest mr john dennis was the son of a sadler in london born in      he paid court to mr dryden and having obtained some correspondence with mr wycherly and mr congreve he immediately obliged the public with their letters he made himself known to the government by many admirable schemes and projects which the ministry for reasons best known to themselves constantly kept private for his character as a writer it is given us as follows mr dennis is excellent at pindarick writings perfectly regular in all his performances and a person of sound learning that he is master of a great deal of penetration and judgment his criticisms particularly on prince arthur do sufficiently demonstrate from the same account it also appears that he writ plays more to get reputation than money dennis of himself see giles jacobs lives of dram poets gage       compared with

give above  00 emendations that shall escape them all during two whole years while mr pope was preparing his edition he published advertisements requesting assistance and promising satisfaction to any who could contribute to its greater perfection but this restorer who was at that time soliciting favors of him by letters did wholly conceal that he had any such design till after its publication which he was since not ashamed to own in a daily journal of nov         and then an outcry was made in the prints that our author had joined with the bookseller to raise an extravagant subscription in which he had no share of which he had no knowledge and against which he had publicly advertised in his own proposals for homer probably that proceeding elevated tibbald to the dignity he holds in this poem which he seems to deserve no other way better than his brethren unless we impute it to the share he had in the journals cited among the testimonies of authors prefixed to this work  v  0

imply that the hero of the poem wanted a supper in truth a great absurdity not that we are ignorant that the hero of homers odyssey is frequently in that circumstance and therefore it can no way derogate from the grandeur of epic poem to represent such hero under a calamity to which the greatest not only of critics and poets but of kings and warriors have been subject but much more refined i will venture to say is the meaning of our author it was to give us obliquely a curious precept or what bossu calls a disguised sentence that temperance is the life of study the language of poesy brings all into action and to represent a critic encompassed with books but without a supper is a picture which lively expresses how much the true critic prefers the diet of the mind to that of the body one of which he always castigates and often totally neglects for the greater improvement of the other scriblerus  v     volumes whose size etc this library is divided into two parts the one his polite learning consists of those books which seem to be the models of his poetry and are preferred for one of these three reasons usual with collectors of libraries that they fitted the shelves or

poverty abovementioned where he no sooner enters but he reconnoitres the place of his original as plato says the spirits shall do at their entrance into the celestial regions his dialogue of the

but he chose rather to be placed in an office of accounts in the city being qualified for the same by his skill in arithmetic and writing the necessary hands he has obliged the world with many translations of french plays jacob lives of dram poets p      mr jacobs character of mr ozell seems vastly short of his merits and he ought to have further justice done him having since fully confuted all sarcasms on his learning and genius by an advertisement of sept  0      in a paper called the weekly medley etc as to my learning this envious wretch knew and every body knows that the whole bench of bishops not long ago were pleased to give me a purse of guineas for discovering the erroneous translations of the common prayer in portuguese spanish french italian etc as for my genius let mr cleland show better verses in all popes works than ozells version of boileaus lutrin which the late lord halifax was so pleased with that he complimented him with leave to dedicate it to him etc etc let him show better and truer poetry in the rape of the lock than in ozells rape of the bucket la secchia rapita which because an ingenious author happened to mention in the same breath with popes viz let ozell sing the bucket pope the lock the little gentleman had like to run mad  and mr toland and mr gildon publicly declared ozells translation of homer to be as it was prior so likewise superior

shows how candid and patient a reader he must have been what can be more kind and affectionate than these words in the preface to his poems  to      where he labors to call up all our humanity and forgiveness toward these unlucky men by the most moderate representation of their case that has ever been given by any author much may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets what we call a genius is hard to be distinguished by a man himself from a prevalent inclination and if it be never so great he can at first discover it no other way than by that strong propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken he has no other method but to make the experiment by writing and so appealing to the judgment of others and if he happens to write ill which is certainly no sin in itself he is immediately made the object of ridicule i wish we had the humanity to reflect that even the worst authors might endeavor to please us and in that endeavor deserve something at our hands we have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting and even that may admit of alleviating circumstances for their particular friends may be either ignorant or unsincere and the rest of

the supposition of which the very basis of all verbal criticism is founded and supported the first that an author could never fail to use the best word on every occasion the second that a critic cannot choose but know which that is this being granted whenever any word does not fully content us we take upon us to conclude first that the author could never have used it and secondly that he must have used that very one which we conjecture in its stead  we cannot therefore enough admire the learned scriblerus for his alteration of the text in the two last verses of the preceding book which in all the former editions stood thus hoarse thunder to the bottom shook the bog and the loud nation croakd god save king log he has with great judgment tranposed these two epithets putting hoarse to the nation and loud to the thunder and this being evidently the true reading he vouchsafed not so much as to mention the former for which assertion of the just right of a critic he merits the

was of apulia who hearing the great encouragement which leo the tenth gave to poets traveled to rome with a harp in his hand and sung to it twenty thousand verses of a poem called alexias he was introduced as a buffoon to leo and promoted to the honor of the laurel a jest which the court of rome and the pope himself entered into so far as to cause him to ride on an elephant to the capitol and to hold a solemn festival on his coronation at which it is recorded the poet himself was so transported as to weep for joy he was ever after a constant frequenter of the popes table drank abundantly and poured forth verses without number paulus jovius elog virg doct chapter    some idea of his poetry is given by fam strada in his prolusions  v    never was dashed out at one lucky hit our author here seems willing to give some account of the possibility of dullness making a wit which could be done no other way than by chance the fiction is the more reconciled to probability by the known story of apelles who being at a loss to express the foam of alexanders horse dashed his pencil in despair at the picture and happened to do it by that fortunate stroke  v    and called the phantom more curl in his key to the dunciad affirmed this to be james more smith esquire and it is probable considering what is said of him in the testimonies that some might fancy our author obliged to represent this gentleman as a plagiary or to pass for one himself his case indeed was like that of a man i have heard of who as he was sitting in company perceived his next neighbor had stolen his handkerchief sir said the thief finding himself detected do not expose me i did it for mere want be so good but to take it privately out of my pocket again and say nothing the honest man did so but the other cried out see gentlemen what a thief we have among us look he is stealing my handerchief  the plagiarisms of this person gave occasion to the following epigram m  re always smiles whenever he recites he smiles you think approving what he writes and yet in this no vanity is shown a modest man may like what is not his own his only work was a comedy called the rival modes the town condemned it in the action but he printed it in       with this modest motto hic caestus artemque repono the smaller pieces which we have heard attributed to this author are an epigram on the bridge at blenheim by dr evans cosmelia by mr pit mr jones etc the sawpit a simile by a friend and some unownd letters advertisements and epigrams against our author in the daily journal  notwithstanding what is here collected of the person imagined by curl to be meant in this place we cannot be of that opinion since our poet had certainly no need of vindicating half a dozen verses to himself which every reader had done for him since the name itself is not spelled moore but more and lastly since the learned scriblerus has so well proved the contrary  v    the phantom more it appears from hence that this is not the name of a real person but fictitious more from  stultus  stultitia to represent the folly of a plagiary thus erasmus admonuit me mori cognomen tibi quod tam ad moriae vocabulum accedit quam es ipse a re alienus dedication of moriae encomion to sir tho more the farewell of which may be our authors to his plagiary vale more and moriam tuam gnaviter defend adieu more and be sure strongly to defend thy own folly scriblerus  v    but lofty lintot we enter here upon the episode of the booksellers persons whose names being more known and famous in the learned world than those of the authors in this poem do therefore need less explanation the action of mr lintot here imitates that of dares in virgil rising just in this manner to lay hold on a bull this eminent bookseller printed the rival modes abovementioned  v    stood dauntless curl etc we come now to a character of much respect that of mr edmond curl as a plain repetition of great actions is the best praise of them we shall only say of this eminent man that he carried the trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession he possessed himself of a command over all authors whatever he caused them to write what he pleased they could not call their very names their own he was not only famous among these he was taken notice of by the state the church and the law and received particular marks of distinction from each  it will be owned that he is here introduced with all possible dignity he speaks like the intrepid diomed he runs like the swiftfooted achilles if he falls it is like the beloved nisus and what homer makes to be the chief of all praises he is favored of the gods he says but three words and his prayer is heard a goddess conveys it to the seat of jupiter though he loses the prize he gains the victory the great mother her self comforts him she inspires him with expedients she honors him with an immortal present such as achilles receives from thetis and aeneas from venus at once instructive and prophetical after this he is unrivaled and triumphant  the tribute our author here pays him is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations many weighty animadversions on the public affairs and many excellent and diverting pieces on private persons has he given to his name if ever he owed two verses to any other he owed mr curl some thousands he was every day extending his fame and enlarging his writings witness innumerable instances but it shall suffice only to mention the courtpoems which he meant to publish as the work of the true writer a lady of quality but being first threatened and afterward punished for it by mr pope he generously transferred it from her to him and ever since printed it in his name the single time that ever he spoke to c was on that affair and to that happy incident he owes all the favors since received from him so true is the saying of dr sydenham that any one shall be at some time or other the better or the worse for having but seen or spoken to a good or a bad man  v    curls corinna this name it seems was taken by one mrs t who procured some private letters of mr popes while almost a boy to mr cromwell and sold them without the consent of either of those gentlemen to curl who printed them in   0      he has discovered her to be the publisher in his key p    we only take this opportunity of mentioning the manner in which those letters got abroad which the author was ashamed of as very trivial things full not only of levities but of wrong judgments of men and books and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer  v    obscene with filth etc though this incident may seem too low and base for the dignity of an epic poem the learned very well know it to be but a copy of homer and virgil the very words  and fimus are used by them though our poet in compliance to modern nicety has remarkably enriched and colored his language as well as raised the versication in these two episodes mr dryden in mackfleckno has not scrupled to mention the morning toast at which the fishes bite in the thames pissingalley relics of the bum etc but our author is more grave and as a fine writer says of virgil in his georgics tosses about his dung with an air of majesty if we consider that the exercises of his authors could with justice be higher than tickling chattring braying or diving it was no easy matter to invent such games as were proportioned to the meaner degree of booksellers in homer and virgil ajax and nisus the persons drawn in this plight are heroes whereas here they are such with whom it had been great impropriety to have joined any but vile ideas besides the natural connection there is between libellers and common nusances nevertheless i have often heard our author own that this part of his poem was as it frequently happens what cost him most trouble and pleased him least but that he hoped twas excusable since levelled at such as understand no delicate satire thus the politest men are sometimes obliged to swear when they happen to have to do with porters and oysterwenches  v    down with the bible up with the pope s arms the bible curls sign the crosskeys lintots  v   0 an unpaid tailor this line has been loudly complained of in mist june   dedic to sawney and others as a most inhuman satire on the poverty of poets but it is thought our author would be acquitted by a jury of tailors to me this instance seems unluckily chosen if it be a satire on any body it must be on a bad paymaster since the person to whom they have here applied it was a man of fortune not but poets may well be jealous of so great a prerogative as nonpayment which mr dennis so far asserts as boldly to pronounce that if homer himself was not in debt it was because no body would trust him pref to rem on the rape of the lock p     v     like congrvee addison and prior these authors being such whose names will reach posterity we shall not give any account of them but proceed to those of whom it is necessary  besalcel morris was author of some satires on the translators of homer with many other things printed in newspapers   bond writ a satire against mr p  capt breval was author of the confederates an ingenious dramatic performance to expose mr p mr gay dr arb and some ladies of quality says curl key p     v     mears warner wilkins booksellers and printers of much anonymous stuff  v     breval besaleel bond i foresee it will be objected from this line that we were in an error in our assertion on verse    of this book that more was a fictitious name since these persons are equally represented by the poet as phantoms so at first sight it may seem but be not deceived reader these also are not real persons it is true curl declares breval a captain author of a piece called the confederates but the same curl first said it was written by joseph gay is his second assertion to be credited any more than his first he likewise affirms bond to be one who writ a satire on our poet but where is such a satire to be found where was such a writer ever heard of as for besaleel it carries forgery in the very name nor is it as the others are a surname thou may depend on it no such authors ever lived all phantoms scriblerus  v   0 joseph gay a fictitious name put by curl before several pamphlets which made them pass with many for mr gays  v     and turn this whole illusion on the town it was a common practice of this bookseller to publish vile pieces of obscure hands under the names of eminent authors  v   0 cook shall be prior the man here specified was the son of a muggletonian who kept a public house at braintree in essex he writ a thing called the battle of poets of which philips and welsted were the heroes and wherein our author was attacked in his moral character in relation to his homer and shakespeare he writ moreover a farce of penelope in the preface of which also he was squinted at and some malevolent things in the british london and daily journals at the same time the honest gentleman wrote letters to mr p in the strongest terms protesting his innocence his chief work was a translation of hesiod to which theobald writ notes and halfnotes as has already been said  v ibid and concanen swift in the first edition of this poem there were only asterisks in this place but the names were since inserted merely to fill up the verse and give ease to the ear of the reader  v     and we too boast our garth and addison nothing is more remarkable than our authors love of praising good writers he has celebrated sir isaac newton mr dryden mr congreve mr wycherley dr garth mr walsh duke of buckingham mr addison lord lansdown in a word almost every man of his time that deserved it it was very difficult to have that pleasure in a poem on this subject yet he found means to insert their panegyric and has made even dullness out of her own mouth pronounce it it must have been particularly agreeable to him to celebrate dr garth both as his constant friend and as he was his predecessor in this kind of satire the dispensary attacked the whole body of apothecaries a much more useful one undoubtedly than that of the bad poets if in truth this can be called a body of which no two members ever agreed it also did what mr theobald says is unpardonable drew in parts of private character and introduced persons independent of his subject much more would boileau have incurred his censure who left all subjects whatever on all occasions to fall upon the bad poets which it is to be feared would have been more immediately his concern but certainly next to commending good writers the greatest service to learning is to expose the bad who can only that one way be made of any use to it this truth is very well set forth in these lines addressed to our author the craven rook and pert jackdaw though neither birds of moral kind yet serve if hanged or stuffed with straw to show us which way blows the wind thus dirty knaves or chattring fools strung up by dozens in thy lay teach more by half than dennis rules and point instruction every way with aegypts art thy pen may strive

an honest mind will love and esteem a man of worth though he be deformed or poor yet the author of the dunciad has libelled a person for his ruful length of face mists journ june   this genius and man of worth whom an honest mind should love is mr curl true it is he stood in the pillory an incident which will lengthen the face of any man though it were ever so comely therefore is no reflection on the natural beauty of mr curl but as to reflections on any mans face or figure mr dennis says excellently natural deformity comes not by our fault it is often occasioned by calamities and diseases which a man can no more help than a monster can his deformity there is no one misfortune and no one disease but what all the rest of mankind are subject to  but the deformity of this author is visible present lasting unalterable and peculiar to himself it is the mark of god and nature upon him to give us warning that we should hold no society with him as a creature not of our original nor of our species and they who have refused to take this warning which god and nature have given them and have in spite of it by a senseless presumption ventured to be familiar with him have severely suffered etc it is certain his original is not from adam but from the devil etc dennis charact of mr p  vo       admirably is it observed by mr dennis against mr law p    that the language of billingsgate can never be the language of charity nor consequently of christianity i should else be tempted to use the language of a critic for what is more provoking to a commentator than to behold his author thus portrayed yet i consider it really hurts not him whereas maliciously to call some others dull might do them prejudice with a world too apt to believe it therefore though mr d may call another a little ass or a young toad far be it from us to call him a toothless lion or an old serpent indeed had i written these notes as was once my intent in the learned language i might have given him the appellations of balatro calceatum caput scurra in triviis being phrases in good esteem and frequent usage among the best learned but in our mother tongue were i to tax any gentleman of the dunciad

eminently shows his humanity but it was far otherwise with the gentlemen of the dunciad whose scurrilities were always personal they went so far as to libel an eminent sculptor for making our authors

popes an elf all he can say for it is he neither made the busto nor himself and by another person of quality rysbrake to make a pope of stone must labor hard and sore but it would cost him labor none

to convey an idea of what was said to be mr curls condition at this time but from that very reason i infer the direct contrary for surely every lover of our author will conclude he had more humanity than to insult a man on such a misfortune or calamity which could never befall him purely by his own fault but from an unhappy communication with another this note is half mr theobald half scriblerus

did not think himself upon the same foot with homer comp art of poetry vol   p  0   but how different is the judgment of the author of characters of the times p    who says sir richard is unfortunate in happening to mistake his proper talents and that he has not for many years been so much as named or even thought of among writers even mr dennis differs greatly from his friend mr gilden  blackmores action says he has neither unity nor integrity nor morality nor universality and consequently he can have no fable and no heroic poem his narration is neither probable delightful nor wonderful his characters have none of the necessary qualifications the things contained in his narration are neither in their own nature delightful nor numerous enough nor rightly disposed nor surprising nor pathetick  nay he proceeds so far as to say sir richard has no genius first laying down that genius is caused by a furious joy and pride of soul on the conception of an extraordinary hint many men says he have their hints without these motions of fury and pride of soul because they want fire enough to agitate their spirits and these we call cold writers others who have a great deal of fire but have not excellent organs feel the forementioned motions without the extraordinary hints and these we call fustian writers but he declares that sir richard had neither the hints nor the motions remarks on pr arth  vo      preface  this gentleman in his first works abused the character of mr dryden and in his last of mr pope accusing him in very high and sober terms of profaneness and immorality essay on polite writing vol   p   0 on a mere report from edm curl that he was author of a travestie on the first psalm mr dennis took up the same report but with the addition of what sir richard had neglected an argument to prove it which being very curious we shall here transcribe remarks on homer  vo p    it was he who burlesqud the psalm of david it is apparent to me that psalm was burlesqud by a popish rhymester let rhymeing persons who have been brought up protestants be otherwise what they will let them be rakes let em be scoundrels let em be atheists yet education has made an invincible impression on them in behalf of the sacred writings but a popish rhymester has been brought up with a contempt for those sacred writings now show me another popish rhymester but he this manner of argumentation is usual with mr dennis he has employed the same against sir richard himself in a like charge of impiety and irreligion all mr blackmores celestial machines as they cannot be defended so much as by commonreceivd opinion so are directly contrary to the doctrine of the church of england for the visible descent of an angel must be a miracle now it is the doctrine of the church of england that miracles had ceased a long time before prince arthur came into the world now if the doctrine of the church of england be true as we are obliged to believe then are all the celestial machines in prince arthur unsufferable as wanting not only human but divine probability but if the machines are sufferable that is if they have so much as divine probability then it follows of necessity that the doctrine of the church is false so i leave it to every impartial clergyman to consider etc preface to the remarks on prince arthur  v     as morningprayr and flagellation end it is between eleven and twelve in the morning after church service that the criminals are whipped in bridewell  this is to mark punctually the time of the day homer does it by the circumstance of the

through ludgate to the city and the temple of the goddess  v     the diving this i fancy says a great enemy to the poem is a game which no body could ever think of but the author however it is worked

our hatred to those characters is lessened if they add a needy thief a poor pickpocket a hungry highwayman a starving knight of the post etc  v     in naked majesty oldmixon stands mr john oldmixon next to mr dennis the most ancient critic of our nation an unjust censurer of mr addison in his prose essay on criticism whom also in his imitation of bouhours called the arts of logic and rhetoric he misrepresents in plain matter of fact for in p    he cites the spectator as abusing dr swift by name where there is not the least hint of it and in p  0  is so injurious as to suggest that mr addison himself writ that tatler no    which says of his own simile that it is as great as ever entered into the mind of man in poetry he was not so happy as laborious and therefore uncharacterized by the tatler no    by the name of omicron the unborn poet curl key p    he writ dramatic works and a volume of poetry consisting of heroic epistles etc some whereof are very well done says that great judge

that seadalous one of the stuarts in folio and his critical history of england   vol  vo being employed by bishop kennet in publishing the historians in his collection he falsified daniels cronicle in numberless places yet this very man in the preface to the first of these advanced a particular fact to charge three eminent persons of falsifying the lord clarendons history which fact has been disproved by the bishop of rochester then the only survivor of them and the particular part produced since after almost ninety years in that noble authors own hand he was all his life a virulent partywriter for hire and received his reward in a small place which he yet enjoys  he is here likened to milo in allusion to that verse of ovid  fletque milon senior cum spectat inanes herculeis

london journals and in a paper called the speculatist in a pamphlet called a supplement to the profund he dealt very unfairly with our poet not only frequently imputing to him mr broomes verses for which he might indeed seem in some degree accountable having corrected what that gentleman did but those of the duke of buckingham and others to this rare piece somebody humourously caused him to take for his motto de profundis clamavi he was since a hired scribler in the daily courant where he poured forth much billingsgate against the lord bolingbroke and others after which this man was

smitten off and were otherwise defaced by unadvised folks queen mary did set new heads upon their old bodies again the   th of queen elizabeth the same gate was clean taken down and newly and beautifully builded with images of lud and others as before stows survey of london  v     see hom odyss    ovid met    v     through the long heavy painful page etc all these lines very well imitate the slow drowziness with which they proceed it is impossible for any one who has a poetical ear to read them without perceiving the heaviness that lags in the verse to imitate the action it describes

religion of their country the surreptitious editions placed here the name of a gentleman who though no great friend to the clergy is a man of morals and ingenuity tindal was author of the rights of the christian church he also wrote an abusive pamphlet against earl s  which was suppressed while yet in manuscript by an eminent person then out of the ministry to whom he showed it expecting his approbation this doctor afterward published the same piece mutatis mutandis against that very person  v     christs no kingdom etc this is said by curl key to dunc to allude to a sermon of a reverend bishop  v     centlivre mrs susanna centlivre wife to mr centlivre yeoman of the mouth to his majesty she writ many plays and a song says mr jacob vol   p    before she was seven years old she also

great zeal against the stage mr dennis answered with as great their books were printed in      mr law affirmed that the playhouse is the temple of the devil the peculiar pleasure of the devil where all they who go yield to the devil where all the laughter is a laughter among devils and that all who are there are hearing music in the very porch of hell to which mr dennis replied that there is every jot as much difference between a true play and one made by a poetaster as between two religious books the bible and the alcoran then he demonstrates that all those who had written against the stage were jacobites and nonjurors and did it always at a time when something was to be done for the pretender mr collier published his short view when france declared for the chevalier and his dissuasive just at the great storm when the devastation which that hurricane wrought had amazed and astonished the minds of men and made them obnoxious to melancholy and desponding thoughts mr law took the opportunity to attack the stage upon the great preparations he heard were making abroad and which the jacobites flattered themselves were designed in their favor and as for mr bedfords serious remonstrance though i know nothing of the time of publishing it yet i dare to lay odds it was either upon the duke daumonts being at somerset house or upon the late rebellion dennis stage

this line presents us with an excellent moral that we are never to pass judgment merely by appearances a lesson to all men who may happen to see a reverend person in the like situation not to determine too rashly since not only the poets frequently describe a bard inspired in this posture on came s fair bank where chaucer lay inspired and the like but an eminent casuist tells us that if a priest be seen in any indecent action we ought to account it a deception of sight or illusion of the devil who sometimes takes upon him the shape of holy men on purpose to cause scandal how little the profane author of the characters of the times printed      regarded this admonition appears from these words page    speaking of the reverend mr laurence eusden a most worthy successor of tate in the

which according to the ancients denotes falsity scriblerus  v    old bavius sits bavius was an ancient poet celebrated by virgil for the like cause as tibbald by our author though not in so christianlike a manner for heathenishly it is declared by virgil of bavius that he ought to be hated and detested for his evil works qui bavium non odit whereas we have often had occasion to observe our poets great good nature and mercifulness through the whole course of this poem  mr dennis warmly contends that bavius was no inconsiderable author nay that he and maevius had even in augustuss days a very formidable party at rome who thought them much superior to virgil and horace for says he i cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit rem on pr arthur part   c   an argument which if this poem should last will conduce to the honor of the gentlemen of the dunciad in like manner he tells us of settle that he was once a formidable rival to mr dryden and that in the university of cambridge there were those who gave him the preference mr welsted goes yet farther in his behalf poor settle was formerly the mighty rival of dryden nay for many years bore his reputation above him pref to his poems  vo p    and mr milbourn cried out how little was dryden able even when his blood run high to defend himself against mr settle notes on dryd virg p     these are comfortable opinions and no wonder some authors indulge them scriblerus  v  0 brown and mears booksellers printers for tibbald mrs haywood or any

stood there looks upon the mention of such a gentleman in a satire as a great act of barbarity key to the dunc   d edit p    and another author thus reasons upon it durgen  vo page       how unworthy is it of christian charity to animate the rabble to abuse a worthy man in such a situation what could move the poet thus to mention a brave sufferer a gallant prisoner exposed to the view of all mankind it was laying aside his senses it was committing a crime for which the law is deficient not to punish him nay a crime which man can scarce forgive nor time efface nothing surely could have induced him to it but being bribed by a great lady to whom this brave honest worthy gentleman was guilty of no offense but forgery proved in open court etc but it is evident this verse could not be meant of him it being notorious that no eggs were thrown at that gentleman perhaps therefore it might be intended of mr edward ward the poet  v    and length of ears this is a sophisticated reading i think i may venture to affirm all the copyists are mistaken here i believe i may say the same of the critics dennis oldmixon welsted have passed it in silence i have also stumbled at it and wondered how an error so manifest could escape such accurate persons i dare assert it proceeded originally from the inadvertency of some transcriber whose head run on the pillory mentioned two lines before it is therefore amazing that mr curl himself should overlook it yet that scholiast takes not the least notice hereof that the learned mist also read it thus is plain from his ranging this passage among those in which our author was blamed for personal satire on a mans face whereof doubtless he might take the ear to be a part so likewise concanen ralph the flyingpost and all the herd of commentators  tota armenta sequuntur  a very little sagacity which all these gentlemen therefore wanted will restore to us the true sense of the poet thus  by his broad shoulders known and length of years see how

once a regard for my judgment otherwise he would never have subscribed two guineas to me for one small book in octavo jacob s letter to dennis in his remarks on the dunciad page    therefore i should think the appellation of blunderbuss to mr jacob like that of thunderbolt to scipio was meant in his honor  mr dennis argues the same way my writings having made great impression on the minds of all sensible men mr p  repented and to give proof of his repentance subscribed to my two volumes of select works  and afterward to my two volumes of letters ibid page  0 we should hence believe the name

the following different character of him  mr welsted had in his youth raised so great expectations of his future genius that there was a kind of struggle between the most eminent in the two universities which should have the honor of his education to compound this he civilly became a member of both and after having passed some time at the one he removed to the other from thence he returned to town where he became the darling expectation of all the polite writers whose encouragement he acknowledged in his occasional poems in a manner that will make no small part of the fame of his protectors it also appears from his works that he was happy in the patronage of the most illustrious characters of the present age  encouraged by such a combination in his favor he  published a book of poems some in the ovidian some in the horatian manner in both which the most exquisit judges pronounce he even rivaled his masters  his loveverses have rescued that way of writing from contempt  in his translations he has given us the very soul and spirit of his author his ode  his epistle  his verses  his lovetale  all are the most perfect things in all poetry etc welsted of himself char of the times  vo      page        v     ab dennis etc the reader who has seen through the course of these notes what a constant attendance mr dennis paid to our author and all his works may perhaps wonder he should be mentioned but twice and so flightly touched in this poem but in truth he looked upon him with some esteem for having more generously than all the rest set his name to such writings he was also a very old man at this time by his own account of himself in mr jacohs lives he must have been above threescore in the mayoralty of sir george thorold in    0 and has since

further account of mr burnet he did himself write a letter to the e of hallifax informing his lordship as he tells him of what he knew much better before and he published in his own name several political pamphlets a certain information of a certain discourse a second tale of a tub etc all which it is strongly affirmed were written by colonel ducket curl key p    but the author of the characters of the times tells us these political pieces were not approved of by his own father the reverend bishop  of the other works of these gentlemen the world has heard no more than it would of mr popes had their united laudable endeavors discouraged him from his undertaking how few good works had ever appeared since men of true merit are always the least presuming had there been always such champions to stifle them in their conception and were it not better for the public that a million of monsters should come into the world which are sure to die as soon as born than that the serpents should strangle one hercules in his cradle  the union of these two authors gave occasion to this epigram  burnet and ducket friends in spite came hissing forth in verse both were so forward each would

the verse is a literal translation of virgil nisus amore pio pueri  and here as in the original applied to friendship that between nisus and euryalus is allowed to make one of the most amiable episodes in the world and surely was never interpreted in a perverse sense but it will astonish the reader to hear that on no other occasion than this line a dedication was written to this gentleman to induce him to think something further sir you are known to have all that affection for the beautiful part of the creation which god and nature designed  sir you have a very sine lady  and sir you have eight very sine children  etc dedic to dennis rem on the rape of the lock the truth is the poor dedicators brain was turned upon this article he had taken into his head that ever since some books were written against the stage and since the italian opera had prevailed the nation was infected with a vice not fit to be named he went so far as to print upon the subject and concludes his argument with this remark that he cannot help thinking the obscenity of plays excusable at this juncture since when that execrable sin is spread so wide it may be of use to the reducing mens minds to the natural desire of women dennis stage defended against mr law p  0 our author solemnly declared he never heard any creature but the dedicator mention that vice and this gentleman together  v     wormius hight let not this name purely fictitious be conceited to mean the learned olaus wormius much less as it was unwarrantably foisted into the surreptitious editions our own antiquary mr thomas herne who had no way aggrieved our poet but on the contrary published many curious tracts which he has to his great contentment perused  most rightly are ancient words here employed in speaking of such who so greatly delight in the same we may say not only rightly but wisely yea excellently inasmuch as for the like practice the like praise is given to hopkins and sternhold by mr herne himself glossar to rob of gloucester artic behett others say behight promised and so it is used excellently well by tho norton in his translation into meter of the     psalm verse     i to the lord will pay

psalm into english meter has wisely made use of this word the man is blessed that has not bent to wicked read his ear but in the last spurious editions of the singing psalms the word read is changed into men i say spurious editions because not only here but quite throughout the whole book of psalms are strange alterations all for the worse and yet the title page stands as it used to do and all which is abominable in any book much more in a sacred work is ascribed to thomas sternhold john hopkins and others i am confident were sternhold and hopkins now living they would proceed against the innovators as cheats  a liberty which to say no more of their intolerable alterations ought by no means to be permitted or approved of by such as are for uniformity and have any regard for the old english saxon tongue hearne gloss on rob of gloc art read  i do herein agree with mr h little is it of avail to object that such words are become unintelligible since they are truly english men ought to understand them and such as are for uniformity should think all alterations in a language strange abominable and unwarrantable rightly therefore i say again has our poet used ancient words and

cambridge he began there to be uneasy for it shocked him to find he was commanded to believe against his judgment in points of religion philosophy etc for his genius leading him freely to dispute all propositions and call all points to account he was impatient under those fetters of the freeborn mind  being admitted to priests orders he found the examination very short and superficial and that it was not necessary to conform to the christian religion in order either to deaconship or priesthood he came to town and after having for some years been a writer for booksellers he had an ambition to be so for ministers of state the only reason he did not rise in the church we are told was the envy of others and a disrelish entertained of him because he was not qualified to be a complete spaniel however he offered the service of his pen in one morning to two great men of opinions and interests directly opposite by both of whom being rejected he set up a new project and styled himself the restorer of ancient eloquence he thought it as lawful to take a license from the king and parliament at one place as another at hicks hall as at doctorscommons so set up his oratory in newportmarket

dublin and london in octavo and duod the publisher who he was is uncertain but edward ward tells us in his preface to durgen that most judges are of opinion this preface is not of english extraction but hibernian etc he means dr swift who whether publisher or not may be said in a sort to be author of the poem for when he together with mr pope for reasons specified in the preface to their miscellanies determined to own the most trifling pieces in which they had any hand and to destroy all that remained in their power the first sketch of this poem was snatched from the fire by dr swift who persuaded his friend to proceed in it and to him it was therefore inscribed but the occasion of printing it was as follows  there was published in those miscellanies a treatise of the bathos or art of sinking in poetry in which was a chapter where the species of bad writers were ranged in classes and initial letters of names prefixed for the most part at random but such was the number of poets eminent in that art that some one or other took every letter to himself all fell into so violent a fury that for half a year or more the common newspapers in most of which they had some property as being hired writers were filled with the most abusive falsehoods and scurrilities they could possibly devise a liberty no ways to be wondered at in those people and in those papers that for many years during the uncontrolled license of the press had aspersed almost all the great characters of the age and this with impunity their own persons and names being utterly secret and obscure this gave mr pope the thought that he had now some opportunity of doing good by  and dragging into light these common enemies of mankind since to invalidate this universal slander it sufficed to show what contemptible men were the authors of it he was not without hopes that by manifesting the dullness of those who had only malice to recommend them either the booksellers would not find their account in employing them or the men themselves when discovered want courage to proceed in so unlawful an occupation this it was that gave birth to the dunciad and he thought an happiness that by the late flood of slander on himself he had acquired such a peculiar right over their names as was necessary to his design   the publisher to the reader it will be found a true observation though somewhat surprising that when any scandal is vented against a man of the highest distinction and character either in the state or in literature the public in general afford it a most quiet reception and the arger part accept it as favorably as if it were some kindness done to themselves whereas if a known scoundrel or blockhead but chance to be touched upon a whole legion is up in arms and it becomes the common cause of all scriblers booksellers and printers whatsoever  not to search too deeply into the reason hereof i will only observe as a fact that every week for these two months past the town has been persecuted with pamphlets advertisements etc see the list of these anonymous papers with their dates and authors thereunto annexed in the third article of this appendix  pamphlets advertisements letters and weekly essays not only against the wit and writings but against the character and person of mr pope and that of all those men who have received pleasure from his works which by modest computation may be about a about a hundred thousand it is surprising with what stupidity this preface which is almost a continued irony was taken by those authors this passage among others they understood to be serious  hundred thousand in these kingdoms of england and ireland not to mention jersey guernsey the orcades those in the new world and foreigners who have translated him into their languages of all this number not a man has stood up to say one word in his defense  the only exception is the the author of the following poem etc a very plain irony speaking of mr pope himself  author of the following poem who doubtless had either better insight into the grounds of this clamor or better opinion of mr popes integrity joined with a greater personal love for him than any other of his numerous friends and admirers  further that he was in his peculiar intimacy appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most private authors of all the anonymous pieces against him and from his having in this poem attacked the publisher in these words went a little too far but it is certain whatever names the reader finds that are unknown to him are of such and the exception is only of two or three whose dullness or scurrility all mankind agreed to have justly entitled them to a place in the dunciad  no man living who had not before printed or published some scandal against this gentleman  how i came possessed of it is of no concern to the reader but it would have been a wrong to him had i detained this publication since those names which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast as must render it too soon unintelligible if it provoke the author to give us a more perfect edition i have my end  who he is i cannot say and which is great pity there is certainly there is certainly nothing in his style etc this irony had small effect in concealing the author the dunciad imperfect as it was had not been published two days but the whole town gave it to mr pope  nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him for if it bears any resemblance to that of mr pope it is not improbable but it might be done on purpose with a view to have it pass for his but by the frequency of his allusions to virgil and a labored not to say affected shortness in imitation of him i should think him more an admirer of the roman poet than of the grecian and in that not of the same taste with his friend  i have been well informed that this work was the labor of full the labor of full six years etc this also was honestly and seriously believed by diverse of the gentlemen of the dunciad j ralph pref to sawney we are told it was the labor of six years with the utmost assiduity and application it is no great compliment to the authors sense to have employed so large a part of his life etc so also ward pref to durgen the dunciad as the publisher very wisely confesses cost the author six years retirement from all the pleasures of life though it is somewhat difficult to conceive from either its bulk or beauty that it could be so long in hatching etc but the length of time and closeness of application were mentioned to prepossess the reader with a good opinion of it  they just as well understood what scriblerus said of this poem    six years of his life and that he wholly retired himself from all the avocations and pleasures of the world to attend diligently to its correction and perfection and six years more he intended to bestow upon it as it should seem by this verse of statius which was cited at the head of his manuscript oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos the prefacer to curls key took this word to be really in statius by a quibble on the word duncia the dunciad is formed page   mr ward also follows him in the same opinion  duncia   hence also we learn the true title of the poem which with the same certainty as we call that of homer the iliad of virgil the aeneid of camoens the lusiad of voltaire the the henriad the french poem of monsieur voltaire entitled la henriade had been published at london the year before  henriad we may pronounce could have been and can be no other than  the dunciad  it is styled heroic as being doubly so not only with respect to its nature which according to the best rules of the ancients and strictest ideas of the moderns is critically such but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the writer who dared to stir up such a formidable irritable and implacable race of mortals  the time and date of the action is evidently in the last reign when the office of city poet expired upon the death of elkanah settle and it is fixed to the mayoralty of sir geo thorold but there may arise some obscurity in chronology from the names in the poem by the inevitable removal of some authors and insertion of others in their niches for whoever will consider the unity of the whole design will be sensible that the poem was not made for these authors but these authors for the poem i should judge that they were clapped in as they rose fresh and fresh and changed from day to day in like manner as when the old boughs wither we thrust new ones into a chimney  i would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious if he cannot decypher them since when he shall have found them out he will probably know no more of the persons than before  yet we judged it better to preserve them as they are than to change them for fictitious names by which the satire would only be multiplied and applied to many instead of one had the hero for instance been called codrus how many would have affirmed him to have been mr w mr d sir r b etc but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him theobald which by good luck happens to be the name of a real person  i am indeed aware that this name may to some appear too mean for the hero of an epic poem but it is hoped they will alter that opinion when they find that an author no less eminent than la bruyere has honored him with frequent mention and thought him worthy a place in his characters  voudriez vous theobalde que je crusse que vous etes baisse que vous n etes plus poet ni bell esprit que
