critical strictures on the new tragedy of elvira  price sixpence  critical strictures on the new tragedy of elvira written by mr david malloch  london printed for w flexney near graysinn holborn mdcclxiii  advertisement we have followed the authority of sir david dalrymple and mr samuel johnson in the orthography of mr mallochs name as we imagine the decision of these gentlemen will have more weight in the world of letters than even that of the said mr malloch himself  critical strictures etc in our strictures on the tragedy of elvira we shall not hasten all at once into the midst of things according to the rules of epic poetry heroic poems and remarks on new plays are things so essentially different that they ought not to be written by the same rules had mr malloch been aware of these distinctions in writing which surely are not very nice he probably would have discovered that scenes admirably adapted for forming a burlesque tragedy would never succeed in forming a serious drama in the prologue the author informs us that the preliminaries of peace are signed and the war now over and he humbly hopes as we have spared the french we will spare his tragedy but as the principles of restitution seem at present strong in this nation before we extend our mercy to him we insist that in imitation of his superiors he shall restore every thing valuable he has plundered from the french during the course of his sad and tedious composition  in the first scene of this tragedy a gentleman who has been abroad during the wars requests his friend to acquaint him with what has past at court in the time of his absence we were equally surprised and delighted with this new method of informing the spectators of the transactions prior to the commencement of the play nothing can be more natural for we imagine the art of conveying letters by post was at that time undiscovered we must indeed acknowledge that during the time of the roman empire letters were transmitted with the utmost celerity from one part to another of those immense dominions but we also know that after the subversion of that state by the incursions of the goths and vandals the first act of cruelty committed by these barbarians was murdering all the postboys in cold blood in like manner as our inhuman edward upon his completing the conquest of wales ordered all the bards to be put to death amongst the number of which had mr malloch been included we had not now been tortured with his execrable tragedy novelty of the same kind with this we have mentioned runs through the whole play almost every scene being an interview and a tete a tete the king wants to see his son the queen wants to see elvira elvira wants to see the king and so on through the five acts  no new thoughts or sentiments are to be found in this performance we meet only with old ones absurdly expressed dryden said that been johnson was every where to be traced in the snow of the ancients we may say that malloch is every where to be traced in the puddle of the moderns instead of selecting the beauties he has picked out whatever is despicable in shakespeare otway dryden and row like a pickpocket who dives for handkerchiefs not for gold and contents himself with what he finds in our great coat pocket without attempting our watch or your purse though mr malloch may only mean to borrow yet as he possesses no fund of original genius from whence he can pay his debts borrowing we are afraid is an inadequate expression the harsher one of stealing we must therefore though reluctantly substitute in its room in the prologue he acknowledges himself a culprit but as the loss of what he has pilfered is insignificant to the owners we shall bring him in guilty only of petty larcenary we believe he has been driven like poor people in this severe weather by dire necessity to such dishonest shifts  in this play the author has introduced a rebellion unparalleled in any history ancient or modern he raises his rebellions as a skilful gardener does his mushrooms in a moment and like an artful nurse he lulls in a moment the fretful child asleep the prince enters an appartment of the palace with a drawn sword this forms the rebellion the king enters the same appartment without a drawn sword this quashes the rebellion how to credit this story or to pardon this poetical license we are greatly at a loss for we know in the year      three thousand mountaineers actually appeared at derby cataline we are credibly informed had a gang of at least a dozen stout fellows and it is pretty certain that bedemar when going to inslave venice had provided pistols and battle powder for more than fifteen fighting men we are almost tempted to think that mr malloch gets his rebellions ready made like his scotch tobacco cut and dry at the sign of the valiant highlander  our great author possesses in its utmost perfection the happy art of uniting rival ladies and of setting at variance a virtuous father and son how intimate his acquaintance with human nature how deep his knowledge of the passions no less exquisite and refined in his morality like a true disciple of lord bolingbroke he unites vice and virtue most lovingly together witness this memorable line of the kings addressed to elvira midst all your guilt i must admire your virtue let us invert this line midst all your virtue i must abhor your guilt let us parody it o mr david malloch midst all your dullness i must admire your genius   we heard it once asserted by david hume esquire that mr malloch was destitute of the pathetic in this observation however we beg leave to differ with him in the fourth act the whole board of portuguese privy counselors are melted into tears the trial of the prince moves the hearts of those monsters of iniquity those members of inquisition when the less humane audience are in danger from the tediousness of two insipid harangues of falling fast asleep this majestic scene is too exactly copied from a trial at the old bailey to have even the merit of originality and indeed it is to the lenity of the king of portugal that we owe by far the greater part of this amazing play the good man lets his rebellious subjects out of prison to chat with him when a wiser monarch would have kept them close confined in newgate the incomparable action of that universal genius mr garrick alone saved this act from the damnation it deserved had not he like a second aeneas carried the old doting and decrepid father on his back he must have lain by the wy though we must observe another character in this play seemed better suited to the impetuosity and fire of this actor we could not but smile at the humor of a merry wag in the pit who at the conclusion of one of the most tiresome pleadings with some degree of impatience and emotion called out encore encore  in the fifth act we were melted with the sight of two young children which the king embraced which the prince embraced which elvira embraced mr addison in the   th no of the spectator has some remarks so judicious and lively on the practice of introducing children on the stage that we must beg leave to transcribe the passage  a disconsolate mother with a child in her hand has frequently drawn compassion from the audience and has therefore gained a place in several tragedies a modern writer who observed how this had taken in other plays being resolved to double the distress and melt his audience twice as much as those before him had done brought a princess on the stage with a little boy in one hand and a girl in the other a third poet being resolved to outwrite all his predecessors a few years ago introduced three children with great success and as i am informed a young gentleman who is sully determined to break the most obdurate heart has a tragedy by him where the first person that appears on the stage is an afflicted widow in her mourning weeds with half a dozen fatherless children attending her like those that usually hang about the figure of charity thus several incidents that are beautiful in a good writer become ridiculous by falling into the hands of a bad one  we would suggest to mr malloch the useful hint of introducing in some of his future productions the whole foundling hospital which with a well painted scene of the edifice itself would certainly call forth the warmest tears of pity and the bitterest emotions of distress especially when we consider that many of the parents of these unfortunate babes would probably be spectators of this interesting scene  the conclusion of the piece is as abrupt as the other parts of it are absurd we should be much at a loss to guess by whom the poison is administered to elvira were we not aided in our conjectures by the shrewd suspicions which the king though otherwise a very loving husband seems to entertain of his wife upon my regreting that her majesty if guilty should escape without poetical justice at least a gentleman who sat behind me a friend as i supposed of the author assured me her punishment was reserved for the farce which for that purpose was contrary to custom added to the play  though in general this tragedy is colder than the most extreme parts of nova zembla yet we now and then feel a warmth but it is such a warmth or glow rath as is sometimes produced by the handling of snow  bad as this play is yet will the author have the profits of his three nights few on the first night having either taste or spirit to express their disapprobation like the rascals who plundered lisbon after the earthquake mr david malloch will extract guineas out of rubbish  we shall now give in a few words the quintessence of this play monarchs ought to be just heroes are bad men husbands ought to die for their wives wives for their husbands we ought to govern our passions and the sun shines on all alike a few of these new remarks form the sum total of this contemptible piece  after the play we were entertained with an epilogue fraught with humor and spoken with spirit there was a simile of a bundle of twigs formed into a rod which seemed to convey a delicate allusion to mr mallochs original profession and some of the lines contained an exquisite and severe criticism on the play itself  amidst all the harshness inspired by a real feeling of the dullness of the composition itself it would be unjust not to bestow the highest applause on the principal performers by the energy of whose action even dullness was sometimes rendered respectable we were sorry to find such great talents so very ill employed the melting tones of a cibber should make every eye stream with tears pritchard should always elevate garrick give strength and majesty to the scene let us soften at the keen distress of a belvidera let our souls rise with the dignity of an elizabeth let us tremble at the wild madness of a lear but let us not yawn at the stupidity of uninteresting characters  finis
