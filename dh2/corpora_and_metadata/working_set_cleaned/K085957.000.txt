a full and just account of the present state of the ottoman empire in all its branches with the government and policy religion customs and way of living of the turks in general faithfully related from a serious observation taken in many years travels through those countries  by aaron hill gent  coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt hor epist    l   london printed for the author and are to be sold by john mayo stationer and printer at the printingpress in fleet street anno domini   0   anne r  whereas our trusty and welbeloved aaron hill gent has humbly represented unto us that he has with great care labor and expense compiled and prepared for the press a book entitled the present state of aethiopia egypt the three arabias palestine and the whole ottoman empire and has therefore humbly besought us to grant him our royal privilege and license for the sole printing and publishing thereof for the term of fourteen years we being willing to give all due encouragement to works of this nature tending to the improvement of useful knowledge are graciously pleased to condescend to his request and we do therefore by these presents grant unto him the said aaron hill his executors administrators and assigns our royal license for the sole printing and publishing the present state of aethiopia egypt the three arabias palestine and the whole ottoman empire aforesaid for the term of fourteen years from the date hereof strictly forbidding all our subjects within our kingdoms and dominions to reprint the same either in the like or in any other volume or volumes whatsoever or to import buy vend utter or distribute any copies thereof reprinted beyond the seas during the aforesaid term of fourteen years without the consent or approbation of the said aaron hill his heirs executors and assigns under his or their hands and seals first had and obtained as they will answer the contrary at their peril whereof the commissioners and other officers of our customs the master wardens and company of stationers are to take notice that the same may be entered in the rigister of the said company and that due obedience be rendered thereunto  given at our court at st jamess the nineteenth day of february   0   in the seventh year of our reign by her majestys command svnderland  portrait of aaron hill mr aaron hill aetatis suae    ao domi   0  h hulsbergh sculp ne solum forti poprium    the dedication to the queen madam were it possible for me to offer at your royal feet a tribute so important as to merit your majestys acceptance i had never paid my debt of duty in so poor a manner but since the smile of heaven upon the widows mite instructs us that the will not power must enrich the offering i am almost led to hope your majesty will stoop to the reception of so low a present when you shall be pleased to know it is all i have to give for life and fortune are so firmly yours already that i cannot hope to taste the length of one or worth of the other but by holding both in your majestys disposal  the sacred power of pious majesty commands not only love and loyalty from subjects and dependants but as the attractive virtue of the wondrous magnet draws the sturdy iron to its sway may challenge an authority to rule the salvage minds of independent infidels the mighty glories of your majestys successful reign have bent more kingdoms than you govern to an envy of the britons happy in your influences and experience taught me that while britains name is now the praise and wonder of such nations as before scarce knew it the prodigious honor paid her name is only owing to the virtues of her monarch  to whom then mighty queen should i address my self for a protection of my labors but to the throne of majesty where critics malice and the sting of censure cannot reach me and where heaven has seemed to point our marks of duty and humility to lie as by the seat of mercy and the viceroy of omnipotence  be therefore pleased great ruler of the hearts as well as persons of your people to accept this humble offering which i lay with duty at your gracious feet for as the small improvement many years continued travels through the rougher corners of the world have made me conscious of may so be crowned with the great honor of your notice all my future aims and utmost applications shall be how to make my self attain one step above the character which now i can with honesty and faithfulness lay hearty claim to of  madam your majestys most dutiful but least deserving subject and servant aaron hill  the preface it was an admirable observation of sir roger lestrange that a book that faced the world without a preface should be looked upon as much unfinished as a beau who comes to court without a perriwig for it is not only grown a kind of law by long continued custom but is even become a necessary labor for the vindication of a man who dares assume the name of author from the not alone sharp criticisms but reflections and scurrilities he will be sure to meet with  we live it seems in a faultfinding age and it is almost become a crime or argument of softness a newfashiond word for folly in a gentleman to read a book with any other aim than to condemn or censure what he understands not  i am sure i have just reason to affirm a truth i have been taught by the ingratitude i would not willingly make use of a more sharp expression of some countrymen of mine who by the baseness of their tempers and malicious aims of disappointed envy took i hope more pains than usual to convince me that my native britain could produce as barbarous and sordid wretches as i ever met with in my conversation with the infidels  the reasons which induced me to address the world with an account of what i had observed in traveling so many years together were not vanity ambition mercenary hopes or any of the common motives which urge great numbers on to write and build them up to the fond name of author heaven indud me with a soul too honest to become a prostitute to the poor dross of interest nor were my circumstances such as might reduce me to a want of those advantages which have too often made a good man infamous  hence perhaps i found so many enemies for we are now unhappily divided into such disordered factions open discords and unaccountable byinterests that honesty it self is measured by opinion and the scale of merit is outballancd by partiality so that when a man is recommended to the world as worth regard the first examination made about him is who sides he with and a report is given of his capacity or principles according to the party he may chance to vote for  possibly i have been represented as a zealous stickler for some party or perhaps been thought to side with none as not too fond of either which of these have made me enemies i cannot determine or if i have enemies at all since it may be it is the fashion to discourage vvriters for endeavoring to take more useful pains than other people be it one or the other i can only say i should if any be exempt from prejudice on that account since i have been so little resident in england that i never yet found time to think on parties any further than to wish there were no illdivided ones so much as dreamed of in the kingdom  my friends persuasions when i came from traveling engaged me to comply with their desires in publishing this book which i more readily assented to because i knew i could say somewhat more than had been seen or told the world by former travelers and i was naturally led to hope my youth might plead a pardon for my errors since an author who attempts to write at four and twenty might i thought be readily excused for more mistakes than will i hope in the succeeding sheets disgust the reader  but there are a sort of people who appear such zealous devotees to malice that no reasonable plea is proof against em innocence it self is spurned by their presumption and they are so overfond of warring against common sense humanity and goodness that they generally blind their judgments to indulge their vices and attack the castle where it is ablest to repulse them  this has been my own goodluck and the illfortune of my censurers whose weak objections spread abroad for ends i am about to mention were so innoffensively ridiculous as to swell up with huge and threatening venom but then burst like toads with their selfdangerous poison yet though they hurt not me their guilt and baseness is not less than if i had been made a sufferer by their groundless malice for as the poet has it   who hurts me not is not the righteous man but he who will not hurt me when he can   the society of booksellers have in a manner quite engrossed the press and the unhappy circumstances of some authors having given them opportunities to impose on their necessities by purchasing for almost nothing their ingenious labors and by making all the gain their own sole property instructed them like stingless drones to feed upon the honey of industrious bees they made advantages of such occasions and encroachd so far by gradual advances that they us d all authors as they did their poor ones and assumed not only the prerogative of purchasing for inconsiderable sums the brightest copies but pretended to be judges of the work it self when probably they knew not what it treated of  hence they were encouraged to impose upon the town by printing old books with new titles selling others at a double rate and authors knowing they could reap no profit from the publication of their writings left em wholly to the booksellers direction whence the press was commonly corrected and the book exposed to public view with as much nicety and learning as became a booksellers capacity  by having printed some few little essays of my own the common way i went as far as any line could reach toward fathoming the conscience of a bookseller or two and thence became acquainted with their customs well enough to care as little as i could for dealing with them and unwilling to have this book come out as uncorrect as it might probably have done and see the town imposed on by too high a price or let the book come out too meanly printed or on common paper i resolved to have it in my power to use the buyers as i would be used my self and therefore at my own charge undertook the printing it but was advised that i might run as little hazard of a loss as possible to do it by subscription  but i was not thus delivered from the imposition of the booksellers who pretended it their right to have two books gratis for six subscriptions i refused to grant em this extravagant demand and gave em often public notice of my resolution whereupon they made it their endeavor to decry the book with open malice and discourage it as much as possible but lest their currlike howlings should be scorned alone as insignificantly noisy they procured some little pensioners of theirs to act the mastiff and by joining in the consort bark the base to their poor trebles  the justice of the thing was what they least regarded twas enough for them to say twas bad though being asked the cause they could reply no more than that twas so because it was so argument was a strange plant to their thin gardens but it must be held as an undoubted maxim that it would be an unpardonable crime should they promote an authors undertaking who refuses to promote their lawless interest  some have had the simple honesty to bring their money to the printer in a rage and swear they never had subscribed but that their customers obliged em to it owning freely that they did the book the greatest injury they could because the author had refused to give em two in six for nothing  well sirs go on with your endeavors i am above the reach of your detraction gain i sought not and for other matters let the book henceforward speak in its own vindication i am only grieved for those unhappy writing gentlemen too much depressed by fortune and thence subject to your tyranny  i was grown so weary of the mentioning the booksellers that i had resolved to say no more about em when a certain humor of a member of that good fraternity who has the sign of the green dragon for distinction made me laugh at the remembrance and record him for an admirable bargainmaker  he had with much ado my promise by a friends entreaty to allow him eight as he desired with a proviso he should take em all unbound but though he was solicitous for nothing more before i granted it he hummd a while with a wise air of contemplation when i sent him word he might subscribe so and replied he thought that nine twixt man and man were very reasonable had i granted those he would have asked for ten and so increased till i had found if possible the measure of his conscience  my book lay open at the printers as it passed the press for free perusal and the booksellers and their adherents had thereby an opportunity to raise objections with pretense of having read the sheets but as i never heard one censure yet deserving confutation or indeed requiring more than common sense to overthrow it so i thought it only fit to let em sink without regard to their original obscurity but if there shall be found a gentleman who meets with any thing he justly may object against let him be pleased to hint it in a letter for me directed to the printers house and then to satisfy the world and him i shall not think my time illspent to print it with as large an answer as is necessary in the preface i shall publish with the next edition  and now i leave the booksellers to their advantages assuring them i owe them no ill will and only say thus much to justify my book against their calumnies if profit could have bribed my tongue or hopes of their good character have stifled my affection to plaindealing i had never been so open in my declarations of their artifices justice always guides my pen nor can rewards desire of praise or fear of any mans illword divert my course of truth from its direct and uncorrupted channel contrary to the assertion of the celebrated juvenal jvu sat  0  tanto major famae sitisest quam ipsam virtutis quis enim virtutem amplectitur praemia si tollas so much more powerful is the thirst of fame than the neglected virtues honest aim for who courts virtue or can long obey when the rewards she gives are snatched away   i shall only add that as it is evidently true the methods i have taken were as just and honorable as was possible the malice which inclined these people to oppose em was a plain effect of something in their principles not altogether reconcilable to justice for where honesty encounters honesty a sympathetic harmony is found between em and we have the words of an experienced greek to teach us that  one good man never hates another   some snarlers do and many more may cavil at the style i have made use of and the weightiest arguments they bring against it are that it appears affected and elaborate that it is dressed in a romantic air and that in short it is so like poetry that it runs into blank verse measure and becomes a kind of prosepoetic composition  it is methinks ungratefully received if censured on so weak a groundwork for i doubt not but the learned reader will perceive no greater difference in the style throughout the book than where it is purposely designed according to the various natures of the subjects treated on and a judicious taste will easily distinguish that the language flows more negligently than it climbs affectedly in all the treatise  besides allowing i had taken pains by an elaborate bent of application to compose a style which i might be deceived in thinking good twoud be but generous and becoming the humanity of all who read it rather to excuse the real errors than create imaginary ones because the fault i had committed could proceed from nothing but an ardent inclination to endeavor more than ordinary the satisfaction of the reader  as for its being dressed in a romantic air were that malicious accusation full as just as it is absurd i cannot see the reasons why it should be looked upon as an objection every body knows the language of romances differs from more serious writings only in the fine descriptions florid speeches artful turns and winning eloquence which are made use of to adorn and recommend a feigned relation and by covering the flaws occasioned by its want of truth excite as noble thoughts and raise as emulative an esteem of honor in the readers soul as if twere real and if the abovenamd ornaments can shine so brightly in a false account of things and places surely when they are additionally strengthened by the truth as well as novelty of what they treat of upon second thoughts those selfconfounding critics who have censured me on this account will find that what they aimed as an abuse has proved a compliment  and just as weak an argument is that which blames my language as poetical for i would only ask those gentlemen who broke their shins by stumbling upon that objection what was the original design of poetry and if they know so much they will answer me twas introduced for pious ends and practiced first to win mankind from guilt and follies by the sweet insinuation of harmonious doctrine for the force of numbers bears a kind of unresisted charm which having first bewitched the senses penetrates the ear and warbles smoothly through the soul dissolving passion in a flood of pleasure  well then this granted me must consequently speak it undeniable that poetry is fittest to command attention and it follows that the nearer prose can imitate it so much more twill tempt the soul to listen to its eloquence and if that be all the ill my style is guilty of i may presume the world will easily forgive me  epithets are certainly the life of an expression and if using them a little oftner and more artfully than commonly we do will not alone adorn our language with a smoother cadence and compleater harmony but add a sparkling kind of vigor to the style they are used in why should men persist in an old error rather than submit to take example from the practice of another  i know not any book before my own that has been writ this way and consequently could not hope to introduce a novelty without encountring everarmd ill nature even were my style as free from faults as i could wish it twoud have enemies because it is new and how can any lower aim that way expect to prosper unopposd when even the glorious reformations of our church and government have many foes who dare reproach em  among the few who i heard were wise enough to think the arguments forenamd a proof of their capacities there is it seems a kind of talking spark who holds an office in the exchequer very fond of raillery he thinks that he has wit enough to make atonement for his want of memory or i should take the liberty to blame him for forgetting he attempted once to make himself an author but the itch that juvenal calls scribendi cacoethes wanting force to lift him higher than the character of horaces promissor hiatu he fell down like icarus and drowned himself in infamy thence losing all right of pretense to censure others by the miserable insufficiency of his own labors  satyr is a kind of dangerous edgdtool and like a razor in a monkeys paw will cut the fingers of a fool who trys to use it wit like fame is very coy and hates a ravisher she sports and wantons like the nimble dolphin in her native channel but like herrings dies immediately and stinks out of her own element  there are a sort of people to so silly a degree the enemies of their own character that silence though the only skreen to hide their want of common sense is most a stranger to their daily practice these are to be pitied and it would be happy since they are blind of soul could there be found a mental occulist of skill enough to couch the catataracts of their obscured capacities that when their eyes of reason would permit their judgment to see clearly they might borrow a latin dictionary and try to construe the two verses following juv sat    felicia tempora quae te moribus opponunt habeat jam roma pudorem   that i might not alone inform but please my reader i have taken care in the succeeding sheets to introduce as many stories as i could with different aims for some are moral some diverting others melancholy and of all kinds some the only fault which can be found with this is that it is digressive from the subject of my book it is true and so are all the moral and occasional reflections scattered up and down yet doubt i not but as the last will be acceptable to honest people on account of the good doctrine they contain and which i ever hope to bear in my remembrance so the first will find a welcome for the diversion they may give unprejudiced perusers  as some may like my book the better others will i question not complain that my quotations from the classic authors are too frequently applied to this i need reply no more than that they struck my memory as i was writing and were thence transcribed as they occurred by accident yet this i dare be pretty sure of that there is none will censure me for the respect i bear the classics in so often mentioning their thoughts but such poor wretches as for want of taste are made incapable of prizing or for want of learning cannot understand them  as i have little reason to believe my judgment any ways superlative i will not say but i have injured them in the translation where the lines would bear a literal version i have rendred the expressions english word for word but where i could not come so near the very words without destroying all the harmony i thought it better to make use of the assistance of a paraphrase yet still preserved entire the genuine sense of the original  a literal translation commonly appears confined uneasy close and awkward like a streightlacd lady in her new made stays but when the version has put on an easy paraphrase and the fine lady is completely dressed with ribbons manteau and her looser ornaments though they are still the same they were before they brightly double former graces and become adorned with an attractive majesty  one sucking critic after having turned the book over and over at the printers with a design to practice the discerning art he had so lately taken on him fixed at last upon this translation of the following line coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt men who over seas to distant countries roll often change their climate but retain their soul   now says he did ever any mortal see so silly a translation i am sure this author can be no great scholar for coelum here is latin for heaven and you see there is no such word as heaven in the whole two verses  o tempora o mores to how strange a length extends ill nature malice and hypochrisy who knows which way to please a world that only can be pleased by their own actions vanity is grown the epidemic plague which robs us of our judgment and a daily proof of the opiniated blindness of mankind in general serves to show us the necessity of learning that  the maxim know your self is really grown useful in every place thought so in none   pretending to condemn all actions but our own is common now from even the courtier to the cottage and deceit is dressed in such an air of honesty they cannot often be distinguished from each other ignorance assisted by a grave assurance passes current for the depth of learning censure is esteemed a proof of judgment and pretended merit elbows from her throne the real virtue were but seneca now living justly might he add more sharp invectives to the following exclamation sen tra hip o vita fallax abditos sensus geris animisque pulchram turpibus faciem induis pudor impudentem celat audacem quies pietas nefandum  o thou fallacious life what hidden faculties in thee we find with a fair face thou cloakst a sordid mind a modest air disguises impudence bullies to peace make counterfeit pretense and pious carriage hides the sinful wretch   i hope i need not fear that any man will carp at my attempting to translate at all the authors i have quoted since the book will probably be read by many who can only understand the english and the men of letters reading the original may if they please pass over the translation  the stretch of malice is so very wide that it has seized among my censurers a pastor of the church of which though an unworthy i am an honest member and am therefore very sorry that to justify my self from the aspersions of his tongue i am obliged to do a thing so much against my nature as expose the follies i am loath to think em worse of one who has the honor to officiate in the cause of christ and thence should rather merit the profound respect my nature teaches me to bear the cloth i hope he will not long be so unworthily possessed of men though never so religious are not wholly free from mortal frailties he may possibly repent hereafter though i see as yet but little likelihood of such an alteration  i must own i was surpised beyond expression when after having urged him to forbear some false and scurrilous reflections on a dr g  th gentleman of worth and learning in a high degree i saw him strike his fist upon the table and cry out in passion before many witnesses endeavor not to justify him he is a v  n r  e and r  l and i will run him down with all the spite and malice i am capable of uttering and to do the lecturer justice he is as capable of both as any man in christendom  i had not wondered to have heard this speech from some robust and brawny grenadier but when mr d  b  ns a parson uttered it from whom i looked for better doctrine i was frighted at the emphasis he put on his expression and starting backwards with uplifted arms could scarce forbear repeating et tu brute as the dying caesar did to his assassinate  nay thought i if you who from a pulpit every week instruct the world can thus by your example contradict your precepts you may be as well for ought i know a breaker of the whole contexture of religion which you preach and live a life of wickedness in every kind as well as this if so i must declare with juvenal juv sat   ultra sauromatas fugere hinc libet and glacialem oceanum quoties aliquid de moribus audent qui curios simulant and bacchanalia vivunt beyond the tartars realms i wish to be or even more northward than the greenland sea as often as wretches dare good council give who look like saints but more like atheists live   it is true i have less cause to wonder at the public defamations he is pleased to make on my account because he told me to my face that i had better not have contradicted him for he had a considerable acquaintance and would do my book more injury than i imagined and i thank his conscience he has tried to keep his word in this particular  i had not mentioned him in reverence to his gown but that the credit he obtains thereby might easily incline all such as know me not to judge he speaks as truly as he ought to do juv s    fallit enim vitium specie virtutis and umbra for vice when dressed like virtue often deceives   a holy aspect and the justly venerable character of clergyman may easily delude unthinking multitudes to groundless censures of unguarded honesty they know him not and are deceived by his pretending to be free from malice therefore i owed this justice to my own vindication for his admirable dissimulation and set airs of gravity are as persius says persius sat   ad populum phaleras ego te intus and in cute novi trappings to please the mob but i have looked in and know thy wellcloakd conscience through thy skin   i hasten from a subject so unpleasing as complaint to the more generous call of humble gratitude which tells me loudly that i cannot mention the advantages i had of other travelers without remembring and acknowledging to whom i owed them and declaring to my reader that whatever i know and far the worthiest part of what i saw was due to the unmerited but boundless generosity of that glory to his country the right honorable the lord paget many years residing at constantinople as ambassador extraordinary and so wisely managing that slippery post that he deserves in all respects the lofty character he bears in turkey of the only man who ever could preserve the favor of the turks and interest of his country both together  i went abroad so very young that after having saild a voyage and made use of accidental opportunities to visit egypt palestine and other eastern parts i came to constantinople time enough to owe the best improvements of my education to the generous care of this wise nobleman whose instructions and example gave me first a notion of the world and under whose protection i was afterward so happy as to see it to advantage having had the honor to attend him from the turkish court to england in a journey over land through almost all the celebrated parts of christendom  the great discretion sure dispatch and admirable policy wherewith he managed the important business of his embassy were such as won him so uncommon a respect from all the turkish ministers of state that under the extensive umbrage of his interest any man who took upon him the protective name of englishman was sure to meet in every part of their dominions more civilities and toleration than the christian travelers of any other country whatsoever could pretend to hope for  hence a thousand marks of favor were conferred at several times on many of our countrymen and hence i snatched the lucky opportunity of seeing with some other english travelers in the year one thousand seven hundred and two the great seraglio at constantinople so much farther than had been before permitted the grand signior being then at adrianople and his ladies with him at his palace in that city  i have little now to add but that i wish with all my heart the reader could be promised a sufficient share of satisfaction in the perusing the succeeding sheets to make atonement for the tedious time the book has been expected malice is so very prevalent and every man so naturally apt to put the worst construction on anothers actions that there are but few who would omit so fair an opportunity of justifying a delay so unavoidable from the examples of the greatest men who ever published books this way  but as i seek not the applause and very heartily despise the censures of the snarling ignorant and ungenerous vulgar i address my plea to such alone as learning or a native nobleness of soul has qualified for serious and impartial judges and those i dare presume to hope will easily perceive that if the book has been a little longer than it was proposed in coming out it was no fault of mine but owing to the common slowness of proceeding used in all books printed by subscription  however as the great encouragement i met with from the numbers of subscribers to this first impression leaves an inconsiderable quantity for sale i am already printing off a second edition with the utmost speed imaginable and have taken care to use such means in hastening on the press that if i set another time it shall be when i find my self assured that i can keep it punctually  as i have heard no more objections that the very weak ones i endeavored to confute in the beginning of the preface i can now enlarge no further in defense of book or author but since i have made so fair an offer of obliging all objectors with the utmost satisfaction truth can give them i would willingly persuade my self to hope that none will be so groundlessly illnatured as to force a war with one who holds the peaceful palm before him as a tutelary mark for the protection of his labors  nothing sure is blacker than detraction hells wide storehouse yields no sin of a more damning nature and methinks no subject of a christian country should indulge his malice by a blushless declaration of egregious falsehoods with design to stain a goodmans character when the speaking well of nay the using well those very men who most abuse us is by the divine decree of christ himself enjoined us as a duty and the very maxim of a heathen in the following verses serve to shame the daily practices of many men who openly avow a zealous love of conscience and religion   it is a good custom to speak well of all but cruel to abuse even such as really fall   however if it is possible there should be found a sort of men who out of blind affection to the dictates of ill nature are resolved to damn what ever they read and only read for that base purpose i shall look upon them as unworthy not of the resentment only but the very notice of an honest man and even content my self to say with persius

obscure an origin that the invaded world stood wondering at their growing fortunes while they should have endeavored to repulse by a vigorous opposition the bold incursions of their encroaching numbers and as at this day they owe the quiet possession of their former acquisitions to the supine negligence and civil discords of the christian world so the same neglects and dissonant interests and affections first built their glory on the entire subversion of our jarring ancestors but twill be needless to insert here any more of their history than will be found necessary for the more easy comprehension of their present condition  the origin of the turks whether pushed on by famine or expelled by the prevailing power of contending neighbors is altogether uncertain a body of adventurous scythians forsook their country in the year of christ     and inured to hardships by the daily prospects of familiar dangers passed over the caspian mountains and wrested forcibly the possession of armenia major from its surpised inhabitants from the appellation of its newcome masters it received its present name of tvrcomania who strengthened by the daily accession of their wandering countrymen grew strongly planted in their conquered habitation and were soon after able to send  000 men under the command of tangrolipix the chief of the selzuccians a family eminent among them to the assistance of mahomet the persian sultan who by their prevailing valor gave a happy turn to his declining fortune but the babylonian caliph being overthrown tangrolipix offering to withdraw his forces was detained unwillingly by the arbitrary power of his ungrateful ally this bred a warm resentment in the turkish soldiers who retiring to a wood increased their numbers by a daily reception of deserting persians their advancement to the empires of persia and babylon till at last they overthrew the sultan in a bloody battle and by the mutual consent of both armies tangrolipix in place of the deceased mahomet was declared sultan of persia and babylon stupendous fortune favored the attempts of his active successors till the glorious expedition of the united christians redeemed the conquered syria from their usurped dominion their ruin by the tartars various was their future fortune sometimes gaining sometimes losing till the empire of tangrolipix was wholly subverted by an unexpected inundation of the conquering tartars they rise again to whom the flying turks abandoned the possession of their enlarged dominions and joining with their countrymen of the selzuccian race in asia minor they followed the fortunes of the successful aladine who invading the neglected corners of the grecian empire then warring with the latins possessed himself of cilicia and the neighboring countries erecting at sebastia the arbitrary throne of a newwon kingdom  are entirely ruined in all parts but they enjoyed not long a quiet possession of their easy conquests for the arring sons of aladine dismembered their dominion by a mutual opposition to each others interest till the fourth king from the founder of that monarchy became a tributary vassal to the victorious tartar who had now entirely broken their large empire in the greater asia as the successful mamalukes had drove their countrymen out of egypt but the tartars neglecting their numerous acquisitions the remaining turks seeing no power to prevent their wills divided with their interests the dismembered country and he that had strength enough to take possession enjoyed the government of whatever part his inclination led him to make choice of  ertogriel the son of solomon a principal member of the oguzian family had with an unexpected supply successfully assisted sultan aladine in a doubtful battle and was rewarded with the possession of siguta a bithynian lordship in which he settled his separated family whose unstable residence had till then obliged them to wander through the various mazes of an uncertain fortune and after a long and peaceable possession having gained the affection of christians and turks by his mild disposition he died in the year of christ      and left behind him three sons osman saragutin and iundas  the rise and antiquity of the ottoman empire osman was elected by the oguzians to his fathers government who taking the opportunity of resenting some outrages committed by the neighboring greeks invaded their dominions overthrew their armies in several pitched battles and having made himself master of the city of nice was after the death of aladine elected to the dignity of sultan and reigning    years he wrested from the greeks cappadocia bithynia and most of the fortified towns which bordered on the euxine sea till in the year   00 he chose neapolis for his regal seat and from thence we date the original of the present turkish empire  then successive conquests osman was succeeded by his son vrchan whose successful attempts on the grecian provinces so much enlarged his dominions that he fixed his seat of empire at the great city of prusa which retained that honor until mahomet the first after several acquisitions in the european greece removed it to adrianople the successors of this prince continued their invasions on the remaining branches of the grecian empire till by the unparalleled negligence of the state then disagreeing with their emperor they lost their ancient city constantinople to the prevailing forces of a second mahomet who by this additional glory was justly honored with the title of great the loss of their metropolis was fatally succeeded by an entire subversion of their shattered empire  continuation of their history the successors of mahomet by yearly acquisitions enlarged their territories in europe and asia which at last not contenting them the victorious selym extended his dominion over syria and egypt bringing the arabians under his authority and raising the foundation of a larger power on the bloody ruin of the subverted mamalukes since when the latter sultans have added to their dominions most of the islands in the aegean sea rhodes with those noble knights who so vigorously defended the seat of their order submitted at last to the irresistible power of the successful solomon cyprus was obliged to fall before the conquering armies of the second selym and since then so prodigiously have they spread their conquests that they now enjoy a free and unmolested possession of the noblest parts of asia europe and the remoter africa on which extensive foundation they have certainly built the most absolute empire and arbitrary monarchy that has ever flourished since the worlds original  extent of the turkish empire for first the western part of its european dominion is extended to the very borders of the oncelost hungary stretching to the adriatic by the ragusean confines bounded on the south by the mediterranean sea on the east with pontus propontis and the aegean even to the scythian chersonesus poland and russia scarce bound its northern limits within this vast extent of empire are contained the fertile territories of the famed romania servia rascia and bulgaria valachia and moldavia pay tribute to its power albania epirus macedonia bosnia and greece are now entirely turkish and the fruitful islands of the aegean sea with those of candy rhodes and cyprus acknowledge now no lord but him  their empire in asia his asiatick territories contain that vast tract of land between the euxine cilician and aegean seas viz bithynia pontus phrygia galatia lycia cappadocia pamphylia cilicia and the vast extent of armenia minor stretching northward from colchis to catai and eastward to the inaccessible mountains of the hardy georgians armenia major is now mostly theirs babylonia mesopotamia phoenicia coelosyria and palestine are altogether in the turks possession as are the vast dominions of the three arabias  their dominions in africa in africa it stretches along the unmeasured coasts of the mediterranean from the red sea to the inmost parts of the mauritanian country including tripoli tunis fez algiers and morocco so vastly large are the usurped dominions of these encroaching infidels but that the reader may more plainly comprehend the whole by a measure of some parts i have calculated the following account for his more particular satisfaction  palvs moeotis entirely his spreads full a thousand miles into the land the circuit of the euxine or blacksea contains at least two thousand six hundred miles three thousand two hundred miles scarce compass egypt and as much of the mediterranean coast as is subject to the turk contains above seven thousand miles in compass from the caspian derbent to aden on the red sea is three thousand and odd miles and near four thousand miles from tremessen in barbary to balsora on the persian gulf so that the amazing conquests of the macedonian alexander are swallowed at a morsel by the swifter acquisitions of a modern empire the stupendous victories of the successful jews outdone by these the mighty power of the egyptian monarchs entirely baffled by the turkish soldiers the grecian empire once so famous for its military achievements divided into provinces by one far greater athens sparta corinth lacedaemonia and those numerous governments so famed for their abounding virtues are all involved in one common ruin and the glorious actions of their prodigious heros forgotten and unimitated by the broken spirits of their supine posterity  the conveniences of their metropolis nor wants this vast dominion any thing that is requisite for the strenuous support of its exalted splendor its very situation seems to speak it built upon the loftiest columns of universal monarchy for its equal division between europe and asia has placed it in the center of the surrounding world whereby they are ever ready to enlarge their conquests either way and have fresh supplies still near at hand to reinforce their broken troops in every corner while his imperial city the ancient constantinople standing so commodiously on the extremest limits of those joining regions is officiously attended by two neighboring seas whose meeting waters gliding by the walls of the magnificent seraglio bring wealth and honor to this potent lord and lay the various treasures of the earth at the worshipped feet of their illustrious monarch  the titles of the turkish emperor nothing can in a more lively manner express the sense they have of their extended power than that affected vanity with which their haughty sultans swell their titles as king of kings and lord of lords ruler of the east and west and of all parts of the world prince of the holy and chaste city jerusalem shining with the brightness of god thrice happy lord of the refulgent mecca tamer of infidels and scourger of the unbelieving race of christian vassals lord of the white and black seas the most mighty and invincible sultan who has power from god to rule all people with a bridle and to break open the gates and bars of all cities and strong places into whose almighty hands are delivered all the ends of the world none excepted these and many suchlike titles are proudly challenged by the imperious ottomans who in former times have blasphemously presumed to take upon them the very attributes of the almighty but of late they are become more modest which may proceed from the numerous disappointments that in the modern wars have so frequently baffled their presumptuous armies and by curbing the designs of their ambitious sultans taught em better how to know themselves and prize their neighbors yet notwithstanding the inglorious reigns of several modern emperors have added nothing to their territories they still continue in a full possession of their former acquisitions and are not only able to defend their own but conquer other countries should the warlike spirit of some more active sultan once lead em out to action  chap ii of the turkish policy the political maxims of an arbitrary government may not improperly be compared to the spreading roots and twisting fibers of some tall oak whose elevated height exposing it to double danger by the raging force of stormy winds among its branches has no security but the rooted depth by which it is supported against the strongest efforts of contending tempests and certainly a government so vastly large so inexpressibly rich and so strangely different from all other must be supported strongly by some uncommon policy without which guard the daring ambition of aspiring princes and the formidable violences of intestine discords would like some surprising earthquake break fiercely through the bands of duty and by their factious consequences involve the empire in most inevitable ruin  that i may with greater ease describe the solid foundations upon which the turks have built their safety twill be necessary to divide their maxims into two parts the first are those by which the sultan supports securely his unrivaled grandeur and the sure dominion of his extensive empire the second are such notions as are taught his subjects with the earliest rudiments of their common knowledge and diffuse with ease a certain awful duty or almost idolatrous veneration through the whole country for the person of their emperor and are the only causes of that mild obedience and miserable servitude with which they own themselves his slaves and endeavor vigorously to exert an uncommon industry in hopes to gain some mark of favor from the inestimable bounty of their common master  the first maxim of the turkish policy i shall begin with the sultan whose first maxim of policy is to depopulate as much as may be the remoter parts of his wide empire the more effectually to strengthen its center the reasons upon which this maxim is founded the reasons he gives to prove the usefulness of this maxim are these first that countries far distant from his eye might with more ease and less danger be induced to some fatal rebellion were the number of their inhabitants but any way proportionable to the convenience of their situation secondly by the miserable and barren condition of a dispeopled country twould be found a matter of inconceivable difficulty for an invading enemy to penetrate their empire with a numerous army since their troops without the chargeable inconvenience of vast quantities of provisions would never be able to subsist in a country whose flying handful of inhabitants would immediately convey what little stores their poverty afforded them to woods and mountains and places inaccessible to people unacquainted with the passes of the country another reason is the utter impossibility which discarded favorites by this means find to escape the anger of their offended sultan for knowing no place capable of assisting or concealing them unless they retire to some christian country they rather choose a voluntary resignation of their lives and fortunes to the undisputed will of their great master and quietly submit their necks to the sword of the executioner  but considering on the other side that the strength and glory of a prince does chiefly consist in the numbers of his people he is ever careful not only to draw to the center the conquered inhabitants of his dispopled frontiers but by the subtle bait of some inveigling privileges is constantly attracting innumerable quantities of tributary christians to embrace the doctrine of their fallacious religion and by becoming members of the mohammedan faith enjoy the possession of some little marks of distinction purposely denied to their more honest fellows who bravely prompted by the dictates of their virtue can without concern despise those gaudy trifles of a fansied happiness and dare prefer the heavy chains of honest slavery to all the guilty pleasures of an apostates liberty  second maxim his second maxim is that the only way to preserve a domestic quiet is to employ the heads and hands of his subjects in some foreign war its reasons the numerous advantages which accrue from this maxim are so conspicuous as scarce to need an explanation for by this means he is continually enlarging the bounds of his dominions or at least improving the vast numbers of his soldiers in an instructive practice of all the various and necessary points of military discipline by these means he preserves himself secure from the sudden violence of domestic rebellion for the search of glory firing the breasts of officers and soldiers they unanimously bend their utmost endeavors to increase the power of their extended empire which a lazy peace might rather prompt them to destroy for the working brains of men inured to war and danger will abhor the rust of idle sloth and stir up gradually an ambitious fire in the breast of the soldier to lay a sudden hold on some inviting opportunity and raise himself to power and honor upon the bloody ruin of his surpised commander  third maxim in the administration of his justice he holds it a necessary maxim that a tedious legality is far more dangerous than a swift injustice its reasons his reasons for this are first the fear and awe which so rigid a manner of proceeding infuses strongly into the hearts of his subjects making them ever ready to obey his most irrational commands with an unexampled willingness and terrifying their reflections with so deep a sense of his power as to deter them from the smallest inclination to a dangerous disobedience and secondly though some by so hasty a severity may unjustly suffer yet numbers are by their examples frightened from villainous actions whose natures and necessities would otherwise incline them to a constant practice of the blackest vices  fourth maxim another maxim teaches them that learning is of all things the most dangerous to an arbitrary monarchy its reasons for first was knowledge encouraged by the happy advantages of a liberal education the genius of their people would soon become much more refined and consequently the gross absurdities and fictitious lessons of their alcoran be looked upon with indignation when compared with the brighter doctrine of the christian religion they would soon discover the fallacious dreams and vain delusions of their fansied paradise and throw off with their ignorance the dull stupidity of their slavish ancestors they would soon perceive the felicity of other nations in a glorious liberty and casting off the yoke they had so long submitted to attempt unanimously some wondrous revolution and weary of a shameful fate in their so long subjection to a tyrannical government redeem their honor with their long lost liberties and triumph in the ruin of their subverted sultan another reason for this maxim is a notion commonly received in turkey that the use of letters is altogether inconsistent with the rougher genius of a warlike nation and that learning if encouraged would lull their faculties in a silent love of study till sinking in the soft indulgence of a philosophical solitude they would neglect entirely the more noble practice of those martial exercises whose successful application has bravely raised them to the glorious empire which now distinguishes them from the less powerful world  fifth maxim but above all these there is one maxim the constant care and security of the turkish sultans and that is to be served by such men as they can raise without envy and destroy without danger this they put in practice by admitting none to the honor or trust of great preferments but such as have been brought up under the strictest discipline of a seraglio education they are generally the sons of christian parents taken captives by the wandering incursions of the roving tartar and sent by way of the black sea to constantinople as to a common market out of great numbers of these there are yearly chosen a certain quantity for the grand signiors seraglio where at their first admission they are carefully instructed in the rudiments of the turkish language and religion thence proceeding gradually as qualified in body or mind from the laborious practices of the meanest drudgeries to the loftiest studies of their more polite accomplishments till their knowledge and experience increasing with their years they are preferred at last to some place of honor about the person of their emperor and thence advanced as occasion offers to the government of some principality a seat of justice or command in the army whichsoever their genius has chiefly seemed to bend them to its reasons and by these means being educated from their infancy with a servile awe upon their spirits their endeavors are entirely bent to please their sultan and starting from so severe a discipline to the seat of power without friend or parent to assist them in their enterprises they have no possibility of attempting with the smallest likelihood of success the least design against the interest of their sovereign but besides this the grand signior has another method no less politic to prevent them from making an ill use of the authority he trusts them with and that is the frequent change of officers often calling them from one government to take possession of another in some far distant part of the country by which means having no time to fix an interest with the people that are under them they are absolutely debarred from the smallest hopes of success in an attempt against the person or power of their sultan who seldom continues them so long as three years in one place and as if in that time there was danger of a revolt takes care by other methods to render it still more impracticable for giving them no money when he prefers them to a government and themselves possessing nothing but what they receive from his bounty they are obliged to borrow great sums on credit to furnish out their equipage for which the christian merchants exacting often cent per cent interest they have no other way to pay these debts than by a barbarous oppression of the provinces they are sent to and knowing their time to be but short they seldom fail by arbitrary methods to enrich themselves for ever after by a three years plunder of the poor inhabitants by which means they become odious to the people who would be so far from assisting them against the sultan as readily to embrace the smallest opportunity for revenging their misfortunes in the death or ruin of their tyrannick governor by which the grand signiors power stands more unshaken than that of christian princes who have too often suffered by the ambitious inclinations of rebellious subjects  these are the most noted maxims of the eastern policy whereby the turkish emperors maintain an uncontrolled authority over their so vast dominions others there are which being taught the people as essential points of duty and religion oblige them quietly to bend their necks and calmly stoop to the galling yoke of an ignoble slavery  sixth maxim and first obedience to the sultans will is taught them as a duty the neglect whereof will draw down the curses of god and mahomet upon themselves and their posterity his word must ever be a settled law and infallibility a peculiar perfection of his nature none dare believe he errs and though his actions appear altogether inconsistent with reason or humanity they must rather question the perspicuity of their senses than presume to think he ever can be guilty nay so widely has this crafty lesson spread its doctrine that to die by the hand or mandate of their emperor is looked upon by these deluded wretches as a never failing passport to the gates of paradise and so sacred a veneration do they pay to the person of this idolized sultan as if his people were destined as an inferior species of mortality to serve the mighty end of his creation the better to support this awful sense of fear and duty the expounders of their law have fixed a notion in the superstitious breasts of the common people that they can never pay too deep a veneration to the person of their emperor since the good or evil fate of the turkish empire depends entirely on the preservation or extinction of the ottoman family  seventh maxim another maxim among the turks declares that merit is the only valuable nobility its reasons whereby the meanest of their people exert their utmost industry in the pursuit of honor as knowing they must owe their fortune to their own personal worth and not the hereditary possession of lands and tenements from the successful labors of industrious ancestors for the grand signior is the common heir to all mens estates and distributing some small part among the children leaves them to cut out their own way to riches and preferment and throws in the remainder amongst the numerous heaps of his own prodigious treasure  eight maxim another opinion not a little conducive to the turkish interest is that those who die in battle against a christian enemy are immediately transported into paradise as a reward for their courage its reasons it is no great difficulty to guess the effects of such a notion on the thoughtless crowd who are thereby at all times willing to invade a christian country and hurried forward to a zealous madness by so encouraging a doctrine fall rashly on and prove too often fatal instruments of death and vengeance  ninth maxim there is another maxim of their policy which seems to have been owing to the vast successes of their arms in the infancy of their empire and that is to look upon prosperity as an infallible sign of gods owning the justice and legality of their endeavors its reasons by these means they have encouraged their armies to a constant assurance of repeated successes from the favorable consequences of one single victory and drawn in prodigious numbers of voluntary soldiers to the assistance of a cause which such propitious omens had induced them to believe must necessarily entitle them to the smiles of providence  tenth maxim there is a law amongst the turks which i believe was introduced from an ancient maxim of their political government strictly prohibiting all subjects to the grand signior from traveling for improvement of their knowledge and experience into any country not under his authority especially such parts of the world as are enlightened by the heavenly rays of christian doctrine and so very nicely is this law observed amongst them that he who is accused of having broken it without a positive order or permission from the court is often punished in an exemplary manner and his goods and chattels forfeited thereby to whatsoever use the sultan shall assign them  its reasons the numerous advantages arising to their government from so strict a prohibition of a custom so diverting to the curious inquisitions of our europaean gentlemen are so obvious to the judgment of a common reader that they hardly need a farther explanation since every body must perceive the chief design of this so useful maxim was to cloak the fallacies of their deceitful doctrine from the hoodwinked eyes of its professors whose clouded apprehensions fatally illuminated by a christian conversation might probably be brought to an entire discovery of that inglorious servitude in which they live and tempt their courage to assume new fire and redeem their minds from an erroneous superstition while they bravely changed the base subjection of their insulted bodies for the generous enjoyment of a nobler liberty and how far the continuance of this subtle maxim may be serviceable to their interest does beyond dispute appear in the good effects it has hitherto produced and the frequent insurrections and intestine jarrs that almost yearly happen on such of their frontiers as by their nearness of situation to the christian countries have rendered their inhabitants no ways strangers to the difference of their government  many besides these are the political maxims of the turkish nation but i shall content my self with having named the chief and those on which they build the pillars of their constitution and will proceed in the next chapter to give as full an account as i can of the peculiar form and artful management of their civil government  chap iii of the civil government of the turks it is perhaps the most difficult undertaking a man can put himself upon to write of the numerous intricacies of foreign governments and particularly one like that of turkey the native haughtiness of whose insulting people and their coy deportment to the traveling subjects of a christian country are so many inaccessible barriers to the curiosity of their observations but it is a task yet more difficult to endeavor a satisfactory description of that part of their constitution which composes this chapter since the offices of their religion are so closely interwoven with those of their law that it is almost impossible to treat of either without involving both in a promiscuous confusion  however that i may the more easily avoid the disagreeable obscurity of so unnecessary a conjunction i shall gradually proceed to an account of the places of trust and great offices of their empire as they now differ from or are dependant on each other  by the foregoing chapters the prodigious power and unlimited authority of the turkish sultan has been fully taught the reader but though his rule is arbitrary and his sway despotick and tyrannical he submits the management of his large dominions to the depending government of a deputed viceroy and indeed it has ever been the custom of the eastern emperors to constitute some favored subject in a degree of honor next themselves a custom by many authors condemned as owing its institution to the slothful disposition of some inglorious monarch wholly given up to ease and luxury the policy of constituting a viceroy a great support of the sultans power but in my opinion founded on the subtle maxims of a deeper policy for by these means the emperors may not only when they please unbend their minds from the fatiguing cares of an entangled government but when the growing anger of their injured subjects provoke them to a resentment of their oppressive cruelties they throw the odium of their own injustice upon their guiltless viceroy who skreening the miscarriages of his imprudent sultan from the revenge of a rebellious multitude becomes himself the object of their hatred and lays the foundation of his masters safety on the peaceful consequences of his own destruction  the manner of creating a grand vizier this officer among the turks is distinguished by the title of vizier azem or counselor in chief to the grand signior from whom all power is immediately derived to him and by whom he is created without any other ceremony than the delivery of a large golden seal whereon is engraved the name and age of the then reigning sultan this seal he always carries in his bosom and becomes thereby invested with an authority almost as arbitrary and unlimited as that of the emperor himself  the antiquity of this office amvrath the third was the institutor of this office at a time when breaking into europe he conferred the dignity of general and chief counselor on one lala schabin his tutor since which time his successors have continued to appoint some favored subject to the dignity of vizier azem and honor those officers with the name of tutor as often as they hold conversation with them  his business and authority the vizier azem as in title so in power is the head and mouth of the turkish law to him appeals are brought from all their courts of judicature and by him the former sentences of inferior judges are frequently disannulled and the cause decided in favor of the party who before had lost it there lies no appeal beyond him unless to the person of the grand signior and that so very difficult that it is very rarely put in practice the manner of appealing to the grand signior the manner of doing it is so odd and different from the europaean customs that the reader will be inclined to pardon the digression if i describe the ceremony as briefly as is possible at certain hours of the day when the gates of the seraglio are set open for the admittance of great numbers of citizens and others whose business with the officers of that place require their daily attendance there the persons who would complain of any grievous injury they have suffered and which the injustice or connivance of the grand vizier has refused to redress enter hastily the outward court and putting pots of fire upon their heads run swiftly forward nor dare the greatest officer presume to stop them till they arrive in the presence of the grand signior and humbling themselves at his feet declare the weighty wrongs they labor under and implore the gracious mark of his unquestioned justice in a kind redress of their oppressive injuries  there is a private divan or court of justice held in the palace of the vizier azem every wednesday and thursday on the other days excepting friday which is the turkish sabbath the divan is kept in an open chamber of the seraglio whither the vizier is magnificently attended by a great number of pursuivants and sergeants at his arrival he is saluted with the noisy acclamations of the people and guarded by a sort of soldiers maintained purposely for that use to his place upon the bench where being seated with the cadeelescheer or lord chief justice and six viziers of the ben who are grave men that have formerly born offices in the government and are skilled in the knowledge of their law but not permitted to give their opinions on any point unless demanded by him he listens to the judgment of the lord chief justice who hears and determines all causes unless the vizier shall disapprove his sentence and reverse it as he thinks is most agreeable to the justice of the cause or his own private inclinations  thus much may serve as to the judicative power of the grand vizier but is far from expressing the utmost limits of his authority which extends its self so far beyond that of the other great officers of the empire that though he cannot by virtue of his own immediate order take off their heads or recall them from their governments he has so great an interest in the grand signior that he can without the smallest difficulty obtain his warrant for the displacing or beheading any officer at court or elsewhere who has unfortunately disobliged him or stands obnoxious to the danger of his envy  in time of war he has the command in chief of the sultans armies and leads them where he pleases without the least necessity of waiting for his masters order he gives audience to the ambassadors of foreign princes receives and answers the contents of their memorials and is in short the only master of the executive power over the grand signiors whole dominions  the splendor of his court answerable to the vast authority of this great officer is the pompous state in which he lives his court consisting frequently of five and twenty hundred servants including the officers about him when he appears abroad he is distinguished not only by the splendor of his equipage but the bearing on the fore part of his turbant two large feathers set on with a great knot of diamonds and other jewels of inestimable value the peculiar mark of his degree the bashaws being permitted to wear but one and the sultan himself never appearing with more than three three horsetails are carried before him on a lofty staff another distinguishing mark of his authority great numbers of stately horses adorned with trappings of gold and silver set thick with precious stones are led before him his stirrops held by the obsequious hands of his surrounding slaves and his garment kissed with the most profound respect by endless crowds of prostrate officers whose servile souls incline their actions to the basest practice of a vile subjection to men by fortune placed above them while they basely triumph over the miserable wretches that are under their command with all the haughty marks of an insulting arrogance  his revenues and advantages prodigious and beyond belief are the amazing profits arising from this post to the coffers of its possessor for though the revenues of the grand vizier or his immediate salary from the crown does scarce exceed five thousand pounds per annum it is yet impossible to guess the vast advantages it brings him for besides the great sums of money he receives from the numbers of his petitioners who be their business of what nature it will dare never move it empty handed there are daily rivolets of plenty from all parts of the empire flowing to his treasury no subject to the grand signior dares enter on a place of power till by the moving rhetoric of some considerable present he has bribed the favor of the grand vizier without which he is always sensible his head will surely pay the forfeit of his avarice there are certain times of the year when all the governors of provinces are obliged to send presents to the sultan after the manner of our newyearsgifts and though there is no obligation which compels them at that time to remember the vizier a fatal experience of the consequences of such a neglect has often convinced them that it is highly dangerous to forget him the rulers of the remotest branches of the turkish empire are obliged to court his favorable representation of their services with the persuasive oratory of their golden messengers and in short no man who omits his duty this way can reasonably hope a long possession of his honors or preferments  by these means a vizier of a covetous disposition who loses no advantage he may reap from his authority has such incredible opportunities of increasing his wealth that many at the death which generally attends their short lived splendour have been found possessors of such immense heaps of treasure as have equaled if not exceeded that of the grand signior their master but those very riches which still render this high office desirable in the emulative breasts of the turkish candidates are the very poison of its pleasures and to a genius blessed with a serious contemplation on the frailties of humanity would open all the dangers of its gaudy glories and rather frighten him from their search than allure him to their possession  the office of vizier a dangerous station for few there are who long enjoy the slippery honors of this wished preferment the sultans policy forbids a long permission of such unbounded power and urges him to frequent changes of such dangerous officers nor are there many who survive the loss of this high post for having some time served like a necessary sponge to gather riches for the sultans use he squeezes them at last into his own vast treasure and to free himself from all the fears of their resentment invents some plausible pretense to take them off and put others in their place to grow up gradually to the same fate their predecessors met with  immediately under the vizier are these three officers viz the muftee the rieseffendie and the tefterdar bashaw of the first of these i shall take occasion to speak largely in the chapter relating to the turkish religion as being high priest and consequently not properly to be treated of under this head further than as he is concerned in the interpretation of their civil law and of that in its due place the office of rieseffendie the rieseffendie is secretary of state and in constant attendance on the person of the vizier by whose orders he dispatches innumerable quantities of patents decrees commissions and other instruments over all parts of the turkish empire its profits this officer has places of great trust and profit under him and by the multiplicity of his business collects such sums of money to his own possession as often equal the riches of the vizier himself  the tefterdar the tefterdar bashaw is lord treasurer of the public revenues he pays the salaries of all great officers depending on the sultan by him the soldiery is weekly paid and all public disbursements made his profits and danger this is an office of great honor and advantage but has the same fate entailed on its possessors with those abovenamd and exposes them not only to the danger of their emperors hatred but often sacrifices their lives and fortunes to the fatal malice and inordinate caprices of a discontented people  the muftee i undertook to say as much of the muftee in this place as concerned his business in the management of their laws his dignity he is an officer of great authority nominated to that dignity by the sultans voice who ought to choose a man of exemplary piety untainted virtues and humility and more especially of undoubted knowledge in the explanation of their law his opinion in matters civil and criminal as well as in affairs relating to the state is given by subscribing yes or no with the humble addition of god knows better to a paper in which the question is for that purpose stated and though he gives his judgment in a persuasive not compulsive manner his sentence is notwithstanding wholly decisive and the judges verdict regulated accordingly without the tedious trouble of a further appeal or any dilatory practice whatsoever for the religion of the turks having placed in this man a perspicuity of judgment almost equal to the peremptory doctrine of a roman infallibility no subject dares dispute the muftees wisdom nor will the emperor himself contemn his counsel for he seldom undertakes a distant war or any other business of weighty moment till the approbation of this religious man has sanctified the action when matters of difficulty are debated before the sultan the muftee is always present at the council and his advice required with the utmost veneration the odd manner of punishing them but as his honors are superior to most other officers of the empire so is his punishment when his demerits have required it in an exemplary manner more surprising for in a castle at constantinople which the turks distinguish by the name of the seven towers there is purposely exposed a brazen mortar of uncommon shape and magnitude into which the muftee when convicted of high treason or unwarrantable practices is publicly thrown headlong and pounded to death with a massy iron pestle  the office of cadeelescheer the next office below the muftee is that of cadeelescheer or their lord chief justice his power whose authority though originally confined to the soldiery extends its self at present to the determination of all sorts of law suits whatsoever with submission to the pleasure of such superior powers to whom there lies an appeal from the tenor of his sentence for the military body of the turkish nation enjoy this privilege beyond the civil that though themselves are subject to none besides their own commanders the authority of their officers extends promiscuously over all sorts of people insomuch that all commissioned officers of the turkish army are by virtue of the commission they possess entitled to the office of justices of the peace over all parts of the empire a policy not a little advantageous to the grand signior by the vast encouragement it gives the soldiers who ever were and must be still the pillars of his government this office of cadeelescheer is a step from which they often mount to that of muftee nor can any man be legally entitled to the one who has not first discharged with universal praise the duty of the other  the mollah they generally rise to the preferment of cadeelescheer from the office of a mollah the advantages of which post are different according to the places over which they exercise their power some are judges in chief over whole provinces and have under their command the kaddees or judges of stately towns and villages others there are whose government is confined to poor and inconsiderable places having under them the tattered judges of a few distressed and miserable cottages  the kaddee the next inferior officer is the kaddee abovementioned or the lowest sort of judges among the turks the profits arising from this post are more or less according to the places under their jurisdiction but is considerable as being the first step toward obtaining the dignity of muftee a preferment eagerly desired by the politest of their people  thus much may have served to give the judicious reader a sufficient idea of the fountain of civil government now exercised in the court of turkey whence slow innumerable streams of policy to the channels of remoter governments possessed in their several degrees by beylerbeys sangiack beys bashaws beys and agas every one of which offices i shall largely treat of in their respective places  the division of their empire the formidable empire of these successful infidels is divided into twenty two parts each division of so vast extent as exceeds the magnitude of many of our europaean kingdoms and governed by its beylerbey or archduke for of all christian titles there is none which can more nearly express the nature of that office every one of these archdukedoms is divided into certain unequal numbers of sangiacks or provinces some containing twenty some not more than seven ten or fifteen according to which numbers the archdukedoms are more or less profitable to their governors the sangiack bey over every province there is placed a ruler distinguished by the title of sangiackbey or lord provincial these depend upon and are subservient to the several archdukes under whom they live  the bey inferior to the lords provincial are the beys or lords of the several partitions into which the abovenamed provinces are divided the aga these have under them another sort of lords distinguished by the name of agas or captains of a certain number of towns or villages and their dependencies all which officers have their several courts of justice peculiar to the different nature of the governments they hold and yet are linked together in the joint promotion of one common interest and a firm obedience to the sacred will of their great lord the sultan  the bashaw besides these archdukedoms severally subject to their respective beylerbeys there are certain parts of the empire independent on those divisions and altogether subject to the government of bashaws a title almost equal to that of prince and generally born by such men as having gradually ascended from the meanest offices have inured their minds and bodies to the roughest changes that can befall mortality and having proved their knowledge by a successful disintangling the occurring intricacies of state and war distinguishably shine by the conspicuity of their merits and succeed alternately to the highest offices of their unshaken empire  but that i may explain more fully the unimagind grandeur of the turkish emperors i will particularize the several governments of all the beylerbeys and the number of those extensive provinces over which they preside that by considering the numerous opportunities the grand signior is master of whereby to reward the fidelity of his subjects the reader may no longer wonder at the support of his authority  the    archdukedoms of the turkish empire the twenty two archdukedoms before mentioned are distinguished among the turks by the following names anatolia caramania diarbekir scham siwas esrum pascha childir cheruzul halep marash kibros tripoly terbozan kars musul rika rumeeli kupudan bosna grandcairo and babylon of which the governors of the two last receive their salaries from the treasury of the sultan the salaries of the bashaws of cairo and babylon the first which is the highest government in the grand signiors dominions has a yearly revenue of three hundred thousand pounds the salary of the last exceeds not six thousand pounds per annum but the numerous advantages which accrue from his perquisites afford him daily opportunities of amassing vast heaps of riches  the remaining twenty have a certain yearly income appointed them out of the annual revenues due from their provinces to the coffers of the sultan which though inconsiderable in it self is constantly multiplied into fifteen or twenty times its quantity by the griping arts and avaritious practices whereby these arbitrary governors oppress their people the fixed allowances which they may justly claim are these which follow  the respective salaries of the archdukes of turkey l the beylerbey of anatolia has a yearly salary of  000 caramania   00 diarbekir  000 scham  000 siwas      esrum  0 0 pascha  0 0 childir    0 cheruzul  000 halep    0 marash  000 kibros   00 tripoly   00 terbozan    0 kars   00 musul   00 rika   00 rumeeli      kupudan      bosna   0   these are the certain salaries settled by the grand signior on the several beylerbeys abovementioned but as i hinted before are seldom the twentieth part of the profits into which they improve their employments  the provinces contained in these twenty two archdukedoms are at least two hundred and sixty four every one of which as i said before has a lord provincial over it whose profits may be computed about half as much as those of the beylerbeys their superior governors the beys and agas possessing smaller salaries in a just proportion to the inferiority of their offices the bashaws are all entitled to revenues agreeable to their power and both the one and the other are alike unbounded  by the prodigious sums of money amassed this way which any curious reader may nearly compute by the account abovementioned and which in comparison with the sultans revenues are as so many small canals to the unfathomed ocean you may guess at the surprising grandeur and inexhausted riches of the ottoman emperors which shall be particularly treated of in a more proper place i shall now proceed to inform the reader in what manner the turks administer their justice and how the forms of law are practiced by that people  a maxim of tacitus twas the opinion of tacitus that those governments have most laws who have least policy and the strenuous support which the turkish empire receives from few but necessary maxims does in a great measure justify the truth of his assertion for they have no confounding volumes of one lawyers observations upon the remarks of another no coke upon littleton to explain the different interpretations of a thing that is or ought to be the same the reports of such a judge or such a lord chancellor have here no power to guide the sentence of a court of justice by the prevailing virtue of some forgotten precedent the speedy dispatch of turkish justice their laws are few but always put in execution with the utmost severity and though the sentence pro or con depends entirely upon the undisputed will of an arbitrary judge whereby the subject is deprived of that indulgent liberty we taste in britain and sometimes sacrificed to the mercenary interest of a bribed decider he has yet this happiness superior to us that he always loses a cause before the melancholy consequences of a tedious controversy has disabled him to support that loss and depriving him of all possible means of a future subsistence unfortunately sink both the cause and the client in promiscuous ruin by one single act of an unexpected injustice  the truth of this will evidently appear by the speedy dispatch of their decisive sentence having no form of law but this which follows their deeds and instruments whatever land moneys goods or any of the common benefits of life are bought by or given to a subject of the grand signiors dominions or any other inhabitant of that empire must be confirmed to his possession by virtue of a sealed instrument called an hodget which being signed by the kaddee or judge of the place they live in does certainly entitle them to as firm a property as all the deeds of gift releases and other endless heaps of parchment now in use amongst us such an instrument being once produced admits of no evasive quirk to weaken its authority no word misplaced or name mistaken by the adding or omitting some single letter can baffle the legality of a subjects endeavors by the shock of a nonsuit but where the justice of a cause is undeniably conspicuous they very rarely suffer by a partial sentence though where the case is doubtful or obscure the native avarice of a turkish judge will generally incline him to a favorable opinion of that side from whence most money challenges his gratitude bribery common among them nor is the curse of bribery esteemed so black a crime in this country as in the western world most men practicing it in a public and audacious manner wheresoever their occurring interests make it useful  womens oaths not taken womens oaths are never taken but against a christian nor a christians against a turk among themselves the concurring evidences of a plurality of witnesses decide a controversy their punishments are either bodily or pecuniary the first are rarely suffered when not deserved but the latter sometimes inflicted unjustly by the malicious prosecution of revengeful people or the partial sentence of some poor and avaritious magistrate  the office of a saubashaw there is no city which has not its saubashaw or head constable over it whose proper business it is to inspect as secretly and as narrowly as possible the behavior of the inhabitants having his inferior officers in every corner to detect the misdemeanors of offending people and seizing their persons deliver them over to such punishments as upon conviction of their guilt shall be judged agreeable to the nature of their offenses  the corporeal punishments in use among the turks are different according to the several crimes for which they are imposed the most common and that which is inflicted on slaves servants and the practicers of pettylarcenys is the bastinado or beating them on the soles of the feet the method of putting this in execution is as follows  their manner of excecuting the punishment called bastinado five or more officers seizing the offender by the arms conduct him roughly to some smooth piece of ground or grassplat where throwing him upon his back the heaviest among them sitting down upon his breast prevents him from springing upwards to avoid the blows when two others by the help of a large stick like the handle of a broom bored through at both ends to receive a rope there fastened by two knotts and hanging down in a bent form like that of a bow lift his legs from the ground and rolling the stick downwards as far as the rope permits them prevent them from moving either one way or the other this done another with a stiff hazel wand gives him as many strokes upon the naked soles of his feet as he was ordered to undergo which are sometimes several hundred and have often proved mortal to the guilty party  a comical story of an english merchant i cannot forbear the crime of a small digression to divert my reader with the comical relation of a certain passage which once in this country afforded me the pleasure of a very agreeable amusement there was an english merchant who had for many years been troubled with the gout in a very violent and uncommon degree nor could the daily application of the richest medicines procure him ease much less the cure he sought in vain for insomuch that being in a manner transported by the sharpness of his pain he became so very peevish that he could neither talk walk or sit still in comfort the pressure of this gentlemans extraordinary affairs requiring his presence at adrianople he undertook the journey with a great deal of uneasiness and met at the entrance of a town called baba a considerable party of turkish soldiers who were marching toward constantinople the officer as is common in those parts took the liberty as he passed to express himself a little disrespectfully in contempt of the christians in the merchants company and he unqualified at that time by the peevish effects of his distemper to bear it patiently made an ill use of his skill in the turkish language and returned the salutation as roughly as it was sent him the inhabitants of that country are of all others least able to bear reflections on their government or religion and the officer of these men forgetting that himself had been the aggressor resented the affront so very highly that he ordered the merchant to be taken from his horse and undergo the punishment of one hundred and fifty bastinadoes in the manner above written vain was resistance against a number so much superior and complaints were altogether useless in a country where the speedy execution of an arbitrary order is the highest qualification they believe themselves capable of in short the poor merchant submitted aukwardly to the unwelcome novelty and was so sorely beaten on the soles of his feet that for many days he was obliged to continue in a house at baba nor was he able to stand upright for a long time after but the jest of this story comes in the conclusion for the bastinadoes it seems having frightened away his gout his distemper went off with his bruises nor was he ever troubled with the return of one single fit from that time forward the unexpected consequence of this lucky beating obliged the merchant at his return to constantinople to seek industriously after the author of his cure that he might thank him for the favor but not being able to find him out he contented himself with a grateful remembrance of the weighty obligation and to this day if he be still alive as constantly drinks to the health of his turkish doctor as he sits down to his table  but to return to the subject in hand they have several punishments peculiar to the military and other orders which shall be described hereafter in their proper place one now in common use amongst them is impaling alive that is thrusting in a sharp pole at their fundaments their manner of impaling alive and forcing it out at the upper parts of their body and so fastening the pole upright in the ground they leave them in some high way as miserable examples to deterr others from the like practices  other punishments in use there strangling in a very expeditious manner is the death whereby they distinguish suffering noblemen hanging they seldom use breaking on the wheel very rarely but the most common way of execution is beheading the condemned person with a broad scymetar while he kneels upon a large heap of sand to that end provided other kinds of punishments there are in turkey but such as being very rarely put in practice are altogether needless to be here mentioned and for that reason purposely omitted  chap iv of the government military if the general experience of the knowing world allows it as a necessary maxim that every effect of nature and morality must be supported by those very causes to which they owe their first production it will follow undeniably that a government not gradually raised from the continued improvements of some unresisted colony but founded violently upon the bloody ruin of a conquered people must slacken by degrees that nervous strengh by which it flourished when the long neglects of idle peace corrupt its natives with the love of pleasure and draw them by degrees to hate the practice of those successful arms by whose unequalled force their braver ancestors had cut a passage to meridian glory  the effects of peace of dangerous consequence to warlike governments it is this alone to which the persian grecian roman and every other glorious monarchy have owed their downfall and it is the same indulgence of a slothful ease has rusted all the powerful springs of turkish discipline and cheered exceedingly the drooping spirits of the eastern christians with reviving hopes to see the happy restoration of their religion and their liberty in the entire subversion of their usurping tyrant for that persuasive poverty which once inclined the turkish soldiers to a scorn of dangers has now no more the power to urge a brave defiance of the shocks of war since they are all possessors of a rolling plenty the want of which provoked em chiefly to their ancient actions  a great decay in their military discipline but though the present managment of their military discipline falls greatly short of what in former ages spoke them matchless they are not yet so sensibly decayed as to become an easy conquest were the united arms of warlike christendom now bent against them for though their soldiers are not now inured to war and hardship nor by the frequent victorys they were used to gain familiar with the face of ruin and continual contest they are not less in number than they were nor all so ignorant as their majority the turkish policy permits no loss of power by the loss of soldiers and is perhaps the only government that ever grew stonger by the death of subjects for having numbers ready upon all occasions to supply the room of such as die their places are improved to double worth by a surprising management peculiar to the turks which shall be told the reader in its proper place they have no occasion on declaring war or losing battles to dispatch their officers for fresh recruits about the country and supply with raw unpollishd rusticks the places of well disciplined and skilful soldiers they have formidable standing armies in every corner of their empire which from time to time supply the vacancies of their contending bodies which like the boundless ocean though discharging endless depths of water appears no less in ebb than flow but stands the same in every season never subject to perceptible diminution  in describing the present establishment of the ottoman forces i will begin with that order of foot soldiers commonly known by the name of janisaries for the peculiar and remarkable privileges whereby they are distinguished from the ordinary militia may justly entitle them to the honor of a preference the derivation and original of the word janisary janisary is nothing but a corruption of the word yanicherr which in the turkish language signifies a neworder they took their original from the death of one hodgy bectash an old religious man of an exemplary life and conversation in the reign of sultan amurath the third king of the turks this man had long endeavored to dissuade that prince from dangerously exposing his person by too near a familiarity with the subjects of servia often prophesying the sudden death which afterward befell the sultan upon the overthrow of lazarus the despot of that country when walking out to view the heaps of slain one miles corbelitza a christian soldier rising heavily from a mount of carcasses made shift to stagger in the pangs of death and by expressive motions of his head and hands desired admittance to the person of the emperor who thinking he designed to beg his life permitted him to such a near approach that the undaunted servian falling on his knees as if he would have sued for mercy snatched out a dagger from his bleeding bosom and striking it with violence to the sultans heart revenged successfully his countries wrongs and lived and died like israels sampson a double scourge to an ambitious enemy  the death of bectash immediately succeeded that of amurath for having often prophesied the blow and not preventing it though near the sultans person he was cut in pieces by the furious guards as a party in the treason but foreseeing easily what fate would soon befall him he rent off a long sleeve which he wore continually on his right arm and putting it upon the head of one of the soldiers cried out prophetically in the turkish language life from my death shall like a phoenix spring to guard from dangers your succeeding king   this said he fell a bloody victim to the soldiers anger but had his prophecy completely verified in the first year of the next sultans reign who reflecting seriously on the fate of bectash resolved to take some method of perpetuating his memory and instituted a new order of the militia by the name of janisaries who to this day in imitation of the sleeve which bectash put upon the soldiers head are all obliged to wear a headpiece faced with pollishd steel to which is fastened a large piece of buff that falling in a moderate breadth from the crown of their head spreads gradually wider to the middle of their backs  the ancient care to supply the empire with janissaries the institution of this famous and formidable militia was founded originally on the surest pillars of a deep but barbarous policy for officers were continually dispatched to make triennial seisures of the christian children inhabiting the countries unhappily fallen under the galling yoke of turkish slavery these miserable wretches thus violently ravished from their sorrowful parents were distributed in parties over all the empire till they reached the age of sixteen years at which time completely versed in the knowledge of the turkish language and religion they were severally disposed of in the many seraglios belonging to the grand signior where for the space of five or seven years they were inured to hardships by the laborious practice of continual drudgeries such as cleaving wood bearing burdens working in gardens and every other toilsome exercise till having learned the art of patience and submissive resignation to the will of their superiors they were instructed diligently in the art of war and as the death of other janissaries afforded vacancy succeeded gradually to their posts and privileges where practicing with an emulative courage the dictates of their education they give a fatal proof how much the present ties of life exceed the bands of weaker nature for not retaining the minutest notion of their parents or their country they bend entirely the endeavors of their arms for the wished promotion of their sultans interest and have in former ages by the excellence of their discipline and greatness of their courage been chief supporters of the turkish glory and by the just rewards their valor won distinguished honorably as the flower of that empire  the present neglect of that order occasioned by their former insolence but far below the ancient spirit of this martial order is the grovelling genius of the modern janissaries who tasting largely of the sweets of power in the black successes of their bold resentments grew madly insolent and so familiar with rebellion that having died their weapons in the guiltless blood of many sultans they became so terrible to succeeding emperors that they have long endeavored by the subtle force of undiscovered policies to raise some milder order on the ruin of the former least like unhappy romes pretorian cohorts the rough effects of their audacious violence should one day ruin that declining empire whose defense alone was the true design of their original institution  their number and privileges their number was at first confined to seven thousand but is now improved to more than forty thousand lawfully enrolled besides vast numbers who by the winning virtue of an annual present to the officers of this order become possessors of those innumerable privileges which exempt the janissaries from taxes prosecutions or any other ties of justice so that being owned on all occasions by the muster masters of that militia they stand secure above the law and practice villainies by the favorable connivance of an uncontrolled authority  their way of living there are now one hundred sixty two chambers or large buildings called odaes at constantinople for the lodging of the janissaries but none in any other part of the empire because the sultans having ever looked upon this order as the safety and support of their authority took care to have them always near their persons a design well laid but fatal in its consequences over every chamber is an officer appointed under the title of oda basham or inspecter of the chamber the creation of a janizary is a peculiar prerogative of this advantageous office and the manner wherein it is performed deserves remark  the manner of their creation when the persons to be chosen have gradually proceeded through the tedious counse of their probationary labors they are summoned in their places to a personal appearance before the muster master of that order who having registered their names in rolls of parchment presents them ceremoniously to the inspecter of that chamber into which they are to be admitted who making them pass by according to their seniority the younger holding up the elders garment strikes every man a blow upon the ear to remind him of the duty and subjection he then takes upon him and without the trouble of any additional formality declares them janissaries  their pay they receive their pay proportionable to their merit beginning with little more than a penny a day and increasing their allowances upon every worthy action till they reach the salary of seven shillings per week which is the utmost pay a janizary can pretend to till the seniority of their years or peculiarity of their actions advances them to the offices peculiar to their order and makes their riches equal to their authority but by the way the reader must observe this pay is only an additional encouragement to excite their valor for they have not only daily meals provided in their chambers with all the other necessaries of life but receive an annual present of a suit of clothes from the bounty of their emperor which is generally made of very good and serviceable green or violet colored cloth the form whereof may fully be perceived by turning to the cut relating to the grecian wedding described at large in the one and twentieth chapter of this book  the power and interest of their general there is an officer appointed over this militia distinguished by the title of yanicherr aga or general of the janissaries whose suspected power alarms the court with such preventive jealousies that the sultan takes a constant care to give that charge to one entirely in his interest a policy whose effects have often saved the modern emperors from the threatened violences of their fierce rebellions the boundless power of this arbitrary officer extends it self to the decision of every intervening accident in favor of or judgment against them the common punishments of their less heinous crimes are generally ordered by their inferior officers and executed by the cooks of their respective chambers the way of executing a janizary but if any of that order is detected in a guilt deserving death he is condemned immediately by the sentence of his general and thrown at midnight with the greatest secrecy imaginable with weights about his neck into the middle of the sea  their arms abroad and at home their arms in war are scymetars and muskets wherewith they fight on foot surrounding always the person of their emperor or in his absence the vizier or general they seldom fight in other order than the figure which of old composed the macedonian phalanx when at home they are appointed a the guards of honor to the christiam ambassadors to keep perpetual watch in all the gates and avenues of their imperial city to accompany and protect such strangers as are curious to behold the rarities of the country from the barbarous insolences of the rude inhabitants which they will do with all imaginable courtesy and fidelity for the small reward of half a crown a day and sometimes les they bear no other arms at home than a small dagger called hanjarr which with a large smooth cane not much unlike the largest staffs belonging to our constables are known so commonly and so extremely feared by all who meet them that no man dares presume to offer the least affront to any christian guarded by a janizary least his blood should pay the forfeit of his insolence  a story of a janizary at constantinople i remember with concern that at my first arrival in that country while i was a perfect stranger to their nature and their language i was prompted by the curiosity of my temper to walk about the streets of constantinople and make my observations on the place and its inhabitants under the undoubted convoy of a faithful janizary we were passing on a causway in a public street when the misfortune of a rude and ignorant potter led him on to stop our way by the means of an ass that he had laden with brittle ware to sell his customers about the city the janizary had already passed the door of a large shop from whence the poor fellow drove his ass upon the causway and prevented me from following my convoy there was a fair descent not much beyond him whereby he might have gone down to the middle of the street had he turned his asses head the other way but whether moved by a religious zeal which naturally teaches them to hate a christian or by the native haughtiness of his unpollishd temper he pressed his ass with fury forward and the passage wanting breadth to give him room obliged me roughly to the inconvenient trouble of an unwilling squeeze to give him all the way i could but finding the unwelcome pressure of the asses panniers a little incomodious i was forced to lay my hands upon the creatures side and pushing forward somewhat violently and unexpectedly together both the potter and his panniers fell headlong from the causway which was almost five foot high into the middle of the street almost half a foot deep in mud and water the fellow somewhat hurt by the roughness of his fall and very much enraged at the destruction of his glasses drew out a long knife which he wore within his girdle and running to the causway endeavored furiously to reach my legs with a revengeful wound the janizary who had heard the fall and was come back to my assistance leaped swiftly down and drawing his hanjarr in hasty passion struck it to the hilt in the poor fellows shoulder who falling on his knees amidst the dirt cried out with lifted arms o god and mahomet his only prophet in what have i offended to be made the victim of a cursed infidel nay to so unreasonable a degree was he transported by his passion that finding no redress he threw the mud upon his face and rolled himself about in blood and water while the janizary marched forward unconcerned and stately leading me untouched through crowds of people who though their eyes declared their anger were obliged to hide their thoughts in the deceitful postures of a mild neutrality  a dangerous privilege of the militia among the numerous privileges peculiar to the janissaries there is one a little inconsistent with the cautious policy of the turkish government that is a permission of increasing their common treasury by the successive additions of what sums of money their agas or generals die possessed of and the grant of very considerable profits arising from the tenure of several large tracts of land in anatolia how dangerous it is to assign such power and riches to a standing army ever quartered in the metropolis of their empire the turkish sultans have experienced dearly by the frequent effects of that audacious insolence which having long been nourished by the dictates of their plenty has often fleshed the lawless janzaries in the murder of their sovereigns nor do they only study their revenge in the success of their rebellion since it is the never failing interest of this order to outlive the reigns of many sultans their abuses of an interregnum for besides the sure addition of a daily penny to their former pay they gain an uncontrolled authority to rob and plunder during the space of a small interregnum violently possessing as a lawful prize whatever goods they lay their hands on and committing boldly black outrages with the plausible pretense of grieving out of measure for the mournful death of their indulgent master  the melancholy consequences of this abuse of power have as is before declared induced the government to study means of ruining this order which not being able to accomplish by the dint of force they have invented many subtle wiles to weaken gradually the foundations of their power for whereas the matchless discipline of ancient janissaries gave bright examples to inferior orders they are now admitted frequently without the gradual labors of probationary servitude marriage once denied em with the strictest prohibition is not only suffered but encouraged by their officers trades are followed and the weekly musters slighted by permission insomuch that their unfurnished chambers once the nurseries of successful valor can furnish few at wars great summons who do not artfully decline the service by the prevailing pleas of wife and family or some mean shift whose common practice has already weakened and will in time entirely ruin the declining columns of that dwindling order  the turkish spahees next to the janissaries i proceed to speak of that order of the turkish horse commonly distinguished by the name of spahees and divided into two bodies viz the europaean and the asiatick these light horse men were in ancient times the noblest cavalry the world could boast of rich and formidable by the plenty they were masters of never coming into the field without the stately splendor of a numerous and magnificent attendance and shining brightly over all the rest of their militia by the vast advantages they made of their acquaintance with or interest in the greatest officers of the empire the reasons of their late decay but poisoning their loyalty with the increase of their authority they sacrifisd their honor to the dictates of ambition and insolently practiced a continued lesson of mutiny and rebellion till the common fate of falling treachery involved their order in a general ruin and from the towering pyramids of their unrivaled grandeur reduced them gradually to a common level with the inferior orders of the turks militia  their pay and opportunities of increasing it at present the number of spahees exceeds not five and thirty thousand who receive a quarterly payment in the presence of the vizier azem a custom introduced by the famous kupriuli to prevent the black effects of those intestine discords common formerly from their pay day quarrels the lowest salary of a turkish spahee is at the rate of one shilling a day to which they become entitled to upon their first promotion to that office and increase their pay by gradual steps such as the favor of their officers the addition of   pence or   pence a day for the head of every enemy they bring their general as much for the information of a spahees death out of the pay of the deceased a custom politickly instituted to prevent the fashionable cheats imposed on christian princes by their military officers besides which casual opportunities of increasing their allowances they receive the additional reward of   pence a day upon the accession of every new sultan to the throne of his predecessors so that by the favorable turns of merit or good fortune they go on increasing by successive additions till they attain at last their ne plus vltra and sit down contentedly in the full possession of eight shillings and fourpence per day  their arms in war the common arms in use amongst these horsemen are numerous and convenient and so strangely differing from one another that it is a sight completely curious to observe a disciplined spahee as fully armed as war requires him for first a glittering helmet rather graces than defends their heads a back and breast piece guard their bodies and on their shoulders hangs a bow with a capacious quiver of their eastern arrows their girdles often hold   horsemens pistols a long light musket slung like ours hangs neatly at their sides and on their proper thigh is fastned a large weighty scymetar werewith when broken in upon disordered enemies they do prodigious execution and riding short in strong and spacious stirrops lift themselves with ease beyond their saddle and extend a blow with double fury besides these arms they bear upon the left side of their horses beneath the girt another strong and broader backsword which with an iron headed mace for that purpose fastened on the contrary side they use promiscuously as they see occasion  their discipline rather desperate than regular their discipline is mean and insignificant for they never form their bodies according to the politer practice of the christian nations into regiments or companies rank file or any other order but uniting strongly into one gross multitude observe attentively the nod of their commanders and repeating loudly exclamations upon god under the expressions allah allah fall rashly on with speed and vigor and if repulsed in their two first endeavors to break the order of their enemies repeat with desperate rashness their dangerous attempt and if repelled that fatal time forget their courage and disperse confusedly in all the hurry of a shameful flight  their punishments in war the charge of those rich wagons which contain the money for the payment of the troops is constantly committed to the custody of the spahees whose place it is to stand on horseback as sentinels of honor with a janizary on foot at the end of every rope which supports the stately pavilion of their sultan or in his absence the vizier his general when their crimes deserve the punishment of death they suffer privately like the janissaries but when demerits of a lower nature call for punishments of smaller rigor they are bastinadoed on their feet as is before described while offending janissaries feel the cudgel on their fleshy buttocks that the one may ride and the other walk without uneasiness by which means neither is prevented from the service of his sultan  so much shall serve to have spoken of the two extraordinary orders of the turkish militia who receive immediate salaries from the treasures of the sultan i shall now proceed to calculate as nearly as is possible the prodigious numbers of their cavalry whose formidable bodies have so often struck a panick fear through the despairing armies of contending governments  zaims and timariot what hey are the main support and sinewy foundation of their military power are the orders distinguished in their language by the names of zaim and timariot the first of which in rank and title is no ways inferior to an earl in christendom the last may justly be compared with our europaean barons and both not much unlike those persons who in england possessed estates in capite or the ancient tenure of knights service  their use and duty it ever was and still continues a custom amongst the turks immediately after having conquered the dominions of an enemy to parcel out the lands into certain large divisions and bestow them instantly upon such of their officers as had successfully distinguished themselves in the reduction of that country these men in return for the possession of their lands are besides the necessary duties of a rustical improvement obliged continually to maintain a settled number of men and horses completely armed and ready at a minutes warning for the call of war to which they go themselves attended by their several numbers when the grand signior or vizier appear in person in the field but generally go or stay according to the dictates of their various inclinations when the armies are commanded by some inferior general  the charge incumbent on a zaim of these the zaims as noblest in their quality are richest in their possessions and consequently taxed with a proportionable weight of care and charges the lowest charge incumbent on a zaim is four complete and qualified horsemen and the highest nineteen the highest of a timariot is four and the smallest one but many of these men ambitious of preferment and desirous to be taken notice of for overacting their parts of loyalty and obedience will often double sometimes treble their proportion of the soldiers  that the reader may be able to compute the number of the ottoman forces i will proceed to make a reasonable calculation of these horsemen from the several farms belonging to the two and twenty provinces heretofore mentioned  in the province of anatolia are rekond     zaims and    0 timariots caramania 0        diarbekir     0    scham     0  0 siwas  0   0   ezrum          pascha     0    marasch 0   0    cyprus 0 0  0   tripoly 0   0  0 rika 0 0 0    terbozan 0   0    halep      0   childir  0  0    kupudan          rumeeli

treated of hereafter consisting of twenty thousand horse and eighty thousand foot kept constantly to be ready upon all occasions so that in the one and twenty archdukedoms abovementioned are contained at least three thousand five hundred and four zaims and fifty one thousand five hundred seventy nine timariots and the charges incumbent on the first of these being as i have said before from four to nineteen men we may reasonably conclude that the grandeur of one making full amends for the deficiency of the other they come attended to the field at the rate of ten followers to each man which added to their masters complete the number of thirty eight thousand five hundred and eighty men  a calculation of the number of the turkish horse the lowest quota of a turkish timariot as has been told already being one man and the highest four and indeed there remaining few of the former since the vast improvements made of ancient farms we may with reason judge timariots to bring one with another three men besides themselves to serve in war which make in all the number of two hundred and seven thousand three hundred and eight fighting men which added to the zaims spahees and egyptian soldiers aforementioned complete their cavalry and form a standing army consisting of at least three hundred thousand eight hundred and eighty eight accomplished horsemen  nor is this large account of their prodigious numbers swollen beyond the fixed reality of their existence i might rather have advanced my calculation in a high degree from the natural dictates of conspicuous probability but shall content my self with having given my reader an account sincerely void of all extravagancies and those fashionable practices whether justly or unjustly i shall not here dispute so unfortunately imputed to the too prolifick fancys of our modern travelers  the order of the tukish infantry called azapi proportionable to the cavalry is the unnumbred infantry of the turkish nation which consists of several degrees in honor or advantage and all maintained in war and peace without the smallest burden on the sultans treasury the most unvalued numerous and unpolished soldiers of the turkish army are the azapi an order void of form or discipline who in the storming towns defending trenches or attacking armies are like useless blocks of timber pushed upon their ruin that falling dead by thousands they may as it were make blunt the weapons of the enemy and with their bodies fill a ditch or form a bulwark for the passage or defense of their more valued followers  besides these general bodies of the turks militia every province has some peculiar order for its own defense nor do the guards of viceroys and provincials form an inconsiderable part of their unshaken strength and power no bey bashaw or any distant governor believing himself secure without the guard of certain thousands of soldiers appropriated to his service who when the common danger or their masters loyalty speaks em necessary are sent to serve their country where any seat of war requires their presence  there are besides these mentioned orders several other sorts of soldiery such as gunners armourers baggageguarders etc of which in constantinople only may be reckoned constantly the number of    or    thousand whereby the reader may be able to guess what proportionable swarms must be distributed in all the spreading corners of that spacious empire  the turks auxiliary forces from valachia and moldavia the subjects of moldavia and valachia are obliged to send auxiliary forces to the assistance of the turks whenever their occasions press em to require it the settled quota of each country is about eight thousand men commanded always by their respective princes nor can the weightiest plea of incapacited poverty exempt em from that duty  the duty of the tartar han in respect to the grandsigniors service but the greatest aid the turks receive from their depending allies is the fixed supply of fifty thousand horse a tribute due to the occasions of the sultan from the petty tartar to be led by the young han his son or the chief minister of the country when the turkish army is commanded by the grand vizier or any other general but when the emperor commands in person the tartar han or prince himself must come and join him with a furnished army of an hundred thousand men  having dwelt so long upon those numerous orders whose unnumberd multitudes compose that formidable power whereunto in former ages the successful turks have owed their fortune it may not be esteemed unnecessary to describe particularly that accomplished discipline so strictly practiced in the longest marches of their numerous army  though the turkish management of their body military has been rendered void of form and discipline by the mistaken representations of some too hasty travelers yet a person who observes with a curious impartiality the artfull methods of their warlike government will soon percieve a matchless order shine conspicuously throughout their camp whose good effects produce continually such happy consequences as will more than make a full atonment for their known deficiency in the art of war  the use of wine denied soldiers of the turkish army upon pain of death for first the use of wine is there denied em by so strict a prohibition that the smallest quantity when discovered is a certain sacrifice of that mans life who has it in possession hereby those frequent quarrels and audacious villainies so fatal and pernicious to the christian armies are perpetually avoided and the noisy clamours of tumultuous war subservient calmly to the milder influence of a peaceful quietude no rapes or murders plead for justice to the base abettors of a countenanced disorder no hopes or prospect of unlawful gain can tempt the officers of a turkish army to the loose permission of licentious insolences all is mild and serene and silent and the horrid face of gloomy war disguised or painted by the brighter marks of form and discipline  it is for this the officers of any marching troops throughout the turks dominions dispatch continually from place to place a certain number of the trustiest janissaries to search the towns through the which their men must pass and seal or stave what buts of wine or other spirituous liquor they find therein at least   days before their camp arrives  a curious sort of torches used in turkey another custom prevalent amongst the turkish armies is to march em constantly from town to town and never suffer them in peace or war to lie so long in any place as to contrive such mischiefs as our christian soldiers by their tempting opportunities do too often study and find means to execute nay so careful are their chiefs to prevent disturbances that they will rather travel all night long than give their men the means of plundering those miserable wretches on whom they quarter and indeed it is a sight extremely pleasant to behold em marching through the thickest gloom of winter nights with so innumerable a quantity of bright illuminations as almost rival day it self with their extended luster nor are these lights like our small torches but composed of large and massy balls of flax and cotton dipped in tarr or turpentine or oftener a sort of oily and bituminous wood which certain arabs purposely attending on the turkish camp and there distinguished by the name of massalageelar bear aloft in iron cages carried on a tall and elevated staff not much unlike those ancient lights described in old and valuable tapesttry  the form wherein the turkish generals pitch their camps and now since i have so often mentioned the turkish army twill no ways favor of a disgressive prolixity if i describe at large that graceful order and unthought magnificence wherewith they pitch their camps in every place they come to first then the large pavilions of the sultan grand vizier or any other general then marching at their head are pitched directly in the midst of some extensive plain surrounded at submissive distance by the tents of his lord treasurer chief steward secretary and the master of the ceremonies these five pavilions placed as i have said before at a respectfull distance extend themselves upon a vast spot of ground leaving in the middle one fine open square in whose delineated center stand a double row of stately pillars which support a lofty canopy under which all punishments when ordered by the general are put in execution here come the officers of the army either led by business or desire of conversation and walking up and down in several companies form agreeably a sort of promenade diverting though irregular  the turkish treasury how guarded in the camp not far from hence are placed those valuable chests which bear the treasure for the soldiers payment pild in gradual order one upon the other and rising in a form directly circular these chests are guarded both within and without by certain chosen horsemen who all night long keep strict and formidable watch with spears and firearms  the two abovementioned quarters are surrounded by the graceful tents of the bashaws beys beylerbeys sangiacks and agas whose stately form and vast magnificence can never be imagined but by such whose ocular demonstration have convinced em of their grandeur for though the turks delight but little in the outward ornament of houses nor aspire in the least to overdo each other in the europaean custom of polite and solid architecture yet do they far more exceed us in the rich ornaments and contrivances of their pavilions than we outshine their homely hutts and miserable cottages by the stupendous fabrics of our finest marble and the most lasting statelyness of our most celebrated edifices  the wonderful conveniences of the turkish pavilions it is every way impossible to describe at large those tripple walls vast rooms of state innumerable apartments kitchens butteries cellars and convenient offices wherein those tents abound which form the courts of some considerable officers in their army their rooms are square and full of windows neatly formed to open always from the windy quarter and in short nothing either useful or ornamental is omitted to complete them  the quarters of the zaims timariots etc behind their masters lie in measured order a prodigious number of the zaims timariots and beylerbeys in proportion to the sultans army who with their horses camels mules and carriages appear a huge and formidable body of wellskilld and disciplined soldiers  quarters of the janissaries the chosen glories of the turkish camp compose its front consisting chiefly of the bravest janissaries and such accomplished volunteers as having fully qualified themselves by a long experience for the duty of an office expect impatiently some profitable employment by gradual succession to the vacant posts of such as fall or by the longwishd favor of some great commander these encompass at an aweful distance the yanicherraga or general of the janissaries whose place and power i have lately spoken of in the foregoing part of this chapter  the spahees quartered in the rear the rear of their army is generally composed of the politest spahees who with many other regular and wellappointed horsemen of the most esteemed and honorable orders maintain their posts in case of need with wonderful alacrity and resolution making good the retreat of their disordered fellows by bravely sacrfising their lives and liberty for the preferable interest of their sultan and his country  station of the baggage and heavy artillery it is generally under the guard of these abovenamed horsemen that the baggage camels and heavy artillery belonging to the army are safely convoyed and really when a man who seriously reflects on what he sees becomes a witness of the numberless attendants trains and carriages of the turkish armies he cannot but with wonder bless that god who curbs in mercy the ambitious arms of this prodigious government and has kindly placed a powerful hook in the presumptuous nostrils of their great leviathan  thus have i at large described the fatal instruments of those depopulating slaughters whose raging violence in former ages raised the monarchs of a ravished empire to the loftiest throne of undivided power and arbitrary tyranny which the world supports and still continue to maintain the swords prerogative whereby without respect to justice or religion the turkish sultans trample proudly on the softer dictates of nature and morality removing violently whatever rubs obstruct their will and to whose inhumane practices nothing can be more applicable than the precepts of photinus expressed as follows in the eighth book of lucan sceptrorum vis tota perit si pendere justa incipit evertitque arces respectus honesti libertas scelerum est etc scepters lose power when kings religious grow and valued honesty does towers oerthrow free villainy supports an enviod reign and unsheathed weapons unshockd power maintain he who in wicked actions takes delight is safe no longer than they crown his sight the pious man in courts should never dwell virtue and sovereign power agree not well but he who meanly thinks such sin a shame let him for ever fear and miss the road to fame   chap v of their naval force the convenient situation of constantinople in respect to navigation let us now proceed to search a little into those extraordinary conveniences for attaining the highest perfection in the art of navigation so peculiar to the capital of the turkish empire that it seems as if the hand of providence had fixed at constantinople the happy seat of universal monarchy and blessed its neighborhood with all the mighty helps that bounteous nature can afford a country or the hand of art can possibly require to extend dominion over all the world and spread authority through distant climates vainly separated by the watery deserts of a stormy ocean  not all the kingdoms of the christian world should they resolve to join their forces and partake promiscuously of one another blessings could afford conjointly more materials for maritime improvements than grow commodiously within the beckon of the turks metropolis timber whence brought them for round the shores whose ragged cliffs encompass the euxine or black sea stand endless numbers of tall woods whose stately timber felled for use supply the city through the thracian bosphorus with the finest wood required for building  canvas hemp tar pitch tallow and biscuit canvas for sails and hemp for rigging well what ships they build they have beyond all possible necessity from those parts of egypt which surround grandcairo valachia moldavia epirus and albania supply them plentifully with tallow pitch and tarr the best in europe as for biscuit it abounds incredibly through every corner of their vast dominions  the prodigious magnitude of the arsenal at constantinople their ports and arsenals for building ships are numerous and convenient beyond imagination that at constantinople is so vastly large and full of voltas or docks for building as to be capable of fitting out above one hundred and thirty five vessels at one and the same time nor are the other arsenals and harbors of his empire less convenient or magnificently splendid in proportion to the several magnitudes of the respective towns or places where they are whence supplied with gally slaves and as for gallyslaves to tugg laboriously at the toilsom oar they neither do nor can want fresh supplies while the barbarian pirates or dreadful ravages of the inhumane tartars present or sell them yearly thousands of such unhappy wretches as have fallen unwarily into their hands and so become the wretched victims of their insatiate avarice  now may my reader be induced to fancy from the accounts abovementioned that the relation i shall give him of the turkish fleets will be proportionable to their conveniences for encouraging above the christian world the useful art of navigation but he will find his error with a deep surprise when he perceives their naval force not only unimprovd by an industrious application to an equal balance with the christian navies but on the contrary every way inferior to the maritime improvements of those poor republics whose small extent and insignificant possessions do scarce entitle them to the name of governments when looked upon in competition with the far superior power of confederated christendom  why the turks grew weak in navigation yet is this great misfortune rather owing to their ignorance than idleness having frequently attempted to equip vast navies and with some success invaded hostile nations with their sometime formidable squadrons but their want of knowledge in the arts of building rigging or the management of vessels still occasioned yearly losses to the sultan by their dreadful shipwracks when they met with tempests or more dreadful overthrows when driven by the turns of chance to stand the shock of a more skillful enemy in the destructive trial of some decisive battle  galleys now chiefly used it is for this alone they have of late disusd their large maahumes or ships of war and fallen wholly into building galleys and galleasses so that trusting rather to the oar than their strength or courage they preserve their navies from those shocking dangers which so often broke em when they vainly thought themselves a match by sea as well as land for christian enemies  there are notwithstanding now at constantinople so many tall and stately ships of war as might compose a navy of five or six and thirty sail from twenty four to one hundred and sixteen guns but these are never sent abroad for use but oftentation the form of turkish ships of war they are beyond imagination high and broad their sterns and heads built high one deck above another for convenience of lodging officers but so unweildy by their form and so unfit for stormy weather by the green unseasond timber which is used about em that though they put to sea with drums and trumpets sounding endless crowds of sailors shouting and their streamers flying with a rich magnificence they soon return unriggd and shattered less in number as in splendor bearing shamefully the ragged marks of weakness and disorder in their tattered sails and planks just gaping to admit the ocean  the turkish galleys which as i said before are what they most depend on are jointly subject to the same misfortunes with their larger vessels and utterly unable to resist the fury of a winter sea wherefore beingfixd in dry docks belonging to the arsenal till the sharp extremity of that unfavourd season is a little over there are orders given to the sultans admiral distinguished by the name of capitainbashaw to call em from their stations and with all imaginable expedition put to sea and cruise all summer  the manner of their raising seamen proclamation is immediately hereupon issued carefully over all the turks dominions bordering on the black and midland seas that such as hold their lands in tenor of sea service shall suddenly repair with their respective quotas to their several posts on board their galleys this is done with utmost speed and generally brings together about two thirds of that great number which their fleet requires upon all occasions  the pay of a turkish sailor to fill the vacancies which still require supply they list immediately prodigious numbers of a sort of mariners there distinguished by the name of tchurmah who are kept as slaves by people in the towns which border on the sea and hired to serve the summer out on board the galleys where for six months drudgery at the laborious oar they receive a good allowance of provision for the voyage and about the sum of five and twenty pounds at their return which is the sole right and property of their respective masters who live an idle and inglorious life upon the toilsom labors and unpitied miseries of their fellow creatures  in case there still requires a fresh recruit they send a certain number of their sturdiest seamen to rove from place to place about the provinces which border on their capital and there impress the lustiest clowns they find amongst them till by this addition they complete the number which the service of the sultan then demands  an admirable policy these last are called azaps or clowns and as least useful to the necessities of their emperor are still least burdensome to his treasury for though their pay is equal to the rest it costs the government not one sole farthing for out of every five and twenty families they claim a right to one azap and for his maintenance that summer the other four and twenty houses are obliged to raise an equal sum of money to reward his service  besides these several orders of the turkish seamen there remains another to be spoken of which consists of those condemned delinquents of the christian churches subject to their tyranny whose crimes or evil fate have chained their bodies to the oar of slavery whence death alone has power to free them these with such of the maltese venetian spanish or italian mariners as have unfortunately been the prize of war are kept misery of galleyslaves together void of hope in endless misery never to enjoy their ravished liberty till the pitying sea demands their bodies worn and meagre by continual labors or the happy turn of a successful battle shall with joy give back again that darling blessing which it once took from em  the yearly voyage of the turkish fleet of galleys the turkish galleys thus equipped set sail for a large port upon the hellespont now called gallipolis their number never exceeds one hundred nor can the mighty power of the turkish sultan maintain a greater fleet though often attempted hence they sail as war or business leads their admiral from isle to isle round all the tributary islands of the archepilago to awe the natives from rebellion or disorder or preserve their shoars from the repeated insults of their christian enemies till having spent the time allotted for their absence they return again to the port of constantinople and discharging all their hired seamen place the galleys in their former stations and retire to their respective habitations till approaching spring invites their officers to renew their care and summon back the mariners to their abandoned duty  beyes of the archipalago besides the fleet immediately depending on the sultans admiral there are a certain number under twenty of the lords or governors of the abovenamd islands who by the tenure of their several governments are still obliged to join the navy every summer with each a well appointed galley under his command when every prize they chance to take is the undoubted right and property of their sultan but when in winter they continue cruizing after the return of their high admiral and his navy whatever prize their fortune gives em is their own by law and by themselves possessed as lawful booty  a great oversight in their governments the fatal cause of that unsinewd weakness in the turkish nvay may not be improperly assigned to their unskilful practice in the art of navigation guiding with a sort of listless application their unpolished rules of maritine improvements and so confiding in the sure perfection of the christian knowledge in that useful science that without the least examination into the pretensions of a renegado they immediately advance him to the post of gunner sailmaker carpenter or boatswain never doubting his accomplishment in a study which they look upon as natural to the natives of a christian country  i know not whether it proceeds from a mean despair of being able to exceed or equal us in sea affairs or is the luxurious effect of their prodigious plenty and those rich dominions they possess by land which tempts their inclinations to a gross and unmolested enjoyment of their unmeasured wealth and draws away their minds from that industrious application they must long time use before they can attain a full perfection in that neglected science but plain and undeniable demonstration convinces us that they affect not in the least becoming formidable by a powerful navy never venturing into distant oceans and very rarely out of sight of land sailing always by direction of certain false and illdesignd seacharts mechanically drawn without the smallest knowledge of a mathematical proportion and as a cloak to shroud the shameful ignorance which reigns among them make frequent use of an inglorious proverb a turkish proverb viz that god has given the land to their possession and thought fit to leave the sea to the dominion of the infidels  in former ages the grand signior could by virtue of his great authority at any time oblige the algierines with those of tunis tripoly morocco fez and other parts of africa to come with powerful ships of war to his assistance the pirates of barbary independent on the grandsignior but the princes of those countrys having lately much increased their power as well as policy find constant means by some excuse to quitt his service nor approach his empire but in order to recruit their own with fresh supplies of men and plunder while they frequently attack such grecian islands as are under the protection of the turkish sultan and artfully contrive to play the pirate by lying off at sea without the reach of any fort or castle that upon complaint by those they injure to the officers of the grand signior those avaricious ministers who underhand receive their shares of all the booty may have a fair pretense for the refusing to demand a legal satisfaction as knowing it beyond their power to revenge the injury  having lately spoken of the miserable fate wherein such wretches find themselves involved as are by the unhappy chance of war become the slaves of an inhumane enemy it may not be unwelcome to relate a story of the particulars whereof i was informed by many people who were witnesses to the truth of most of its uncommon passages  a strange story of a turkish slave redeemed from servitude signior pietro cornaro a young accomplished gentleman of an ancient family and considerable fortune in the city of ferrara in italy was led not many years ago to travel through the various provinces of his celebrated country that by improving his experience he might entirely satisfy his eager curiosity and enrich his mind with such refined notions as would distinguish his perfections from the far less qualified and common conversation of his fellow citizens  he came amongst other places to leghorne and took up lodgings at an inn in order to observe the rarities of that well peopled city and happening to be placed in an appartment that opened to the public street would often take a morning walk about his room and looking frequently upon the street divert himself agreeably by a curious observation of whatever passed before him  a privilege of slaves in leghorne it is a custom of the town abovementioned to enlarge the turks who serve em as their slaves and give them liberty to ply as porters or betake themselves to any other toilsome drudgery obliging them to pay their masters such a daily sum of money as is judged convenient and permitting them to keep the little overplus to serve occasionally their own necessities  a virtuous curiosity directly opposite to signior pietros chamber was a bench on which he often saw a melancholy turk sit thoughtfull and dejected leaning pensively his head upon his hand and dropping now and then a silent tear which he endeavored secretly to wipe away with a large knott of ropes the wretched badge of his unfortunate employment the frequent repetition of this mournful practice though begun too early for a public observation was perceived with wonder by the compassionate italian who earnestly desirous to become acquainted with the reasons of his sorrow sent at last a messenger to fetch him and having carried him directly to his own appartment discoursed a while and asked him several questions in the italian language wherein the turk had then attained considerable knowledge and receiving answers modest and particular proceeded to demand the manner of his being taken and how long he had continued in that state of slavery  with wringing hands and elevated looks which seemed to blame his stars for his unpitied misery the poor disconsolate mohammedan began his tale and watered his complaint with showers of tears whose falling streams spoke piercing proofs of his ungovernable sorrow i am says he an honest musseman never friend to war or rapine but became a sacrifice to both in an unlucky visit to an aged father then in health and peace at cyprus now perhaps laid cold and breathless in some gloomy grave and may have broke his heart to hear my misery  these sad complaints were followed mournfully by a sincere and full account of every accident which had concurred unfortunately to reduce him to this slavery he soon at large informed his kind inquirer that he had sorrowfully spent four tedious years in that condition which had left three wives two sons now men and nine small children drowned in grief for his unlucky loss and wholly destitute of any means whereby to know his present habitation  the pitying breast of signior pietro framed for tender and compassionate impressions melted generously with sympathetical concern to hear the wretched and forlorn condition of this complaining infidel and asking him his name and other things he thought convenient he gave him money and dismissed him kindly with a word or two of comfort  a generous compassion the turk returned disconsolately back to the unwelcom practice of his daily labors and the tendernaturd signior pietro seriously reflecting on his weighty sorrow and considering that the will of providence or some unthought of turn of fickle chance might one day make the case his own and teach him by the bitter proofs of sad experience how to pity others miseries by the insupportable extremity of his own misfortunes he resolved to do a noble act of christian charity and making interest with the governor of the town found means to get the turk released for the ransom of about one hundred forty five duccats  never could more welcome and surprising news rejoice the heart of humane sufferer than that which brought the happy turk the news of his delivery with rapid transports of ungoverned joy he fell upon his knees embraced the feet of his adored redeemer and with numerous vows of hearty gratitude entreated signior pietro to inform him how he might return twice told that friendly sum which had so generously purchased him his valued liberty  an honorable liberality the good italian wished him well but told him he expected no return yet if his soul was noble and would urge him to be grateful he only asked his solemn promise that he would at his return redeem from slavery some christian gentleman whom he should think did most deserve it and send him back as soon as possible to visit once again his native country this last agreement was in fine cncluded on and the delivered turk supplied with clothes and all things necessary embarked on board an english vessel bound for turkey and returned successfully to his former habitation  there passed about three months beyond the day of the mahometans departure from leghorne when signior pietro having been the greatest part of that time in venice pleased extremely with the city and its people became enamored of a lady young and beautiful called maria margarita delfino who had for several years resided in that town under the roof and care of a substantial merchant youngest brother to her father who with her sisters and the major part of her relations lived at malta nothing could dissuade the amorous italian from a violent expression of his growing passion he solicited her uncle with incessant importunities and at last engaged him to permit him to address her upon this condition that he should accompany his niece and him to malta there to gain her fathers approbation of his person and condition this he promised and continued four months daily visiting the object of his affection till he gained entirely her consent to marry him when she was authorized to do it by her fathers order and it seems their sympathetic ornaments of mind and body pointed out the match and spoke em only worthy of each others value  a strange misfortune which befell a lover and his mistress they embarked upon a vessel bound for malta and belonging to that island which they were almost arrived in sight of when a turkish gally met and boarded them making undistinguished prize of all her cargo and transporting signior pietro with his mistress and her uncle into threatened slavery landing them at smyrna together with the valuable prize in which they took them  oh strange uncertainty of humane life blind mad event of fickle fortune how much in vain do thoughtless mortals boast the blessings of a worldly grandeur when the sudden turns of war or accident destroy tyrannically in one poor moment the stateliest pillars of that fansied greatness upon which foundation we so vainly build our hopes of happiness  a very odd and surprising turn of fortune i forgot to tell you that the three companions in this miserable state had changed their clothes for course and rougher habits when they saw the danger they were falling into that being so disguised they might expect a ransom from a smaller charge than otherwise would serve em so that being taken with the common people they were like them in chains conducted to the public market where the slaves are bought and sold like sheep or oxen signior pietro and the young ladies uncle were tied together and placed with many more to wait the purchase of the fairest bidder opposite to them the poor unhappy lady stood half dead with fear and anguish with a numerous crowd of christian women young and old expecting every moment to be bought and torn away from any hopes of seeing ever more her lover and relation  a grating trial of a lovers patience who could now express the swelling grief conflicting passions and tumultuous agonies wherewith these poor desponding lovers viewed each other yet not daring to discover their concern for fear their love should double their misfortunes till at last a young and graceful turk came up to the disconsolate maria and bargaining immediately with the officer who kept her paid the money and throwing on a veil he brought on purpose took her from the rest and carried her away with an extraordinary satisfaction  many a complaining look did the despairing lady give her friends who answered her with all the mournful marks of silent lamentation and were now especially the lover so confounded with their misery that they stood insensible like marble statues looking steadfastly upon the ground and took no notice of the many purchasers who walked about from place to place to view the persons of the wretched captives  while they stood thus fixed in contemplation on the transitory blessings of a mortal life there came a turk from stall to stall enquiring earnestly of every officer what quality and country their several slaves laid claim to and examining particularly the slaves themselves to the same effect at last he came to signior pietro who holding down his head the turk stooped forward to look upon his face a courtesy not often put in practice by those barbarous people who when a slave refuses to hold up his face will generally take them roughly by the chin as when a jockey looks upon a horses mouth and rudely force em to expose their countenances a lucky accident the turk no sooner saw the face but starting back in great surprise he raised his arms and eyes toward heaven and half transported at the strange discovery cried out aloud i thank thee holy prophet thou have guided well my lucky footsteps the grieved italian looking up at this surprising exclamation saw before his eyes that very man whom in leghorn he had so kindly freed from slavery no pen can tell the raptures he must needs conceive at this so happy meeting swift embraces followed their surprise and when the wonder of the turk would give him leave to speak again he thus address himself to signior pietro  a memorable piece of gratitude i promised thee said he thou best of christians that i would certainly redeem such slave from servitude as i should judge did more than any else deserve that blessing and now thank mahomet in thee i have discovered him with that he ordered him who guarded them to send some person to receive his ransom and conduct him presently to his own house the overjoyed italian heard with pleasure the design of his accomplished gratitude but told him if he would be doubly kind he might redeem his friend who suffered with him and they would find some speedy means to reimburse his utmost charges the proposition was embraced as soon as offered and a person being sent to take the money received immediately the ransoms he demanded and returning to the market left the gentlemen in the care of their redeemer  another strange surprise the turks two sons when told the accident by which their father met the man to whom before he owed his liberty expressed sincere and grateful joy and bid them welcome with an inexpressible civility and after having heard the manner of their being taken and their sorrowful complaint for loss of an unhappy virgin whom they loved so dearly he who was the eldest of the two cried out with earnestness now by the religion of our prophet and his people my fathers house contains this virgin and thereupon proceeded to inform them he had bought that very morning a young christian slave to wait upon his mother and his fathers other wives that she had given the same account as they had done of the particulars of her captivity that she was then above among the women and he would for satisfaction fetch her down that very moment  it is easy to imagine the disorder of their breasts possessed alternately by hope and fear which raged impetuously and racked their minds till doubt gave way and boundless joy overspread their souls to see the person they so lately lost conducted to their arms by him to whom the laws of turkey gave her up as lawful purchase  they staid a week with their kind landlord who would not rest till he had likewise ransomed two men servants and a maid who waited on the lady these together with as many of their goods and clothes as he could purchase from the turk who took them he bestowed again upon their lawful owners gave them a considerable sum of money and contrived to get them passage on a vessel of marseilles then bound for malta  signior pietro the young lady and her uncle frequently endeavored to oblige this honest turk to take their bills or find some other method to secure his money but he persisted in a positive refusal of their smallest proffers telling signior pietro the debt was paid before it was contracted and would often lay his hand devoutly on his bosom and with a zealous sigh repeat this proverb a turkish proverb the god of heaven has given us plenty that we may give from god where need requires it  moral reflections on the instability of fortune this story tho digressive from the subject of the chapter may perhaps so far divert the reader as to make a full atonement for its undesignd prolixity since a moral observation may thereby be made and teach us happily so well to use our charitable opportunities that we may reasonably hope if once our fate should chance to be inverted duly to receive that measure of compassion which our former mercy heaped abundantly on those who wanted it always bearing in our memories that the transitory smiles of worldly fortune though they make a blessing great can never make it fixed or permanent that kings and beggars are alike the sport of chance and those who rule to day may serve to morrow while the blanks and prizes of our frail mortality proclaim alternately the good or ill of humane life uncertain as a lottery  but to return to what i undertook to speak of such as before described is now the greatest naval power which the turkish sultans boast possession of and while the reader may be led to wonder at the blindness of those enemies to christendom he would do well to praise the mercies of that god who by his undeserved and boundless providence vouchsafes to curb the wild desires of an ambitious government by not permitting them to know their interest and improve those vast peculiar opportunities their provinces afford them to the terror or destruction of his church and people  a powerful navy the glory of a nation the numerous advantages a nation gains defended formidably by a warlike navy are beyond dispute the pillars of her state and chief promoters of her envied glories since a people strengthened by a powrfull fleet not only reap advantages from foreign traffic and become thereby immensely rich at home but are enabled fully to extend their conquests to the spacious earths remotest corners and become free denizons of all the countries of the habitable world  the decay of naval force among the turks an omen of their downfall that therefore these aspiring and ambitious infidels instead of having gained a double knowledge of the useful art of navigation as their daily conquests swelled their empire have extremely slackened their oncewarm endeavors and begin to slight marine improvements may well be looked upon as an undoubted proof of their declining state and sinking grandeur and many reasonable causes join to prompt a christians hope that he may live to triumph in the downfall of a throne whose black foundation fixed its greatness on the bloody overthrow of injured princes and the undistinguished slaughter of invaded nations  nor are the turks insensible of their weakness they know they lie entirely open to the insults of the muscovites who lately forced a passage through the euxine sea and sent a ship of  0 guns which brought on board the czars ambassador and coming to an anchor at the point of the grand signiors seraglio saluted and surpised the city with a whole broadside never was there seen a greater consternation which continued with uncommon hurry and destraction till twas publicly proclaimed he came to bring their emperor a compliment from moscovy since that they have repaired some castles on the entrance of the bosphorus and black sea but never built one vessel more nor taken any requisite precaution in order to withstand the growing danger which alarmed their fears from so undreaded and remote a corner  chap vi of the tenets of their faith and how differing from the persians the turkish alcoran or body of their faith three noted books among the turks direct their faith and dictate their religion the alcoran or body of their law and faith was first compiled by the impostor mahomet assisted by the pen of sergius a monk this book is written in arabian verse but rough and inharmonious nor must be either read or written in another language it is like the gospel amongst christians sacred and incontrovertible and approached devoutly with a zealous kiss nor must be touched by christians or the unwashd hands of turks themselves the titles under which it passes are agreeable to their opinion of its doctrine such as light of god sole guide to paradise and divine director unto heavenly glories  the second book of their religion the second book which teaches their religion is the assonah or sure traditional decrees of their enlightened prophets ebubeker omar haly and ozmyn the third by whom twas written the third is called the necessary consequences of the books of life or true interpretation of the prophets pleasure which last was written by the ancient caliphs of egypt and babylon whose vast authority the power of the sword and change of governments has centurd in the muftee of the modern turkish empire  the five articles required to constitute a true mohammedan now though these three abovenamed books contain the total sum of their fallacious doctrine yet are they inverted greatly by the various explications and directly opposite opinions of their expounding doctors but notwithstanding their divisions into numerous sects which teach peculiar doctrines to their several adherents there is a certain standard of their faith containing five religious articles of fundamental piety and indispensible necessity which are required to constitute a true mohammedan and allowed by all sufficient proofs to gain a man of any party or opinion whatsoever the valuable character of a true believer the first is frequent cleansing with a pot of water all the outward parts of their polluted bodies the second is to pray five times each day they live the third to keep one month in twelve a strict and holy fast the fourth to give according to their wealth a large proportion to the poor believers and the fifth to visit once at least before they die the celebrated tomb of their impostrous prophet or depute some holy person in their stead and bear his charges going and returning through the numerous stages of that commanded pilgrimage  the main profession of the turkish faith the only great and noted article of the turkish faith is centred fully in the following profession allah ekbirr esaked hu enlah ilah he illallah ve esked hu enai muhammed weesuul the meaning of which words in our language may be expressed as follows i verily believe there is but one god and mahomet is the prophet of that god other rites and ceremonies are only looked upon as trials of obedience and never reckoned necessary rules to guide their faith or forfeit though omitted their assured salvation  certain other principles of their religion amongst these last may be esteemed the duty of their circumcising children their abstaining zealously from blood and swinesflesh their observing friday as an holy sabbath their refusing images or pictures in their churches and a number more of their religious customs  a pleasant notion of the turks concerning the creation though they acknowledge god in all his attributes of great good just omniscient omnipresent and incomprehensible they deny with violence the doctrine of the trinity and not distinguishing the sacred union of that heavenly mystery are blindly led to think we worship three distinct and separated godheads they believe that god created both the world and all things in it and relate a pleasant story how he formed man of various sorts of colored clay which having lain for many thousand years neglected in the sun he breathed into him the breath of life and being much delighted with his new creation made the angels kneel down and worship him but when the innate pride of haughty satan urged him to deny his gods decree by boldly daring to dispute his will the kindled anger of the great almighty threw him headlong down to hell with all those angels which appeared his friends for which they say the envious devils have since that been unrelenting enemies to humane happiness  their opinion of our savior though they dissavow with heat the noblest principles of opposite christanity they do not only speak respectfully of jesus christ but own him as a prophet far beyond the hebrew moses and inferior only to their worshipped mahomet whom he preceeded with inferior share of inspiration as he succeeded moses with a greater portion they deny his crucifixion they call him in their books the breath of god but own not his divinity nor can be brought to credit his asserted crucifixion which they say was inconsistent with the justice of a god so holy and impartial they can by no means think he would permit a prophet whom he had endud with virtue to resist all sin cure worst diseases raise the dead and do all other miracles to be made a sacrifice to so unworthy base and cursed a people as the jews then were and die so vile a death as christian doctrine says he suffered  a strange opinion of the turks concerning judas the better to defend this error in their faith they have contrived a subtle story how when christ was led to die almighty god translated him invisibly to a place in heaven and deceived the eyes of the deluded jews by such prevailing and mistaking blindness that they seized on judas who betrayed him to their hands and taking him for the departed jesus nailed him to the cross and executed him instead of our redeemer  no jew permitted to turn turk till he becomes a christian they believe him to have been a virgins son and that his mother mary bore him at her breasts conceiving not by humane help but by the virtuous odor of a certain rose they will not suffer him to be blasphemed but own he will return to judge the world some years before its dissolution nay so great a veneration do they pay his memory that they refuse to let a jew turn turk till he has first espoused the christian faith and will from thence become a perfect mussulman  they quite deny the doctrine of eternal punishment believing every man attended constantly in life and death by two contending angels one whereof is white and kind the other black severe and cruel such they say as die religiously are transported soon to joys in paradise while such as live a careless loose debauched and sinful life shall long be tortured by their sooty angel and receive a great and tedious punishment for all past wickedness before their white and friendly angel can prevail to lift em from the flames of hell and bear em pure and free from stain to taste the bliss their paradise affords them  the gross absurdities of their politest notions of a future state are such as will undoubtedly surprise the reader with a wonder at their ignorance but are not if considered rightly void of crafty and designing subtilties since to the rude and barbarous natures of those unpolished gross and sordid people who were first deluded by the turkish superstition nothing could have been a fairer mark to draw away their minds than those alluring prospects of a carnal pleasure which so entirely suited their extravagant desires and unrefind capacities  the turks odd notion of a general judgment the common notion prevalent in turkey of a general judgment and its necessary consequences is ridiculously founded on the following particulars they say the winding of a frightful horn shall shake the world to single atoms by the raging force of unresisted earthquakes god alone shall judge all mortals moses christ and mahomet appearing severally at the head of their respective followers to intercede with the almighty for the pardon of their sins the line or bridge of justice that cain shall lead the numbers of the damned all laden heavily with satchels full of crimes upon their burdened shoulders to pass upon a small and slippery rope thence called the line of justice that the greatest sinners shall be forced to tumble on the rightside into prodigious flames and scenes of torment there to be till having expiated all their guilt they shall be taken suddenly to seats in paradise while hell the devil and his wicked angels shall become annihilated by the power of heaven  those whose sins are less in weight and fewer in their number falling gently to the left of this abovenamed line of justice shall be taken in a nearer way to endless bliss and undergo but very small and trifling punishments to purify their natures for the taste of happiness  reward of virtue but as for those whose pious lives and exemplary virtues have deserved on earth no just reproof they shall be poised in passage by their guardian angels and attain successfully their throne of joy without the trouble of the smallest stay in either of those places not unjustly called the turkish purgatories  the odd chimeras of the turkish paradise paradise is by the turks conceived a spacious land overspread engagingly with lofty palaces inviting shades soft murmuring fountains cooling grottas verdant bowers and slowry meadows adorned magnificently with trees of gold and rocks of diamond amidst whose soft alluring charms the neverfading joys of love must bless their hours with constant pleasure giving each his lovely mistress rich in beauty and accomplished sweetness both of mind and body never subject to the earthly passions or deficiencies of nature pure and perfect in their forms and substance daily gaining back their robbed virginities to bestow again on those to whom before they lost em ever blooming in the flower of youth and served obsequiously by the attendant duty of divinely featured boys or angels and in short enjoying in their fansyd paradise the very height of those extravagant desires which are on earth the wild and vain effects of an insatiate wanton and luxurious appetite  predestination strictly held in turkey predestination in its highest  extended pitch is by the turks most zealously mantaind nay to such strange degrees of height does this opinion lift em that they scruple not to look on god as the unquestioned author both of good and evil  they all unanimously acquiesce in one belief that every man receives upon his forehead at his time of birth the undisputed mark of all his future good or ill that there is written both the time and manner of his certain death nor can he possibly by any means avoid the fate to which the will of god has so ordained him and herein they seem exactly to agree with those expressions of the famous seneca in his tragedy of oedipus a quotation from seneca relating to predestination fatis agimur cedite fatis non solicitae possunt curae mutare etc guided by fate we must subservient be nor can our care subvert one fixed decree whatever our mortal race does undergo whatever we think or act from heaven must flow all natures springs move one appointed way and the first hour points out the latest day   a very strange and humerous custom of the turkish people they hold the name of god so sacred and inviolable that they seldom speak of the divine omnipotence without a reverend stroaking down their beards and faces nay so careful are they to preserve from disrespect the power of god that when they find the smallest piece of paper fallen in the street the gravest man among them will with reverence stoop to take it up and thrust it closely into some small nook or crevice in the walls or houses as they pass along a stranger would be very much surpised to see the outward cases of the turkish buildings crammed as full as possible of little rough and rumpled scrips of brown and writing paper  their reasons for it the reasons which they give inquiring christians for the practice of this odd and trifling ceremony are diverting and particular for first they judge it an unseemly action to permit the feet of men or beasts or highway mud which fills their streets to touch or soil with their polluted filth a thing whereon the name of god might probably be written  the other reason which excites the walking turks to narrow searches for such bits of paper is a notion they have got amongst them that before they come within the walls of their delightful paradise they must be all obliged to walk barefooted over a large and glowing plain of redhot iron without permission to have any thing beneath their feet but all those former bits of paper which they saved on earth from being trampled on by the polluted tread of men or horses  the turks ungrateful for their womens favors women are but rarely suffered to appear in mosques and then are placed all over veiled behind a large and darkened lettice for the turks however fond of female conversation and wholly given up to wanton dalliances and the warm caresses of their womens persons are so far from placing like our amorous christians flames and darts death wounds and lightning in a ladies eye that they inhumanely deny their dovelike women even so much as one poor place in that enchanting paradise which we like more indulgent lovers make our mistresses the sole disposers of  the turkish ladies are denied a place in paradise the fine virginityrestoring ladies i so lately spoke of are not such as here on earth the turks enjoy but fine newformd and shining creatures purposely created for the place they dwell in while the poor forgotten objects of their worldly love remain without in places far less bright and glorious nor are allowed one distant view of those transporting joys in whose possession their oncelovd and stately lords now live in raptures  and now to give you british ladies an enlivening taste of turkish arrogance to your deserving sex and let you see how little cause you have to grieve that we possess a just and mild preeminence by natures laws and those of matrimony i will venture to translate a famous song now much in vogue among the celebrated beaux and belles of turkey you will pardon ladies if it wants the spirit of a good translation since where the subject does not please the jaded pen will very rarely reach perfection the song should seem to have been made by some successless lover on his meeting a repulse from one he courted for his fourth and favorite consort i a very odd and comical turkish song three wives i boast as black as jet and comely as the pine amongst all the three i never met a baulk to one design o mahomet o prophet you who can hear and revenge an injured mussulman ii a short and fair late won my heart and her i would have blessed she should have had of love a part superior to the rest o mahomet o prophet you who can hear and revenge an injured mussulman iii but she denied the proffered bliss and durst refuse to wed but if she suffers not for this may i be lost when dead o mahomet o prophet you who can hear and revenge an injured mussulman iv before her window long i stood sung loudly to her praise deep gashd my arm till drowned in blood yet unconcerned she would gaze o mahomet o prophet you who can hear and revenge an injured mussulman v but though she proudly dares rebel the time will come when i shall see the poor inferior wretch in hell not worthy once to look on me then slight conceited slave if there you can the proffered courtship of a mussulman   the turks forbid the use of wine the use of wine is in the alcoran forbid the turks on pain of the severest anger of their god and prophet yet they publicly express their great dislike of that injunction by the frequent drinking it in largest quantities in men of years and grave appearance it is esteemed a crime beyond excuse to be inclined to common drunkenness and men of high and envied posts are careful how they show the smallest inclination to the like intemperance lest they should give a joyful opportunity to their observing enemies to blame the follies of their several governments as an impure effect of loved ebriety but men of gay and sprightly tempers young and unimployd in state affairs affect the practice of continual drinking yet drink it to extravagance nor is the use of wine by them conceived as sovereign by its virtues or enlivening qualities but by the downright operation of a powerful quantity which skrews their spirits to a strange extravagance and robs em wholly of their deluged reason by the moist effects of its intoxicating nature  there is a custom i observed amongst the turks that they will often visit christian merchants at their country houses where retired from fear of public observation they have convenient time and opportunity to carouse at pleasure till becoming downright drunk and mad they run immediately to mount their horses and though scarce able to continue on their feet when fixed securely in their saddles begin to spurr with restless fury riding up and down from hill to valley in a constant gallop till they grow again sedately sober and return to take a formal leave of him whose wine they quassd so freely of  there goes a pleasant story of the cause why mahomet prohibited the use of wine to all his followers which is related by the turks themselves with these particulars  a story how mahomet came to forbid his followers the use of wine there was a certain shepherd in the neighborhood of meccha whose possessions were so far superior to the rest of his fraternity that he was chosen as a ruler of their whole society and exercised a sort of mild authority by the joint permission of the shepherds of that country  it happened that this man opposed with violence the doctrine of the impostor then but newly vented in those very parts wherein he lived and all the brotherhood depending upon him as on their lord and oracle the crafty mahomet perceived it difficult without his friendship to accomplish his designs and so resolved to court his favor by the most respectful marks of honor and civility  accordingly he came one day to make a visit to this powerful shepherd attended pompously by a magnificent and numerous retinue it happened that a daughter of this honest mans was that day married and a splendid entertainment made to feast those many guests who graced her nuptials when the prophet entered he saluted kindly all the company with his most hearty blessing and sat him freely down among the rest pretending great and wondrous satisfaction in their agreeable and pleasant conversation  the first and best effect of wine the merry company a little elevated with the fumes of wine forgot their hatred to the doctrine which he taught and pleased to see him so familiar and respectful grew extremely fond of the impostors person shaking him by the hand embracing him with fervor and saluting him with kisses on his cheeks and forhead  but business leading him a little farther he began to take his leave and was detained against his will by the uncommon kindness of the shepherd and his family who would by no means suffer him to go till he engaged himself by solemn promise to return again as soon as he had ended what small business he was then to go about he went and finished in an hour or two the utmost of his task and made all have imaginable to be there again imputing the excess of their civilities to the virtue of the wine they drank so plentifully which he therefore blessed with often repeated orders to his numerous disciples that they should thenceforth drink a double quantity of that celestial liquor whose effects produced such peaceable engagements and had power to change the sharpest hatred into love and make a friend of a professed and open enemy  the last and worst effect thereof but when he came again among them he perceived a mighty change in all their humors they were now become entirely drunk and turned the late expressions of their kindness into rude ungoverned and tumultuous violence him whom so lately they addressed with kisses now they curse and strive to murder noise and discord fighting and distraction were the only scenes he had before him and in short with much ado escaped alive from their oppressive injuries  the new effect of this mistaken liquor urged the prophet to a new decree as much against it as the first had been in favor of it for perceiving now it could excite disorder and give birth to broils as well as mirth he changed the sentence he so lately gave and made it an haraum for ever after or abomination not to be encouraged by the children of his people  the turks and persians much divided in religious matters these are the prevailing tenets of the turkish faith but differ widely from the persian doctrine which last nation though the followers of mahomet and his religion do notwithstanding that prefer before him hali his successor and usurper of his empire by the claim of marriage with the prophets daughter who in the end was overthrown and slain by ebubeker omar and osmyn whose opinions are at present followed as believed inspired like mahomet himself by all the turks depending on the government of the grand signior but as for persia she adheres entirely to the thoughts of hali and esteems him not inferior even to their famed impostor  these dissenting notions and increasing differences in opinion have at last so far extended their pernicious influences that from small and gradual breaches they are now burst out to open hatred of each others persons complaining mutually that either side has added to or taken from the substance of their alcoran as has been most agreeable to their respective interests and the promotion of their own opinions  nay to such unbounded madness does their hate arise that not contented to heap loads of dreadful curses on each others heads they set themselves in every point directly opposite to one another notions the turks remaining censured as schismatical by the adverse exposition of the persian creed and persia stigmatisd for wilful heresy in more than seventy places of the turkish alcoran  a rude and barbarous proof of disrespect thus will the turks revile that hali whom the persians own as their infallible director and the persians in return to mock the objects of the turkish worship raise in sugar at their marriage feasts the figures of the three respected friends of mahomet viz ebubeker omar and the forenamd osmyn when growing merry in their drunken cups the bridegroom and his fellows draw their scymetars and with a spightful scoff and noisy mockery first cut them down from top to bottom and then proceed to melt the numerous pieces as a means to sweeten their sherbets and other liquors  it is from a natural aversion that the favorite color green which by the turks is only worn about the head and noblest parts is by the persians chosen to make their breeches shoes or drawers and employed continually in all the most indecent disrespectful uses which a man can possibly invent to put it to  several differences between the turkish and the persian tenets the turks esteem it necessary to resort in frequent numbers to the public mosques to pray conjointly for the grace of god and blessing of their prophet but the persians hold it only needful to convene at churches in a full assembly there to make an open declaration of their fixed belief without the duty of a general prayer to heaven for mercy  the persians never shave the hair upon their upper lip but cut and trim the beard upon their chin according to the various forms their several fancies lead em to make choice of whereas the turks preserve with care a very long and spreading beard esteeming the deficiency of that respected ornament a shameful mark of servile slavery  swinesflesh and the use of wine denied the turks with strictest prohibition are by the persians practiced with a fond indulgence nor do the last distinguish meats by clean and unclean but enjoy promiscuously the common gifts of natures liberality  the persians when they wash their feet before they pray do seldom more than stroke the outward part with their right hand just dipped in water and hold it a superfluous ceremony to rub hard as if they washed away the dirt which last the turks believe a duty of assured and indispensible necessity  a number more of suchlike opposite and contradictory opinions divide the faith and interests of these powerful neighbors who invent a yearly store of black invectives to attack alternately each others doctrine amongst which curses none are more surprising odd and comical than these which follow  the curses common between the turks and persians may your fatigued and hated soul find no more rest when damned to purgatory than a christian s hat enjoys on earth by this i guess they meant to ridicule our european custom of saluting oneanother with our heads uncovered may your transmuted soul become in hell an hackney ass for even the jews themselves to ride about on these and many others needless to insert are fashionable curses and in frequent use among the hotbrained zealots of each adverse party  thus have i at large set down the most material articles of turkish faith which if the reader looks upon as gross absurd and void of reason let him direct his praise to that great being whose enlightning rays of mercy and compassion have inspired his soul to steer aright and miss the stormy seas of pride and ignorance  yet this the turks agree upon with us that though they differ in their notions of the godhead yet they own one great supreme and sacred being to whose unlimited and mighty power the earth mankind and all things else owe their existence and it is observable that though most nations vary in their opinions yet they own conjointly one superior essence as is observed ingeniously by lactantius in the following expressions all people under different notions own one god omnivm sententia quamvis sit incerta ebdem tamen spectat ut providentiam unam esse consentiant sive enim natura sive ether sive ratio sive mens sive fatalis necessitas sive divina lex idem est quod a nobis dicitur devs  the opinions of all men though never so uncertain tend directly to one common center and agree unanimously upon one conspicuous providence which is that be it nature light reason understanding destined fate or the divine decree it is still the same with that which we distinguish by the name of god  chap vii of the ceremonies of the turkish religion the many inconveniences of turkish superstition a strict adherence to the dangerous tenets which compose the foregoing chapter have exposed the turks to constant troubles that strange inhumane tyranny and barbarous violence with which their haughty arms have crushed the christians have obliged whole nations to become their enemies the rash and inconsiderate doctrine of predestined fortune has exposed their lives by an imprudent and unnecessary scorn of danger from the fatal influences of contagious pestilence their false belief of a sublime reward for death in battle has excited thousands of their bravest soldiers to forget the charms of life and liberty and run directly on the mouths of cannons  yet though they see these many inconveniences and have doubtless some amongst them who have now discovered the fallacious principles of their impure religion they persist with obstinacy in the strictest practice of its weakest precepts like those whom marius victor censures sharply in the following verses nil hosts nil dira fames nil denique morbi egerunt fuimus qui nunc sumus ijsque periclis tentati nihilo meliores reddimur unquam sub vitijs nullo culparum fine manentes in vain dire hunger foes and sickness strove the fixed intention of our souls to move what once we were we strongly still remain and the same snares once felt now fell again no length of time can our stiff natures bend we live midst showers of vice and sin that knows no end   the danger of entering a turkish mosque the superstitious ceremonies of the turkish nation are as numberless as they appear extravagant nor is it easy to obtain admittance where we may become eyewitnesses of their devout retirements for so severely do they guard their public mosques from christian observation that should an heedless and unwary stranger set his foot within their gates at certain seasons of extraordinary devotion he would be seized immediately by watchful officers and hurried headlong to a partial magistrate whose harsh decree admits no bail nor any other means of liberty than becoming instantly a member of their faith by publicly renouncing the divinity of christ and owning mahomet a greater prophet which they must attest by the commanded seal of instant circumcision a severe and barbarous custom but must surely be submitted to unless the person so surpised will die a martyr to the christian faith and bravely spurn with just contempt the proffered doctrine of their vile impostor  and now since i have spoken of the circumcision used amongst the turks it will not be improper to begin with that in the description of their ceremonies and acquaint my reader with the form whereby they put that act in execution  they are not by the precepts of their alcoran obliged to circumcise their children as a point of duty but continue to observe that ancient practice from the custom of arabia long before the time of mahomet and use it now as an undoubted mark whereby they stamp the faith of mussulman on tender infancy  the manner of circumcising infants in turkey the act of circumcision is performed by surgeons when the child has reached the age of seven years and is supposed sufficiently capacitated to profess his inclination to become a mussulman at which time all his friends relations schoolfellows etc are invited to a feast and entertained as splendidly as their various qualities may be thought to merit then the boy is brought amongst em and demanded whether he approves of the intended ceremony his assent is given by the lifting up his finger and himself extended on a table where the surgeon strait performs his office and having thrown the skin upon a chasingdish of coals he baths the wound in salt and water after this his head is shaved to one small lock whereas before he wore his hair disheveled and untouched by razor this done they put him on a large white turbant and from that time forward he becomes a member of the turkish faith  their circumcision of a full grown convert when any christian ripe in years becomes a turk and will apostatize to base and sinful superstition he is led in triumph on a stately horse through all the great and noted streets to some considerable mosque or temple holding in his hand an elevated javelin the point whereof he frequently affixes to his perjured breast a silent declaration of his will to die for that religion he has then embraced the zealous turks who pass along bestow their various presents on the shameful wretch with very large and bounteous liberality and being circumcised in public state he is attended back with great solemnity receiving constantly some means of livelihood by pension from the court or such preferment in their sea or land affairs as his profession whilst a christian speaks him sit for  sacrifices what and how made in turkey they have at public times like those of circumcision certain sacrifices yet not such as formerly were used as duties of religion but are commonly the flesh of sheep or lambs the heart cut out and burnt in fire while the beast divided is distributed with care among the poor and indigent about the neighborhood  a strange uncommon fatal accident fell out about the year   0  when i resided with his excellency the right honorable the lord paget then ambassador extraordinary at constantinople mediator and plenipotentiary at the treaty of carlowitz whose truly great and noble services have left behind him an immortal character to the interest and honor of the british nation and the admiration of the turkish empire  a most unhappy story of the total ruin of a turkish family there was a turk who lived in the abovenamd city not extremly rich but moderately stored with easy plenty he had a wife so tenderly beloved and gratefully returning a reciprocal affection that he would not use the freedom of his country in regard to tolerated and indulged polygamy but confined the treasure of his honest love to the endearing center of his first wifes bosom he had two children by his favorite consort one was then four years of age the other lay a speechless infant in its easy cradle when his fruitful wife became delivered of a burden which declared him father of a third and hopeful son  the common custom of a grateful sacrifice on such occasions led him to prepare a splendid feast and summon all his near relations to be witnesses of his exceeding joy for this new blessing they met together in an open court and after several usual forms proceeded to the place where many sheep were killed to give the poor the person who performed the ceremony cutting the throat with a large knife peculiar to that office and departing with the company to have the sheep divided in another place more fit for such an action  a strange curiosity of a turkish infant there was a window opened from the room where the childbed woman with her newborn infant lay upon a saffrai elsewhere spoken of at the lettice of this window stood the eldest son and saw with pleasure the performance of the ceremony he was much diverted to behold the blood of the expiring sheep run trickling from their throats and taking notice that the knife wherewith twas done was left behind by chance or negligence and that the people who attended him were some gone down to see the sacrifice and those above intently busied by his mothers mattress he endeavored slyly to escape discovery and stole away without so much as being any ways observed by those about him  he was no sooner out of sight but he descended by a case of marble steps directly to the place where lay the knife yet red and reaking with the blood of those poor beasts whose bleating innocence it had so lately sacrificed  he took it up and hiding it with all imaginable cunning underneath his vest returned as slyly as he could and entered the appartment he so lately left as unperceived as he had just before departed from it  a murder innocently committed in a low capacious cradle near the place where then the mother lay his second brother not above a twelvemonth old was sleeping calmly and secure from any fear by yetunbroken rest and native innocence to him the poor unhappy boy immediately repaired and little thinking what he was about began to practice on his tender throat the method he observed the man to use in butchering the sheep designed for sacrifice the waking child began to cry as quickly sensible it felt some pain while still the boy continued his endeavors drawing up and down like some small saw the fatal knife and laughing heartily to see the blood distain the clothes wherein his brother lay who struggling to the utmost of his little strength the other to maintain the sport which so delighted him endeavored hard to keep him down and leaning forward with too great a weight oerturnd the cradle and the infant in it  a melancholy consequence thereof the mother whom the cries of the assaulted babe had just then led to look that way beheld her son come tumbling out all stained with blood and wounded horribly the strange surprise of such a shocking prospect drew her to forget her weak condition so that rising hastily she staggered inconsiderately on the newborn child and treading on its neck became its murderer  the third effect of an unlucky accident the guilty son perceiving by the shrieks and postures of his mother that he had someway or other done amiss threw down the knife and running from her presence to avoid the danger of a dreaded punishment fell down the high and slippery marble steps and broke his neck by that unhappy accident  the mother followed to the fatal place and swooning at the sight was carried back to the unlucky chamber but the overstraind attempt she had so lately made beyond the strength of her reduced condition so disordered all her body that unable long to bear the burdens of her grief and weakness she died herself some few days after  the miserable end of an unhappy master of a turkish family the wretched master of this miserable family survived not long the melancholy loss of so endeared a consort and such hopeful children but became thenceforth abandoned over to a mournful solitude nor could the oftrepeated efforts of his dearest friends procure him comfort so that wholly losing all the taste of mortal pleasures he began to languish more and more and ever one year was fully past quite broke his heart with weighty sorrow and completed dismally the last sad scene of such a fatal and surprising tragedy  i have informed my reader in the foregoing chapter that the five notorious and essential points required by mahomet from all his followers are frequent washings prayers and fasting one whole month the giving alms proportionable to their substance and performing ever they die one pilgrimage to mecca  i shall distinctly treat of all these duties in their several proper and respective places and as their washing is a previous ceremony to the other four it will be requisite i should begin with an account of that  two sorts of washings now in use among the turks it is divided into two distinct formalities the public washing in their baths or bagnios and the private washing in whatever place their inclinations or their business find em  the turks descended from the race of esau now though their prophet has expressly ordered in the lessons of his alcoran that every turk shall often wash declaring cleanliness a valuable part of his enjoined religion yet the custom is of more antiquity than he by many ages for the turks derive it from the days of esau whose posterity they boast themselves to be descended from and therefore claim the name of ishmaelites but though the ancient institution of these washings owed its being to the wholesome practice of a cleanly people and was never meant a sacred ceremony yet the fixed decree of their adored impostor has inclined the turks to such a strange opinion of its efficacious virtues that they now believe the water they make use of not alone sufficient for the cleansing all the outward parts of their polluted bodies but of sovereign power to wash away their sins and free from guilt the most internal passages of their impurest souls  private bagnios in great mens houses we may divide their bagnios into two sorts the first are such as rich and noted persons build in some convenient part of their own houses where their wives themselves and all their servants bathe conveniently in different divisions as often as their duty inclination or their leisure from employment urge em to it  the public baths and reason why so cheaply accommodated in them the second sort of bagnios are those public places where for payment of a penny or threehalfpence they are washed politely and supplied with linen or whatever else the bath requires by the diligent attendance of appropriated servants the reason why they are so cheaply served is owing to the great revenues left to bagnios by deceased mahometans who amongst the other dictates of their morality hold it as a very meritorious deed to build a public bagnio hospital or other place of entertainment for benighted travelers and endow the same with an extensive liberality  men denied entrance while the women bathe these public baths are very common in their largest cities and receive at several hours prodigious numbers of either sex and every quality for whose distinct and separate accommodation they afford divided and particular conveniences when women bathe a large and ivoryheaded indian cane is placed against the door that opens from the street and no man dares on pain of death at such a time as that claim entrance  the law of mahomet obliges every turk to bathe his body when he has caressed a woman and the ladies are obliged to do the same so that every morning when they rise the first employment of the day is washing in the bagnio where they are not only cleansd with water but perfumed and dried with scented linen hair how taken off without the razor the heads of men are daily shaved and men and women are alike enjoined to leave no hair on any other part in order to obey which firm decree the meaner sort make use of a compounded substance made of earth from certain islands of the archipelago and neatly mixed with lime and drugs of proper virtues this they beat to powder and applying it to any hair they would remove it takes it off as clean as possible  but as the frequent use of the abovenamd powder is of dangerous consequence if suffered to continue but a moment longer than the falling of the hair some use pincers the more polite and fashionable ladies rather choose to use the help of pincers and irradicate it swiftly by a twitching violence others shaved by waiting maids yet this is only done by such as would distinguish all their actions from the customary practices of other people for the generality of turkish ladies caring little for the pain of using pincers and unwilling to descend to vulgar methods constantly appoint some favorite waitingmaid to play the barber and perform that office with a sharpedgd razor    st sort of private washing when practiced the other sort of washing is divided likewise into two distinct performances the first is practiced after having made the necessary evacuations required by nature and to this they use the three last fingers of the left hand on this account the turks of note have cocks of water running into marble basins in their several privies and the meaner sort of men among them never go to suchlike places without an earthen pot of water formed commodiously with a narrow spout which serves their use on all occasions  second sort when practiced the second sort of this last washing is in order to their prayers for which sole end a numerous quantity of brazen cocks supply large cisterns placed in order at the entrance of their churches here they wash by way of preparation first their arms hands head neck teeth and forehead thence proceed in summer weather to their naked feet but if the time be cold and rigid it is enough to make an outward motion and the will is taken for the duty of the action  the several hours wherein the turks are obliged to pray next come their prayers and those at least five times a day the overzealous bigots to their falls belief pray always seven but the common times enjoined by mahomet are just before sunrising just at noon betwixt noonday and setting of the sun exactly at sunsett and last of all two hours after  their forms of prayer by whom invented their forms of prayer consist of sentences collected here and there from several chapters of the alcoran some few whereof were left by mahomet but many more compiled by his successors ebubeker omar osmyn and hali and most men now of good capacities compose their prayers according to the pressures of their several occasions they praise therein the mercy bounty and divine omnipotence of the almighty author of our earthly beings petition heaven for the constant welfare of their sultan and his empire and conclude inhumanely with numerous curses on the christian world  the reader will be better able to perceive their manner by the following copy of a janissaries form of prayer who was appointed by the general of that order to be one amongst a constant guard which kept the gate belonging to the british ambassador at constantinople the prayer of a turkish janisary in gods great name in gods great name and in the holy name of mahomet his mighty good and only prophet god is great my god is one i shall be happy and successful while i trust in him may my sword be broken and my head become the drinking cup of infidels when i forget his glory let my prince live long and flourish like the cypress let my order be unnumbered as the sands of the sea shore that we may well defend him and let his lands become as large and unresisted as the boundless ocean let the cursed infidels be damned for ever since they dare o mahomet oppose thy precepts let the meanest slave within the territories of my dread sovereign put his foot before it is washed upon the neck of that proud king amongst their people who once blasphemes the holy prophet let the infidel i guard be safe whilst under my protection but let all others perish quickly or enlarge the bounds of thy religion god is great god is one and mahomet his only prophet  their postures when they pray when they resolve to pray in any mosque they leave their slippers at the entrance of the place when they pray they turn their faces to the east because their prophet lies entombed that way then standing for some time upright and silent with their arms a cross in serious contemplation on the duty they are summoned to they elevate their eyes and mutter to themselves some pious sentence after which they sit down cross legged with their hands before em and repeating slowly several short ejaculations at the end of each bend forward to the earth and touch it with their foreheads some will kiss the ground in pure acknowledgement of their submissive natures this they do for several minutes looking now and then behind em over either shoulder for they think their prophet when he comes will suddenly appear behind some mussulman devoutly praying  their fixed attention in the act of prayer they pray with fervor and a fixed attention never turning like too many inconsiderate christians in our noisy churches to behold what people pass behind them all is still and softly sacred no man mutters prayers of course and gapes the while to see about him how his neighbors clothes are fashioned no loud indecent whispers interrupt devotion to inform some busy irreligious asker who addresses such a lady and how much such a woman brought her husband no opening pews and shutting them again disturb the congregation with their needless clamor no holytalking and conceited hypocrite outruns the parson with her zealous lips while her lewd eyes behind a fan are laughing heartily at some poor jest her ears have listened to no turndup eyelids seem to speak her thoughts on heaven while a wrymouth or scornful turn of her affected nostrils declare her observation running over the faults or ill contrivance of her neighbors pettycoat a turkish mosque is free from noise and all within it so sedately bent on what they do that it is a matter of sufficient wonder to behold so many met together in so deep a stillness a pious nicety and indeed so very sacred do the turks esteem the act of prayer that if the casual sting of some small gnat the scratching of their heads or any other common accident but chance to interrupt them they begin again though almost ended thinking such prevented prayers of no effect or virtue whatsoever but neglected as unworthy the great ear of heaven  preaching how practiced in turkey a small and unadorned erected pillar bears a case not much unlike a pulpit whence the priests sometimes direct a monitory sermon to the listening congregation consisting generally of explanatory sentences on the mysterious chapters of their honored alcoran with proper applications to the numerous audience the book is held in reverence to its author almost even with the readers eyes and certain grave religious songs are intermixed with their devotion which being ended every man begins to stroke his beard and uttering short and private praises to his god and prophet takes his leave and goes away with an extraordinary satisfaction  beads how used among the turks they use a sort of beads not much unlike the rosarys of roman catholics but to an end extremely different for whereas the latter make those trifles guides of devotion men in turkey only bear em in their hands and tell em over while they want some other exercise the beads consisting generally of a scented past agreeably perfuming all who touch them i mention these because some heedless travelers observing them in common use among the turks mistook the cause and never searching into their design have confidently spread a noted falsehood on the fixed authority of their afformd experience  no business must excuse the turks from prayer such turks as at the common hours of prayer are on the road or so employed as not to find convenience to attend the mosques are still obliged to execute that duty nor are ever known to fail whatever business they are then about but pray immediately when the hour alarms them in that very place they chance to stand on insomuch that when a janisary whom you hire to guard you up and down the city hears the notice which is given em from their steeples he will turn about stand still and beckon with his hand to tell his charge he must have patience for a while when taking out his handkerchief he spreads it on the ground sits crosslegd thereupon and says his prayers though in the open market which having ended he leaps briskly up salutes the person whom he undertook to convoy and renews his journey with the mild expression of ghell johnnum ghell or come dear follow me  the creation of a turkish yemaum or parish priest the turks are summoned at the hours of prayer by the repeated acclamations of their yemaums or parish priests a people chosen to their offices by the recommendatory letters of their best parishioners to the vizier azem if near the metropolitan or if in places far remote to the bashaw of the respective provinces where such vacancies may chance to happen by him they are examined for the turks admit of no such thing as spiritual authority and if found qualified to read the alcoran and to have practiced an austere and rigid life they are confirmed by virtue of a sigil in the sought possession of a vacant priesthood  how the turks are called to prayers these call as i have said above the turks to prayers by mounting to the steeple tops of their high mosques where straining to a vast degree the shrillness of their voice they often repeat that god is one and mahomet his prophet by constant practice of this ancient custom some attain a great perfection and stopping with their fingers both their ears will raise their voices to so high a pitch that it amazes strangers when they hear them crying  bells not allowed in turkish churches by this contrivance they supply the want of bells not tolerated in the turkish churches the reason of their prohibition the cause whereof some travelers ascribe to an unwillingness they have to follow any custom of the christian countries which though they vow a disrespect to our religion and our manners is not altogether the prevailing cause of their forbidding bells throughout their government but as the turks are more inclined to groundless superstition than the christian world there is an ancient prophecy which having long foretold the greatness of their empire in the downfall of the greeks advises them to take a constant care least by the tinkling of a bell the walls of constantinople should be betrayed again and the undreamtof fall of that important place denote the ruin of their whole dominions the words of this feared prophecy translated into english run as follows a turkish prophecy the time shall come when earthquakes shall confound with unresisted shocks a fertile ground when the wide ocean shall be stained with blood and bulwarks float on the portentous flood when smoke and fire shall join to form new rods and mortals ravish thunder from the gods then shall the courage by mean swains possessed lead the bold east to overrun the west the pride of conquest shall adorn the field and the tall cross to the bright crescent yield but ever the growing moon her full attains her waning face shall see her sons in chains in a black hour a fatal bell shall ring sure mark of swift success to a new mounting king   the meaning of the prophecy this prophecy they look upon as verified in the destruction of the grecian empire about the time that gunpowder and the use of cannons was invented the swains who were to lead the east to overthrow the west were successful shepherds who laid the first foundation of their present empire the cross they look upon to signify the empire of the greeks alluding to the banner of constantine the great the waning of the moon before her full they say denotes the ruin of the ottoman family before they have obtained their wish of universal monarchy and their interpretation of the bell i have just now given you  the dress of the yemaums how differing from the rest now though these parish priests are reckoned while they hold the places they obtain amongst the number of the turkish clergy yet are they no ways differently dressed so much as to distinguish them from laymen but in the folding up their turbant which they wear a little larger than the rest they seldom preach or venture to expound in great assemblies the mysterious points of their religion but content themselves with leading people into mosques and the inferior businesses before related and if their posts are taken from them they remain no more as members of the priesthood but betake themselves at pleasure to such different employments amongst the laity as their several educations may have qualified em for the practice of  the sohoigs or preachers of the turks the common preachers in the turkish churches are the sohoigs a sort of men politely bred of eminent perfection both in mind and body versed gentelely in a more than common knowledge of the liberal arts and sciences and sedate professors of the rules of moderation these are most respected by the turks and christians and are really so accomplished in external carriage and the vnfeignd practice of an inward piety that it is not common to behold their fellows even in the most refined and polished parts of wellbred christendom  the muftee the head of their religion is the muftee an officer of the highest dignity as to the respect which all men show him but not extremely powerful in that he is rather looked upon as an undoubted oracle in cases of dispute in justice or divinity than as possessor of a large and personal authority how created his salary and perquisites he is created by the sultans choice who puts him on a rich and splendid vest of sables and confers upon him as his placess due the yearly salary of about two thousand pounds which by the sale of certain benefices in his gift belonging to the royal mosques of constantinople and the frequent presents he receives from foreign ministers and those of turkey is improved to   times as much again  the emirs or kindred of mahomet how respected i may set down amongst the orders of the turks religious the emirs or branches of their prophets family these are so highly valued by all sorts of people that it is present death to lift an hand against their persons they are independent on the common government and subject to some grave and ancient member of their own fraternity they wear a sort of turbant high and stately in bulk not much inferior to a british bushel its color is and must be green for that alone distinguishes their lineage and is worn because it was the color of their prophets standard which a member of their brotherhood must always carry to the war when the grand signior does appear himself in field  the turkish funds for maintenance of their clergy in order to maintain their stately mosques and endless numbers of the priests about em above one third of all the lands within their empire are appointed for the raising sums of money to defray the charges of religious establishments and such prodigious gifts are daily added to the settled income of the lands appropriated for the use of all their royal and inferior churches the yearly revenue of santa sophia that the fixed revenue of that famous mosque distinguished by the ancient name of santa sophia does amount to near one hundred thousand pounds per annum  their priests subservient to the civil magistrates the priests of turkey are not as in christendom subservient to the higher power of superior clergy but every man dependant wholly on the civil magistrates of his respective parish so that having no dispute upon the several privileges of spiritual and temporal authority they mingle mildly in a joint obedience the clergy showing due respect to the unbridled laity and the latter giving daily proofs of a profound and decent veneration to the office of the former which they show sufficiently in that respectfull style wherewith they commonly address them how the turks address their clergy to you the rich and valued mines of eloquence and wisdom bright directors to the paths of god beloved of heaven and children of the prophet the glories of religion and illustrious pillars of unbiased justice may your judgment be increased and joys be doubled etc  the turkish ramazaan or yearly fast of thirty days i now proceed to an account of the beforenamd third injunction of their prophet to the followers of his doctrine and that is to observe a fast one month in twelve this fast they call the ramazann and keep it by the different courses of the moon always falling sooner out each year than other change the season with the month they fast in and oblige em once in thirty years to fast each day of every season  their manner of observing it they keep this fast by strict unbroken abstinence from the first appearance of the morning sun till after sunsett in which religious time it is death to eat or drink or smoke tobacco but when the lights appear upon the steeples of their mosques they lay aside sobriety and bringing out the dainties purposely reserved begin to revel in a loud extravagance turn fast to feasting night to day and dallying with their women loose and wanton spend their their hours in mirth and jollity till some shrill cock invites their sleep by loudly telling them the first appearance of unwelcome morning  travelers and the sick a little favored however travelers or persons indisposed may break the fast of ramazann provided when recovered from their sickness or arrived in safety at their journies end they fast as many days together as they then omitted doing it  the strictness of the duty so strictly do they keep this celebrated fast that in their noted cities officers are sent about from place to place to make their observations on the peoples actions and it has been known that some of their most active sultans have rode incognito about the streets attended at a distance by observant executioners who at the smallest beckon of their masters finger were in constant readiness to strangle or behead whatever persons he had found in actual disobedience to the rules of their religion  the feast of bairamm and manner of its celebration immediately subsequent to the ramazann is that short three days feast they call bairamm not much unlike our easter they have two of these each year the first is introduced by the appearance of the first new moon that closes up the fast and is proclaimed by the discharge of all the cannon round the sultans palace and the airy notes of sprightly music sounding loud from every corner the second is about threescore and ten days further in the year this feast is kept with universal mirth and all the sports which turkish gravity permits the practice of and at this time they visit one another with a nice formality observing from the courtier to the meanest peasant certain punctual and established forms of salutation not inferior to the polished complaisance of christian palaces  zacatt or giving alms how ordered by their doctrine and now i come to treat of their zacatt or fourth injunction of their prophet which is nothing else but giving alms according to the plenty god has blessed em with they are prescribed the several rules of this commanded charity in books the ancient doctors of their law have left behind em the standard rule is to bestow one penny in an hundred of their utmost substance on the public funds for building hospitals maintaining poor and aged people erecting hans or inns upon the road where pilgrims find freecost a threedays entertainment or for any other public good which shall be thought convenient the different principles of the turks discovered in their charity this is the lowest they should give but some are found whose sordid base and avaritious principles incline them meanly to deny their wealth that they may save a poor and inconsiderable portion from the uses they should give it to and others have been known who generously prizing transient riches at their proper worth refuse to hide one numbered penny but on the contrary bestow the fourth or third of all their substance on the needy objects of a pitied poverty  the pilgrimage to meccha fifthly the annual pilgrimage to meccha is enjoined the turks who must from every part of their wide empire once at least before they die perform that journey as a typical expression of their passage from this world to that hereafter many thousands yearly undertake this celebrated pilgrimage referred to the   th chapter but as there is a large account of all the ceremonies of that respected duty in another part of this book i shall say no more in this place but will referr my reader for his further satisfaction to the eight and fortieth chapter treating fully of some strange particulars  friday the turkish sabbath friday as i said before is set apart by the mahometans for their day of rest or sabbath which they keep religiously till the duties of the mosques are fully ended their punishment for breaking it and if in time of their divine service a turk presumes to open shop they nail his ears directly to his counter and expose him to the scoffs of public scorn as one who merits not the name of mussulman  the derveeshes who they are they have a sort of priests amongst em called derveeshes who on these days harrangue the people in the open mosques and turn themselves about in frantic postures to the noisy sound of certain instruments of music till giddy by the frequent rounds they make they fall upon the ground and lying for a while without the smallest motion rise at last with elevated eyes and arms extended telling with a grave and artificial look their gaping audience that while entranced as they beheld they have been taken into heaven and conversed with angels in the fields of glory the cheats they put upon the people in their mosques and so proceed while sheltered by the cloak of deep hypocrisy to tell the people what their own desires would have performed under the prevailing notion that they are all the while pronouncing sacredly the will of heaven  the temperance and longaevity of the derveeshes these priests are most abstemious in their diet and austere in humor rarely speaking but in mosques and never drinking wine or any other liquor than the fountain water whereby secure from those distempers which the ill effects of gluttony and drunkenness make common to luxurious and intemperate appetites they generally live to a prodigious age and serve to prove by undeniable experience the inconsiderate follies of such rich men as hurry headlong to their graves by lewd extravagancies and the constant practice of a loose debauchery on which the following verses in lucans pharsalia are a very eloquent and nice reflection o prodiga rerum luxuries nunquam parvo contenta paratu et quaesitorum terra pelagoque ciborum ambitiosa fames and lautae gloria mensae discite quam parvo liceat producere vitam et quantum natura petat non erigit aegros nobilis ignoto diffusus consule bacchus non auro myrrhaque bibunt sed gurgite puro vita redit satis est populis fluviusque ceresque learn wastful luxury whose dainty care can never be content with lowprizd fare and thou vain hunger whose ambitious taste plows land and sea to furnish fine repast vainglorious folly of a splendid board with farfetched cates and chosen dishes stored learn with how little life may be preserved and how much nature asks ill is he served who strives by strong oldwine his health to raise pressed in some ancient kings forgotten days the hearty poor the wholesome country swain drinks not in gold nor does for myrrh complain bread and the murmuring current of some mead supply his largest wants nor does he dainties need   and indeed it is a very common thing to see in many of those countries subject to the turks both men and women of amazing ages a very odd discovery of a man in bulgaria who had lived to be     years old once i traveled through bulgaria and valachia into germany from adrianople with the right honorable the lord paget then returning from his ten years embassy in the turkish court we pitched our tents about a furlong from a small and inconsiderable village through whose midst a smooth and pleasant river gently glided natural curiosity and the coolness of the day invited me to take a melancholy walk along the green and solitary banks of the delightful current where i was surpised to find a very old and graceful man lie stretched upon the grass and humming to himself the merry remnant of a turkish song  i viewed attentively the wrinkled visage of this ancient man who seemed to have been buried and returned to earth with all the furrows of destructive time engraved upon his forehead but while i wondered at the briskness of his voice he doubled my amazement by his leaping up with such agility of body as became the strength of one in all the vigor of accomplished manhood a cringing method of salutation used in turkey he came toward me bowing with a servile air peculiar to the slavish nature of that conquered nation and endeavored to salute me with a strange humility by the kissing of my vest a cringing custom used in turkey and only proper for the sordid practice of a base submissive and inglorious people  i prevented his design and pleased to see the odd appearance which he made desired him to follow me to yonder camp and i would treat him with a glass of wine a strange instance of mirth in old age he seemed transported when he saw the tents and running on before me a considerable way with awkward steps as if he aimed at something like a dance he threw his arms and feet about him at a merry rate and with a very brisk and laughing countenance repeated in a sort of tuneless ballad several verses to the following purpose wine makes old men young again ay marry and women too wine cures sorrow takes off pain and former joys can soon renew   the odd account he gave of himself i brought him to the camp where having eat roast beef and drank above a quart of strong red wine we asked him where he lived how old he was and many other such like questions he returned for answer that he knew no more than that he was about thirty years of age when the village where he lived was burned to ashes that his childrens children he thanked god were dead and he had nothing left upon his care but his old brisk and honest person and so began to sing and dance again as he had done before  by this time several of the country people who came out to look upon the tents where gathered round him and informed us that his family had lived above two hundred years as farmers in that neighborhood that he had long outlived the period of his race extinct near fourteen years before by the death of two of his great grandsons men fullgrown that he was now maintained by charitable contributions of the houses in the village and that he was by punctual calculation from the burning of the place computed then arrived at the surprising age of one hundred sixty and two years  teeth three times changed he could eat the toughest meat without the smallest trouble leap about without a staff and having changed his teeth three several times the set he had were wholly sound and white as ivory nor was he then in seeming danger of approaching death but may perhaps be now alive as healthful and untouched by those infirmities peculiar to old age as when he was an infant  chap viii of the several sects into which they are divided frequent changes in religion a certain proof of humane imperfection amongst the numerous imperfections which attend mortality there is none can better serve to prove the frailties of our human nature than that diffusive levity which does so often change the notions of mankind in matters of religion to day we strongly fix our resolutions to defend the creed we now profess with lives and fortunes nay so warmly struggle to promote its doctrine that we scarce avoid the guilt of persecution to enlarge its limits yet to morrow shakes the pillars of our faith and leads us headlong to a blind extravagance in joining vigorously with some new sect to undermine clandestinely the mocked foundations of our forsaken church and on her ruins raise the columns of some new opinion and prevailing heresy  interest the common cause of new opinions and if we guide our judgment by a contemplative view of those great turns to which the ancient or the modern changes in religion owed their introduction the pricks of conscience will be rarely found the real causes of those numerous innovations persuasive interest is still the motive that excites our actions to our own advantage man is naturally prone to love himself and will embrace such tenets as do best agree with his desired convenience or sooth most favorably the gross accomplishment of his licentious inclinations and when the tempting call of such a doctrine summons his adherence nature urges him to quit a faith more rigid and severe and make himself a member of such new profession as enlarges him to practice free from censure the unbounded pleasures of a welcome liberty  men are naturally led to quit the weakest party thus every age produces new and various heresies nor can the meanest doctrine want its proselytes if vented at a time when foreign wars or civil discords shake the pillars of that faith it must oppose for men of small and undiscerning judgments will be proud of owning in its shining grandeur a religion they will quit with scorn and indignation when too weak to grant its persecuted sons a claimed protection and as a palliating excuse for their abhorred apostasy can only say with ovid tempora mutantur and nos mutamur in illis the times are changed and we are changed with time   the means whereby mahometanism gaind success twas by these means mahometanism invading asia at a time when wars and tumults schisms and heresy and all the plagues of fatal discord rent the kingdoms of the christian world with dire divisions met a swift and strange success perhaps beyond the very hopes or wishes of the black impostor  the cause of the variety of sects among the turks but as all men let them change as much as possible their natures and religion must notwithstanding still retain some scattered notions of their former customs and perhaps a sort of native fondness for their ancient practices so the prodigious body of the turkish church promiscuously receiving different nations to compose its grandeur is thereby divided into full as many sects and different opinions as a mixed confusion of mahometanism in its own divisions with the broken remnants of so many hundred several sorts of worship could produce amongst them  above an hundred different opinions now professed in turkey there are at present near an hundred noted sects among the turks who disagree in very wide contrarieties of opinion and many more whose unsupported follies sinking daily by their want of learning to defend their tenets are not worth a strangers observation nor esteemed enough considerable by the turks themselves to claim a place in their religious lists  to treat distinctly of the various sects that now divide them would require more room than can be spared from matters more material and diverting and afford the reader small delight and less improvement i will therefore mention but the heads of some prevailing tenets and proceed to what will entertain the curious with a more uncommon and agreeable amusement  a sort of turks who own our savior for the son of god and first in due respect to the eternal glories and immense compassion of our blessed savior i must with zealous wishes for the great improvement of a happy prospect mention an opinion long since formed in several parts of the grand signiors country and of late increased to such a strength that thousands of his subjects openly avow it in despite of danger  the tenets of the sect abovementioned the professors of the doctrine taught by this opinion are distinguished by the name of choopmassiahee or dreamers of messiah these declare that christ was god is now in heaven and shall come to judgment far superior to their prophet or his followers to prove the truth of this opposed assertion they produce the words of mahomet himself by a quotation from their alcoran where it is said thine eyes o mahomet shall see thy lord return in glory they are generally men of clear capacities and exquisite dexterity in management of business and by the sacred notions they retain of the divinity of jesus appear not widely separated from the pale of his religion some have gone so far in their enlightened preference of christ to mahomet that they have fallen martyrs to an unripe faith and even in death maintained their principles  the barbarous and inhumane doctrine of the morgee another sect entitled morgee hold with obstinacy that all the followers of true mahometanism must necessarily attain the most sublime and heightened joys of their transporting paradise though while on earth they lived in endless wickedness but on the contrary affirm that any who deny their prophet though they have led a sober virtuous truly exemplary and unspotted life will find it yet impossible to be admitted into heaven or indeed to save their souls from tedious scenes of future punishment  the chawargee the chawargee maintain it an absurd and false conclusion to assert that ever god bestowed on man the gift of prophecy or thought it necessary to inspire with boasted knowledge or infalibillity the blessed capacity of any chosen or distinguished mortal they deny the prophetical inspiration of mahomet these allow no more to mahomet than that he was a man whom nature had endowed with great accomplishments and god afforded an enlarged peculiar and uncommon portion of his holy spirit in regard to his unequaled zeal and unaffected piety  the sephatee the sephatee affirm that god possesses endless attributes of power life wisdom truth and justice but extend their notions to such wild extravagance as to conceive his senses built upon the same corporeal organs which compose the fabric of our humane bodies they think he hears smells sees feels tastes and understands as we do here differing from mortals only thus that whereas our bodies are both weak and finite god has framed himself a being strong and infinite this notion they defend or strive to do it from those several passages of holy scripture where the figurative sense of the expression speaks of gods creating eve from adams rib as by the virtue of a manual operation his sitting on a throne repenting often what he had decreed as of the actions of a humane body the grossness of their apprehension they will not be dissuaded from conceiving those expressions in a literal sense and being for the most part men of gross and vulgar apprehensions ascend not to the height of sacred contemplation on the mysterious attributes of the allgreat incomprehensible  a sect among themselves divided into one and thirty different opinions wonderfully various and strangely contradictory to their own assertions are the notions formed of the divine omnipotence by the muhawtazlee a sect divided into one and thirty several interpretations of that controverted tenet which divides them from the rest and that is god is holy and eternal by the virtue of his essence yet refuse to own him eternal by his eternity knowing by his knowledge or merciful by his mercy their surprising caution and fantastic notion of almighty god proceeds from their aversion to the doctrine of a trinity so that to avoid a multiplication of the divine power they run themselves to strange abstruse and incoherent dreams of something which they would conceive but cannot  a sect who wait the coming of another prophet another sect called zeidee believe that long before the world shall end a persian prophet shall be sent by god to disannul the laws of mahomet and teach a new and surer way to joys hereafter  a blasphemous opinion jabhaiah are a sort of people who affirm that god created man the world and all his labors by mere chance and accident denying his omniscience and believing that he improves like men by practice and experience  two sects directly opposite maalvmgee and meizhachullha are sects directly opposite to one another the first affirming god is to be known on earth by the knowledge of our selves and the last maintaining it impossible either in the present world or that to come to know him otherwise than by a faint perception of his rays of glory  a stoical and melancholy sort of people kaadezadeeli are a stoical and melancholy sect who practice strange and superstitious ceremonies in praying for the dead these men profess a natural aversion to the sound of music and neglect with rigid and austere disdain the cheerful use of mirth and pleasure they sit whole days and nights alone still bending forwards and repeating with a doleful and desponding accent the respected name of the supreme almighty  idolaters among the turks there is a certain sect called sabbin tending strongly to adore idolatrously the sun and moon from the conspicuous influences they are found to have on things below  a sect among the turks who allow the trinity another sort of men called escrakee allow the trinity as a number springing from the unity of god this sect are blessed with a platonic contemplation on the great idea of divine omnipotence and discerning plainly all the gross and sordid falsehoods of the turkish alcoran reject the notions built upon its fabric and support their arguments upon the surer principles of humane reason  a sort of men professors of an exemplary modesty the hairhetwee diffide so much in natures strength and humane understanding that they think it sin to contradict the weakest argument preferred against them affirming that our frail capacities can never represent a true idea of a being so superior to us these men behave themselves with an accomplished modesty give no offense to man or beast but when a question is proposed for their desired solution return this answer allah belerr ammah ben yoketer god knows all but i am ignorant  a sect who hold the transmigration of souls but more diverting and extraordinary will appear the munasahee or pythagorical opinion which maintains with violence the old metempsychosis or the transmigration of our humane souls to this assertion are inclined the ablest physicians of the turkish empire and it is a matter worth the readers patience to reflect a little on the oddness of their notions as to this particular  they hold that when a man departs this life his soul shall enter in that very moment the appointed body of some certain beast whose nature did in life the most resemble the prevailing genius of the late deceased thus for example the undaunted soul of some brave warrior shall be sent to animate the lion the cowards soul shall dwell at rest within the hare the generous shall possess the horses body and the goat contain the soul of the lascivious the camel much respected among the turks but as a blessing most desired and the sublimest happiness they can attain in death the pious grave religious and contented man shall see his soul inform the camel a beast of every other most respected by the fond mahometans  a very strange opinion thus cased and fettered shall the souls of mortals wander in the course of a refining pilgrimage for the full space of three thousand and five hundred years still growing more and more polite and glorious till the longest date of their enjoined peregrination once expired they return again to some bright part of undiscovered earth where free from those unnumberd and insulting imperfections which attend mortality in its impure and unrefind existence they shall enjoy the choicest of such unimagind blessings as will fit them joyfully for that more bright reception they expect to meet in the transporting mansions of a future glory  there is a story which a very grave and seemingly religious turk would often tell me with repeated vows and serious protestations of the truth of his assertion he was a strict adherer to the doctrine of transmigration and gave the following account of a surprising accident which had obliged him to embrace the articles of that till then despised opinion  a strange relation of a turks conversion to the doctrine abovementioned i was said he about my one and twentieth year of age a violent opposer of the tenets of munasahee or such as hold the pilgrimage of souls  for so it is called among the turks and often used to laugh at the opinion of an elder brother who delighted much in running races and was wonderfully swift of foot on which account he often used to fancy that after death his soul would animate some horse or antelope he died and left me very sorrowful for he deserved my love by frequent kindnesses and triumphed in a more than common share of my sincere affection i often hunted in the neighboring woods and took a great delight in all the practices of rural pastime when on a certain day with several of my acquaintance riding out to seek some sport we roused a stagg of stately size and spreading antlers  strange action of a beast directly contrary to his nature the beastno sooner saw the dogs about him and beheld the company prepared for his destruction but instead of flying from impending danger he came running swiftly toward my horse as if he aimed to overthrow me with his fury  a very odd passage surpised at the advance i saw him making i prepared as well as possible for selfdefence and poizing in my hand a pointed javelin i carried with me was about directing it to wound his breast when o amazing prodigy i saw the dogs begin to tremble and instead of tearing his unhappy limbs lie down and fawn with lolling tongues upon the panting animal who with a timorous have as sadly apprehensive of the threatening weapon reared himself upright upon his hinder feet and with his two fore legs and the expressive motions of his head and eyes made melancholy signs of some important secret which his want of speech denied an utterance  a turk discovers his brothers soul in the body of a stagg methoughts the very moment when this moving posture of the stagg was pleading for compassion i perceived a sudden cold strike through my body and imagined i distinctly heard a murmuring whisper speak these words as softly and serene as if some gentle breath of wind had fanned my temples pity o unthinking man thy brothers soul to whose appointed wandrings the intended death of this poor stagg shall add twelve years of tedious pilgrimage  astonished at the strange and unexpected accident i dropped my javelin from my trembling hand and scarce preserved my self from sinking off my horse by the industrious favors of my friends assistance but while they were busy in endeavoring to recover me again the stagg was gone nor did one dog attempt to follow him  and now continued he you will not wonder that i hold the doctrine you so much oppose for certain truth and undeniable reality my brothers soul by this strange accident converted me and may the will of god direct some chance to lead your judgment first to see the light of mahomet and then the certainty of this sure faith the tenet of his follower  excuse me reader that i have so long detained you on so whimsical a subject nor believe you see this story here inserted from a fond effect of my credulity i tell it to divert you with the turks opinion who had framed hereon a fixed belief of transmigration and imagined by the whisper which he dreamed he heard that such departed souls as dwelt within a beast that happened to be killed or die by accident before its time shall lose entirely all those years they had remained enclosed before such accident and be obliged to wander so much longer through the various stages of their tedious journey  monasteries among the turks by whom ordained monasteries or a sort of cloisters for religious turks of several orders were anciently ordained by mahomets decree in imitation of the convents famous then for exemplary piety and great economy by the religious practices of solitude and sanctity among the christians  muveh lehvee an order of turkish monks of these are held in most esteem muvehlehvee an order silent humble modest and professing charity they wear the coursest dress that can be possibly invented and renounce the world with all its glories fasting every thursday round the year besides the ramazann or public ceremony and neglecting piously all earthly pleasures for the preferable blessings of a future paradise  these monks the most accomplished spies of turkey iconivm is the favored residence of these religious men there dwells the chief or prior of their order and from thence they go like roman missionaries up and down through china persia and the wide dominions of the great mogul striving to convert to turkish superstition every man they can commodiously fall in with and by traveling without the least suspicion into foreign countries become the only able spies of all the sultans vast dominions  not much unlike the capuchines of rome there is no order in the romish church which does so nearly suit the manners habit humor and deportment of these turkish friars as the capuchines and they agree so fully and exactly in their several customs that were it not for staining with the near comparison a christian character these eastern priests and monkmahometans might not improperly be called the capuchines of turkey  nimtulahee another order of the turkish priests they call nimtulahee these have their convents in the city of constantinople weigh their bread by drachms and scruples fast and pray whole days together and avoid the company of all mankind they place no value on the blessings of mortality making frequent use of this grave maxim in their common conversation their pious maxim riches are the vainest trifles we can possibly collect since they so far possess our thoughts that we forget one fatal hour may take us from them and herein they seem to steer the prudent course of a sincere morality believing the natural frailty of our humane bodies undeserving half the pains we take to pamper em and disregarding with a wise disdain those transitory ornaments and fading satisfactions which must perish with the persons of unthinking mortals and here they act agreeable to the notions of the admirable horace in the seventh ode of his fourth book hor l   ode   pulvis and umbra sumus quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina summae tempora dii superi cuncta manus avidas fugient haeredis amico quae dederis animo cum semel occideris and de te splendida minos fecerit arbitria non torquate genus non te facundia non te restituet pietas what are the bodies men so vainly boast but dust and ashes and a fleeting ghost who knows if heaven whose power to day we praise will add one short to morrow to our days vainly fond mortal does thy soul employ her greedy faculties in search of joy for all those blessings thou do now prepare will fly the eager hopes of thy expecting heir when the impartial stroke of certain death shall ravish all thy glories with thy breath when the great judge of heavens unbounded state has sentenced thee to some eternal fate alas my friend where is then thy noble blood what will avail thee there thy earthly good vainly thy eloquence will there implore nor can thy pious life thy finished course restore   edheemi a grave and solitary order another order of the turks religious called edheemi live in woods cells hollow trees and other lonely places converse familiarly with lions tigers and the wildest beasts which haunt the forest if we may believe the members of their own fraternity they have some convents in the eastern parts of the grand turks dominions but will rather choose to live abroad and taste the free uninterrupted pleasures of a constant solitude  santoons a loose and frantic sort of people santoons or holymen a sort of frantic idle and conceited beggars going almost naked with their bodies wounded deep in many places are esteemed among the turks as sacred and inspired by the divine illumination these commit the worst extravagancies under the deceitful cloak of heavenly raptures and are allowed the use of wine and all strong liquors to enable them the better to converse with god and view his glories  fools and madmen valued much among the turks madmen and fools are by the turks esteemed the favorites of heaven they think em taken from their tenements of clay to talk with angels in the upper regions and will therefore beg the blessing of an idiot when they meet him in the streets and bending forward kiss his garment with the most profound and humble veneration  schism more prevalent in turkey than in christendom many other sects and orders are at present found among the turks some of which assert opinions in diametrical opposition to the tenets of the others and divide the doctrine they profess from mahomet into such intestine jarrs and public disagreements that the power of schism in christian churches falls far short of that now found in every province of the turkish empire  the opinions of some diametrically opposite to those of others some profess perpetual chastity and fearing nature will incline em to forget the tenor of their vow will make themselves unable to commit such sin by the preventive virtue of a selfcastration others marry freely in their very convents and enjoy amidst the rigid ceremonies of religious solitude the loosest pleasures and unbounded freedom of allowed polygamy some again must never marry but are made a full amends for that restriction by the liberty they have to hold a free and undisputed conversation with as many concubines as they find means to compass  one common article in which they all agree thus they vary widely from each others practice and only join unanimously in this one common article that it is their duty to oppose with violence the doctrine of christianity hate kill and persecute without compassion all the members of that envied faith till they have rooted from the earth the name of jesus and reduced the nations of the conquered world to worship singly one great god and mahomet his prophet  but the neverfailing mercy of our great protector who prevented hitherto their cursed designs has graciously been pleased to take away all cause of fear from his defended church whose firm foundation he has placed upon a rock nor shall the gates of hell prevail against it  chap ix of the turkish studies and how far learning is encouraged among them learning discountenanced in turkey and the reasons of it learning as inconsistent with the nature of a government wholly founded on the power of the sword receives but small encouragement in any part of the grand signiors empire and as i have said before it is a maxim of his policy to bend the minds of all his subjects to a constant practice of the art of war imagining that when a man relaxes from the love of military toils to the more soft bewitching charms of books and solitude he grows unfit for martial labors and becomes so deeply sunk in pleasing contemplations on the works of nature that he loses by degrees that active vigor which should bravely recommend a daring soldier to the face of danger  learning agreeable to mild and gentle governments rome the ancient and the glorious mistress of the kneeling world has taught the turks by sure experience that learning and the moral dictates of attained philosophy agreeing sympathetically with the noble honest and religious forms of milder governments preserve a peaceful and unshockd tranquillity for men thereby will see the blessings they enjoy in liberty and know to prize their happy freedom dangerous and fatal to an arbitrary monarchy but in governments tyrannical and arbitrary learning like a spurr to horses of a fiery nature only serves to make em feel and hate their servitude exciting warm and dangerous sparks of courage in their breasts whose sure effects produce an eager and undaunted inclination to expose their valued lives and fortunes for redeeming gloriously the ravished charms of liberty and property  rome successful in her pristine ignorance thus while the weak and dubious fate of infant rome obliged her sons to slight all studies but the art of war she triumphed nobly in a vast success and grew in time to such a pitch of pride that she subdued the monarchs of the distant east and raised her emperors to all the power that arbitrary rule and unresisted tyranny could possibly afford them for the constant practice of a military toil made dangers natural to all her people who allured by hopes of fresh success attempted freely any hazard like the men of whom thus lucan in his first book  quos ille timorum maximus haud urget lethi metus inde ruendi in ferrum mens prona viris who fearless even of death fears blackest fright led on by courage swiftly rush to fight over groves of pointed steel   oerturnd and ruined by polite improvements but when the roman conquests had possessed the world and gained the height of universal monarchy the call of war no more alarming their forgotten valor they betook themselves to study arts and sciences and flourished for a while in all the blessings of meridian glory but the dictates of their learning fatally encouraged soon inspired their glowing bosoms with a scorn of slavery and produced such bloody and intestine discords as oerturnd the grandeur of their spreading empire and involved the government in all the miseries of divided ruin  however as it is natural for the working brains of man to fix attentively on some peculiar and selected object how wide soever from the fashionable practice of the times they live in so some are found among the turks whose native curiosity inclines them to the search of what small share of knowledge they can possibly attain from the perusal of those few and trifling books they have among them  the first advance of turkish learning and though for reasons mentioned in the chapter of the turkish policy the art of printing is prohibited among those people it is not likely they should reach so great perfection in the study of philosophy and other dubious parts of learning as the more inlightnd scholars of the christian world yet are not all so meanly ignorant as the generality the person whose ambition leads him to bestow upon some favorite son a costly education generous and particular must first begin like those in christendom and see them taught their a b c or alphabetic knowledge of the turkish language  the knowledge of the alphabet as much as is required in any turkish minister of state nor is the knowledge of their orthographic learning looked upon as here with us like childrens study and the first accomplishment of every mean capacity but on the contrary nothing further is required from such as are elected to the greatest places of the empire than to be qualified to read a chapter in the alcoran and sign with their respective names the written instruments dispatched about from place to place by their authority  scribes or public notaries used much in turkey scarce one in many hundreds of the sultans subjects though they read perhaps indifferently well can write his name or form one single letter of the alphabet so that when any business offers which they would acquaint a friend with who resides at any distance from the towns they live in they must address themselves to certain scribes or public notaries whose peculiar trade it is to write the letters wills or other paper instruments of any such as will employ them  their number in constantinople no less than thirty thousand of these public scribes at present dwell in full employment in the city of constantinople and proportionable numbers are distributed by order of the court to other cities of the empire they are admitted upon full examination by the great vizier or some inferior officer deputed by him they take an oath to keep all secrets no ways tending to the sultans prejudice but discover every little hint that looks like treason hereby it is difficult beyond imagination to maintain a treacherous or illegal correspondence  their several businesses not only letters and the little instruments of private business are dispatched promiscuously by the scribes abovenamd but all the copies of such ancient manuscripts or modern treatises as are in use among them must be frequently transcribed by some of these the art of printing not allowed as i before informed you  the art of writing fair in great perfection with the turks however omne malum habet in se bonum every ill contains some good within its self the scribes of turkey by perpetual practice are become such masters in the art of penmanship that they have pieces common in their meanest houses which for justness of design equality of character and accomplished beauty grace and smoothness cannot be exceeded or indeed matched by the politest writingmasters known in europe  the difficulty of sending letters to any part of the turkish empire since i have had occasion here to speak of letters twill not be digressive from the subject of the chapter to acquaint the reader that in order to prevent the ill effects of treasonable correspondences they permit no settled posts in any part of turkey so that he who would dispatch a letter to a friend though hardly fifty miles asunder is obliged to hire on purpose some courier or proper messenger or must be forced to stay the motion of a caravan or the departure of a certain sort of messagebearers natives of arabia who ramble up and down on foot to every corner of the turkish empire and will carry letters for a large reward to the remotest borders of the turks dominions  the danger of traveling alone very great in turkey the reader will conclude that wanting posts upon the roads must render traveling a vast expense fatigue and hazard and really where a man presumes to trust himself alone or undefended by the power of some respected order he exposes rashly both his fortune and his life to the repeated insults he is sure to meet with from the barbarous wretches he must pass by in his journey  how a man must do to travel safely but the man who knows the custom of the country will be sure to hire a turkish janizary to accompany him by whose protection he will not only be secure from danger but may eat and drink sleep ride or what he pleases free from charge upon the oftinvaded property of the poor enslaved and miserable inhabitants  the second step of turkish learning but to return to what i was about no sooner has the student gained a full and finished knowledge of these earliest rudiments but he proceeds to change his theory to practice and apply himself to study with the utmost care and venerable industry the unnumbred intricacies of their alcoran for to be learned in that is what they all desire with eager emulation as the means whereby they gain the reputation of accomplished scholars and are thoroughly qualified for any post of honor or religion  the great respect the turks show to such as are well versed in the exposition of their alcoran the men who reach perfection or as great an height as can be well attained in this respected study are on all hands sought to by the common people as the oracles of their religion and undoubted solvers of the most abstruse and noted difficulties but more than any other are esteemed a sort of men who by a daily running over the several chapters which compose their alcoran in time commit it to their memories and can repeat in order every sentence of its valued doctrine so that bearing as it were the body of their whole religion within themselves they are esteemed as sacred as the book it self and every where distinguished by such shining privileges as declare how much the turks  o shame of christendom encourage more than we the study of religion  the turkish language rough and beholding to   other dialects the turkish language rough and inharmonious is obliged to the arabian persian and chaldean tongues for all the softness it at present boasts which notwithstanding is so very little and so seldom understood by common people that the turks of late difuse the practice of that borrowed sweetness once the aim of all their nation  italian the only western language studied by the turks of all the noble languages at present spoken by the western world italian is the only favorite among the turks and that being seldom understood beyond the superficial knowledge of a common conversation the latin german spanish french or british dialects are altogether strangers to their learning or affections nor is the grecian tongue that poor unhappy sufferer with her ruined sons so much as sought or any ways esteemed by the illiterate subverters of that lamented nation  but though the native harshness of their own unpolished tongue denis that smooth enchanting eloquence those various tropes and graceful figures which should form the fine and lofty style required in rhetoric the turks of note or lovers of improvement are not void of other means whereby to reach a wished amusement which the barren study of their barbarous language cannot give them  the persian and arabian romances much in vogue among the turks the method then they take to raise their souls to emulative heights of honor and ambition is to study an accomplishment in all the artful turns of persian and arabian oratory whereby they are inspired with lofty thoughts and brave desires of equalling those great and noble actions which they read with wonder in the generous characters of ancient heros celebrated gloriously in the famed romances and ingenious novels numerously scattered up and down in both those languages  the common subjects of the persian stories these novels and romances are composed by certain famous writers who possess a genius fertilely productive of inimitable turns of wit and fancy they consist for the most part of broken remnants of the several histories of worthy men set off to great advantage by the fictitious beauties of their strange additions nor do they want the taking graces and enchanting ornaments which shine so softly through the various subjects of our british french and spanish novels  how they are adorned they boast their knights relieving ladies in distress and slavery their tilting tournaments and amorous courtships their enchanted castles giants monsters dwarfs and squires their delightful meadows murmuring currents shady bowers and groves of myrtle all which are there as frequent and fantastical as in any clelia or cassandra of them all  one kederlee the same with them as st george among the christians amongst the many mighty men of valor and renown whose acts of chivalry they record as miracles they relate prodigious and diverting stories of a certain knight called kederlee who by the actions of his life appears no other than the famed st george that celebrated dragonkiller of the british nation the   beasts which the turks have placed in paradise and so highly do the turks respect the memory of this illustrious champion that in regard of his unequalled and surprising merits they have given his horse a seat in paradise and placed him there in state and glory with the ass whereon our savior rode the dog belonging to the seven sleepers and the favorite camel of their prophet mahomet  the turks unskilled in history as for the delightful and improving knowledge of history the turks are wholly destitute of any means whereby to reach the smallest skill in that engaging study for though they take a constant care to keep exact and punctual records of the rise and progress of their own prodigious empire they are so ignorantly defective in the study of chronology that by the strangely rude and barbarous dictates of received tradition they confound all ages reigns and persons in the mixed disorder of a wild irregularity  a strange opinion of the turks concorning solomon and homer thus they look on solomon and homer to have been two brothers who contended with each other for the bays bestowed upon the most deserving poet and believe that homer having gained the universal plaudit of the judges of those times was envied by his brother solomon and being banished from the court was forced to roam about the world and beg a livelihood from charitable contributions  i know not how it comes to pass but solomon is now the only prince who lives in their traditions and so great a notion have they formed of his extensive power and the splendor of his government that they have listed all the famous monarchs of the ancient world as servants to his grandeur  another of julius caesar job and alexander the great thus is the celebrated julius caesar thought by all the turks to have been admiral of a prodigious fleet of ships belonging to the abovenamd solomon consisting of a thousand and odd hundred sail they say that alexander the great was the illustrious general of his victorious armies and that job so famous for his exemplary patience was the judge of all civil causes of his large dominions  more versed in poetry and why inclined to study it somewhat more refined are their capacities in the art of poetry if that indifferent skill they boast may claim the honor of so high a character for the ambitious sultans of the turkish empire hearing that the works of ancient poets are esteemed in christendom ambition of the turkish sultans and having been informed by runagados what immortal characters have been conferred on former princes by the pens of such as writ harmoniously became inspired with eager wishes that their own great actions might be copied to advantage by some eastern muse and so transmitted with a shining glory to the praises of posterity  the turkish language too rough for poetry this flattering notion of the turkish monarchs caused an eager application of their subjects fancies to the favored study of poetic excellence but the unpolished cadence of their guttural language not allowing them sufficient harmony they make but dull insipid verses unless they tune their muses to the warbling lyre of smooth arabia  the arguments they use in its defense however notwithstanding all the disadvantages they meet in their attempt they still continue to improve their genius in the practice of this study using arguments to prove the use and great necessity of poetic learning not much unlike the thoughts of horace in the following verses vixere fortes ante agamemnona multi sed omnes illacrymabiles vrgentur ignotique longa nocte carent quia vate sacro men brave and valiant lived before those days wherein famed agamemnon gained his praise yet does a dark oblivion shroud their fames and nights black mists efface their glorious names unknown and unlamented dead they lie while deeds of later heros never die hence springs the cause the first no poets praise the last outlive their death in bards immortal lays   the study of poetry why opposed by certain rigid sects strongly notwithstanding are these great encouragers of poetry opposed by certain sects of grave morose and rigid principles who raise objections to the study from the many false and contradictory assertions of the greatest poets the reasons which they give for their dislike of poetry which besides the scandal they affirm it must infallibly create to their unstained and holy doctrine has another ill effect which is so painting over all the vices of a man or nation and so satyrically detracting from their envied virtues that posterity will be obliged to read a mixed account of truth and falsehood without the smallest possibility of distinguishing with certainty between the one and the other and herein they seem to blame such noted fictions as those for which ausonius censures virgil in the following verses on the statue of queen dido as i remember in the    th epigram auson epig     illa ego sum dido vultu quam conspicis hospes assimulata modis pulchraque mirificis talis eram sed non maro quam mihi finxit erat mens vita nec incestis laeta cupidinibus namque nec aeneas vidit me troius unquam nec libyam advenit classibus iliacis sed furias fugiens atque arma procacis iarbae servavi fateor morte pudicitiam pectore transfixo castos quod pertulit enses non furor aut laeso crudus amore dolor sic cecidisse juvat vixi sine vulnere famae vlta virum positis moenibus oppetii invida cur in me stimulasti musa maronem fingeret ut nostrae damna pudicitiae vos magis historicis lectores credit de me quam qui furta deum concubitusque canunt falsidici vates temerant qui carmine verum humanisque deos assimulant vitiis the epigram in english i am that didos image kind and fair whose form thou see here carved with artful air such was my body but my soul never knew the crimes which virgil made my story do nor was my life debauched by loose desires nor burnt my honor in incestuous fires never did famed aeneas see my face nor land his trojan squadrons in this place flying the rage of proud iarbas will to save my valued fame i chose my self to kill nor was it madness made my bosom bleed but chaste and weighty grief that urged me to the deed thus did i fall unwounded in my fame my consorts wrongs revenged and all my shame and built a stately town to celebrate my name but why malicious muse did thou inspire erroneous virgil with a strange desire to heap a feigned dishonor on my name and sell my modesty to raise his fame learn all from me credit historians more than those who never will give their fables over but daringly expose to public view the secret acts of love which jove is pleased to do poets are liars and for love of rhymes will make the gods themselves partake of human crimes   the manner of making turkish verse the turkish poetry consists of certain short and broken measures chained most commonly to double rhymes that so that jingle of the numbers may atone as much as possible for the unpleasant roughness of the cadence they confine their muses for the most part to low and doggrel balads or the whining composition of some amorous pastoral yet some few are sound among them of a very brisk and sprightly wit who will on weddings victories or other such occasions exert their faculties in forming something like a panegyric epithalamium ode or witty anagram and having done their utmost with design to please the patrons they address receive a present equal to the merit of the work or rather given according to the generous or avaritious temper of the person they have complimented  examples are the surest means of teaching any thing but examples will be most diverting and inform the reader more exactly of their peculiar taste of several sorts of poetry i therefore now proceed to come as near as i can trace their language to some remarkable and celebrated turns of turkish wit whereby the authors gained a great and lasting reputation  a pleasant story of a turk who hired poets to make verses on his wedding there was a noted turk who lived in constantinople and had lately gained the parents approbation of a certain lady young and beautiful they were married and their nuptials celebrated with a splendor equal to their fortunes which were great and plentiful the sports performed on such occasions drew the observation of all sorts of people who were treated and caressed with wonderful civility among the rest unwilling to omit the smallest point of lofty liberality the joyful bridegroom sent an invitation to the most esteemed and brightest poets of the city assuring them they should receive an hearty welcome and to tempt the trial of their utmost skill informed em he designed a good reward for him who made the finest verses in congratulation of his marriage  the poets feasted by the bridegroom the summoned bards appeared immediately and having feasted plentifully on the bridegrooms entertainment thought it proper to remember what they came for and retiring severally to the private arbours of their patrons garden soon composed the mercenary praises he expected from them and returning to the place where waited the impatient company repeated every man his own performance each submitted each in hopes of preference to the decisive judgment of a fair majority  the consequences of this famous battle of the turkish muses having made some noise about the city many copies of their awkward panegyricks were distributed about and since i was obliged by an acquaintance with an italian translation of them all i would not think the pains too great for the diversion of my reader to present him with their verses in a british dress the first are these which follow the first poets verses i mustapha bashaw to you great ali favorite of mahomet and pride of hali address my lines  you are a man so clever that i could wish you were to live for ever for then the beauteous wife you now enjoy would bring you every year a smiling boy so would the world forever happy be beauty and youth wit wealth and honor see your wife and sons would prove the former two and the three last must ever shine in you   i assure the reader i have done the poet justice in his fancy and expression which though a little brighter in the end than the beginning may be excused in that it is more than tolerable in a country where the sun of learning shines so seldom but here comes another somewhat merry and diverting the second poets verses o mighty ali let me swear that a most happy man you are your self is wondrous wise and witty and god has sent a wife to sit ye but that i may discover best how much i really think you blessed oh heavens were i one hour of life to be in bed with your sweet wife sbud how should i for joys then strive and be the happiest man alive   the author of this comical conceit was one morat a brisk and airy spark who would not lose his jest wherever he found it but his muse however mist the prize and though the bridegroom seemed well pleased and laughed for company he was not master of a turkish nature if he did not curse the poet for his odd uncommon way of praising him a third succeeded him more gravely with the lines which follow i the third poets panegyric on the bridegroom god made two sparks of heavenly fire more bright than others were framed em to kindle soft desire both spotless chaste and fair ii go down says he to earth and there long wander up and down till having found the loveliest pair their bliss by marriage crown iii they came and journeyd long in vain until they found the two then centered here and now contain the destined joys of you   a comical reward for poetry some other poets tried their skill but all fell short of these and one zulduc the author of the last was judged deserving of the promised prize which was accordingly bestowed upon him by the bridegrooms order the present was a wellshapd ass with saddle and caparison embroidred richly and the bridle breastpiece and the other harness all embossed with polished silver of which metal were the large and weighty stirrops made according to the turkish fashion  this strange illchosen present soon alarmed the town with mirth and wonder at the novelty of our triumphant poets odd reward and amongst the many others who reflected pleasantly upon the turks unfashionable gift a certain humerous spanish runnagado skilled completely in the eastern languages and still retaining sprightly relics of his countries genius was a little sharp upon the subject in the following satyr a spanish runnagados satyr on the bridegroom and his present complain not poor zulduc that thy reward seems not to speak a generous regard thou do alas mistake thy patrons mind the gift he made thee proves him more than kind for as a lover whom strong passions move yields up himself a sacrifice to love so alis hand has given to thee dull man though not himself as near it as he can for nature bridle saddle all combine to show how near the ass and latenoosd ali join   the condition of music among the turks proceed we now to musicks charms as like to those of poetry as possible yet not so much encouraged by the turkish nation who are altogether strangers to the melting strains of vocal harmony nor understand the charming use of those delightful instruments whose elevating sounds have unresisted power to move the souls of dying men and make the poor desponding wretch forget his sorrows and erect with joy his drooping head to hear the soft and tunefull call that lulls his cares and hushes for a while his loud misfortunes  their notions thereof a sort of paradox the notion of the turks concerning music will appear a paradox for they abhor the brisk and airy tunes of christian composition and alike despise the dulcid notes and melancholy soft complaining strokes of grave sonatas the shape of a turkish ghittarr yet are they never easy when alone unless they have a kind of course ghitarr or such a sort of instrument consisting commonly of several wires upon a long and slender wooden body with a round capacious hollow head the form whereof is represented in the cut relating to the grecian wedding in the one and twentieth chapter above the letter i on the right hand of the figures  their manner of using it with this dull instrument the solitary turks divert themselves in every place and every company they place it in the left hand and turning its unweildy belly to their sides with the unheeding fingers of their other hand strike up and down at random all the wires and whine out horrid and unpleasant noises to the humdrum echos of their barbarous instrument  the strange esteem the turks profess for the abovenamd instrument yet so bewitched are all the turks to this ridiculous amusement that a stranger must be plagued in every corner of their streets and houses with repeated sounds of doleful airs and noisy voices void of harmony nay to such extravagant affection are they now arrived for this prevailing fashion that the soldiers go not to the war without their fiddles nor can any travel half a day in turkish territories but he shall see a grave longbearded mussulman sit singly crossleggd under some large oak or shady cypress pleasing his conceit with melancholy ditties to the strumstrum music of his thrumd ghittarr while his poor horse is turned to graze about the field and seeks the pleasure of a more substantial entertainment  the shape and use of the turkish baseviol another instrument in use among the turks is a large wooden trunk not much unlike the fashion of the former whereto one large and rozind twisted catsgut is affixed so straightly that by scraping thereupon with a proportionable bow a certain hoarse and hollow murmur strikes the ear like the unpleasant tuning of a bad base viol  the form of timbrels and how used in turkey another very celebrated piece of music is the noise they make with jingling timbrels which are formed exactly like a sieve the bottom made of buff extremely strong and durable small long and narrow holes about the sides contain a certain number of round thin and polished plates of brass bored through the center and securely fastened with a liberty to play upon a little pin this timbrel they make yield a very jarring and discordant sound by striking with their fists upon the middle of the leather which thereby affords a sort of drowsy base to the more shrill and sprightly trebble of the clattering plates of brass about it both these abovenamd instruments are likewise represented in the cut aforesaid  wind music not in use among them wind music is not much in vogue in any part of turkey a sort of pipe or awkward flute they make of reeds is what they chiefly now delight in but the hautboys trumpet and the favored instruments of christian countries even from the amorous flute down to the rustic bagpipe are entirely strangers to the turkish practice  drums and kettledrums in high esteem drums they use in martial expeditions and delight extremely in their warlike thunder kettledrums they beat with skill and pleasure but they understand no tunes nor boast the noble theory of music but play by rote on any instrument the incoherent dictates of a wild extravagant and artless fancy  the turks unskilled in logic the turkish studies boast no logic nor does any man among the most polite of all their people know its meaning no tough syllogisms puzzle their discourses no nego minorem majorem or consequentiam confound their students with asserted contradictions the reasons why they disapprove it all is vulgar plain and ignorant nor do they wish to gain a clearer notion of a dangerous science which they say opposes always and too often overturns the truth of argument and light of reason  their ignorance in metaphysics they know no more of metaphysics than a trifling contest on the attributes of god and that maintained with such absurdity and weakness that the artless tenor of their jangling disputations cannot boast a regular proceeding but is founded grossly on the obstinate profession of illiterate contrarieties  physic not well understood in turkey physic is esteemed a sacred study but their ignorance therein exceeds belief for though the ancient doctors of arabia were the best physicians of the times they lived in and could say with solomon they knew the vegetable nurseries of nature nay could tell their virtues from the cedar to the hyssop yet the modern arabs and the spacious body of the turkish empire are eclipsed by clouds of such supine obscurity that they can boast no good physician in their nation but respect a quack if bred in christendom as an undoubted master of an useful science which their want of learning or neglect of opportunities deny themselves the smallest knowledge of  navigation how far known to turkish mariners navigation as i said before is little understood by turkish mariners the compass is by them divided into eight great points and the dependant usefullness of that illustrious art so much unknown that they can only sail before the wind and while the nimble ships of other nations ply with ease their handy tacks to starboard or to larboard quarter veer about lie by and coming up within few points of every wind sail on secure in spite of adverse and tempestuous weather the baffled efforts of the turkish sailors sailing their desires the unweildy vessels of those ignorant people must be forced to creep for hospitable shelter to the close protection of some neighbring harbor and expect with patience the desired return of proper winds to prosecute their voyages  the state of their geographic learning geography is so unknown among them that they hardly find a possibility of reaching skill enough to learn the situation of their own dominions and so very dark are their capacities that way that some the most refined among them have desired me to inform them whether britain did not border on the mouth of the mediterranean and the king of frances territories spread their frontiers to the western indies  geometry astronomy and astrology how far known in turkey geometry they cannot boast the smallest notion of and are extremely ignorant of astronomical observations yet some are found in turkey who pretend to schemes and figures in astrology and calculate nativities for superstitious people when even those very men who pass for conjurers and are esteemed as such by the unthinking populace behold with wonder the surprising form and advantageous uses of our christian globes celestial or terrestrial  but let us now descend from lofty studies to the rural practices of country labors and we shall perceive the common ignorance as formidable there as in their schools of education and unpolished seminaries of religion and philosophy  the turks unskilled in husbandry so little are they skilled in agriculture and the art of gardening that where the ground requires manuring they are wholly ignorant of all improvements which the rustic arts of european husbandmen have taught the practice of and let it lie neglected and untilled not useful to themselves nor advantageous to posterity  their lands extremely fertile but providence has strangely so ordained that they possess such fertile and productive territories as will yield the blessings of a double harvest from the easy labors of an unfatigud and pleasing industry  greeks commonly employed to till the ground yet are the native turks so given to luxury that few among them care to take the smallest pains in rural practices but on the contrary they still employ the subject greeks to do their drudgery and live supinely like the lazy drones upon the plundered honey of the bees about em  the reason why the turks neglect improving lands and perhaps this universal negligence in country matters may proceed from that inglorious and submissive slavery wherein they live and which depresses weightily their unsupported spirits by the sad reflections of their miserable servitude to an unbounded monarch who possesses at their deaths the product of their labors and becomes sole heir to all their lands excluding even the children of a frugal father from the wished enjoyment of a ravished patrimony  how a country life may be unpleasant for though the charms and various pleasures of a country life may tempt the inclinations of a thinking man to leave the hurries of a towndestraction and relax the springs of wearied life in gentle solitude yet is not any of these flattering blessings to be met or hoped for from a rural life encumbred with the plagues of noisy discord and severe effects of an insulted slavery where every moment may produce some strange and unexpected accident and reduce the owner of a rolling plenty to the shame of poverty or military ravages upon the spiteful nod of some capricious governor  when and how a country life is truly happy then o sweet and gentle solitude are thy retirements truly happy when we can enjoy secure from danger the inviting pleasures of thy dulcid mansions when the softer wishes of our peaceful souls may free and unconfined become successful and our undisturbed and blissful hours roll smoothly on within the limits of paternal residence how truly just are the exalted notions of the roman horace on the present subject when he says hor ode  d epod beatus ille qui procul negotiis vt prisca gens mortalium paterna rura bobus exercet suis solutus omni faenore neque excitatur classico miles truci neque horret iratum mare forumque vitat and superba civium potentiorum limina the ode in english happy the man who free from care as men in former ages were from usury retires and plows with pure industrious hand with his own steers his fathers land the crown of his desires no storms of war his peace can shake vnmovd he sees the billows break and mocks the oceans frown he shuns all courts where lawyers are disdains the haughty grandeur there contented with his own   by what has been already said the reader may conceive with ease the utmost altitude of turkish learning i shall now proceed in the ensuing chapter to inform him of the morals of those mighty people  chap x of the turkish morals all men by nature more or less are taught morality the reader can expect no elevated notions of refined morality from such as live on others misery and owe the grandeur of their lofty fortune to the bloody ruin of invaded nations yet as natures dictates and the common lessons of a mild humanity excite mankind to do the justice they again expect so have the turks in the last age been more refined than formerly they were by frequent converse with the christian nations which their extended conquests made their neighbors  some british travelers have flattered the turks strangely do the characters which all our travelers have given the turks mistake their nature some ingenious gentlemen the natives of great britain have thought fit to speak those people noble masters of a spotless virtue and describe them sailing in a sea of glory laden richly with the golden notions of morality and wisdom which distinguished anciently the great inhabitants of the countries they have conquered  others have detracted from their real merits others less obliging but alike mistaken biased by the follies of a fond partiality allow them owners of not one commendable or virtuous practice but describe their natures wholly sunk in dull stupidity and universally inclined to mischief and iniquity  a medium most eligible and the nearest truth these extremes are both to be rejected and a modest medium chosen to direct us we shall then discover that the same variety of humor and morality now reigns in turkey that is found in christendom and that the numerous mahometans are like our selves divided into good and bad according to the lessons of their different educations or the contrary impulses of a vicious soul or one inspired with a sublime and generous love of virtue  their divided notions of morality not more divided is the turkish faith than their infirm morality some holding lawful meritorious and as duty that which other some condemn as odious sinful and illegal nay to such degrees of violence do they proceed herein that some believe it sin to pity christians others hold it charity to relieve them some hate mirth and others sorrow some love one thing some another each opposing to others principle with all the malice of discordant obstinacy as is described by horace in the eighteenth epistle of his first book oderunt hilarem tristes tristemque jocosi sedatum celeres agilem gnavumque remissi the sad the airy hate the brisk the sad the swift the slow despise the joyless hate the glad   but to let the curious clearly understand in what condition are maintained the common morals of the turks in general i will transcribe a sort of catechism taught their children who imbibing early what the parents make em learn continue when grown up to justify their tenets the interrogatories are as follow a turkish catechism q tell me thy name  a my name is mustapha  q how were thou made  a by one great god alone and indivisible almighty merciful omniscient sempiternal full of truth and rich in glory  q by what means do thou hope to gain salvation  a by walking strictly in the paths of holiness as measured out by gods decree and set before all true believers by the goodness and compassion of our pastor mahomet whose name be sacred sent by god to teach mankind and now in heaven his mighty true and only prophet  q how do thou expect to gain his favor or reward his goodness  a by promoting his religion and a charitable pity of my fellow creatures  q how must his religion be promoted  a by destroying with the sword and fire all such as dare oppose his holy doctrine till the infidels are rooted from the earth and all the universe submits to own his glory  q how will you extend the charity enjoined you  a by erecting hans or public inns for entertaining poor benighted pilgrims building bagnios and endowing mosques with large revenues if the lord of paradise is pleased to bless me with a plentiful ability if not by giving freely to the poor as much as i can spare redeeming slaves and looking upon the beasts which serve our uses with a mild compassion  q how are you to pity beasts or birds which serve you  a when an ox ass horse dog mule or camel has for many years been truly serviceable i must let him graze in peace about my grounds and live the rest of his disabled life entirely free from toil or drudgery as a reward for all his former labors  q what else are you required to do to such poor animals  a i am obliged to load my camels and all other beasts of burden favorably and with pity buy the birds that pine in cages for their absent mates and let them fly away to seek lost liberty  q who under mahomet will you obey  a my prince and parents  q how must you serve your prince  a with life and fortune for he is the lord of all my plenty and may honor my head by making it his footstool i am to live and die when he commands it and depend on nothing but his sacred pleasure  q how will you respect your parents  a with the unfeigned duty of a meek humility as becomes the honor of those persons from whom next god i had my being  q how will you deal with your neighbors  a love those who love me hate those who hate me kill those who strive to kill me but never give back ill for good nor good for evil  q what is your highest wish  a on earth success and paradise hereafter  q is your wish sincere if not may heaven refuse it  a so be it to me    this catechism may convince the reader that howsoever differing their notions are in other points they all concur in one unanimous respect wherewith they humbly own the power of god and worship his divinity of which the eldest ages of antiquity acknowledge the assured existence and hesiod seemingly inspired with more than heathenish light of reason thus expresses a quotation from hesiod concerning the power of god     highthundring jove who in heavens loftiest throne sits uncontrolled and rules the world alone at pleasure lifts to empire lowly swains and hurls from boasted grandeur him who reigns with ease extirpates lines of noblest race and gives undreamt of honors to the base in short his arm can make the crooked straight and draw out all the pride which swells the haughty great   the bad effect of a bad opinion their notions of the duty which obliges them to propagate the doctrine of their prophet leads their reason justice and humanity so much astray that neither promise vow nor solemn oath can bind their conscience to omit an opportunity of adding any thing to former acquisitions  the turkish trade is managed by the jews by this means christians find it dangerous to deal in turkey and gaining no security from sacred oaths nor oftrepeated promises refuse to credit such as they suspect who therefore not regarding public business leave the management of all their trade to crafty jews a people wily and industrious in the art of cheating handsomely and who are numerously spread over every corner of the turkish empire constantinople and its neighborhood containing many thousands of those scattered people  the crime of lying seldom known among the turks lying is a crime not often known in turkey nor does any man affirm for certain truth what is not proved so by his own experience and speaking generally when a turk has stroakd his beard and laid his hand with gravity upon his breast sedately to assert some questioned point you may securely take his word nor is he ever known to falsify his promise  swearing practiced and encouraged of all the turks immoral practices the vice of swearing to a strange extravagance is most in fashion and so oddly new and different from ours are their invented oaths and curses that it will not be a needless trouble to inform the reader what uncommon thoughts those people exercise on such occasions  strange and unexampld curses used in turkey thus for example when they would express their anger to a man or beast they do it commonly in the rash and inconsiderate manner following may the graves black angel fry your soul may you vomit up your bowels and your heart strings burst in sunder may the birds of heaven defile your head and your unwashd body damn your soul to future vengeance but more ridiculous and impiously void of reason is a method they encourage by a constant practice cursing with a strange and senseless fury things inanimate and void of understanding if a man affronts em camel horse or any other beast of burden checks their will or any accidental stumble over a stone provokes their passion they proceed without reflecting on the object of their rage to vent these curses annah sana secteim gaour annah sana yonnina sicheim that is i ravished your mother you infidel and i will ravish her again as she lies in her grave  the common oaths in use among the turks their common oaths are such as these by mahomet s great office by the throne of god by the roof of heaven by the sea and land by the sultans soul and the hairy scalp of my mother  gaming how far encouraged gaming is so little prejudicial to the turkish government that though the natives much delight therein as shall be shown hereafter it was never known among this people that estates were ruined and whole families impoverished by the cursed effects of such a vicious practice  drunkeness a prevailing vice among them ebriety i have before informed my reader is unlawful by their prophets prohibition of the use of wine or other strong intoxicating liquors yet how far this weak and disregarded barrier stops their progress in so loved a vice will be easily conceived when i assure him that no nation under heaven is addicted more to frequent drunkenness than are the turks in private meetings  whoredom and adultery but rarely practiced whoredom and adultery too much encouraged by the christians practice and alleviated commonly by the palliating cloak of a pretended gallantry are seldom found among the turks the punishments so great and obviously known and difficulties of obtaining female correspondence so insuperably hazardous deterr them from attempting such illegal love and the little value which they hold their women at the slavery that poor unhappy sex are there subjected to and the unbounded liberty their laws afford em in promiscuous use of wives and concubines excite no search of such unvalued pleasure  the turks are much inclined to sodomy but now o black and horrid shame i must with all the detestation of a christian zeal descend to speak a shocking truth relating to the strange and cursed pollution of inverted nature that ancient hellish crime which ruined sodom and at present reigns among the turks with such libidinous extravagance that they will publicly avow their countenanced delight in such a beastly and inhuman practice  they have their favorite pooshts or catamites as common as their concubines and ride attended to the wars or distant governments by rich and splendid numbers of these young male prostitutes  the means whereby the turks grew fond of sodomy it is more than probable that the raging fire of this impetuous lust began to flame from the original confinement of the turkish janissaries denied like roman priests the liberty of marriage who therefore not supporting the unwelcome prohibition with expected resignation to the will of their commanders broke out in loose and wanton searches after unknown pleasures and like water checked in its encumbered chanel soon doubled former force and rapidly oerflowd the deluged banks whose lofty mounds had formerly confined them  the vice encouraged by impunity impunity for such unnatural and encroaching guilt emboldens their presumption to so vast an height that i remember with the greatest horror and amazement an unexampled impudence i was my self a witness of at adrianople  a story of a turk at adrianople sir robert sutton now ambassador from her present majesty to the court of constantinople being just arrived in the abovenamd city where his predecessor had some time expected him it was my duty to congratulate his entrance on that dignity which i did in company with many british gentlemen at that time there the house in which sr robert lodged was seated pleasantly upon a noble river which runs along the city and an open kiosk or airy summer house looked out upon the water  we were standing here extremely pleased with the delightful prospect when from the plain upon the other side we saw a turk of middle age and decent habit lead a boy about fourteen directly to the bank which slopd upon the river where he thought himself securely sheltered from the people of a village not far distant  an incredible proof of turkish insolence descended to a place convenient as he thought for the execution of his purpose he began to our surprise and inexpressible confusion to prepare himself and his consenting catamite for acting a design so hateful to our sight and such a stranger to our customs that we scarce believed our eyes when they beheld this object we hallowed loudly to the lustful wretch who turned his head with seeming wonder to perceive us there but still persisted in his first attempt till snatching up a fowlingpiece which lay by chance upon a table in the summer house i cocked it and presented it against his body as if i would have shot him dead immediately at this he started and adjusting the disorder of his loosned dress retired precipitately with a thousand curses on the house and company for having balked so impious an intention  a noted proof of gods abhorrence of the crime there is in barbary upon the coasts of fez and in the neighborhood of that imperial city a most strange and dreadful proof of gods resentment of this growing guilt in his surprising judgment on a certain moor inflicted in the very moment of the beastly action why unbelievd it is unbelievd at least suspected though attested in the works of several authors but that common fate of travelers assertions shall not make me backward in maintaining truths i know the folly of believing travelers more apt to lie than other people nor will judicious readers question the authority of any mans relation for his having traveled into other countries a poor a weak malicious proof of envy and the mean effect of judgments want or scarcity of honor for men by nature favorers of truth will still continue so what ever place or climate they may chance to visit for as horace says coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt men who over seas to distant countries roll often change their climate but retain their soul   the particulars of the story upon a spacious wild unshadowd common in the way from fez to arbacan a village not far distant you perceive at near six furlongs from the common road the figure of a turk committing sodomy upon the body of an ass and coming nearer led by wonder or prevailing curiosity discover it to be an image formed in very hard and solid stone the hoofs hide hair teeth and color of the ass as various and distinct as when alive the turbant of the poor unhappy man seems half untied and hanging negligently over his shoulders a very wonderful act of providence even the eyebrows nose mouth lips and every feature of his face exactly formed to speak him living nay the very rings upon his fingers and the nails of either hand remain distinguishably obvious to the common view alike converted into stony substance varying in its colors answerable to the different parts of that amazing metamorphosis it represents  it stands so strong and deeply rooted in surrounding earth that neither man nor ass can possibly be separated nor the whole conjunctive monument of sin removed from its foundation which they say has very often been in vain attempted  a traditional account they give of the abovenamed accident tradition teaches them and they teach travelers that in some old forgotten age of which their ancient records make no mention the miserable wretch thus strangely represented frequently committed sodomy upon the open common with asses mares and other beasts which grazed promiscuously upon the public pasture but that at last the weighty justice of almighty god oertook his insolence and changed him into stone whilst busied in his wickedness that so he might remain to future ages an immortal monument of heavenly vengeance  no sort of robbery much known in turkey housebreaking pocketpicking and the meaner practices of pettylarceny are altogether strangers to the natives of this country who so much abhor the person of a thief that where a man accused of any robbery escapes the hand of public justice he will notwithstanding fall a victim to the unresisted fury of the raging populace for all the turks are so entirely free from fear of losing goods or chattels by the breaking up their dwellings that the richest warehouses which their city boasts of often lie whole nights unbarrd and open in their lowest windows nor are these frequent opportunities of robbing any ways improved to eithers disadvantage  a very comical bargain customarily made among them but if they overreach each other in their private dealings they do not only think it lawful but a commendable discretion and therefore it is a common custom with the merchants of this country when they hire a broker bookkeeper or other servant to agree that he shall claim no wages but to make amends for that unprofitable disadvantage they give them free and uncontrolled authority to cheat them every way they can in managing their business but with this proviso that they never must exceed the privileged advantage of ten per cent all under that which they can fairly gain by blinding their respective masters in the settling their accounts is properly their own and by their masters will confirmed to their possession  the british merchants will be apt to censure these proceedings as ridiculous and tending to encourage knavery but he will soften his opinion when he thinks upon the reasons which they give for the permission of this custom  the reasons why the turks allow this custom the servant knowing he has nothing to depend on but the profits he must gain by an industrious application to the art of cheating puts himself upon a wily method of oerreaching others in the goods he buys by order of his master whom he strives again to overreach by reckoning them to his accounts at full and current prizes the master on the other hand well knowing that unless he watches carefully his servants managements he will deceive him ten per cent and probably go far beyond those tolerated limits becomes observant of his own affairs and keeps his profits in his own possession  murder common in the turks dominions murder is so dangerously common in this country that there passes scarce a day wherein some man or other is not killed the turks however rarely butcher one another but the hated christians fall in every corner wretched victims to the blinded zeal of such mad pilgrims as return from meccha or the lawless insolence of unrestrained levants or those who man their ships of war on what account committed by   sorts of people the first of these transported by the dictates of delusive doctrine aim at heaven by the death of every christian they may chance to meet till they are killed themselves by way of vengeance and the last delight in murder by the bloody consequence of a licentious education so that you can hardly pass the streets of turkey but you must be witness of an hundred proofs of their inhumane practices  a story of a pilgrim who endeavored to kill the author one day i went on board a british vessel in the port of constantinople and returning to the shore with several europaean gentlemen all dressed according to the christian fashion we received a thousand barbarous affronts as we were landing from the boat but being long inured to turkish insolence we took no notice of their scurrilous expressions but endeavored to have passed em by with an uncommon exercise of patience and humility till we perceived a certain tattered wretch in habit of a pilgrim leaping up and down with elevated eyes contracted forehead and a visage full of passion and deformity he held a dagger in his hand and skipd about with such conceited violence as made me take his zealous transports for an air of madness so that thinking him some simple antic i laughed aloud at his extravagant diversion  the barbarous action of a zealous madman he saw me laugh and made directly toward me with his brandished weapon which a greek interpreter endeavoring to turn aside received unhappily to the hilt within his bosom i began at this to change my humor and endeavor to prevent the proffered salutation of the pilgrims dagger stepping back i drew my sword and kept him at a distance still retiring from his aggravated fury which being now increased to double height by now and then a thrust upon his wrist he grew quite desperate and finding that he could not come within my sword stepped back a foot or two to gather force and threw the dagger swiftly at my breast with all the strength that zeal and anger could supply his arm with  an odd way of reaching heaven providence perverted its designed effect and led me to avoid the danger of its point by sinking suddenly with knees upon the ground but dreading the event of his continued villainy i made a strong and lucky thrust which pierced his bosom through and through and brought him staggring to the ground to reach the paradise he hoped to gain by such a bloody method and inhumane species of mistaken merit  not one pretended to detain us from escaping but on the contrary discontinued all their insolences to gather numerously round the body and repeat a prayer for his departing soul desiring mahomet to see the piety of his intention and reward his death with the assured possession of expected glory  a strange and horrid principle alike destructive to the turks themselves and strangers in their country who seldom let the death of an assaulted friend go unrevenged by which means all the trading towns of turkey constantly afford successive scenes of murder and destraction  the wonderful discovery of a barbarous murder hapning in the time of my continuance in this country claims a place in my remarks for two great reasons first the oddness of the thing it self distinguishes the accident in a surprising manner and secondly the neversleeping justice of almighty god appears conspicuously in the strange conviction of so black a villainy  a story of the wonderful discovery of a murder the sackah or the man who carried water for the use of our ambassador at constantinople used to fill his leathern vessels at a very deep and ancient well not far beyond the buildings of the city where one morning he with great surprise beheld the lifeless body of a man without his head lie weltring in a stream of blood disrobed and mangled in a thousand places to disguise him from the knowledge of such travelers as might occasionally pass that way a cursed policy the virile marks of nature were entirely cut away that so the proofs of circumcision or omission of that ceremony might not speak him turk or christian  concerned to view so sad a spectacle the melancholy sackah soon returned and telling every man he saw the accident he met with endless crowds of curious people flocked to see the headless trunk of this unknown and miserable object for a week or two it made a mighty noise about the town and great enquiries were for some time made in order to discover the inhuman author of this strange barbarity  an undeniable instance of gods care and justice but full three months were now expired and no news came of any man so much as guessed to be concerned therein so by degrees it was forgot and silenced till the hand of heaven thought fit to point out the undreading villain and deliver him to justice which he thought himself too wise to be detected by hor ode   lib   raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo rarely does vengeance quit the villains chase though she pursues his crimes with a slow halting pace   there was a public shootingmatch with bows and arrows appointed to be held upon that very spot of ground wherein the well was dug near which the body had before been found unnumberd multitudes were gathered to behold the skill of the competitors and being heated by variety of exercise drew water from the well and cooled themselves by drinking it  the murderers name and quality a crowd of men were gathered round the brink and gave a sudden shout as if surpised at some undreamt of novelty from every corner of the field the people ran to know the matter and among the rest one cara musul alimet a scrivener of the city pressed among the foremost to demand particulars  he was no sooner come but looking over the shoulders of a man or two who stood before him he perceived to his confusion and astonishment that one who had designed to draw up water in the bucket had attracted to the brim of the surrounded well a dead mans head all pale and ghastly hanging by the hair upon the iron of the bucket  a most prodigious and amazing accident he had reason to appear amazed and had begun to tremble when the head fell suddenly from off the pail and tumbled swiftly over a sloping ground till it arrived directly underneath his feet and there lay still its horrid face and dreadful visage turned quite upwards seeming to accuse the silent guilt of his confounded murderer  the name and quality of the person murdered the trembling wretch half dead with fear confessed he had been author of the famous murder that had been of late so much discoursed of telling those about him that the name of him he killed was gurat oglani a merchant of aleppo newly come from thence to sell some jewels he had bought a pennyworth of the eastern caravan that he had been directed to his house by letters from a friend to lodge and board while he continued in the city and that cursed avarice had tempted his desires to kill him on a certain evening near that well into which he threw the head and had so cut and mangled all the body that he knew twoud be impossible it should be known or guessed at  a very curious and particular observation confession was enough to gain a sentence for the villains death who being broken on a wheel directly in the place the murder was committed in acknowledged it to be as near as he could guess that very spot whereto the head had rolled and stopped beneath his feet when first he owned the monstrous action  the turks more prone to vice than virtue thus much shall serve to have spoken of the turkish morals who are generally more inclined to vice than virtue and though there are some men sincerely pious sound among them yet are the greatest part of those who pass for men of zealous and religious principles but seemingly affected with the love of piety and rather honest by the fear of punishment for acting wickedly than by the pungent dictates of a tender conscience directly contrary to the virtuous man whom horace thus describes in the   th epistle of his first book hor epist    lib   tu nihil admittes in te formidine poenae oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore never let fear of punishment incline thy backward will to act a good design he who is truly worthy hates to sin cause guilt must wait without where virtue dwells within   i lead my reader now to view their trade which with their various and peculiar arts of management therein will be the only subject of the following chapter  chap xi of their trade foreign and domestic the turks not ignorant of the advantages of trade the numerous advantages of foreign trade and vast improvements which those nations make to whom the benefits of an extended commerce open great and glorious blessings are so entirely known and envied by the turkish court that they reflect with grief upon those maxims of their policy whose rigid dictates have confined their traffic to the meaner profits of domestic correspondence  they would willingly abate the rigor of their laws to taste the sweets of so desired a liberty but fear the breaking one decree should shock another why not encouraged by their government for twould be full as dangerous to a turkish sultan to permit a traffic foreign and domestic and thereby let his people grow more rich and wise as should some heedless sailor in tempestuous weather strike a window through the sides of a deep laden vessel to admit the light and thereby let in dangerous waves to sink the ship in a tumultuous ocean however their esteem for trade and inclinations to encourage it as far as may consist with the security of the sultan and his power may be discovered by the efforts used to draw as many merchants to the harbors of their empire as may settle a continued commerce with the turks from the respective nations which they all belong to  the glorious titles of the turks metropolis constantinople is to this end named the harbor of the universe throne of splendor and the seat of riches but the common title which both turks and christians give that city is the ottoman port and by that name alone we generally express it  since then their want of skill in maritime affairs and the discountenance of the supreme and arbitrary power forbid their sending ships abroad let us proceed to see what foreign nations condescend to sell the manufactures of their country in a turkish market  the british factory at constantinople and first the trade we manage with these people is so great and advantageous that the right worshipful the turkey company employ a worthy and a numerous factory at constantinople consisting commonly of five or six and twenty merchants with their servants and dependants for whose protection and encouragement the kings and queens of england the antiquity of the turkey company since the reign of queen elizabeth have still maintained some wise ambassador at the turkish court whose prudent managements have all along preserved a sure establishment of profitable commerce and defended both their persons character and factory from those affrontive insolences and audacious impositions which the haughty carriage of the sultans ministers have often offered with success to other nations  the factory at aleppo another british factory is settled at aleppo under the direction of a consul of our nation but that city standing far from any port but scanderoon or alexandrietta a little town which borders on cilicia and lies in    degrees of northern latitude that is the harbor whence the goods are carried to and from aleppo by the merchant ships of our and other nations  the other at smyrna smyrna has its factory and consul and in some measure rivals both the other in the richness of its traffic many other places subject to the turk have their peculiar consuls but are inconsiderable in respect of the aforenamd cities and dependant on the plenipotentiary authority of the ambassador residing at the port  the goods of british manufacture commonly exported into turkey the goods exported to these wealthy factors on the ships belonging to the turkey company are chiefly cloth lead tin pewter linen coral and the finest iron all which merchandices are esteemed at profitable rates and turn to good account if rightly managed  sugar how carried thither british vessels often sail to lisbon where they take in cargos of brazil strong chested sugars which they carry on to smyrna scanderoon or constantinople and dispose of to a profit sometimes reaching cent per cent and always near it  gunpowder a profitable commodity gunpowder yields considerable gain and ever finds a speedy vent the turks not skilled in making it so well and eagerly engrossing any quantity the christians will afford them  firearms how valued firearms of all sorts will be sure to meet a ready purchase and the muskets of a strong true british bore are so esteemed in every part of turkey that they stick at nothing reasonable in the price provided they are suffered to approve their value by a shot or twos experience  pitch tar and rozin pitch tarr and rozin are exported thither in considerable quantities for though the conquests of the turks and nations tributary to their government afford far more than they can possibly consume they notwithstanding value that which comes from britain and will barter for it with a double weight of what they have among them which is often brought again to several parts of england and there disposed of at full the price the first had cost em  clocks and watches much esteemed of all sorts of clocks and watches made in britain are in turkey vendible commodities with many other valuable merchandices frequently exported into the grand signiors country and affording very large and easy profit  goods imported by the turkey merchants the british merchants in return for these import vast quantities of grograms camlets tissues velvets and raw silk in great abundance fine rhubarb opium aloes balm of gilead cassia coffee and a thousand other drugs of noted efficacy in medicinal operations  fine cochineal gummastick terra sigillata indico and cotton rich sherbets cavear and carpets of a noble size and wrought beyond comparison embroidered muslins silks and handkerchiefs or curious workmanship in gold on leather with a number more of such like manufactures profitably pleasant to industrious traders are imported with an unknown gain from several harbors of the sultans empire  shagreen how made and whence imported another sort of merchandice imported thence is leather of all sorts prepared and unprepared besides which the country yields great quantities of sealsskins goatsskins and the wild assshide whereof they make the best shagreen in use amongst us  pistaches almonds dates dried quinces marmalade and fruits of all sorts are by foreign merchants bought at very low and reasonable prices whence transported to the several ports of christian countries they are sold to great advantage  the hollanders conveniences in trading with the turks next to the british factory the hollanders maintain the greatest trade with turkey dealing for the same commodities but sending ships much larger and at half the charges they  for the most part make the best returns and speediest voyages  the ungenerous policy of france in respect to turkey the french as well as those last named maintain ambassadors at constantinople but with this difference that the first design thereby no other interest than their factories prosperity whereas the last have other ends directly contrary and by preserving a perpetual amity between their monarch and the sultan endeavor still at every favorable opportunity to stir that people up to war against such nations as are enemies to france by such unchristian practices imagining to gain some sure advantage by the great diversion which the turk must make invading christendom  the jews the only brokers for the turkish merchants i have before informed my reader that the jews are brokers to the turkish merchants and indeed on them lies all the management of public traffic people framed by nature with a conscience and capacity alike endued to cheat the universe they grow by these means soon extremely great and wealthy but the turkish ministers have learned a lesson how to squeeze a grape when ripe and juicy to the best advantage  domestic trade how carried on the utmost of their foreign trade is now expressed i next proceed to speak of their domestic traffic which is partly carried on by coasting vessels sailing cautiously at little distance from the shore and partly by the caravans or land conveniences which are constantly in motion and export the manufactures of one part of their dominions to another  their navigation as i have before declared is mean and far inferior to the christians skill and therefore they are backward in the hazarding commodities by sea unless in trade with islands or a country they may reach with ease and safety how far the turks employ their ships in trade thus they send their ships to load with goods from cyprus candy rhodes and all the islands of the archipelago and sometimes venture with considerable fleets to alexandria scanderoon and certain other ports of barbary and egypt  the trade of turkey with the euxine or blacksea the euxine or blacksea has a peculiar fleet of ships appropriated to the trade the turks maintain with all its harbors whence they deal for little else but timber and supplies of slaves to serve their uses which are sold them annually by the salvage tartars who in their destructive ravages and deep incursions into poland russia muscovy and other bordering christian territories spare nor sex nor age nor quality but carry all in equal fetters to the shame and torment of perpetual slavery  the caravans of turkey are mistaken generally by the vulgar notions entertained among our common people who misled by their affinity of name with certain carriages in use amongst us think em large unweildy wagons which contain a multitude of passengers what a turkish caravan is whereas the true and genuine meaning of the turkish etymology is haraavahan that is to say a mixed convenience and such are all the caravans of turkey consisting of unequal numbers of assembled merchants travelers and pilgrims from fifty to an hundred thousand and so on to sometimes fifty sixty seventy or an hundred thousand souls  the order they observe in all their caravans over these promiscuous multitudes presides a certain officer distinguished by the name of caravanbashaw or captain of the caravan he constitutes inferior officers punishes disorders regulates abuses and preserving fixed tranquillity and peace throughout their journey guards em with a number of selected soldiers from the scattered parties of arabian horsemen who are all professed freebooters and will often attack a number ten times larger than their own and carry off the merchandice and camels in the rear in spite of all the opposition can be made against them  the method travelers must take in turkey travelers agree with this commanding officer for such a sum of ready money to be served with carriage and provision if they please for any journey and by means of these continual motions of the caravans from every corner they are constantly supplied with all the richest products of their distant manufactures and the finest jewels porcelane and the rest of the commodities abounding in the most remote divisions of east india persia china or the aromatic confines of arabia felix  the turks exact great custom for imported goods twas long before the turks had learned the benefit of making foreign goods pay custom of admission but when once they tasted the advantage it might bring them they proceeded to exact such vast unreasonable sums that christian traders find themselves obliged to raise the former prices of their goods the better to enable them to bear the imposition  mechanic skill divided into   extremes as for the skill this people boast in their mechanic professions it is differently great or small according to the inclinations of the natives in general or particular genius of the tradesmen of that country some handicrafts fall vastly short of ours in britain others far excel the famed artificers of even the most refined and celebrated parts of christendom  the turks excellent at embroidery thus in the art of sowing or embroidring on leather with a party colored silk or golden wire they have reached so great a pitch of excellence that not the nicest needles of our most industrious housewives can by any means compare with their perfection  extremely ignorant in clockwork and ingraving again in clockwork or the curious arts of cutting or engraving metals they are skilled so poorly that they understand not good from worthless work but will alike encourage every ignorant and idle vagabond and the accomplished master of the nicest operation  the turkish art of damasking their scymetars the turks have reached peculiar excellence in damasking their scymetars whereby they do not only strengthen but adorn the metal with a fine and streaky substance yielding a delicious scent and odoriferous perfume surprizingly agreeable to such as draw their weapons unawares and suddenly  there is a notion commonly received but false and groundless as is well observed by monsieur tavernier in the two hundred and thirtieth page of his persian travels viz that all such scymetars are brought from damas or damascus and can no where else be made when it is certain and notorious truth that they are done as well in many other parts of the grand signiors empire  an error in the assertion of monsieur tavernier but as it is difficult almost beyond surmounting to avoid asserting some erroneous probability while we zealously endeavor to reform the false opinions of the men we speak to so the author lately mentioned to correct one error has produced another for to undeceive such people as imagined steel was only damaskd at damascus he informs his reader that golconda does alone afford a metal capable of that impression when it is not only practiced in the cities of aleppo smyrna cairo constantinople and an hundred other parts of turkey but in many provinces of christian countries i my self once bought a sword at hambourgh of a cutler who for ten pence more than his demanded price both damaskd and perfumed it to so high a pitch that it retained the scent for some years after  the manner of damasking this is done by heating to a moderate degree the metal you would damask and instead of cooling it as usual by the dipping it in water twisting round it a rough canvas towel purposely permitted for an hour or two to lie and soak in milk and fountain water wherein has been dissolved a certain quantity of vitriol salarmoniac and some other such like compositions  the turks exquisite at making bows and arrows bows and arrows they have learned the art to make with wonderful dexterity and can in steel or wood not only shape them to an exquisite perfection but contrive them even for use far better and more lasting than the celebrated archers of the indian countries can pretend to equal  carpenters joyners masons smiths and other artisans of turkey though they are extremely skilled in their respective trades according to the customs of the nations they inhabit cannot boast that admirable genius which at present shines in the conspicuous improvements of our europaean arts but labor hardly under the oppressive weights of ignorance and tyranny  painting ill understood in turkey painting is in turkey little understood because they look on representing any human image or a being blessed with life as gross idolatry and a black abomination in the sight of god on which account they have maliciously defaced unnumberd pieces of antiquity by beating off the heads or picking out the eyes of every painted figure or accomplished sculpture which they had the undeserved good fortune to become the masters of in their successive conquests  their manner of painting however some there are who paint in miniature and represent in fine and lasting water colors great variety of fruits and flowers and sometimes landskips but it is rarely known that any can attain a tolerable skill in the expressive doctrine of a true proportion  and yet they seem ambitious in the search of new improvements and would gladly reach the white they aim at while pushed forward to a vigorous desire of an increase of knowledge by the placing as sublime a value on the excellence of art as is expressed by the greek hipparchus in the following verses     life boasts no blessing more refined than art nor can kind heaven to man a loftier bliss impart for when the unexpected turns of fate has shook to ruin our securest state when dubious war shall all things else destroy that stands unshockd and safe a sure and lasting joy   the cause of turkish ignorance in arts but what shall man presume to say when the almighty justice of an overruling providence permits a poor and miserable people to continue groaning under the resistless torments of a servile bondage to the arbitrary sway of an unbounded monarchy whose barbarous policy permits no light of learning to disperse the gloom of an encouraged ignorance  before i end the chapter i am now upon i will propose a useful and an easy way of gain to any who had rather hazard and fatigue their persons by embracing such a prospect as will give them more than hopes of great advantages than sit contentedly in idle shame and poverty at home indulging the deficiencies of blinded reason by a long neglect of active industry  a useful project for a skillfull brewer london contains an unknown number of ingenious brewers who for want of stock to carry on a creditable trade are forced to live in mean conditions servants to the wealthier and more thriving brothers of the same profession let such as these consider well their present circumstances and learn by what i now proceed to treat of how they may improve them  brandy wine and all strong liquors known in turkey are unlawful to their use by the aforesaid prohibition of their prophet mahomet yet are these people so inclined to drinking that for want of other pleasing beverages they will often venture public scandal and severest punishments to satisfy the call of their insatiate appetites by drinking wine in such prodigious quantities that i forbear to mention what my eyes have often witnessed lest it should with difficulty gain belief  now this excessive love of wine proceeds from nothing else but their complaindof ignorance in brewing other liquors the turks extremely fond of english beer for i frequently observed that when an english ship had brought some bottles of our country beer or ale to turkey and presented em to such as afterward would compliment the noted turks of their acquaintance with a share in drinking them they constantly expressed a wonderful esteem and eager inclination to obtain a quantity assuring us repeatedly that could they make such drink themselves they never should be tempted to commit a sin by breaking through their prophets order to forbear the use of wine and brandy  nothing can be possibly more easily accomplished than the universal wish of turks and graecians upon this occasion would some english brewer skilled in his profession make a voyage into turkey purposely to use his best endeavors for the introducing common use of beer or ale instead of water  for first i have sufficiently explained my reasons to believe the natives of that country would with pleasure drink it and the price by no means could retard the practice malt incredibly cheap in turkey for so cheap is malt throughout their empire that they feed their poorest horses with the best of barley and with so much ease might he expect to thrive herein that though he sold the liquor he should brew at not so great a price as a quart a penny he must soon grow rich by more than cent per cent clear profit in his dealings  but so far beyond this lowest computation may he reckon his advantage that i can experimentally assure him he might sell it and be never thought too dear at full the price it bears in london nor would the turks think more too much or if they should the very factory it self excluding all the other christians there residing would enrich him speedily provided he took care to manage well the brewing all his liquors  some objections answered if any timorous man objects the inconvenience of so long a voyage his being altogether unacquainted with the country and its language and his want of friends to help on his design those difficulties soon will vanish when i tell him he may bargain for his passage on an english ship and be supplied with all provisions even to constantinople for considerably less than twenty pounds that he will land within a few stones throws of the ambassadors house to whom the captain must of course present him if designed to settle there that he is bound to grant him his protection and encouragement that he may have a druggerman or an interpreter to wait upon him for a little charge and still conversing with his countrymen maintain a trade almost as free and uncontrolled as if in england  the probability of the projects meeting with success i beg the readers pardon now and should before have begged his patience for this long digression but have said thus much to tempt the inclinations of some more sprightly men than ordinary to attempt a project that can no ways hurt them but can boast of more than single probability to advance their fortunes if it does the good for which it is intended i am fully satisfied if none believe it worth their while to put in practice i shall still remain alike contented  why the turks are more deficient in the point of trade than we i have said as much of both their foreign and domestic trade as either subject will afford and if you think it not proportionable to that mighty bulk and farextended power of their arbitrary government consider them as people altogether strangers to the peaceful practices of correspondent justice a nation built on ruin and the sword and in its rude original entirely void of honesty and commerce if then this great unweildy body has of late descended to the thoughts of traffic you must look upon it only as a branch of their prodigious oak and consequently flourishing in far less bright and emulative splendor than our christian arts of trade and navigation which are the strong and stately trunks of our more thriving trees of profit by whose celebrated sap and vegetative juice those spreading limbs are still supplied and richly nourished with a neverfailing and consummate plenty  chap xii of the turkish habits governments so absolute and tyrannical as that of turkey give us little reason by the notions we conceive of their unpolished constitution to expect examples of a common decency much less exact economy from the untaught and rustical deportment of their rough inhabitants  an exemplary prudence of the turks in point of dress yet to my great surprise i found the turks in many things i speak it with concern more prudent or at least more orderly than any part of christendom particularly so in that accomplished regularity observed among them in respect to dress you may with ease distinguish there the mistress from her waiting maid and know the quality of any man you meet by the peculiar ornaments of his restrained appearance there no footmen huff along ridiculously vain as if they wore their masters honor in the lining of his livery those look great among the turks who really are so and a modest carriage and sincere humility adorn the persons of the common people  men obliged to dress according to their quality dresses are as marks whereby to know the men you meet though strangers to your view and pay the nice punctilios of respect which are required from every quality to those above and those below them but the head as commonly esteemed the noblest part is always chose to bear the mark of an enjoined distinction nor is it possible to speak in any reasonable compass of the strange varieties among their fashions every rank of men or different order being more or less distinguished from the other by some answerable turn of habit and appearance i proceed to treat distinctly of as many as may prove diverting to the reader or deserving of his notice  the turks observe the custom of the ancients in respect of habit the ancient custom of the eastern nations who delighted much in long and open habits is to this day prevalent among the turks nor do they ever change the fashion of their dress esteeming little such as are misled to frequent alterations of the clothes they wear and hating with a fixed and rancourd enmity the modish shape of christian habits asserting that by openly exposing legs and thighs and wearing coats so short and close we do not only act immodestly but by the follies of a fond fantastic and affected levity for which they wilfully mistake our conges and genteel deportment entirely rob our selves of that grave majesty which should distinguish man from other creatures  the mohammedan lock they shave their heads as soon as circumcised and still continue to renew that practice through their riper years permitting only one small lock to grow upon their crowns to an uncommon length which being daily combed and scented by the barbers art is twisted with a neat and wonderful dexterity then fastned in a knot and suffered to remain unloosd beneath their turbants  the common notion of it false and groundless ridiculous and groundless is the common notion that the turks expect to be received by mahomet from earth to paradise their prophet holding them by the abovenamed lock of hair thence called mohammedan  an exemplary piety of certain poor and miserable christians they rather wear it as a voluntary mark of their profession of his faith as many christians now inhabiting the miserable countries of bulgaria georgia servia and sclavonia invent an art to stain by application of a certain juice the tender foreheads of their newborn children with the forms of crosses that when afterward grown up and subject to the arrogance of turkish neighbors they must keep their faith in spite of persecution or expose their persons to the scorn of christians and be shunned forever in their base apostasy  the shape and substance of the turkish shirts their shirts are formed alike for men and women open in the sleeves which some men wear near half yard broad they make em of a sort of callico crape or muslin without either neck or wristband never suffering any linen to appear when they are dressed a pair of drawers tie upon the shirt of the same stuff and reaching loosely to their very ancles shacksheers or drawers over these they draw their britches called shacksheers in the turkish language made of scarlet or a violet colored cloth and reaching like the former to the instep where being gathered at the bottom commonly three quarters round they strongly sow em to a sort of leathern houseshooes soft and yellow and contrived exactly to the shape of every foot these they call msts which serve within doors while they sit or walk on their embroidred carpet papooches or their walking slippers for they leave at entrance into any house their walking slippers or papooches made with smooth and yellow upper leathers and the sole extremely thin but so well beaten that it will resist the dirt or water in their streets to admiration they are made without the smallest heel instead of which they use a piece of iron framed exactly like a horseshooe they are shaped like womens slippers with a sharp and picked toe and come not half way up the instep so that by the smoothness of the outside of the inner and the inside of the outer shoes i often kicked em off as i was walking in the streets nor can a stranger keep em on his feet till use has made em easy to his motion  the inconveniences of wearing em another inconvenience which attends the wearing these abovenamed slippers is the custom they have got of leaving em without like womens clogs at every door they chance to enter so that often when i have been present at their stately visits feasts or public ceremonies coming out amidst a crowd of people i have sometimes found my slippers changed and others soiled and not worth wearing left me in their room nay very often have been forced to walk through all the dirt with nothing on my feet but mests which letting in the wet were worse than if i had gone home barefooted coaches are not found in turkish cities as esteemed an idle proof of an effeminate indulgence  the shape of turkish boots they ride on horseback with a great delight and wear a sort of boots unable long to keep out water they are shaped at bottom like the shooes above described and made but weakly of the same smooth leather reaching to their knees and large enough to hold with ease the numerous gathers of their spacious britches  their wastcoats a doublet made of thin stripped silk or stuff convenient for a summer wear is formed without the shortest sleeves and reaching to the hipp is folded one side over another and fastened on the left with loop and button  another sort of wastcoat over this they wear a dolamann or long loose robe of callico or muslin in the heat of summer in the winter made of silks or stuffs embroidered richly or not at all according to the quality of those who wear em these reach like ladies nightgowns to the ground of spacious breadth at bottom the sleeves are close and button at the wrist where they turn back with facings of the same they button also at the neck whence one side sloping over the other they are fastened in the same place and manner with the under wastcoat just now treated of  the richness of their girdles they bind these dolamanns with silk or muslin girdles of a length sufficient to allow three rounds about the body after which they tie an artificial double knot before and twist each overplus within the girdle to the right and left the ends of these long scarfs embroidered purposely or richly flowered with gold and silver finely intermixed with persian silks of various colors  a sort of winter gown to wear in houses at home in summer they have nothing on besides still turning up the corners of their dolamann within their girdles but in winter most men in their houses wear a sort of loose and open gown which reaches to their knees some lined with silk and some with furrs some having open sleeves and some not any all according to the different inclinations of the men who wear em  a costly sort of lining when they go abroad they let down constantly the corners of their dolomann and put on blue or scarlet sometimes green long robes which train upon the ground lined through with ermin squirrelsfurr good foxskins rats or sables some of which are very costly and can scarce be bought for fifteen hundred dollars  a noble sort of robe not much unlike the roman mantle some delight in wearing light and unlind silken robes not much unlike the dress wherein we often see the ancient heros painted loosely over their armor they are fastened with a silver gold or diamond clasp above the breast thence falling back with admirable grace and spreading with an hundred airy folds wide broad and stately from their manly shoulders  the fineness of their daggers gloves they wear not nor appear with scymetars but when they travel all the arms they bear about em is the short hanjarr or dagger which i mentioned in the chapter of their military government which being thrust within their sash on the left side thereof does often shine with precious stones and other rich and splendid marks of the authority and grandeur of the man who wears it  the quality of turks distinguished by their turbants their heads as i have said before distinguishing their quality are differently dressed by different degrees of people yet they all affect the wearing turbants some of muslin some of silk and some of callico the various colors forms and magnitudes whereof contain the marks of splendor or subjection the muftee wears one bigger than a bushel yet not heavy nor any ways incommodious the sultan wears his somewhat less and differently twisted the grandvizier lordtreasurer and other officers whether civil or military are each obliged to wear a turbant answerable to their quality  their several colors the fashionable color of these turbants is a spotless white though they are sometimes worn of black red yellow or of any other unmixed color for a stripped or speckled turbant is a mark whereby they know a christian who must never wear one of a pure and single color green is the peculiar property of those emirs or kindred of their prophet which i long since spoke of a turk is punished if he dares presume to wear it on his head unless intitled to it but a christian so offending is without the smallest hopes of pardon instantly condemned to a renunciation of his faith or must assert it by the trial of a painful martyrdom  the dress of common people the meaner sort of people go barelegd with girdles twisted round their middles and a dirty towel wrapped about their heads or sometimes a small scarlet skullcap covering their crown and reaching to the tops of both their ears which is the only cover that the servants wear throughout all turkey who though somewhat better dressed than are the other common people yet in this restriction are not much above them that is they must not wear those loose furr gowns denoting power but be contented with a tight closebodyd dress which speaks their servitude  the dress of turkish ladies at home their womens dress at home is just the same in britches slippers shirts and wastcoats with the mens before described upon their heads they wear a sort of pastboard like a apiece trencher covered over with embroidred muslin to certain silver points on whose extremest edges their perfumed and scented hair is fastnd so that twisted into several locks and hanging with a sort of easy freedom round their heads adorned with ribbands diamonds and an hundred different sorts of glittering stones it gives a graceful look and amiable air to the appearance of the turkish ladies  it is but very rarely that they go abroad and then to no place but the public bagnios or the funeral or marriage of some near relation but when they do they cover their abovenamed headdress with a linen muffler which meeting with another piece of black and shining silk that hides the upper part of their faces nothing but their eyes and nose can possibly be seen  they hide their faces in obedience to the precepts of their prophets law which tells em it is unlawful to discover any of those beauties god has given them but to their husband or their father their dress abroad they wear abroad a gown of blue or scarletcloath which buttons fast before and hangs with narrow sleeves below their fingers as they walk they hold the bottoms of their gown in their left hand as low as they can possibly reach and swing their right each step they take with a surprising haughtiness or rather gravity they die their nails with certain drugs which yield a color like a reddish yellow and delight extremely in the richness of their habits though they very seldom gain an opportunity of showing them  the female slaves and servants of the turks are veiled or muffld while about their business but meanly dressed according to the servitude of their condition  but what i have already spoken of the turkish habits shall the rather serve in that the reader may discover with his eye the several dresses represented in the cut hereto annexed more fully and particularly than can be comprehended in a verbal and more dark description  the turks in all their customs opposite to us in every action of their lives the turks oppose the europaean customs they wear long clothes we wear short ones we in salutation of a friend esteem it rudeness not to bow with head uncovered they receive that point of breeding as the greatest and most base affront that can be put upon them we esteem a bending of the body graceful and obliging they interpret it a mean acknowledgement of our inferiority to him we speak to they love sadness and a grave deportment we love gayety and briskness of behavior every thing in short is carried on directly opposite to both our humors and our customs whether one or tothers airs of breeding are the most consistent with that native majesty which man was formed with must be judged by several persons several ways and whether they or we are right or wrong we both believe our own the worthiest fashion for as the famed athenian solon has it in his elegies   the cowards self is brave in his own eyes and the most homely wretch will his own features prize   chap xiii of their wives concubines ways of courtship and forms of marriage the inimitable virgil was undoubtedly inspired with love and truth when he asserted this so often experienced maxim omnia vincit amor and nos cedamus amori love conquers all things to his power we yield and proudly lose the day when beauty takes the field   the power of love the roughest heros of the ancient world amidst the dusty scenes of war and ruin red with blood of undistinguished slaughter and encompassed round with care and danger often slackened natures springs and sinking calmly from the love of glory let their laurels wither on their heads and lost the sense of honor and renown entirely stupefied in all their faculties and slumbring meanly in the downy scenes of this lethargic passion  how much that passion now prevails among the turks even the adamantine breasts of icy scythia have admitted love in all its fervor and forgot entirely native roughness by the softening charms of female conversation nay to such excess does that bewitching passion now prevail among the turks that as if they were not the posterity of such uneffeminate and hardy ancestors they frequently neglect the great affairs of state and interest to dally wantonly with favorite women and enjoy the loved and rapid transports which attend on their caresses  herein however they have got the start of europaean lovers that whereas we languish long and unsuccessfully for some loved ladies favors they enjoy the utmost of their wishes in a speedy consummation of their forwardest desires  the power of turkish husbands again though i will not give my country women cause of anger by affirming that as preferable an advantage as the former they boast a sort of unconfined authority which makes their wives submissively obedient but since it never allows that mutual confidence that generous free and open familiarity so requisite to make a marriage truly happy i cannot praise their policy in robbing wives of that well tolerated liberty which serves to soften matrimonial bondage and proves a sure and winning mark of conjugal goodnature  an ancient saying it was the saying of a very ancient grecian author  nature did not frame the woman to command and philemon a poet who flourished in the reign of alexander the great has left his notions of the matter in the following lines    a wife my friend who takes the wisest way should not command her husband but obey for where a woman over her consort reigns the weight that gauld before now wounds with killing pains   and so entirely do the turks adhere to this poetic doctrine that for fear their wives should by degrees encroach on their prerogative they rob them barbarously of those indifferent liberties without whose taste it is morally impossible for man or woman to be truly happy  submission and affection of the turkish wives the good effects of turkish discipline surpised me much when i percievd that notwithstanding their severe behavior toward their wives the patient turtles were so far from lessening their affection on confinement that they rather doubled their respect and spaniellike fawned humbly on their injurers with the assurance horace had from lydia tecum vivere amem tecum obeam libens with thee dear soul i could for ever live my life to die with thee i would freely give   the mistaken notions of some of our british ladies it is a strange amazing labyrinth of female wonders to behold the contradictory inclinations of that unintelligible sex while those in turkey grow goodnatured by a brutish usage ours in britain sometimes think it out of fashion to oblige an easy husband and instead of mending on the kindness they receive insult the more and make their spouses gentle condescension their undoubted privilege of nature these speak in rougher notes than those above and plead like juvenals unreasonable woman sic volo sic jubeo stat pro ratione voluntas it shall be so i will it is my command and resolution shall for reason stand   increase and multiply is held a very good and necessary maxim by the turkish nation and indeed they lose no time nor opportunity of putting it in execution to the best advantage wives slaves and concubines promiscuously granted them without control and every tenet of their faith and practice of their lives combining jointly to indulge their wishes in the gross enjoyment of a sensual appetite  polygamy was by mahomet allowed them freely and unbounded but the dictates of their policy obliged em to restrain that tolerated liberty and fix a certain limit to that dangerous privilege for the reasons following  the reasons why the turks restrain polygamy were men permitted to indulge their senses in the various pleasures of promiscuous embraces they would marry inconsiderately such a number of wives that on their death the major part of their estates devolving to the sultan little would be left to share amongst them and the helpless ladies consequently forced to want and beggary  another reason and indeed the wisest of the two is this the numerous doubts fears envies jealousies and quarrels which alternately possess a womans mind where rivals are respected would by tolerating many wives become so frequent formidable and ungoverned that those fairy pleasures which invite to matrimony vanishing away would leave behind em little else but noise and discord troubles and distraction  how many wives the turks may marry however they are yet permitted by the common custom to espouse four lawful wives and lest their wandering inclinations should induce em to believe they were denied a pleasure heaven designed em they are freely suffered to enjoy the persons of as many concubines or purchased slaves as they may think agreeable nor are the children so begot esteemed in turkey as in christian countries spurious and illegitimate but equally intitled to their fathers love and honor of his quality with others born in wedlock  with this proviso notwithstanding are they freemen and legitimate they must be manumitted in a public form by will and testament before some judge of civil administration sealed signed and given in by their own fathers hand with solemn ceremony a very strange and barbarous custom this neglected leaves em servants to their brothers will who may at pleasure use them as their bondsmen  o happy turks cries some disconsolate and wretched british husband when he hears me tell him turkish matrimony is not quite so true a gordian knot but that it is frequently untied without much difficulty yet perhaps were some mohammedan his spouses consort he would find a blessing which her present owner either does not know or care to value  the turkish marriages not performed by priests but ere we speak of their divorces twill be proper to describe their matrimonial ceremonies and in order thereunto i must acquaint my reader that the act of marriage is performed by the appearance of the husband with the father uncle brother or some near relation of the brides before a judge where in a public manner he avows his inclinations and affections to the person of the lady though perhaps he never saw one feature of her face but that is no matter love you know is painted blind and thence blind bargains are become a fashion  proceeded this large step on his intended journey he is next demanded by the judge what offers he can make deserving her acceptance settlements are made according to his circumstances or the fettered privileges of turkish subjects and the bridegroom signing there an instrument whereby he owns her for his lawful wife the match is entred in a public register and ever after they are conjugally coupled  how the man employs the night before now then let us venture to observe the consequences of this previous ceremony after which the man transported to be sure and full of raptures takes his own and halfgaind spouses male relations to his own appartment where he entertains them till within an hour of midnight with the fashionable music vocal and instrumental coffee and sherbet and if of brisk and airy constitutions sometimes treats em with a glass of wine but very sparingly for fear of reprehension  how it is employed by the women but as for the poor female victim who is trembling all this while with dreadful apprehensions of some near surprise she sits unveiled on an embroidred cushion in the midst of a large room round which are placed her sheacquaintance friends and kinsfolks all invited by her mother if she has one to inform her what she is about to do and read alternately repeated lectures of the duty of a wife and power of her husband while the poor halffrighted creature stares about her with a blushing ignorance amazed and quite confounded with their monitory lessons  thus they pass away the time till almost midnight when they take the bride with one consent and lead her to the bagnio if there is one in the house if not a common bathing tub will serve the turn here every gossip plucks a feather till having quite undressed the helpless virgin they begin to wash and rub her soundly smoothing over her body with a certain scented and balsamic ointment the better to prepare her for approaching pleasures after this they put her on a shift and wrapping nightgown thence conducting her to take her rest till early the next morning  the morning ceremony at the dawning of the day they come again to wake the bride who rising from the last possession of her virgin pillow is by them attended with officious ceremony dressed in all her richest robes and soon made ready for the amorous call of her expected husband  he is not tedious well suppose in dressing but with all the friends he entertained the night before sets forward from his house well mounted and attended by a gallant troop of gentlemen on horseback serenaded as they go by several sorts of music sounding with them through the streets they come at last where lives the bride whose father summoned by the noisy instruments commands his door to be set wide open and demands within it what they want and why they visit him  the manner of the bridegrooms coming to demand his wife the bridegroom answers sitting on his horse he comes to claim the lovely jewel god has given him and names her with a loud and haughty voice and being further asked how well he can defend her he lays his hand directly on his scymetar and draws it half way from the scabbard every horseman in the company proceeding to the same expression of his friendship to the married couple hereupon the father stepping from his door advances slowly some few paces to salute the bridegroom who with all his followers dismounting nimbly lays his hand devoutly on his breast and utters this expression true happiness this moment blesses me to which the father answers heartily o may that happiness be great and lasting  how the bridegroom is received at his fatherinlaws house the bridegroom enters full of joy and with his father flies up stairs as nimbly as he can his friends mean while conducted in and entertained below according to the turkish fashion at the entrance of the womens chamber he is met by the expecting bride her mother and relations she unvailed and aiming all her beauties to surprise his fancy entering he extends his arms with wonder and astonishment and  doubtless overwhelmed with rays of brightness finds himself unable to sustain the shock and therefore turns him round with great humility in order to escape the danger of his spouses lightning  how the bride receives him but the tender natured nymph unwilling to confound at first appearance calls him back with gentle phrases and the mild expression of gehl giacquir bennum that is to say return my good angel this encouragement removes all fear and tempts him forward till his newmade consort takes him by the hand and leads him to a table little higher than the ground she seats him crosslegd there upon a fine embroidred cushion and sits down herself in the same posture opposite to him all the company then place themselves on cushions six foot distant from the ogling spouses till they form a fine and spacious circle round the table  his entertainment smiles and glances and the common airs of meeting lovers pass the time till there is brought upon the board betwixt them two small dishes one containing a fat roasted dove the other filled with certain cakes not much unlike our barley sugar  emblematical proceedings of the married people the dove is cut in four distinct pieces whereof the head and neck make one the rump the second and the body slit in two composes both the other the bridegroom first presents his lady with the rump and this expression though lowest yet acceptable the bride returns her consorts compliment by giving him the head with this submissive motto be thou my head and i thy footstool  then put they both their hands together on the table taking each one half of the divided pidgeon which denotes that they should live like harmless turtles and that though the head and tail make some distinction yet they ought to love and prize each other as two different parts of one sole body  this done the bride extends her hand and reaching from the other plate a piece of the abovenamd barleysugar directs her fingers to her husbands mouth and makes him swallow it he does the same to her again by this expression of their silent will declaring mutually that it shall be always eithers chief endeavor to oblige the other by a constant practice of the sweetest carriage and most tender actions which can prove affection  a drinking emblem they next proceed to call for drink which presently is brought em in a chinacup containing fine perfumed sherbet of costly preparation first the husband sips and then the wife which having done they jointly lay their hands upon the cup and spill the liquor on the table which is thereupon removed immediately this emblem signifies that they must always join with sympathetical concern or joy and gain or lose the pleasures of this life with equal satisfaction  after all these ceremonies are performed the bridegroom takes his leave and goes away to his own house in order to prepare for the nocturnal entertainment of his charming wife who in the close of evening is attended to his place of habitation in the following manner  in what manner the bride is carried to her husbands house the bridegrooms brother or the nearest of his kindred claims the lady in her husbands name who is delivered into his possession veiled all over mounted like an amazonian heroine astride on horseback and attended by a stately number of her female friends who ride about her and support a sort of indian canopy which falling like a tent below her horses breast becomes a perfect cover and prevents her being seen by any of the people who will always crowd the streets on those occasions round this shining troop of ladies ride a greater number of the male acquaintance of both parties who serve alike to grace the cavalcade and guard the women from the insolent abuses of the common people  how she is received there arrived at last the waiting bridegroom standing in his door receives his consort open armed and leads her instantly to some prepared appartment where their numerous men relations who assisted in the ceremony enter one by one according to their quality and having each bestowed some present answerable to his circumstances they withdraw genteely with repeated wishes for a happy bedding of the amorous pair returning every man to his particular place of habitation  the pastimes of the women the women to divert the husband and his bride begin to dance at which profession they are skilled but aukwardly performing always singly and inventing strange and frequently lascivious postures to adorn their motion and excite an ardent flame of expectation or to call it by its right name lust in the alreadykindled fires which warm the breast of the impatient lovers  the previous ceremonies to the bedding but now the time which ever rolls along with heavy wheels on such occasions summons them to hasten the usual preparations for the bridal bed in order whereunto they lead the bride with songs and music to the chamber which contains the stately scene of her expected pleasures here they place her on a small square block all covered oer with silk or velvet and retiring to the distant corners of the room invite the husband to the comical performance of a merry duty fashionably incumbent on new married people  no pulling off the bridal garters throwing the stocking or other common practices in use at british weddings are observed among the turks but sure the reader will allow the turkish bridegroom has a task far more diverting strange and comical  a comical injunction on the turkish bridegrooms for he is first obliged to be his spouses valet and undress her for his bed nor is this odd injunction all is he obliged to for the young and airy turkish ladies who delight in dressing a new married friend contrive such strange and artful knots about the silken strings which tie her drawers that it is next to a downright impossibility to find out gentle means to loosen them yet the eager bridegroom is enjoined to kneel and fumble with his teeth till he can some way or other get them open which the young and vigorous lovers all impatient of delay with violent endeavors bite asunder none in such a case must use the least assistance either of their own or spouses fingers so that were there men as well as women present at this ceremony they would doubtless find themselves far more diverted than the merryest company that ever graced a christian wedding  it would it is presumed be altogether needless to instruct the male or female reader in the well known consequences of these preparatory pastimes since the common knowledge of both turks and christians will direct their fancys to a full discovery of these secret practices which eithers modesty will constantly incline their will to draw a curtain over  to leave them undisturbed and private  and now since i am treating of the lovers fond elyzium twil not be improper to observe that those bewitching joys are sometime frustrated and lessened very commonly by the jealousy or malice of some other wife transported with the fear of scorn at the appearance of a riva in her lords affections  witchcraft very common among the turkish women in turkey nothing is more frequent than a deep and cursed knowledge in the practices of witchcraft sorcery and a sort of juggling villainy whereby they render impotent and ineffectual the strongest efforts of a vigorous lover on his wedding night and it is perhaps to this the turkish matrimony though indulged in polygamy owes the common and amazing paucity of children  nay so skilled are many in this damnable profession that they insolently dare pretend to force affection from antipathy it self to punish infidelity in affairs of love and give a lady supernatural charms to change her humble servants vowed inconstancy  the practice very ancient among the greeks nor do we find such practices of modern date the ancient greece was famous for this study which they had originally with their worthier knowledge from that source of learning egypt how skilled the grecian ladies were in magic incantations may be gathered plainly from simaethas words to her maid thestylis in the second eidyll of theocritus where she endeavors to bring back delphis who had abandoned her affections part of the  d eidyll of theocritus      where are my laurels thestylis and where the powerful philtres we must now prepare this sacred cup with purple fleeces bind that though my fickle lover proves unkind i may some magic incantations use and force him to a breast he would not choose since he ungrateful went twelve days are fled nor knows he whether we are alive or dead   and a little further in the following words begins her incantation       with all the sacred charms of magic art i will now inchant the loved inconstants heart but thou o moon shed favorable rays for grateful i to thee address my lays to thee o goddess and to hecate the powerful subterraneous deity at whose appearance curs forget to bark and silent let thee stalk through dreadful dark whilst over the graves at noon of night you tread and press the clotted blood of the corrupted dead hail awful hecate hail goddess hail grant me thy aid  so shall my charms prevail go iynx go kind spirit have away and drag him to my house without the least delay   another sort of sorcery there is another sort of sorcery much used in turkey if it may be called so since perhaps the notion took its rise from nothing but the superstitious fancies and ridiculous opinions of hypocondriacal persons they call it magic of the eye or the bewitching by an evil look now whether there are any real grounds for this belief i shall not venture to determine a story of a gentleman bewitched by an evil eye but this i can assure my reader that i knew a gentleman at constantinople who was naturally blessed with an uncommon share of wit and judgment yet became a downright idiot in the space of twenty four hours upon going by the invitation of a greek of his acquaintance to make one among the guests at an armenian wedding and it was believed in town by every man who heard the story that the evil eye of one there present had deprived him of his senses  another sort of marriage used in turkey there is among the turks another sort of marriage generally used by strangers who reside but little time in any city this is called hakabin and is a bargain made before a judge whereby the man is bound to take the woman and maintain her as his wife for one two six or more months and when his business calls him to another place he is obliged to give her such a sum of money as is mentioned in their first agreement  concubinage how tolerated concubinage as i have said before is granted to the turks who always keep as many slaves as they can purchase and maintain to serve by day the uses of the house and all night long the pleasures of their master  there is in constantinople a slavemarket twice or thrice a week thither the people go and see the miserable christian captivevirgins dressed in all the tempting ornaments that can allure the looks of amorous passengers they speak to those they are inclined to like and having asked them any questions they think fit to start they feel their breasts hands cheeks and foreheads a curious search nay proceed if curious in the nicety of search to have the young and wretched creatures taken privately to some convenient place where undisturbed and free to use the utmost of their will they find out certain subtle means of boasted efficacy to discover instantly by proofs and demonstration whether the pretended virgin has as yet been robbed of that so celebrated jewel she affirms her self possessor of  the slaves they buy they carry home and use as is abovedeclard till growing weary of their persons and embraces they have liberty again to sell them to some friend or neighbor taking others to their changeable affections nor are their wives at all disturbed to see them use this tolerated freedom the turkish wives may claim one night in seven customs tyranny has made them humble none complaining of her husbands slight provided he bestows one night in seven in her conjugal caresses that the law has given them as their unquestioned property and will oblige the man to own it as his duty  the turks notion of cuckoldom more reasonable than ours an honest and an admirable notion sways the judgments of the turkish people in the point of cuckoldom for that which here with us is strangely looked upon as the husbands shame is in their country placed more wisely and with justice on the lewd adultress and her hornified relations for where the husband finds his bed dishonored and polluted he applies himself directly to some judge or governor and sitting forth at large the cause of his complaint obtains relief by an immediate order of divorce and frees himself at once from wife and scandal  why the turkish sultans must not marry the turkish sultans must not marry or it is become a politic omission to forbear so doing first in that twoud cause alliances and distant kindred to their royal family a thing they always feared and hated and secondly because the greatest and most unexpected turns of fate shall never wound the princes honor in obliging him to see a wife become the victim of licentious insolence and he himself an helpless witness of her shameful usage  the original of the custom bajazet an ancient but unhappy emperor by dear experience taught em this for when the brave victorious tamherlane the great had won the battle which reduced him to his misery his wife dehespeena whom he dearly loved and in whose blessings his were centred being taken prisoner was before the face of her distracted husband ravished by the conqueror the unsupported sorrow which the haughty turk conceived hereat shook all his patience into madness and produced that rough and melancholy death which put an end to all his sufferings  the princes who succeeded bajazet resolving for the future to avoid so black and piercing a misfortune made a law that none should marry ever after on the throne of turkey which has been observed with such religious constancy that two late emperors have been deposed and little urged against their governments but that they took the liberty of marriage and thereby infringed the solemn prohibition of their wiser predecessors  four sorts of divorces used among them i spoke just now of their divorces and will here describe four several methods now in use whereby the turks with ease untye the strongest cord which joins their matrimony  the first the first is registered before a judge as are indeed the other three by this the man and wife are only separated either free and altogether independent on the others power here the husband is obliged to settle a sufficient maintenance and keep her separate as well as when they lived together  the second the second kind of separation is a wider breach of conjugal conjunction for they then are left entirely to their liberty and as by joint consent they may return again to one another arms so may they also marry at their pleasure any other person who shall best agree with either of their circumstances  the third divorce in case of impotence the third divorce now practiced by the turks is when a woman is unfortunately married to a man unqualified for satisfaction of her warm desires by the natural misfortune of an impotent frigidity in such a case the man refusing to discharge his wife is summoned by her friends before a judge and forced to bring her with him to the same appearance when the charge is read against him she is asked if she will then affirm the truth of all that accusation hereupon she stoops and taking off her slipper spits upon the sole and strikes it on her husbands forehead modesty requires no further confirmation from a female plantiff and the sentence is immediately pronounced in favor of the lady who is thenceforth free to marry as she pleases and entitled notwithstanding to a large allowance from her former consorts yearly income  nor is it hard that women should be favored in a case so reasonable when it is the only plea they have for gaining a divorce while on the contrary the men possess a thousand great and boundless privileges and are at any time enabled to obtain releases from their matrimonial chain on every mean and slight occasion  a very merry kind of practice for the punishment of levity but the most diverting sort of a divorce that ever was heard of is the oochey tahalac which having once disjoined a pair permits no second thoughts or change of inclination so as to be reconciled again till as a punishment for his ridiculous and fickle humor the repenting husband will contentedly stand by and see his wife in open day enjoyed before his face by some brisk stranger who is led by accident to pass the house where they expect impatiently the first fair comer  a pleasant passage hapning some years since at constantinople will afford an entertaining and complete idea of this humorous custom it fell out as follows  a pleasant story of the master of an english vessel the master of an english merchant ship who understood but little turkish scarce enough to buy an orange as he walked the streets would needs be ventring frequently on shore sometimes with company and sometimes without well dressed with turbant dolamann and every other part of habit in the turkish fashion he was often cautioned of the dangers he might fall into but never listned to his friends advice returning always safely to his ship without the least affront or meeting any who accosted him in the country language  but rambling on a certain day about the city he was beckned to by several turks who stood together at the entrance of a house surpised at first he would have passed em slowly by as if he took no notice of their summons but before he got five yards beyond the door he felt himself pulled back by one who smiling spoke a long and speedy sentence and returning toward the door he came from dragged him as it were by force to follow him  the master understood not one small syllable of what he said but went as he was led without so much as speaking all the way till coming to the door the other company began to laugh and talk with eagerness as if they were informing him of something very pleasant and diverting he seemed to listen with a wonderful attention and to cloak the matter laughed for company but durst not speak for fear of a discovery he then began to curse his forwardness and turkish habit and to wish himself secure on board his ship resolving to attempt no more such single wanderings  a comical surprise mean while the turks had led him forward and conducted him to a large chamber on the elevated floor whereof there lay a bed with quilt and mattress after the fashion of the country upon the bed sat crosslegd a genteel young lady gay and beautiful with face unveiled and sprightly countenance who blushed at his appearance on a cushion not far distant sat a grave kaddee or judge the master of the house and in a corner of the room stood leaning and disconsolate a wellmade turk who by the sequel proved to be the husband of the lady on the bed and standing there to be spectator of a duty he would rather have excused  a very doubtful state the company withdrew at the approach of the master leaving none behind but the young lady and her husband smiling as they passed him by and pulling to the door to keep them private it is not difficult to guess the wonder which amused his thoughts at such an odd and unexpected accident he stard about him like a man distracted ignorant what he was to do and fearing every moment some design which he conceived was formed against him  at last the husband looking roughly toward him spoke a few low words which by the accent seemed uneasy and with a nod or two and motion of his hand made signs that he should do the duty he was called to without delay the lady likewise beckned with her finger and repeated often these words gehl adham gehl that is come man come he understood so much but no ways apprehending what they meant by those expressive motions instead of answering their repeated invitations stood still and gazed about with mute astonishment  the husband half amazed to see his silence and fixed posture as also eager since he knew it must be done to have it over came grimly up and pushing him with anger forward cried out aloud geddi brai boc kahdin that is go fool see the lady but the frighted britain all surpised at this new step was so confounded with the turns of the amazing accident that scarce remembring who or where he was he forced himself with fury from the turk and in the english tongue cried out why in the devils name do you push me thus i know not what you would be at nor understand one word you say to me  an odd discovery the shocked mohammedan with all imaginable wonder started back to hear him speak an unknown language and snatching off his turbant presently discovered him a christian by the manner of his being shaved and pointing to his head cried loudly to his wife vollah boo adham gaour by the lord this mans an infidel with that he drew his dagger from his girdle and his wife began in passion to rise up and fall upon the master when the turk bethought him of a cunning stratagem to save his honor and having given the english man his turbant back again endeavored partly by fair words and partly by his signs to make him understand he should go out as silently as he came in and seem to smile as if he had been pleased with his adventure  the trembling master glad of any opportunity to get away from such a dangerous scene of wonders made abundance of expressive motions with his head and hands to thank him for his kindness and was marching off with counterfeited smiles upon his face when all the company still waiting in the outward room began to gather round him and to ask him if he had been satisfied in his goodfortune he answered as the husband had made shift to teach him hevett sultanum that is yes noble sir a merry action of a turkish lady but the expecting wife who had it seems been balked of her desire and was unwilling though she lost the christians kindness to deprive her self of some more qualified persons followed to the door and cried out yoketer that is  he lies as loud as she was able  this alarmed the judge and all the rest and made the husband hang his head like one condemned to stocks or whipping post in short they seized upon the poor discovered master and began to drag him back to do the duty they expected from him he unwilling to comply with their desires endeavored by continued struggling to break loose and get away till in the scuffling he again let fall his turbant and with much ado escaping from their hold ran swiftly through the street while all the boys he passed by seeing him disordered and bareheaded and besides a fortunate escape alarmed by the repeated exclamations of the turks he broke away from who cried out an infidel an infidel as loud as they were able gathered round him and with dirt and stones pursued him through the city till he came upon the water side and found among the rest some janissaries whom he knew and whose authority protected him from further injury  i cannot say what second spark the lady found to serve her turn or how the business was performed among them but the masters ill success in this last ramble proved more efficacious to dissuade him from such bold attempts in future voyages than all the good advice and solid doctrine which had been before in vain bestowed upon his rash and inconsiderate obstinacy  i promised in the title of this chapter to say a little of the turkish ways of courtship and will now proceed to let the reader know as much of their amors and gallantry as fell occasionally within the compass of my observation  no coming into womens company in turkey there is no such thing in turkey as a public meeting and promiscuous conversation of sexes at the park ring balls or theater or any other tolerated scene of honorable liberty all are grave reserved and solitary women seldom stir abroad before or after marriage and as there is never found the smallest opportunity of seeing or conversing with the ladies love is consequently quite a stranger to their warmest inclinations till they have obtained an object whereupon to build it yet there flames amongst the youth of this licentious nation such a raging passion of desire that they employ the wishes of their earliest manhood how to get a wife or two to pass their time with and apply themselves accordingly to those allowed and fashionable means whereby though blindfold they may gain a mistress  matches made by friends their common custom then in such like cases is to listen to their friends proposals such a man has such a daughter neice or sister so and so possessed of beauty and good humor fortune they expect none with a wife in turkey for the husband there must buy her person with a settled sum according to her value which they seldom hold at mighty rates or the agreement made between the parents of the willing couple  a pig in a poke the fathers word is sometimes taken for the daughters merit and the bridegroom signs the articles of marriage before he is admitted to a sight of his beloved but the brisk and wiser sort of gentlemen will seldom make so blind a bargain and refuse to listen to the smallest motion of a matrimonial treaty till they are convinced by ocular experience that the mistress offered them is really as deserving in her person as they speak her in her character  the turkish custom in case of rivals it sometimes happens that two rivals jarr about one lady and in such a case the parents of the virgin will not interpose their counsel nor authority but by the following method bring the lovers to her sight and let her choice decide the matter they are both appointed at a certain time to meet beneath the window of a chamber of the house she lives in letticd over so that nothing can be seen within the room but those who stand within can easily perceive whatever passes in the court before it here is placed the mistress of their hopes who having by the throwing down a piece of silk informed em she is there the amorous madmen strait begin to strip one arm above the elbow drawing with the other hand their sharpedgd dagger and exerting each his brightest faculties in singing riding leaping hurling the geritt or javelin and an hundred other exercises in which the vanity of either has persuaded him to think he can excel the other  a dreadful way of making love but the most ridiculous and senceless method of expressing their affection is their singing certain amorous and whining songs composed on purpose for such mad occasions between every line whereof they cut and slash their naked arms with the abovenamd daggers each endeavoring in this emulative madness to exceed the other by the depth and number of the wounds he gives himself some turks i have observed when old and past the follies which possessed their youth to show their arms all gashd and scared from wrist to elbow and express a great concern but greater wonder at their past simplicity  how the lady makes her choice the marble hearted lady proof a while against these barbarous demonstrations of their love at last makes choice of him whose air and face she best approves and speaks her mind by throwing down a ball of twisted silk while he on whom her mind is bent is whining out her praises this produces frequently so great a fury in the disappointed soul of him who loses her that running furiously upon his happier rival they proceed at daggers length a second time to try their titles to her partial favors and before they can be parted oftentimes prevent the bliss of either by an interchangeable bestowing on each others bosoms such amazing wounds as bleed away their love and life together  the oddness of the style invited me to render some of the abovenamed songs into english which are the most esteemed and run as follows an amorous turkish song could i dear ray of heavenly light who now behind a cloud do shine obtain the blessing of thy sight and taste thy influence all divine thus would i shed my warm heartsblood as now i gash my veiny arm would thou but like the sun think good to draw it upwards by some charm another follows as diverting as the former another turkish song on the same subject oh lovely charmer pity me see how my bloood does from me fly yet were i sure to conquer thee witness it heaven i would gladly die but oh i fear when i am dead in the other world we shall not meet if not how like a fool i am sped for dying blindly at your feet   i have at large informed my reader of their matrimonial ceremonies and have nothing further left to tell him on that subject but that however loose the inclinations of the turkish ladies may be rendered by confinement it is seldom known that any wife defiles her husbands bed perhaps it is owing to their want of opportunity for i must own my self a great and utter enemy to that restriction which the eastern nations lay upon their women and believe that where a mutual freedom liberty and familiarity is by custom or unkindness any ways denied a married couple it is impossible to reach that elevated happiness described by horace in his thirteenth ode hor ode    lib   felices ter and amplius quos irrupta tenet copula nec malis divulsus querimoniis suprema citius solvet amor die happy thrice happy more than blessed are the unshaken pair whose tie stands fixed in eithers breast unbroke by grief or care whose grounded love by trifling jars feels no abrupt decay but keeps within true duties bars firm to the latest day   chap xiv of the turkish women in general if by the title of the chapter the reader may be induced to expect a particular account of the exterior qualifications of the turkish ladies he must imagine a difference in their persons and complexions answerable to the climate of a hotter or colder country whose various influences must unquestionably produce as various effects in the persons of its natives the turkish wives submissive and respectfull to their husbands but as the unlimited authority which the turks usurp as a right of nature over their submissive wives extends its force to the remotest borders of their unmeasured empire the continued practice of a conjugal obedience has bent the nature of their haughtiest women to acknowledge readily an inferiority of sex and obey their husbands with the strictest duties of an unfeigned humility this useful maxim which is for ever taught em with the earliest rudiments of their infant knowledge has among many other this one effect that by representing the women even in their own imaginations subservient to the will of man it inspires them all with an ardent zeal in the daily practice of those alluring parts of education which may render their persons most charming and agreeable to the happy object of their exalted wishes  the great advantages thereof many besides this are the great advantages the turks receive from their wives subjection for it entirely frees em from the imperious behavior of insulting yokemates keeps em secure from the uneasy discords of a jealous consort and gives their leisure hours an entire possession of the fullest pleasures to be found in matrimony while the common plagues and bitter minutes of some europaean marriages are altogether strangers to the sweet enjoyment of their consummate happiness  how wives are kept in turkey it is a sense of awful fear and duty that obliges them contentedly to live at home without the smallest power in domestic matters shut up together in a long appartment divided like our hospitals for several beds where free from envy pride or jealousy they eat drink and work together guarded by the watchful observation of industrious eunuchs and excluded from the society of men above ten years old never stirring from their houses nor making visits to their neighbors but all entirely bent to please by turns the wandering will of their respected husband  these then are the chief accomplishments of their womens minds which are molded by the same customs to the same nature in every part of their country and though some provinces have been esteemed more famous than others for the beauty of their women the following account will serve as a description of the turkish ladies  the excellence of their complexions their complexions are for the most part of a lovely fair and without the help of art so exquisitely smooth and ruddy that it is beyond the power of imagination to guess at their beauty which extraordinary perfection they owe to their so frequent use of bathing and perpetual confinement to their houses by which means they are never ruffled by the changes of the weather nor subject to the sultry influences of a scorching sun but it is observable that they lose their beauty much sooner than the inhabitants of the northern world for the daily use of bagnios though it smooths their skin and softens their complexions does notwithstanding prejudice their constitutions by the warm effects of its sulphurous quality a description of the persons of the turkish ladies their features are generally most agreeably regular of an exact and sweet proportion their eyes of a piercing black almost transparently bright and striking and the larger they are the more esteemed for so vast a value do the turks profess for great eyed ladies that the enjoyment of such is by mahomet promised them as one of the sublimest joys of their chimerical paradise arched eyebrows judged a beauty by the turks the arched excellency of their eyebrows is no small addition to the beauty of their features and so nicely sensible they are of this perfection that where nature has denied em so agreeable a charm they are never contented till by the repeated applications of artificial endeavors they raise their brows to a lofty semicircle meeting over their nose in a sharp and graceful angle  their shapes and aires i can hardly speak of their shapes with so large encomiums as i have done of their beauty since the looseness of their dress denies them that forced slenderness of wast so much admired by our europaean ladies but though they boast not that one excellency nature has adorned em with a thousand others which sufficiently supply its want for their bodies have somewhat of an agreeable turn and their motions carry a peculiar grace in an easy and unaffected freedom of behavior the native chams of an amorous softness appear unfeignedly in every look while every step bears somewhat of an air not altogether free from a majestic gravity and yet entirely governed by an uncommon easiness  the turkish ladies are lasciviously inclined i am sorry after so true yet great a character of their persons to descend to the weakness of their unguarded virtue which lies so open and vnfortifyed by principle as to be incapable of resisting the smallest temptation of a favorable opportunity this vice of incontinency is undoubtedly no hereditary misfortune derived from their ancestors since most of the modern turks especially those of europe are descended from the greeks the old inhabitants of that subverted country a nation so entirely free from lewdness and immorality that they instructed all the world in the sublimest virtues the reasons of their lewdness the warm desires which at present sway the looser inclinations of the turkish ladies are rather the effects of their unnatural confinement and the strict prohibition they are under from the society of mankind which raising their imaginations to an opinion of a more elevated bliss than is really found in the conversation of our sex enflames their wishes as it heightens their curiosity and renders the coldest constitution of em all an easy conquest to the first addresses of an adventurous lover and it is no wonder they have no more regard to their virtue or their honor while the duties of religion are never taught em but on the contrary their minds possessed that as god has given them a soul inferior to that of man he exacts less service from the female sex whom he only created for the use and satisfaction of the nobler males  by these notions and the want of liberty beforementioned they are all led to so vast an esteem of men that they scarce know a difference in their merits receiving promiscuously all such as chance or assurance throws in their way and proceeding without the ceremonies of a formal courtship to a plenary satisfaction of their lewd desires the lewdness of the turkish ladies when they can convey some stranger into their appartments and so lascivious are their inclinations that if by the ingenuity of their contrivances they can procure the company of some stranger in their chamber they claim unanimously an equal share of his caresses and proceed by lots to the enjoyment of his person nor can he be permitted to leave them till having exerted his utmost vigor in the embraces of the whole company he becomes incapable of further service and is dispatched with the thanks and presents of the obliged family  i will desire my readers patience while i entertain him with a fair example of the levity for which i thus accuse the turkish ladies it is not now above eight years since first it happened to a fond mohammedan who all possessed with europaean dreams of love and beauty would neither marry wife nor take a concubine that was not mistress of a tender nature and as he thought accomplished sweetly in those bright perfections which in spite of fate must make him happy the folly of our inconsiderate love of beauty but oh how vainly does deluded man depend on beauty as a means of bliss when every frail misfortune of deficient nature robs him of his hope it is a blessing ever subject to a thousand accidental shocks of ruin and even in its longest and uninterrupted course of sunshine but the transient shadow of a momentary satisfaction excellently defined by seneca in his tragedy of hippolytus anceps forma bonum mortalibus exigui donum breve temporis vt velox celeri pede laberis oh beauty doubtful good to human kind thou shortlived blessing transient as the wind how do thou slide with slippery speed away and how the baffled hopes of mortal life betray   the turk of whom i am about to speak was long an enemy to every thought that led him to a scene of matrimony but he was caught at last and i have ever found that those who most inveighed against it have been soonest tempted to its yoke and often most gauld by it it was a very witty observation made by an old greek poet in the following epigram the witty observation of an ancient greek   the man is cursed who takes a she as partner of his bed this all men know as well as me yet who forbears to wed   a pleasant story of the bold adventure of an english sailor this turkish nobleman for smiling fortune had enlarged his circumstances to a great and lofty pitch of splendor kept a very large haramm or chamber of his women he possessed i think of wives and concubines no less a number than a quarter of an hundred and so fondly doated on their amorous conversation that he knew no pleasure greater than the enjoyment of their company would pass whole days in their apartment and choose some one among them every night to carry to his bed and favor with the duty of his kind embraces  however whether nature had not qualified him for the womens favorite or whether every lady thought her turn too long in coming is not known but this is certain that the whole society of beauties were extremely melancholy and would pensively retire to a large window which looked out upon a garden on the backside of their apartment and by throwing up the lettice let in air which fand not cooled the warmth of their desires their lord it seems was very covetous and finding eunuchs somewhat chargeable maintained but one and that an old and lazy fellow who would always go to bed before his ladies and by that means give them favorable opportunities to open the abovenamed window and look out upon the garden or divert themselves with any entertainment they thought fit to pass the night in  twas late one evening and the family secure in their repose when a brisk english sailor who had lost his company in coming not an hour before from drinking at a little hovel where a greek sold wine had rambled up and down from street to street till he arrived in a small narrow lane one wall whereof belonged to the abovenamed garden a lucky curiosity he was walking hastily along not knowing whereabouts he was when he was startled at the sudden noise of womens voices and desirous to behold what sort of creatures females were in turkey he was led by wine and curiosity together to ascend a sort of wooden scaffold which he found there raised against the wall and had been built in order to repair some breaches made by time  the art of his profession had instructed him to climb by which means he with ease got up so high that hanging by his hands and feet he overlooked the ridge of the wall and could perceive distinctly by the favor of the moonshine several ladies almost in their shifts and sporting wantonly together in a window on the other side the garden he was wonderfully pleased to see a sight he had been long a stranger to and not being able to express himself in turkish was resolved to show his breeding in the english language and called out aloud a comical salutation ha my dear rogues have i caught ye faith egad i wish i was among ye  nothing could have been a greater surprise to the discovered ladies than to hear a voice at once appearing to be a mans and stranger to their language or acquaintance but twas increased if possible when they beheld a head chin high looking over the wall with short thick hair and hat of english fashion a surprise soon over the fright at first obliged em to a shriek and drove em from the window for about five minutes but perceiving none had overheard them in the house they gathered courage and returned again believing providence had sent a man to gratify their wishes  the sailor had by this time got astride upon the wall and was beginning an old ballad in that merry posture not remembering he had changed his wapping residence for a short continuance in a turkish city but the ladies gathered in a knot about the window and by the cautionary motions of their fingers hushed him into silence and began to beckon him with smiling looks and all the tempting invitations of an amorous deportment  a very kind familiar invitation encouraged by their unexpected kind behavior the adventurous tarr forsook his station and leaping from the wall into the garden expressed his satisfaction in their beautiful appearances by all the awkward bows and apish cringes his marine accomplishments had made him master of he came at last and stood directly under them explaining by the motions of his head and eyes and other signs that he was sorry such an inaccessible height prevented him from reaching them  an obliging condescension they talked a while by signs and motions but perceiving they could reap but little pleasure from so remote a conversation the obliging ladies loath to lose so rare an opportunity began to make successful use of those inventive faculties which nature constantly bestows on woman in her amorous exigencies and while certain of the company continued at the window smiling in a sort of wanton dalliance with the raptured sailor others ran and tied as many of their sheets together as would reach the ground which having done they came again and making fast the hither end to certain hooks within the chamber threw the other down to him and kindly beckned him to make a proper use of their inviting favors  a bold adventure he was not backward in performing their desires but never thinking of the consequences which might happen made a shift to reach the window by the help of their contrivance they received him joyfully and had begun to stare upon the strangeness of his habit when he interrupted them by roughly kissing all the company imagining that since he always used his english mistresses in that familiar manner it was the fashion so to do in every foreign place he came to  the turkish husbands never kiss their women but in bed and consequently this behavior of our merry britain wonderfully diverted them they laughed exceedingly and gathered round him every one asked some particular question but he could not understand one word they said and finding more than he expected in the chamber looked about him with a great amazement but began at last to catch them in his arms embracing them by turns with so much zeal and rapture that twas hard to tell which party knew most pleasure he in meeting such engaging beautiful and willing creatures or the ladies in their accidental satisfaction of admitting to their arms a lover of so brisk and airy a deportment and a man so full of mirth and vigor  a very fair proceeding of the turkish ladies the room wherein they lay was long and broad with beds all laid in order along either side and each desirous first to offer him a part of hers they raised a sort of war among them till it was resolved that all should draw a lot a piece and stand to the decision  this then at last they all agreed to and with scissars cut a crimson ribband into five and twenty pieces each a little longer than the former these they made the sailor hold and drew their lots in order she who had the longest was that very night to have him for her bedfellow and so proportionably she who had unfortunately drawn the shortest lot was doomed to be the farthest distant from his wished embraces  the order they contrived to keep thus had they formed almost an whole months task for the poor sailor who never used to think on time to come and therefore went contentedly to bed with his fair firstnight mistress we will not doubt the satisfaction which he met with but proceed to tell the reader that an hour before the break of day that lady who was next to be his partner came and waked him from a pleasing slumber lest he should unluckily by oversleeping his security be found as soon as morning broke by the eunuch who was always used to walk his rounds about that time and this was the concluded order they were all to take for their assured security  i scarce believe our amorous tarpawlin when the cool reflection of his waking senses represented his condition found himself so pleasant as the night before but he had gone too far to think of going back till he had done the duty they expected from him and therefore wisely thought it best to seem transported with his present past and future happiness the contrivance which they made to hide him in short they led him to a very high and spacious prss or rather wardrobe for it was the place wherein they used to hang their clothes in this repository he was forced to stand or lie all day and had the door by chance been opened he had yet perhaps continued undiscovered hid all over by the clothes about him  the master of the house would often come and pass some hours every day amongst his women so that all day long the sailor was confined to keep his station yet wanted little else but liberty for he had meat and drink far more than he required their good natured manner of getting him provisions which the good humored ladies ordered to be set aside pretending they would eat it at another time and taking some convenient opportunity when all was safe they carried it directly to their pounded amoroso  all overturned by an unlucky accident they passed about ten days and nights without the smallest fear or danger of discovery when an unlucky accident fell out and ruined all it happened that the lady to whose turn twas come that night to claim the sailor for her bedfellow was taken by the turk her lord and master to the unexpected favor of his own enjoyment so that she whose lot came next was sooner than she thought of mistress of her long hoped happiness but when the next turn came the lady who the night before had lawfully possessed her husbands bed renewed her title to the balked enjoyment of the sailors person which she who next expected it denied with fervor urging that she having lost her turn should stay till last of all before she could in justice lay a second claim to what she aimed at  the sailors dangerous discovery words were multiplied to noisy disputations and from thence they fell to downright blows about the matter till the house alarmed by their disturbance waked the eunuch who came running to the chamber to demand the cause of their so sudden disagreement and the first thing he took particular notice of was the poor sailor who was got among the thickest of the fray to interpose the best of his endeavors for appeasing their tumultuous violence  his bold attempt to get away the eunuch all amazed to see a man so strangely dressed among the ladies came and caught him roughly by the shoulder who surpised as much to find himself discovered struck the old and feeble eunuch such a blow upon the head as beat him to the ground and running to the window never staid to look for sheots which if he had he would have missed but venturing his neck to save his liberty leaped nimbly down and lighting on the soft and yielding mould received no hurt but made a shift to clamber up a gate which opened to the lane and after half an hours rambling up and down half dead with fear came out upon the port where lay an english vessel half unladen close upon the key he got onboard and overjoyed at his escape went next morning to the vessel he belonged to which departed two days after bound for alexandria  the liberality of the turkish ladies he brought off ten or twelve considerable diamonds of a greater value than the profits of a hundred of his voyages could possibly amount to every lady gratefully bestowing one the night she bedded him had he but staid to have gone through the family he had grown rich by their successive bounties but he had cause to be contented with his fortune eitherway and what will serve to make this accident the more diverting is that when the eunuch rose and looked about him the ingenious ladies joined to tell him an amazing story how the man he saw came in and frighted them which passing for a truth they saved their reputations and perhaps their lives while it was commonly reported round the city that the devil or an infidel had entered the haramm of such a nobleman nor was it known which way he had got in or how he could find means to get away again  a story of the unfortunate intrigue of a french ambassadors secretary less fortunate though equally adventurous was the comical amor of a young gentleman secretary to the french ambassador at constantinople about the year   00 who attempting to have bribed an eunuch of a turkish noblemans haramm received encouragement to hope admission on a certain night when coming by direction of the abovenamd eunuch to a certain woodpile in the yard belonging to the house wherein they were he mounted on the loggs and waited for a summons  he had not long continued there before a certain lady purposely as twas reported afterward admitted to a chamber very near him came and looked about her at the window the amorous monsieur had no sooner fixed his eyes upon her a silent way of making love but believing that to be the future object of his love he put in practice all the lears bows cringes and grimaces he was capable of using  but while thus employed upon the turkish woodpile the master of the house who had been told the secret by his faithful eunuch came attended by a number of his servants and apprehended him amidst the numerous airs of his too distant courtship the bad success of his amor no excuse could plead his pardon but he was immediately led out and in the very gate set open purposely to gather lookers on received two hundred bastinadoes on the soles of his feet and was turned out to hop along the streets and reach his home as well as his sore bruises would permit him  the turks sharp answer to the french ambassadors complaint complaints were made by the ambassador his master but the turkish court returned for answer that as all their dealings with the several ministers of foreign princes had been hitherto directed by the customs of their country so they knew not well to grant a satisfaction for an accident which had not yet afforded them a precedent thereby insinuating that the secretary had so greatly and so openly affronted the turk who bastinadod him that twas an action whose peculiar insolence was past example  loves blind effects excuseable in all men let love excuse the amorous frenchmans rash attempt or rather his miscarriage it is a flame will burn in every country and the smoke it raises may excuse the blindness of the objects which it seizes on no man can always run too fast for following indiscretion and you know who tells us nemo omnibus horis sapit no man is always free from folly well spoke that ancient greek who asks this question in the very case we now are treating on   ah brainless youth in vain you fly from love he is winged and you on foot who then must swiftest move   the turkish ladys want of honor rather to be pitied than condemned consider readers when you see this strange account of the fair sex in turkey it is not nature but the rules of education which inspire the most accomplished chastity with purer notions and if the rude and barbarous ignorance wherein the turkish women are obliged to live has sacrificed their honor to the warmth of their desires rather pity than condemn their want of virtue and remember in compassion of their frailties that humanum est errare it is natural for all mankind to go astray   chap xv of the turkish customs and ceremonies in conversation in describing the general customs of the turkish conversation twill be the plainest method to begin with their morning exercises and trace them through the various entertainments of a busy day for when you know what manner of living is practiced by the richest and most active of their people you may easily guess at the less stately or stirring life of the remainder  the first employment whereto great men in turkey put the day each then obeys for the most part the summons of the earliest cock and rising from his mattress for featherbeds are never used in turkey his slaves attend in an obsequious reverence to wait his motions to the bagnio which great men constantly build in their houses others must be contented with the public ones here when thoroughly cleansd they rub him with napkins till he is dry and then attend him silently to that part of his house he pleases to be dressed in every servant knows his office one puts on his shirt another his wastcoat the third his vest and another his turbant till he is at last completely ready  their diversions when at home if he intends a visit he commands his attendants to put themselves in order and in the mean time sits cross legged on a cushion in the corner of some saffrai looking into his gardens smoking tobacco drinking coffee or perhaps playing at chess with some favorite eunuch which are the only domestic diversions in use amongst them  their manner of making visits when his horse is ready for they seldom visit on foot he comes gravely down to the gate of his house through a double row of his attendants who laying their hands on their bosoms bow slowly to the ground and kiss the corners of his vest which is the common salutation of the turks to their superiors his horse is covered with a stately caparison of cloth of gold or silver sometimes adorned with jewels which reaches from under the saddle to his heels his stirrops are of silver and so large as to contain his whole foot they are held while he mounts by two of his servants and when he moves he is followed by a great number of them on foot walking two by two at equal distance how they receive each other at their houses in this order he proceeds to the house of him he would visit having before given him notice where alighting at the bottom of the stairs he is conducted through double rows of servants to the presence of their master who meets him nearer to or farther from his room of state according to the difference of their quality though to christians they never stir out of their places but receive them sitting after the mutual compliments of somewhat declining their bodies with their hand on their bosom they proceed through several rooms to that they are to sit in the stranger as they walk always taking the left hand preferred as the noblest place in conversation because whoever has it is supposed to be master of the others seymetar as i think i have in the foregoing part informed my reader when they are entered they advance to that elevated part of the floor called the saffrai and place themselves crosslegd opposite to each other on cushions richly covered with their hands upon their laps like our women  how they are entertained in visits now begins discourse which is hardly entered on when several pages richly dressed bring in a silk or muslin handkerchief finely embroidered and spread it on the strangers lap then comes another with a salver containing several sorts of sweetmeats in little spoons like those we use for tea some of these he eats and is immediately attended by a third with a dish of coffee that drank the handkerchief is taken away and they withdraw but the visiter has hardly renewed his discourse when they return again with another handkerchief which being spread as before one sprinkles sweetwater in his face from a silver bottle and another smoking his beard and the inside of his vest with burnt perfume from a golden incensepan they withdraw again these two ceremonies are usually performed at the pages discretion as to the time between them but there remains a third which they must wait their masters call for and that is the bringing in a large dish of sherbet of an excellent flavor which as soon as the stranger has drank he takes leave and goes away a very odd custom for it is their custom never to call for that liquor till they grow weary of their visiters company  they seldom eat above one meal a day and that a dinner they are rarely known to be luxurious in their appetite and are yet extremely covetous of heaping vast and numerous sums of money from the offices they hold unskilled in that incomparable doctrine of horace in the twelfth epistle of his first book hor epist    lib    toll querelas pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit vsus si ventri been si lateri est pedibusque tuis nil divitiae poterunt regales addere majus  cease your complaints it is not the want of riches makes men poor nor can your wealth a lasting bliss procure if you have meat and drink and habit too oh learn content what more can riches do   the turkish diet their diet is but course and rarely varied consisting generally of boiled hens or mutton and a sort of buttered rice of late much used in britain where it is called according to the turkish name pilowe their butter is not made like ours but on the contrary is nothing else but sheeps tail fat once melted down and so preserved in certain skins for common uses  sheep with tails so large that they are forced to draw them after em on carriages and since i mention turkish sheep it will not be digressive from the subject i am upon to tell you that there are in many provinces of persia and the grand signiors country sheep whose tails are so prodigiously encumbred with an incredible load of fat that twenty thirty often forty english pounds of grease are taken from the tail of one sole sheep nay to such a bulk and weight they sometimes grow that it is a very common scene in many parts of turkey to behold em dragging after them their ponderous rumps on twowheeld carriages contrived on purpose  turkish pies another sort of diet used among the turks are certain pies indifferently baked and filled with meats of various kinds but so excessively and past all relish mixed with garlic that the strongest appetite of france it self could scarce digest them  their manner of dressing roastmeat they seldom roast and when they do observe a very different manner from the europaean practice all their fires are made in holes cut one or two foot deep in earth about the several parts of all their kitchins an iron engine shaped not much unlike a gibbet holds a string which fastned to some part of any thing they roast turns gradually round and so prepares it for their easy palates  a very savory sort of dish in use among the turks one dish they have in frequent use of relish not unsavory which may be named a sort of forced meat it consists of many kinds of flesh all minced and chopped together with the rind of limons nutmegs pepper cloves and cinnamon all this they roll when seasoned into balls of reasonable sizes wrapping them about with doubled bay leaves newly gathered and proceeding so to roast em with a gentle fire this i think they call kabobb and is if my skilled country cooks will take my word a sort of palatable preparation worth the imitating  their way of making bread as for bread they use no other than a sort of flat and doughbackd cake they call ecmeck they make it of a course and illground flour rendred moist by milk and water after it is kneaded they proceed to press it out with heavy rolling pins and cutting cakes in trencher form lay many on an heated hearth by one another throwing over them the hot and burning ashes till they judge em baked sufficiently by which means they are very harsh and grating in the teeth as if some sand had fallen upon them  their manner of eating when they eat they use no plates knives forks or any thing but wooden spoons not much unlike the fashion of our ladles these cakes of bread supply the place of plates or trenchers upon them they lay their meat so thoroughly boiled or roasted that they tear with ease what part they choose by the assistance of their fingers eating last of all the plates themselves as did aeneas and his newly landed trojans thus described by virgil in his seventh aeneid virg aen   consumptis heic forte aliis ut vertere morsus exiguam in cererem penuria adegit edendi et violare manu malisque audacibus orbem fatalis crusti patulis nec parcere

posture of the servants the towel that goes round on all their laps the man who reaches water from the fountain the carpet on the floor and every figure in the piece is done as naturally as is possible depiction of turks of quality at dinner turks of quality at dinner to her grace mary duchess of ormond etc this plate is most humbly dedicated  s bois    while having swiftly swallowed all their meat nor finding further dainties left to eat insatiate hunger not yet fully fed forced their keen teeth to gnaw their smallshard bread with eager jaws and hands to bite and tear the poor remains of their portentous fare nor even the very plates themselves to spare see cried ascanius we no morsel lose but make those trenchers meat which we for meat should use   their postures when they eat they sit at meals crosslegd about a table scarce so much as half foot high made hollow and the inside plated over with tin or silver in their laps there lies a long course towel very narrow reaching round the whole table whose uncovered surface contains their several dishes still removed as soon as tasted to make room for others only differing in the color of the soop wherein their meat is brought before em  the drink they use at meals as for drink they rarely use at dinner any other than the fountain water commonly at hand in all their dining rooms and taken up in silver gold or earthen cups that moment it is called for by the servants who attend them it is seldom known that all the family sit down together to their meat one smoaks another sings a third perhaps is playing on his fiddle one is eating and a fifth employed at chess with some companion of no greater stomach than him self but that their ways of eating and their postures when about it may be understood more fully i have here annexed a cut wherein the reader may behold em plainly represented  they commonly delight in sprightly exercises after dinner as believing em conducive to their healths and reputation many sports they use all which i shall describe in proper order and will first proceed to treat about their hurling the geritt the favorite exercise of all these people  hurling the dart a common exercise in turkey this manly sport is not unlike perhaps the same with that ancient roman custom of darting javelins from their hands the vigor wherewith they threw them and the execution they performed when thrown may be conceived by the description of the death of turnus in virgils last aeneid virg aen ult cunctanti telum aeneas fatale coruscat sortitus fortunam oculis and corpore toto

power and lifting all his body to the throw aimed at his rivals breast a dreadful blow not from stone walls by battring engines broke with half such horrid roar resounds the stroke not meeting thunderclaps which rend the sky with such loud shocks roll on and striking backwards fly the javelin flew like a black whirlwind strong bearing grim death with hissing force along till through the edge of his broad sevnfold shield it pierced his coat of mail unused to yield transfixed his thigh with a surprising wound and nailed with folded knee great turnus to the ground   the turks how skilled therein nor is the turkish skill inferior to the roman in this celebrated exercise which is so common and thereby so exquisitely known that some are found among them who with one strong throw at fifty five yards distance will with blunt unheaded wooden javelins break a door of near inch thickness into twenty pieces  nay to such perfection are the turks arrived in this encouraged practice that they never miss the smallest mark they aim at using the diversion both on horseback and on foot and catching with their hands the weapons of their enemies in certain skirmishes by way of single combat or a party of an hundred twenty ten or more or less against an equal number the beauty of their graceful forms of exercising it it is a curious sight and worthy observation to behold their admirable horsemanship and dextrous management of these gerits at certain public and appointed trials by the way of challenge where an emulative fire inspiring either side with hopes of conquest leads em on to act as cautiously as if in earnest it is amazingly agreeable to see these men amidst an hissing multitude of darts which fly continually from side to side behave themselves with free and unaffected carelessness with ease defending every part and turning prancing rearing and curvetting on their warlike horses as if they were not two distinct and separated bodies  their dexterity in several admirable points they bear within the left side of their horses girt a certain cane of crooked top not much unlike a crook or nuthook with which they suddenly snatch up whatever javelin lies upon the ground which some can do without such help by bending from their saddles in the swiftest gallop others there are found in turkey who will throw a dart with all their strength a little rising as it flys and watching eagerly the course it takes spurr violently on and catch it as it is inclined to fall some yards before it comes upon the ground and this they often will repeat for twenty sometimes thirty casts together  and now since i occasionally spoke of turkish horsemanship i will describe the manner of their riding which together with the graceful shape courageous nature and the swiftness of their horses renders them the surest and politest horsemen of the universe  the turkish saddles and caparisons their saddles are of deep and solid make of gentle rise behind and bearing at the bow a sort of high and round steel brass or silver headed pummel very dangerous to men unused to riding they tie their upper girt quite round the saddle under which is fastned to three buckles a caparison which falling largely back hangs almost to the ground and being made of silk or cloth of various colors is embroidered richly with a gold or silver wire and oftentimes set thick with precious stones of a surprising luster and inestimable value their bitts are excellently made of polished steel so sharp and yet so easy that when gently held they cannot hurt a softmouthd horse and yet upon occasion will control a lion all the bridles used by gentlemen are made about the breadth of one of our inches of a sort of fine and twisted silk of green blue scarlet white or any other color  their way of riding both their bridles and their breastplates are adorned with massy plates of brass or silver gilt genteely and their stirrops of a very large unweildy size with four sharp corners which supply the want of spurrs upon their boots for those they never wear in turkey they are fastned strongly to the saddle frame but hang so short that they are forced to ride with knees quite bent as when they sit its advantage over ours but though this posture may not seem so graceful to the eye as ours in christendom it is yet far more secure and useful for by this means turkish horsemen rising in their stirrops and elonging all their bodies to each stroke they give both reach as far again as we can do and strike with twice the strength of europaean cavalry and it is in imitation of this eastern custom that the hussars of our army ride so short and are esteemed so useful in pursuits or parties  their use of bows and arrows another exercise much used among the turks is shooting for a prize with bows and arrows at which they are expert and dextrous as i have said before but practice this diversion in a very dull and slothful manner always near the mark and shooting at a sort of plastered target while they fit in rows upon the shady grass and send their servants for the arrows as they use em their bows how made all their bows are toughly made of hardened horns of buffelos mixed with steel of admirable workmanship and finely gilt and painted with an airy mixture of bright sylvan colors  the turkish way of wrestling wrestlers are esteemed and very common but unskillfull in the dextrous art of tripping fairly all their method is to strip their bodies naked to the middle oil their joints and stooping forward very low run aukwardly about each other making sudden strange and uncouth noises to surprise or startle their antagonist and snatching with their hands his leg or thigh so throw him upon his back without so much as ever making use of their own legs about it  ropedancers and juglers ropedancers and a sort of juglers are encouraged to perform their several tricks to please with mean amusements in the open street such persons as will stand and gather round their exercises who contribute something each to pay their labors when a fellow brings about a certain wooden dish to every one of the spectators and desires their penny twopence or whatever more or less they please to give him  the carriages in turkey the carriages in use in turkey are a sort of long and heavy wagons drawn by buffelos a kind of beast not much unlike an ox but stronger far and larger by one half their horns are long and spread to such considerable breadth that i have seen the tips or utmost points almost two yards asunder  their unfamiliar way of living i have told before their manner of saluting one another as for visiting they seldom use it and when business leads em to each others houses they are always entertained in outward rooms nor are their wives permitted to appear nor grow acquainted with their neighbors consorts  their manner of sleeping in their clothes they sleep on quilts extremely hard and very often in their clothes by which continued custom they are some of them so lousy that you cannot pass a street without observing three or four employed while sitting at their door or in their shops in searching for and killing those encroaching vermin nor do they blush to be discovered in so strange an action common practice having made a fashion of this lazy pastime  they make water like women when they have occasion to make water they withdraw from public observation and like women couch themselves almost upon the ground least by an accidental drop or two upon their clothes they should become defiled they spit with scorn to see a christian stand against a wall and sometimes strike him as they pass along to signify their hatred of his action and immodesty  a story how a gentleman was circumcised for pissing against a turkish mosque i very well remember that i landed once at candy with about four more all englishmen and strangers to the customs of the country we were busy in observing as we walked along the buildings of the city and afforded as surprising objects as we looked upon by being dressed in english habits till at last an inconsiderate and unluckly member of our company who found himself inclined to vrinate turned round with far more confidence than wit to do it just against the corner of a turkish mosque  the people with a sudden hollow flew about us and began to use us somewhat roughly but a mild deportment and submissive carriage saved all harmless but the frighted criminal he poor man was doomed to suffer certain insolent and unrestrained levants the sailors of the country came about him with their knives all drawn and having a long time beaten him about the head obliged him to lie down upon his back and never waiting for the usual ceremonies circumcised the struggling and complaining gentleman with butcherlike incision  they said abundance but to little purpose for we understood not then one syllable of turkish yet supposed they were upbraiding the offender and advising him to err no more lest he should meet a second sort of circumcision far more fatal than the former and indeed the suffering person was beyond expression overjoyed to find his loss not half so great as he at first expected it complaints are vain where remedies are never found so we were glad to march contentedly away resolving for the future to avoid the danger which our friend had met with  a comical humor of the gentleman in relation to his mistress shame and regret so much confounded him that he endeavored once or twice to drown himself upon receiving a kind amorous letter from a mistress he had left in england and would often swear he never would return because of his misfortune but it seems some merry gentleman of his acquaintance writ a letter to the lady and informed her of his resolution and the accident which caused it and upon her writing to her lover that she knew the business and was glad it was no worse the poor dispirited gallant took courage once again and ventured to go back he married her immediately on his return and since he found her satisfied has little reason to continue melancholy i could tell the reader a more pleasant story of another gentleman but he is unmarried and might chance to lose his mistress by the bargain  what the turks hunt with dogs hunting is an exercise in which the turks take great delight sometimes with dogs and sometimes without with dogs but far inferior to our english breed they course the stagg fox hare and other swift defenseless animals but when they hunt the lion leopard tiger boar or other forest beasts they use the dogs for nothing but to rouse the game and leave it to their management  how they hunt wild beasts in turkey they have both weekly monthly and yearly hunting matches when the gentlemen about the country gather in a great and formidable body at some noted place of rendezvous each mounted bravely on some horse that has been trained to warlike discipline and armed with a large oval target full of spikes almost yard long which hangs on their left sides upon their shoulders certain quivers full of the beforenamd geritts or steel pointed javelins and in their girdles stick a pair or two of small skrewbarreld pistols besides all these a crooked backsword arms their thigh when thus accoutred they obey the summons of the captains trumpets one distinguished by that title being always over them  the form they ride in the common form wherein they ride is that of an extended crescent or half moon whereby encompassing the corner of a wood they send in dogs to rouse the beasts about it which the cautious currs no sooner have performed but they come barking back and save themselves from danger by retiring underneath the horses heels if it is a lion or a tiger they disturb those often have the courage to run roaring forward and attack the party  when the beast is seen approaching every man prepares his target for his own defense unknowing where he aims his vengeance while the furious salvage makes directly at some singled horseman who opposing his sharppointed shield the leaping beast is wounded deeply and while redoubling disappointed efforts closed upon by the surrounding party who discharge a shower of javelins at his body till he falls and dies amidst a thousand wounds  when they shoot wild beasts with pistols but if as sometimes has been known the man at whom the lion leaps is ignorant at his defense and lets him seize his back or shoulder with a dreadful paw the company no more prefer their sport to their companions safety but ride in upon the beast and shoot him dead with pistol bullets  how they hunt the boar the boar they often hunt on foot with spears of steel and having roused his bristled anger wait his coming with a cautious eye and leaping from his tusks as he runs swiftly by them take him on the turn with strange agility and strike him through the heart with their abovenamd boar spears  how wildcats are hunted wildcats or catsof mountains there afford an excellent diversion they frequent the woods and leap about from tree to tree insomuch that all who hunt them are obliged to wear a sort of headpiece for it is very common to behold em jump upon the shoulders of their hunters and endeavor so to wound them till they are prevented by the dart or pistolshot of some behind them  the manner of a turkish coffeehouse coffeehouses are frequented by all sorts of people for it is there they meet to talk of news divert themselves with smoking telling stories or hearing novels read yet are these coffeehouses different from ours in that they only are a sort of stalls like tailors shopboards open to the street and capable of holding twelve or fourteen men who meeting there sit crosslegd for an hour or two to pass away the time which lies upon their hands with several different kinds of innocent diversions  opium how and by whom taken among the turks opium has in former times been taken as a cordial by the generality of men among the turks and certainly that custom owed its introduction to the prohibition of the use of wine yet now it is much disused and mostly practiced by the lawyers scribes and such whose heads are ever busied in affairs of great and high importance these by constant use become enabled to digest a quantity of force sufficient to destroy three other men its chief effect is for a while to elevate the senses to a wondrous pitch of mirth and gayety but in few hours they must renew the means or their agreeable and brisk deportment will be soon transformed to a surprising dullness and unguessd stupidity  an excellent custom to encourage industry there is an admirable custom first no doubt designed as an encouragement to industry by so persuasive an example that the sultans must profess some certain trade or calling so to be the better able should their fate require it to get their livings by their own handlabour thus some are taught the art of turning cups and balls in lignum vitae others learn to dress up turbants some make bows and some embroider every one in short who has the smallest prospect of succession to the throne of turkey being taught some useful and ingenious art to honor and promote industrous applications  i have as fully treated of their ways of living in this chapter as is needful or diverting to the reader who may see thereby that though they boast no sunshine of illustrious learning nor the more polite and ceremonious customs of the christian world they are not altogether void of form and order in their public or their private wheels of government proceed we now to trace them to their graves and see their offices of mourning and respect for such as having run the course of nature drop a sleep and make their exits  chap xvi of the turkish funerals moral reflections on the consequences of superstition to what a strange degree will superstition lead astray the minds of mortals and how wonderfully blinded in a cloud of ignorance and obstinacy must our senses lie when even the brightest ray of truth it self wants force to dissipate our errors  yet such a darkness sways the judgment of the turkish nation nor can even the plainest demonstrations of their most ridiculous selfcontradictory and erroneous principles convince them of their folly they are hardened in their resolutions to persist vnthinkingly in what they have so long maintained and the increasing weight of dangerous pride has shut the door against their reason  the turks unhappy in a grounded obstinacy the follies of our lives forsake us seldom where we see them not and the unhappy turks believing all their superstitious notions sacred truth die as they live and have as strange and unaccountable opinions of a future state between their death and gaining paradise as of the pleasures which they dream will there present themselves it is pity that a people so prodigiously successful and so full of power should be hoodwinked from the knowledge of a more refined and heavenly doctrine how true is that expression of the greek theognis  true wisdom knows a more exalted bliss than boundless power or mighty empire is   for want of that the turks mistake the road to truth and wander both in life and death alike estranged from reason or the smallest share of solid judgment  the ceremonies used by the turks in sickmens chambers when any of this people weak and aged by the course of nature or perhaps invaded by the raging pains of a distempered body are supposed by their acquaintance or relations any ways in danger of approaching death they flock in numbers to the sick mans chamber and endeavor to persuade him that he ought contentedly to meet his fate and cheerfully resign his soul to him who gave it making him repeated protestations of their great affection and assurances that they had rather die to keep him company than live to lose his valued conversation they sing incessantly in doleful strains a kind of melancholy songs whereby they think they charm the evil angel who attends to kill him the subject of these songs is the profession of their love not much unlike but far less tuneful than the    th ode of the second book of horace where he thus addresses his expression to the indisposed maecenas hor ode    lib   d cur me querelis exanimas tuis nec diis amicum est nec mihi te prius obire maecenas mearum grande decus columenque rerum ah te meae si partem animae rapit maturior vis quid moror altera oh why maecenas should you thus unkind with your complaining murmurs rack my mind believe me it is not kind to heaven nor me that you should first to death a victim be you the great ornament of all my fate and generous prop of my depending state ah if too swift a call this mournful day must snatch my souls dear better half away why should the other part imperfect longer stay   their ceremonies immediately on a friends death but when the fleeting breath of the departed mortal has forsook his body and they find no further room for hope they tear their clothes and for a while abandon over their reason to the force of passion weeping with a long immoderate sorrow till at last those kinsmen farthest from his blood begin to dry their eyes and strive to comfort him whose nearness of alliance to the person of the deceased requires him to appear chief mourner at his obsequies they first condole his loss and then proceed to such advice as the so late named horace gives his brother poet on the death of quinctilius hor ode   d lib   multis ille bonis flebilis occidit nulli flebilior quam tibi virgili tu frustra pius heu non ita creditum poscis quinctilium deos he is dead and when he lost his precious breath a thousand pious people mourned his death yet none o virgil does like you complain and even your self alas lament in vain for not the utmost pity you can show will bring his summoned ghost from the dark shades below   the melancholy mourner must a while resist their strongest arguments but by degrees is brought to own with them the notions of the same abovenamd author durum sed levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas it is hard but patience makes that burden light against which it is vain to strive and sin to fight   so that when their tears are dried away and they have time for ceremony they proceed to do their other duties in the following manner  their way of laying out dead bodies the men by men and women by the help of their own sex are in the midst of some large room laid out as here in england on a carpet mat or something meaner answerable to their quality a crowd of friends swarm round the body which is naked on the ground and having turned it nine times round and round with prayers and invocations for the mercy of almighty god they lather it with soap and water shaving it from head to foot with sharp edged razors  after this they wash it clean with milk and water somewhat warm a very strange expression of respect then tie their beads or other little toys about his limbs which is a fashionable method of expressing their affection but the strangest custom i have ever found among the practices of any nation is a method they have got to wound their bosoms with a pin or bodkin and receive as much of their own blood upon their fingers end as will enable them to write distinctly in a crimson character their names and ages on the breast of the deceased  how they fold the body then fold they up the body in a linen sheet which twists about a dozen times the compass of the corpse but is left open at the top and bottom for a pleasant sort of reason which i shall hereafter mention and which superstition has persuaded them to think sufficient  when they bear em to the grave it is commonly about the close of day and with a numerous train of the acquaintance and relations of the late deceased the manner you will see described at large in the cut that is annexed hereto but for the readers further satisfaction i will set down all the order which the turks observe at the most celebrated funerals of men of high and noted quality  their forms of marching to a funeral first march a train of grave derveeshes or the priests of whom i spoke in a foregoing chapter these bear a certain number of large flaming torches and with melancholy looks and careful slow and heavy steps foretell the people what is coming after them  next follow other priests who by their wringing hands and shaking heads and other such expressive signs of sorrow seem as much concerned as if the parts they only act were true and real  an explanation of the plate which represents the prospect of a turkish funeral a a the grave and people gathered round it b b b the churchyard c the torch bearers d d d the priests and hired mourners e e e e four fine led horses f f the trailers of the ensigns g the turbant which lies at the head of the bier and marks the quality of the deceased h the dead body upon the bier i two priests who follow the corpse k k k k k the company invited to the funeral l l two christian travelers looking on m the guide who attends them depiction of a turkish funeral to sr alexander cairnes of monaghan n the kingdom of ireland baronet his representation of a turkish funeral is respectfully dedicated      the turks all mourn in white then come several men who bear along large ensigns trailing far upon the ground behind em after them four six or ten led horses at an equal distance led by grooms on foot come slowly forward covered to the heels with fine white cloth for that is the turkish mourning treading with a grave and heavy step as if they knew the cause of their appearance  how the body lies upon the bier now comes the body carried on a bier by four tall men half covered over with the mourning cloth which falls about em from the bier and hangs upon the ground the corpse is born head foremost through the city wrapped in linen with his face uncovered and a turbant at his crown whose shape or magnitude denotes his quality they never bury them in coffins so they lie all open to the public view bestrewd with every flower which may happen then to flourish  behind the corpse immediately appear two venerable priests with turbants of a large and stately size who all the way they go with elevated eyes and arms extended sometimes striking furiously against their breasts call vehemently on the name of god pronouncing it a thousand times with awful sound and melancholy accent  the close of the procession in the rear of the procession walk his friends in graceful order two by two with handkerchiefs to wipe away the tears they shed for grief or fashion women go not to the funerals of men nor men to those of women unless it be a number for their safety and performance of the ceremonies requisite in burials  their church yards how and where placed churchyards among the turks are always placed without the town or in some wild and vacant place within it as for ground they never mind to choose it level hills and dales are all alike and for the space of sometimes full three miles about you see a sort of grove or wood if the expression be allowed of lofty stones for at the head and foot of every grave is placed a marble of the shape and bigness of a common man the only way they have to signalize the memory of noblemen i mean great officers among them is to carve the tops of both the stones they fasten at his grave to represent a turbant of a size or form which speaks his quality they strew the ground with odoriferous flowers and often plant such little trees and herbs as are for ever green and flourishing a charitable custom of the turkish women three times a week the women meet in all their coemiterys to condole the loss of dead relations with continued howlings for about two hours leaving when they go away on every grave meat drink and money as a charitable offering to the numerous poor who afterward come in and taking what they find there left do gratefully repeat a certain number of petitions for the soul of the deceased proportionable to the alms bestowed upon them  their ceremonies at the grave hither then they bring the corpse and coming to the grave first lay it on the earth and gather round it every one repeating prayers for his delivery from the punishment of purgatory for they hold as i have said before a middle state this done they bury him without a further ceremony and filling up the grave with earth return again in order as they came  a very strange notion of an examination in the grave now says the turkish doctrine they no sooner leave the body in the ground but up start two black horrid angels with their hands of steel and heads of fire these immediately rejoin the soul and body and by force oblige the frighted wretch to sit upright while they with great sharp knives of fiery substance cut the body widely open and examine nicely all his heart to see what sort of life he led while here on earth if they perceive his good deeds more in number than his evil actions they with humble congees sneak away and in their room come two bright spirits from the realms of bliss who lay him gently down to rest again and sitting one to guard his head the other to protect his feet attend him so till the great day of universal judgment  the punishments they fancy illmen undergo but if they find as ten to one they do that his ill actions have surpassed his good ones one black angel with an hammer of a thousand weight with fury strikes him on the head and beats him eighteen fathoms under ground by which time being turned in passage like a shuttlecock the other fiend receives him at the bottom with another blow as fatal as the former and thereby sends him swiftly up again so continuing to knock him up and down till mahomet their prince of mercy shall in gracious pity of his human frailties condescend to grant a short reprieve which being passed the bloody executioners strait fall to work again as roughly as before and this opinion so prevails in their imaginations that they always in their prayers for friends deceased implore the mercy of almighty god to ease them from the torture of the two black angels and it is for these two fiends convenience that as i said before the winding sheet is left untied at top and bottom  nine days successively the dead mans friends assemble at his grave and pray together for the welfare of his soul that time of mourning over they erect a monument of little cost  but not unless he was of a distinguished quality upon the flats whereof appear engraved in turkish characters the several graces and accomplished excellencies which adorned his person with peculiar merit while he lived and flourished  a pleasant kind of burial some are buried in their gardens and have tombs built over them adorned with jessamines and all the odoriferous plants which blooming spring perfumes the world with whose delightful shades embracing with a sort of melancholy closeness the half covered pillars of thebaick marble afford a pleasing and surprising prospect through a grated opening in the outward wall formed purposely to let all passengers behold the monument  the mausolaeums of the turkish emperors the sultans who have built large mosques in constantinople and who shall be spoken of in the chapter relating to that city have their rich and stately mausolaeums near the temples where assemble daily numbers of poor pilgrims who receive a certain alms to pray for the departed soul of him whose liberality they then are blessed with many lamps are constantly kept burning and a set of priests maintained on purpose to inspect the duties of the place which are both numerous and superstitious even beyond imagination  epitaphs of modern use among the turks it is seldom known that any other epitaph is placed upon a tomb than just a plain account of the condition name age sex and time of burial of the person there interred yet it is of late become a custom with the richest and most noble of their people here and there to order certain short and witty verses to be made upon the virtues of the dead and either carved or writ in golden letters on the marble monument i will transcribe and print in english one or two of different kinds that you may better guess their manner of composing them here follows one upon the death of ishmael bashaw the governor of constantinople who was killed in battle at the great defeat the turks received in passing over the river raab in hungary to fight the german and hungarian forces under the command of general montecuculi on the   th of july anno domini      an epitaph upon a turkish general killed in battle by the germans here by his two good angels guarded lies ishmael bashaw in war the germans prize they killed him basely ever the stream he passed he won but lost again because he won too fast o infidels beware he who perplexed your souls while in this world will damn em in the next   another follows of a merry strain upon a certain orange merchant who died in his first wives arms upon his wedding night in which they seem to show a love of puns by jesting on his profession an epitaph upon a man who died in his wives arms on his wedding night alas alas here free from cares and strife lies one embraced to death by his first wife had thou been sowr as persian limons are thou had not met a fate so sharp so rare but as thou wast an orange thou art dead for women love such sweetness even in bed and she who by thee chanced that night to lie tasted thee found thee sweet and quickly sucked thee dry   i could insert some others which i now have by me but the two abovewritten will suffice to show their genius and the turkish taste of wit in epitaphs  chap xvii of the public and private buildings of turkey the reason why the turks neglect great buildings amongst the various and innumerable follies which possess the turks they boast one prudence and maintain it with an argument that is it is indiscreet and next to madness to employ their thoughts and constant labors in the raising lofty and stupendous palaces whose solid forms may probably outlive the very memory of their forgotten founders why should we cry the turks bestow our cares and riches on the vain contrivance of magnificent and stately structures when we neither know if we shall live to morrow nor are sure to leave our sumptuous habitations to an heirs possession of our race or our religion horace wisely in his second book and eighteenth ode reproves this folly hor ode    lib   tu secanda marmora locas sub ipsum funus and sepulchri immemor struis domos in hewing marble all thy hours unthinking wretch roll on when the swift call of deaths keen powers shall snatch thee hence anon in building palaces of state you waste your measured breath vainly affecting to look great unmindful of your death   the ancient buildings of greece quite ruined and forgotten nor are there now remaining many of those vast and unexampled buildings of antiquity whose stately spires and venerable piles in former times were wont to crown the face of greece with an amazing majesty almost all those ancient marks of pride and grandeur are entirely ruined and effaced from even the nicest ken of curious observation and if any yet remain they are so mouldred and deformed by penetrating time and ages injuries that they will hardly serve to any other end than the presenting a memento to the frailties of mortality and telling lookers on with a prevailing silence and the horrid marks of an experienced desolation what ausonius says when he declares that mors etiam saxis nominibusque venit how wide alas does deaths dominion fly when even our names themselves and stones must die   the public buildings more magnificent the turks however negligent in the magnificent and lasting structure of their houses spare no pains no art nor money in their public buildings such as mosques or churches bagnios hans and hospitals which with their common dwelling houses form the subject of this chapter and shall at large be treated of in their respective places  the situation of their mosques and first their mosques as dedicated to the service of the great almighty though in an erroneous and mistaken way of worship claim our observation they are ever situated on some elevated hill or rising spot of ground thereby appearing more majestically great and towering the common ones are seldom found so stately as our country churches and may be more particularly conceived if the reader will be pleased to look upon the form exactly represented in the figure marked by the letter o in the cut of a grecian wedding in the one and twentieth chapter  but the royal mosques or such as have from age to age been founded by the mighty turkish emperors deserve a more particular and full description which take as follows the turks unskilled in the ancient orders of architecture first observing that the turks unskilled in ancient orders of ionick dorick or corinthian buildings practice methods independent on the customs of our europaean architecture and proceed by measures altogether new and owing to the product of their own invention  the description of a royal turkish mosque they are built entirely of a spotless white and shining marble round in form and rising to a large and stately cupola supported nobly by a double sometimes treble row of pillars of a different order each from other yet without a name whereby i can express them in the british language their capitals and bases are not seldom formed of brass and frequently the columns ringd about with a continued piece of twining carvdwork of that very marble which composes the pillar sometimes other workmanship adorns them not unlike that raised work which italian architects distinguish by the name of basso relievo very often they are left quite plain but admirably polished by an art which gives them lasting luster  a sort of turret not unlike the monument in london the capitals of these high pillars support not only the abovenamed dome or cupola but a broad marble gallery which running round the whole circumference at several doors admits an entrance from four six or eight tall turrets which surround the outside of the mosque and are erected of an equal magnitude from top to bottom rising from the ground and reaching half as high again as to the center of the cupola at equal distance from each other every turret is adorned with two three sometimes four large tarrasses exactly like the gallery upon the monument on fishstreethill in london whence priests appointed for that duty call the people to assemble in the mosques at their divided hours of prayer  a glorious appearance the cupolas which often are surrounded with an hundred others small and close together like a bunch of grapes are with these small ones richly gilded as are frequently the spires of the abovenamed turrets so that the sunbeams reflected gloriously from their all dazzling luster strike the eyes of gazing strangers with a sort of new surprising pleasure  religious washing places round the bottom of the outward building are erected many cisterns curiously contrived with brazen cocks affording water for the ceremonious washings of the zealous turks who hold it an unpardonable crime to enter any mosque before their bodies are prepared by washings as directed by the precepts of their prophet mahomet  the fineness of the marble sides and floors a stately portico admits them to these mosques of wonderful contrivance and extensive magnitude here all who enter leave their slippers and advance barefooted upon mats or carpets which are spread at large and cover neatly all the floor which with the sides is flaggd with admirable squares of polished marble joined so closely that in many places it is a difficult attempt to undertake a quick discovery of any joint  images esteemed idolatrous all images as i have said before are so abhorred by the mahometans that they esteem it an idolatrous offense to have em in their houses so that consequently they are never found in mosques or places consecrated to the practice of religion the use of niches in the turkish mosques yet though images are disallowed the compass of the inner wall of all their mosques is full of niches such as in the europaean piles contain fine statues but are here appointed to another use for being large and deep beyond the christian form they fill the surface of those spacious hollows with the oftrepeated names of god and mahomet in broad and shining golden characters  from the great gallery which i just now informed you was supported by the capitals of those vast rows of pillars which secure the building certain broad and stately arches sloping downwards through the body of the church between the columns and the bottom of the cupola surprise a stranger with a distant prospect of the sides of the mosque and all within it terminating nobly in the latenamd niches rendered stately by the golden names of god and mahomet  within the temples ever burn prodigious numbers of glass lamps which hang about ten foot above the ground illuminating day and night the body of the church with a surprising brightness and requiring such an annual charge for the supply of oil and cotton that revenues are appropriated to that single use and such amazing numbers still continue burning in their royal mosques that i dare hardly hope belief when i inform my reader that in the mosque called sancta sophia at constantinople an incredible number of everburning lamps no fewer lamps are always lighted than thirty thousand and some outward odd ones  a description of the turkish bagnios to every mosque belongs a bagnio which as much frequented by the turish people is esteemed a building of no small importance these are often though not always built of marble square and spacious all divided into many and convenient chambers sweating rooms and cooling baths which each makes use as he finds himself inclined in every one of these divisions different cocks of brass admit what quantity of water hot or cold they think convenient and since as i have said before the men and women knowing constantly the hours of eithers bathing never offer at immodest entrance there is no precaution taken to prevent an insolence the laws of turkey punish so severely all the doors are therefore carelessly left open and the modestest of all their women wives or virgins bath securely in unguarded nakedness as never apprehending they are liable to any kind of danger  a merry story of an english cook who caught some turkish ladies naked in a bagnio yet what withholds the bold presumption of a curious ignorance it is not many years ago since an assembled company of naked ladies were unexpectedly surpised by an adventurous tarpawlin cook on board an english merchant ship then lying in the harbor he was rambling up and down about the city when coming by a turkish bagnio built of marble round and not extremely large he took it for a cockpitt and perceiving nobody denied him entrance was resolved to see a little sport so in he went but had not passed two outward rooms before he made a full discovery of his mistake and something else which the poor frighted ladies shreikd their anger at but the attendants of the bagnio being naked in performance of their office and the starting britain nimble heeld and quick to apprehend his danger he escaped and ran directly to his fellows whom he left upon the waterside and got on board without suspicion so that he can truly boast he was eyewitness of a curiosity unknown perhaps till then to the most esteemed and favorite breast of any christian  a description of the turkish hans next come their hans a sort of square stone buildings for the entertainment and reception of promiscuous travelers some of these have lodgings and conveniences of diet to deliver gratis to whosoever asks it which has been the gift of some deceased rich officer as are indeed most buildings of this kind throughout all turkey  others only give them room for carriages and cattle which are ranged in rows along the middle of the han whose sides are all divided into large partitions each whereof contains a chimney where the company who take it up may dress their meat and sleep on mats if weariness inclines them for nothing else can possibly occasion even the least repose in such a wretched place with such companions as are generally met withal and in the midst of such confused and strange variety of endless noises  the inconveniency of turkish hospitals infirmaries or hospitals are commonly stone buildings of a large quadrangular design not much unlike our own but that the beds lie open to each other no apartments being formed to keep the sick of one distemper from diseases of another kind but inconsiderately exposing all to public view and dangerous conversation  description of their common dwelling houses now let us look upon their common houses and we shall perceive them poor and mean illcontrivd and never higher than one single story they are generally built i mean the frames of green unseasond timber cased with mud or unbakd bricks half hardened in the sun which is the cause that yielding to the weather they can seldom stand above ten years without expensive trouble in a general repair and another inconvenience which attends their way of building is that by the sudden moistures and as sudden heats these bricks are subject to a sort of black and deadly scorpions breed so frequently in all their walls that i have had them often fall upon my clothes as i have walked about their finest houses  the meanest of their buildings rise a little in the roof and form a low and archlike ridge defended from the rain by slates or tiles of odd contrivance and have a sort of gallery or balcony built quite round them description of their finest houses the better sort are sometimes raised to moderate height by an unpolished kind of stone of greyish color they open from the street with low and illmade wooden doors to spacious courts or yards which lead em to an illcontrivd and timber staircase that admits em to an hall where wait attendants at a door which opens into the more rich and private chambers  round the abovenamed courtyard are the several offices as stables kitchen cellar buttery and the other necessary places in a great mans family  pleasant rooms the best apartments though not stately are beyond imagination pleasant and agreeable for some are floord with oak all covered over with fine mats or carpets painted on the sides and cieling with an hundred various colors richly intermixed with gold and silver and adorned with little wands of deal cut long and in a semicircular form the flats whereof are glewd on cross ways to the colored roof and form a sort of square confusion or agreeable irregularity one half of all these rooms is raised about a foot above the other called the saffrai which i have before occasionally mentioned and is generally that side of any room which looking out upon the gardens adds a double beauty to the place it self which is alone sufficiently agreeable by being covered with the richest carpets and surrounded on the sides with fine embroidred velvet cushions upon which they sit or lean by day to eat drink talk or entertain their family how the turkish beds are made and where at night their beds are made not soft with down but stuffed with camels hair sheeps wool or cotton  other rooms are paved with fine and various colored marble having fountains of a round triangular square oval or what other form their fancy leads em to make choice of in the midst of the apartment a melancholy but delightful amusement and several others trickling gently from the hollow wall and falling with a sort of melancholy murmuring upon thin shells of brass contrived on purpose to resound the notes of the complaining waters and complete thereby the dulcid entertainment of a charming natural and yet uncommon harmony  the turks delight extremely in a country life retiring often to some rural seat to please themselves in solitude to which end also they have very large and costly gardens to their city houses where though it is allowed they neither know nor covet christian arts of planting flowers and marking out their ground in orderly divisions the turkish gardens form a sort of natural paradise they yet contrive so charmingly to imitate soft natures sweetness in their wildernesses groves and shady bowers that walking underneath the covert of the meeting boughs and undistinguished avenues they seem possessed of that elyzian happiness described as follows by tibullus sed me quod facilis tenero sum semper amori ipsa venus campos ducet elysios hic choreae cantusque vigent passimque vagantes dulce sonant tenui gutture carmen aves fert casiam non culta seges totosque per agros floret odoratis terra benigna rosis ad juvenum series teneris immista puellis ludit and assidue praelia miscet amor since gentle love with ease my heart invades venus shall guide me to elyzian shades there songs and dances swell full tides of joy and birds from tree to tree their wings employ stretching for dulcid strains their tunefull throats and chanting harmony in warbling notes vncultivated shrubs yield cassia there and all the kindly soil does fragrant roses bear there lovely nymphs with amorous shepherds toy mixed by kind love in skirmishes of joy   it may not be improper under the head of turkish building to introduce a word or two concerning their skill in the art of fortification which far inferior to the christian practice you may take as follows  the turkish art of fortification they have no opinion of the lofty bastions hornworks ravelins counterscarps tenailles or outworks of the christians but level all their modern works within a little of the ditches which surround em which though less chargeable they hold as efficacious to oppose approaches as the other method but their chief security and whole dependence is in undermining all their works which they do so dexterously that by sinking one below another they can blow up bullwarks after they are taken three several times so often ruining the efforts of their enemies  the turks the best defenders of a town and why the turks of any nation are the best in the defense of towns besieged for priests or politics have craftily infused a notion in their minds that he who being garrisoned in any fort belonging to the sultan lives to see the infidels possess it shall not only lose his prophets favor but forever be excluded from the future blessings of expected paradise  the turkish prisons few and weak and why i should add a little of the turkish prisons which the reader may perhaps expect of strength and number in proportion to their cruelty and arbitrary power which the sultan exercises but that very cruelty is on the contrary the only reason why there are in turkey very few and those weak prisons for the justice or injustice of the sentence which condemns a criminal of any kind is so speedily inflicted that there frequently are known but fourteen hours between the crime and execution so that any place will hold the guilty since for reasons mentioned in the part foregoing an escape from justice is esteemed impracticable  chap xviii of the city of constantinople the antiquity of constantinople this great and famous town the subject of this chapter and an ancient seat of grandeur and authority was built about the time wherein the persian empire flourished over the eastern world her founders name was byza whence she took her first denomination of byzantium and continued an obscure and inconsiderable city till the reign of pausanias king of sparta  when conquered by the romans to him it fell the prize of war he won it by assault and gloriously rebuilt enlarged and strengthened it insomuch that long enjoying peaceful plenty she continued mistress of a fixed security and after three years vigorous defense became a dear and bloody victim to the conquering army of severus an ambitious roman emperor  how rendered great and glorious she changed her masters but continued notwithstanding in the same condition as to power or character till the choice of that illustrious christian emperor constantine the great distinguished her by bright and shining honors from all other cities stripping rome of all her glories to adorn this happy favorite of his fancy and in short removing from the western world the mighty seat of universal empire to dignifie this new elected eastern city with that envied title and conferring on his rich and stately residence the celebrated name of constantinople thereby expressing that he placed her welfare in an equal balance with his own prosperity and had elected that one place of all the world to be the proud and splendid scene of his amazing grandeur  to draw inhabitants from rome to this new city he decreed that citizens and freemen of the one should all of course be free of the other robbing italy of many monuments of conquest and antiquity and transplanting endless numbers to constantinople how long it flourished which continued from the year of christ     to      in all the glories of unrivaled plenty and extended power under a successive race of formidable monarchs who possessed a large and uncontrolled dominion over distant territories and enrolled the glories of their great metropolis in the politest nay the foremost leaf of fames bright register but how uncertain and delusive are the honors of mortality and all the shining trains of pageantry which join to flatter us with promised fortune what condition of our frail humanity is permanent or solid or as juvenal has it in his tenth satyr juv sat  0  quae praeclara and prospera tanti vt rebus laetis par sit mensura malorum where can be found that uncomplaining state or where the master of so blessed a fate that they can freely and sincerely say ours is a griefless joy and bliss without allay   when constantinople was taken by the turks ambition and the wild distractions of intestine discords shook at last to worse than nothing that divided empire and involved her children in a bloody ruin by the conquering arms of turkish enemies who in the year abovenamed won by storm that miserable city which with different fortunes has born different names and reigned by turns the famed metropolis and favored residence of the ancient roman grecian and the present turkish emperors who now have changed her name from constantinople to stambole her present turkish name the etymology of which arabian word is by the turks interpreted fair peace and plenty  moral reflections on the instability of fortune learn o mortals by the fate of empires not to swell imprudent thoughts with sails of pride for any frail and transitory gifts of fickle fortune when you plainly see how roughly she insults and swiftly tyrannizes over boundless monarchies whose unimagind paleness of to days declining state so strongly gives the lie to the deceitful gloss of glittering yesterday well judged the greek who thus defined her fickle nature     fortune makes wretched humane things her sport and triumphs from the hovel to the court those who but just before she downward hurled she lifts again to shine above the world whilst he she late exalted to the skies is thrown to beds of clay and on vile dunghills lies   the beauties and conveniences of constantinople let us then proceed to view this city in her modern dress perhaps not less illustrious though more enslaved than when she shon the empress of the gazing universe her situation as i have before observed has opened all the gates of plenty and command to her unbounded sway and traffic and the unexampled beauties of the prospects she affords are such as render her the seat of pleasure and the paradise of nature  her form and situation the town is built of form triangular and lies upon a cape of land which gently rises with a smooth acclivity to a considerable imminence of ground the eastern side is watered by the bosphorus or channel which divides the euxine from the hellespontic sea about seven leagues in length in breadth three quarters of an english mile a spacious haven of unequaled depth security and beauty lies upon its northern line and to the west it is bounded by the continent  the circuit of the town and how fortified the compass of the town is sixteen miles surrounded strongly by a triple wall with towers and ditches the remaining labor of the ancient greeks whose arms and names are yet perceivable carved here and there upon the stones five gates of four and twenty open to the land and nineteen look upon the sea or haven into which no ship can come which does not first pass almost closely by the point of the great turks seraglio which completely forms one angle of the city and the buildings rising gradually on seven easy hills each crowned with a magnificent and stately mosque whose spires and domes are richly gilded and most strangely intermixed with groves of cypress in the gardens of their houses form a scene so lovely and surprising that the ravished traveller believes himself approaching to a place no less agreeable than was the famed elyzium of the ancient poets  a wonderful disappointment but nothing can be possibly a greater disappointment than i found at entrance all those bright and golden glories which had tempted at a distance lost their beauties in a nearer view the illcondition of the town of constantinople and i instead of an expected heaven was amazed to find a hell of darkness narrow streets with dirty causeways on each broken side and windows hanging over almost meeting in a dark conjunction low mudd cottages and wide divisions all oergrown with grass or bushes and unpleasant prospects of dead walls and crooked lanes no glass in any of their windows but instead thereof old rotten lettices half stuffed with dirty rags of various colors and half covered over with a sort of thick white pasted paper every thing in short but their great buildings such as mosques or bagnios hans or palaces of powerful officers meanly representing to a strangers view the roughest side of shameful poverty seeming to upbraid the base inhabitants with their dejected slavery in all the shocking marks of miserable servitude  however many stately public edifices well deserve a full description and in order thereunto omitting purposely the great seraglio the southwestwall whereof divides it from the city because i shall discourse apart of that proud palace of the turkish tyrants in in the nineteenth chapter i proceed to speak of all things else in proper order  the sultan visits sancta sophia every friday and first among the many royal mosques which crown the highest places in constantinople none comes near the famed sophia standing not far distant from the sultans palace who resorts thereto each friday in a public state by the description of this one the others stateliness may easily be comprehended  twoud be a needless labor to repeat the form since what i mentioned in the foregoing chapter may sufficiently inform the reader as to that particular it shall suffice to say that as no humane imagination can conceive its wonderful magnificence no mortal pen can possibly describe it a description of that glorious temple it is in short a faultless and unequaled edifice yet not the work of turkish architects for twas erected in the reign of the emperor justinian and remains unrivaled queen of temples notwithstanding more than half her beauteous ornaments have been maliciously defaced by turkish superstition  how much it has been defaced by turkish superstition for all that excellent mosaic work which so amazingly adorned the floor and sides with shining figures of a thousand various forms and colors is at present either hid by mats and carpets effaced by iron instruments or quite daubed over with an inchthick plaster the stone and brazen statues of the grecian emperors have lost their heads and are become disguised by the repeated efforts of licentious insolence the deep and admirable cisterns which were formed amidst the vaults belonging to that temple and supplied with water from stupendous aquaeducts now almost ruined by the mouldring rust of time and base effects of sloth and ignorance  her further encomiums yet is the venerable pile in spite of accident adorned with such a sacred lofty and majestic aspect that her towering roof bright gilded dome and artfull cupolas her marble pillars and unnumbred ornaments combine to strike an awful reverence through the breasts of strangers obliging them to own they see in her a sort of shining glory which our modern buildings in their richest splendor fail to equalize  a sweating pillar amongst the numerous rarities this church affords there is a large black marble pillar plated from the basis to the capital with sheets of copper which at certain hours of every day throughout the year emits a sort of vaprous moisture and is therefore called the sweating column whence this odd effect should probably arise i cannot guess but it is the common notion of both turks and graecians that it was the pillar whereunto the officers of pilate bound our savior when they scourged him and upon this only ground persuaded to believe the drops afford some secret blessing or prevailing virtue you may see great numbers of promiscuous people wiping off the moisture with their clothes or foreheads some expecting by its sovereign power to be protected from the least misfortune  a door of noahs ark four doors it boasts of stately height and curious workmanship the wood whereof the largest is composed is said to be a part of noahsark and therefore being purposely left open in some parts the rest all plated over multitudes of poor and superstitious people come and kneeling in the hallowed portico imprint their kisses on the holy timber with a sort of mad and zealous transport  description of the hippodrom within the view of the abovenamed temple stands the hippodrom a large round spot of ground like lincolnsinnfields surrounded with the best and noblest buildings of the city about the middle of this spacious circle stands a very large and stately obelisk of rich thebaick marble on one pedestal whereof may be discovered these remains of some antique

serpents looking from the top to three distinct corners of the city in the figure of a just proportional triangle what the meaning of this ancient hieroglyphick was is now unknown but this is certain that the turks have had some grounds to look upon it as an ominous remain of magic skill since just two months before the deposition of their sultan ibrahim one head fell off as if it had been sawed which being fastened on again by some ingenious artist kept its place as firm as ever an ominous observation but about a month before that great rebellion some years since which ended in the sultans death and total ruin of his favorite officers another head fell off and was attended by as fatal consequences as the former  another obelisk of several stones another obelisk not far from thence consisting of a wondrous number of large stones cemented artfully together now entirely ruined so as scarce to represent the form it bore upon its basis wears an ancient greek inscription so defaced by time that it is a needless trouble to insert the broken characters  constantines pillar the pillar commonly distinguished by the name of constantines stands tolerably whole but little more than twelve foot high excluding capital and basis this distich may be read with difficulty round the top to theion epgon enthale phthapen pono neoi anoyl eyses aytokpatop   a deep and most prodigious cistern beneath this celebrated hippodrom there is a very deep and vaulted cistern of incredible extent and formerly supplied with water by a subterraneous passage in such plenty that when constantinople was invested fatally by mahomet the great it yielded daily a sufficient quantity for all the numerous inhabitants but whether avarice or their dependence on their strength has made the turks neglect repairing it i cannot tell it is now quite ruined all the walls being fallen in and rendring the cistern consequently unfit for any future use or service  whence it took the name of hippodrom this place was called the hippodrom from the greek word  which signifies a horsecourse and to that sole use it was of old appointed the turks at present call it hatmahdan which is as much as riding place in english it is here each friday that the most accomplished horsemen of the turkish court and army meet in parties to encounter one another in the hurling the geritts which i so lately spoke of they do it always with such wonderful dexterity that though their darts are blunt they imitate exactly even the roughest shocks of real war nor in their strange agility of body come below

they had viewed the train and saw the graceful horsemen crown the plain epytides who distant from the rest a lofty station purposely possessed observed them ready swiftly to disjoin then smartly cracked his whip and gave the expected sign at once the troops by gallant captains led around the plain in spacious circles spread then summoned back in different lines appear each warlike hand adorned with a sharppointed spear now march in adverse files the stately train now changing forms renew their ranks again and circling rings in rings curvett along the plain thus they extend their artfull wheelings far and wage with friendly arms a counterfeited war now they by flight their naked backs expose then turn with lifted spears upon pursuing foes till peace proclaimed they lay their arms aside and mingling ranks and files in graceful order ride   the historical pillar in the womens market which the turks distinguish by the name of auharatbaasar stands a column of prodigious height and such a curious workmanship that being full even from the basis to the capital with hieroglyphic figures representing in a twining manner by towns castles ships and horsemen battles and a thousand other strange devices all the rise and progress of the grecian empire from its original successes the figures are contrived of such proportionable magnitude that both the highest and the lowest seem alike the author enters it and what he found there this pillar like the monument at london is not solid but within to be ascended by a strong and winding staircase where the curious enterer finds not any thing that is worth his observation but the names of travelers of every country cut upon the stones to tell succeeding comers who were there before them i perceived among them all but three that i could think were english which were writ as follows upon different places h blunt  an englishman and lover of his country william dennis in the year    0 was here george sandys december the   th    0  this last is doubtless that ingenious gentleman who has so much obliged the world with his polite and learned observations on the eastern countries  but now methinks i feel in writing it that weighty grief which seized my spirits when i saw the poor remains of ruined majesty the great and glorious palace of the mighty constantine where honor breathed as in her native element and all the virtues which adorn the mind of man conspired to render good a court whose greatness and magnificence could possibly admit of no addition even this rich court with all its ancient state and grandeur is so strangely changed amidst the unexampled miseries of poor subverted greece that those tall roofs once shining brightly in a dress of gold are tumbled with the columns which supported them and lie confused in heaps of rubbish scarce deserving even the name of ruins the palace of constantine the great now made a stable for wild beasts those bright apartments which in former times were wont to shine with ornamental balls and glorious crowds of celebrated beauties are at present made a den or stable for the several sorts of wild and forest beasts which serve the pleasures of the haughty sultan  here may the proud man read his fate and see in the example of this fallen empire which by the haughty reigns of her insulting monarchs grew divided and was consequently weakened more and more till all her discords ended in her downfall how admirable are the notions of the great tragaedian upon this particular sen trag of troas violenta nemo imperia continuit diu moderata durant quoque fortuna altius evexit ac levavit humanas opes hoc se magis supprimere felicem decet variosque casus tremere metuentem deos nimium faventes no tyrants government can long endure a moderate sway is ever most secure the higher fortune builds a mans estate and still the more she elevates his fate so much the more does it become his mind humbly to own the gods beyond his merits kind to fear the various ills poor mortals know and worship bounteous heaven whence all his blessings flow   antiquity i think can boast no more remains than what i have already named of all those glorious monuments of art and splendor which in former times adorned this city modern buildings as described in the foregoing chapter are not wanting but as none deserves particular remark the number of mosques in constantinople i only will inform you that the turks compute the number of their mosques at constantinople to exceed seven thousand  but the reader must not here mistake my meaning as confined to the walled town alone for they include the cities following joining all in one denomination as we do that of westminster with london  the city scutary the old chrysopolis at present scutary a bythinian city standing opposite upon the other shore of the abovenamd bosphorus contains within her bounds a great seraglio of the turkish sultans and is large and wealthy not much less than three miles round  the city pera pera galata or cornu byzantium anciently reaches with considerable breadth from the opposite shore of the haven much above an english mile with steep a scent even to the very summit of the hills which overlook the city the use of a seraglio there here is likewise a seraglio of the sultans serving as a prison to receive at each triennial view of the grand signiors women whole shoals of barren sick or antiquated ladies  all the ministers of foreign christian princes have their dwelling houses in some part of pera seldom suffered to reside within the walls of constantinople the buildings of this town are somewhat larger and more stately than the other all the christian factories residing there the christian privileges there and favored with a sort of privileged immunity among themselves possessing a large place thence termed the frankstreet or the street of french men for the turks in common talk call every christian by that name who there with pleasure live promiscuously enjoying almost uncontrolled an envied liberty which very rarely any turk presumes to make encroachments on though some have often insolence enough to threaten it  some other suburbs such as those without the gate of adrianople where the turkish sultans at a certain tomb of some old prophet are invested with their power spread themselves about and much enlarge the compass of the city which if taken altogether a comparison of london with constantinople does indeed possess a a greater space of ground than london but by reason of the gardens joined to every house and many vacant places of the town can notwithstanding boast scarce half her number of inhabitants  the sultan common landlord of most houses the houses or the greatest part of constantinople are the sultans property who lets em out at different rents according to their value and appoints collectors to receive the profits thence arising  besisteens their use and description besisteens or large and highroofd places built of timber or sometimes of stone are public markets not unlike our old exchange where goods of every kind are bought and sold each mystery or trade possessing a peculiar row or walk hither resort both turks and christians who would purchase any thing of worth for only here they can procure it all the streets directly contrary to ours made dark and close in front no shops appearing in them worth the notice of a stranger or inhabitant  the form of turkish wherries the persons who inhabit the opposite sides of the haven correspond at ease by means of many thousand boats perpetually rowing up and down called kaicks of long and narrow form a little rising at each end and widening in the middle not unlike an opened beanshell and now i mention their conveniences of rowing i will venture to digress a little way in order to divert you with a story common in the mouth of every waterman who rows you by a castle founded on a rock that stands surrounded by the water at about two furlongs distance from the town of scutary  the maiden tower this fort for such it is now is called by the inhabitants the maiden tower it is strong and well defended by five and twenty cannons of considerable bore the sea between the town and it runs thirteen fathom deep yet is it plentifully stored with cool fresh water by a spacious subterraneous passage which admitting it from a large brook not far from scutary it finds a channel and emits vast quantities from a prodigious well within the tower running thence through hollows in the rock and mixing with the waters which surround the castle  the story which they tell is somewhat odd but may divert the reader or at least will serve him as a moral caution to beware how much he listens to the tempting calls of loves extravagance whereof the knowing seneca has left this maxim sen tra of hippol  quisquis in primo obstitit repulitque amorem tutus ac victor fuit qui blandiendo dulce nutrivit malum sero recusat far quod subiit jugum he who can bravely inborn courage prove and dares repulse the first attacks of love with sure applause shall break his fancys chain and crowned with glorious conquest safe remain but he who flatters his mistaken will inflaming fire and nourishing the ill too late shall weep to see himself undone gauld by the weighty yoke he could but would not shun   a story of unfortunate and melancholy love there lived  say turkish chronicles at scutary then chrysopolis a very rich and noble earl extremely favored by the grecian emperor with whom he often used to ride abroad on hunting and continue absent sometimes twelve or fourteen days together  the countess an exceeding good and pious natured lady being dead and leaving one sole daughter of the greatest beauty wit and other excellencies which adorn a female mind and person she was used to mourn her fathers absence in a solitary sorrow still forsaking company and pleasure to retire alone to sigh or read amidst the shady groves and pleasant meadows which afforded sweet retirements not far distant from her fathers palace  a fathers fatal foudness her celebrated beauties had alarmed the youth of court and country every father wished his son this maids possessor and the sons of every parent mad with passion lost their sense of other pleasures and enchanted by her graces flocked in numbers to solicit her affection but the aged earl entirely doting on his daughters conversation never listned to their largest offers bent if possible to keep her single that he might as long as he should live enjoy her company  an unexpected meeting fortune on a certain time the father being absent led a young and amorous gentleman to take a pensive walk along the bank of a delightful current near the bottom of a wood belonging to this earl and not six hundred paces from the house whence just before his lovely daughter had walked out and was by him surpised while leaning pensively beneath the shelter of a spacious oak and reading softly with a fixed attention  never was joy more unexpected and transporting than that which seized the starting youth at this surprising accident for he had long been one of those who languishd for her favor but till now had never gained the smallest opportunity to let her know how much he loved her having been among the rest denied admission by her fathers obstinacy  a sudden conquest of a ladys heart love i think is seldom wanting upon such occasions to inspire his subjects with rhetorical assurance so that prompted by the dictates of prevailing passion he addressed the lady with a modesty so graceful yet becoming resolution that she had no sooner cast her eyes upon his person but a sudden inclination and as sudden fright together seized the tender regions of her virgin bosom  various arguments with mutual satisfaction passed away the time in sympathetic pleasures and such powerful charms did each discover in the others person that from that time forward they agreed to meet in the adjoining grove at the same hour every evening not having opportunity elsewhere to do it lest the ladies father should discover their intrigue and hinder them from prosecuting their resolved affection  i need not tell the english ladies that the rules of virtue and her female modesty obliged the daughter of the absent earl to seem more backward than her eager lover in the amorous settlement of their intended meetings but where occasions are so seldom found it is a needless nicety to stand too long on lingering ceremonies a kind and gentle condescension so in short upon assurance of her lovers honorable meaning and indeed her quality had placed her far above distrusting his pretensions she permitted him to hope he might at last be happy in her wished possession and for many weeks met undiscovered in the secret grove and tasted all those innocent delights which lovers may enjoy without the smallest tincture of a guilty conversation  but oh  how soon decay the brightest scenes of splendid fortune twas not long this amorous couple held their bliss unbroken and serene for the earl long since returned had often observed his daughter absent in the evenings and would frequently reflect with not a little wonder that she always chose one certain hour to leave the house and still refused whatever company proposed attending her a fatal jealousy his natural jealousy required no fuel to increase its fire but supplied with this burnt out in double fury so that he resolved to watch which way his daughter took and make it his endeavor to discover what he doubted  accordingly one evening purposely disguised in habit like a shepherd he continued in a meadow near his house and saw the poor unthinking lady hasten from a private door and cross the fields directly to the entrance of the grove just mentioned  an unfortunate mistake little did she dream her father was so near and not mistrusting him who at distance she mistook to be the person he appeared went boldly forward to the place appointed where she met the object of her love and sitting down upon a bank as usual tenderly reclined her head upon his bosom and began to say a thousand soft endearing things believing they were then as private as before till in a manner stupefied with eager passion both neglected every object but each others person not perceiving the suspecting father who had gone a little round below the brow of an impending hill and now stalked forward undiscovered till he came so near behind the lovers busied in their courtship that he overheard with ease each little word which passed between them  a dangerous discovery kisses and a thousand other amorous actions prompted the unfortunately raptured couple to repeat with loud and solemn protestations old assurances of love and marriage insomuch that the surpised and angry earl transported by his rage to hear his daughter give away her self to one to whom he had before denied her and for certain family disputes extremely hated drew a sword which he had privately conveyed within his dress and running violently at the starting nobleman who drew in his defense was killed upon the spot before the lady almost dead with fear recovered from the fright his sword had put her in  a cause for sudden and tempestuous sorrow but none can surely guess the storms of grief and wonder which overwhelmed her breast with a tempestuous hurricane to hear the shepherds dying voice so plainly speak her fathers accent in short upon approach she knew him notwithstanding his disguise and while the lover half distracted at the fatal accident prepared to speak his wonder and her comfort ran with violence about the fields forgetting love and all its consequences but this last unhappy one which she proclaimed aloud to every servant of her fathers house whereto she slew with shrieks and horror  the servants ran and seized the nobleman who stood confounded like a speechless statue looking eagerly upon the body of the murdered earl nor aiming to defend himself from being taken a cruel sentence to divide two lovers news was carried to the emperor of every circumstance of the unlucky action who considering wisely all particulars gave the gentleman a present pardon but resolving to prevent them from conversing with each other ever after ordered the young lady with two aunts and all the family to be confined in the beforenamd tower then called stony island giving strict command to all who guarded it that they should never suffer her to get away nor give admission unto any person such excepted as were authorized to claim it by his royal passport  a while the lady mourned so deeply for her fathers death and the desponding lover for the action he had done that neither thought upon the hardship of their cruel separation but when fleeting time presented to their minds the sharpness of their fate in that severe decree they both forsook all hopes of comfort she in prison grew quite weary of and hated life and he at large became abandoned to encroaching sorrows melancholy silent and a prisoner to his grief amidst the tracts of disregarded liberty  a melancholy way of life twelve tedious months were now rolled over and the discontented lover still continued every day to visit the remembered scene of former bliss and present misery he would often walk disconsolately up and down along the bank of that delightful river which was used to murmur out a melancholy harmony to sooth their minds oppressed by fear of ill success in their commenced affection and reflecting on the various words and actions which had passed between them would now and then let fall a mournful tear to think on their misfortunes  at last despairing ever more to see his dear contracted mistress he began to wish a period to his life which only served to lengthen out his misery and as he walked one day perceived a rock wherein he had heard talk of some dark cave so dismally forbidding that no man had ever yet been found who durst attempt to enter it disdain of danger from a weariness of living urged him on to seek the place with resolution to go in regardless of the consequence  a bold and hazardous attempt he found at last the gloomy entrance of the horrid place which opened downwards with a very steep and dangerous slope and never waiting for a second thought went boldly in and crept along the rugged sides a narrow channel from the neighboring river running through a passage twixt the rocks directly in the middle for about an hundred yards he made a shift to crawl along with wondrous difficulty down a very deep and slippery descent but there perceived the water which till then had ran confined to proper bounds increased in breadth to such a vast degree that there was left no more dry ground to stand upon a strange example of the power of despair however as desiring death he was resolved to tempt it and continued his advances through the water sometimes scarce above his knees then almost to his neck here running ten or twenty yards indifferently smooth then falling many foot and roaring round his head like some egyptian cataract sometimes he fell half drowned with the impetuous fury of the torrent sometimes walked through the rushing streams which almost trippd him from his feet with their amazing swiftness  a strange curiosity still he crept as near as possible to some one side and held upon the edges of the rocks he met with till reflecting on the strangeness of the place he walked in and how much it was impossible to reascend those watery passages he had already passed he was resolved to live as long as he was able and observe by touch and ear what further wonders the descent might lead him to for twas so void of the least glimpse of comfortable light that he had then no use of eyes for none could pierce one inch of the surrounding darkness  he came at last so far that he perceived a sensible decrease in breadth for he could stretch his arms with ease and touch both sides but on the contrary the depth increased exceedingly and by the waters doubled roaring and beating back as from some wall he found the cavity no further capable of giving room to a continued progress a wonderful subterraneous passage yet considering there must be some passage of emission and little caring whither it might lead he dipped his head and body under water and with much ado shot swiftly with the eddy through a very short and narrow neck and found himself immediately enlarged but covered over with a flood of waters which he took to be the sea when finding breath grow short upon him he made use of strong and artfull strokes which he had learned by swiming while a boy by these means thinking he should soon be freed and gain the surface or expire amidst the waves both which events he formed a swift idea of expecting either with a like indifference  a strange escape but he was much surpised when long before he guessed it he perceived his head above the water and as soon as he could see beheld himself within a sort of well or cistern almost level with the brim he swam a while about from side to side at last observed a channel into which the cistern disengaged her rising waters there he soon got out extremely weakned by his subterraneous journey and the first fair object he discovered when he looked about him was his former mistress walking in a garden with a very sorrowful and pensive countenance  the happy meeting of two real lovers the unexpected shock was much alike to both the lovers but the lady frighted at the odd appearance of a dropping man who looked like some inhabitant of an inferior world began at first to shriek and fly but when he faintly called her by her name she knew the voice mistook him for a ghost and fainted to the earth unable to support the weight of so surprising a discovery  but to conclude the guards came in upon the ladies shrieking and immediately laid hold on their adventurous visitor but when the emperor was told the story he commanded both the lover and his mistress to be brought before him and considering the particulars of this amazing accident immediately reversed his former sentence had them married in his royal presence graced them ever after with peculiar favors the etymology of the maiden tower and in memory thereof commanded that the castle should be called the maiden tower which commemorative name it bears at present  excuse me reader for the length of my digression it is a story confidently told amongst the turks but faith is every mans undoubted property believe it or believe it not i only quote and not assert it as i heard it told me for the strange original of their old castles etymology  the seven towers a strong castle the seven towers an ancient castle by the roman emperors called janicula is now a magazine or sometimes prison for the noblest criminals it is a very spacious building and was strong beyond a common fort before the murdering use of cannons was invented the sultan constantly maintains therein a numerous garrison its situation is upon the southeast side of constantinople  the aquaeduct of valentinian    miles long but while i treat of this illustrious city twoud be an error no ways pardonable should i fall to mention the prodigious aquaduct of valentinian which for sour and thirty english miles brings water upon channels built on arches over spacious valleys from the top of one tall mountain to another till nigh the city it pours down from a stupendous height and fills a cistern like a lake of fine white marble which contains above two hundred stately pillars of the same and having been repaired by several turkish emperors does by pipes and conduits now supply

this plate as an acknowledgement of the authors weighty obligations is most humbly dedicated  h hulsbergh facit      chap xix of the grand signiors seraglio and particularly the apartment of his women the introduction i told the reader in the preface of my book by what uncommon means i was so happy as to gain admission to a palace which for many ages has been kept a secret to the searching knowledge of our europaean travelers and shall now proceed to entertain him with a wonderful but pleasant and sincere account of new discoveries which like the golden indian world lay long unenterd as appearing barred against our view with unsurmountable impediments but gained at last will spread throughout our western regions such surprising plenty of her valuable product as may more than recompense the patient stay of your expecting curiosities  i love not flattery from any hand much less would sooth my own performances with elevated hopes of a success beyond their merits complaint against the malice of the fashionable critics but of this the world will give me leave to be assured that as i write the beauties of an earthly paradise and unimagind scenes of amorous royalty till now unknown not only to my countrymen but every part of distant christendom i have at least deserved the thanks of an impartial reader and may be allowed to blame the undistinguishing ill nature of such steely critics as instead of owning an agreeable surprise in meeting subjects new and entertaining strive ungenerously to condemn a labor merely out of ignorance or incredulity because they find it something odd and full of novelty  however all that base ingratitude which meanly may endeavor to obscure the worth of what i write shall never boast that private fear of barking malice could prevent my pen from boldly aiming at a public satisfaction what the reader may expect in this chapter i will not therefore only entertain the world with an agreeable amusement but proceed by regular degrees to give the reader an entire idea of the famed seraglio of the turkish sultan not omitting any odd and pleasant observation but neglecting purposely the trifling repetitions of those things preceding authors were enabled to inform you of and chiefly bending my designed description to those glittering piles of stately buildings groves of pine and bowers of cypress paths of love and labyrinths of pleasure which combine their graces to adorn the seat of one great lord and render perfect the delightful mansions where the amorous sultan toys away his minutes in the wanton raptures of his ladies conversation  the lovely situation of the grand signiorss seraglio first then if ever heaven decreed a part of this divided world should shine conspicuously above the rest and seem to beckon universal monarchy to fix its throne on her delicious surface it is the very ground whereon now flourishes the glorious palace of the proud mohammedan for from that eminence of ground on which the temple sancta sophia has its situation runs a narrow neck of land descending gradually and on either side politely sloping downward till it forms at last a charming angle on the northeast point of constantinople  the form thereof the form of the seraglio which is built hereon appears a sort of long triangle one whole side whereof is bounded by the neighboring buildings of the city both the other shelving downwards to the sea which washes em and with their utmost angle pointing out amidst the waves directly opposite to the surprising height and rough appearances of certain wild and distant asian promontories thrace with all the beauties of her europaean landskips forms a prospect full of pleasures on the other side not one small ship can anchor in the haven but must pass the point of the seraglio first whose noble situation leads the eye to gaze astonished at such strange variety that all the ravished sweets of art and nature here seem joined as if they had agreed to mix their richest excellencies and complete a modern rival paradise to that of eden  its strength and circuit it is above three english miles in measured circuit quite surrounded by a lofty wall defended strongly by a sort of quey of five yards breadth which runs all round it where are planted numerous pieces of prodigious cannon of an unexampled size and monstrous bore one very deep and spacious ditch encompasses the wall which is moreover strengthened by capacious ramparts and a square watchtower at every hundred or two hundred paces end in these stand day and night selected numbers of the finest soldiers in the sultans guard who see that none presume to venture near the walls of his forbidden palace the beauty of its prospect at a distance all the inside is adorned with spires and stately balls gilt round with gold and shining from afar with a majestic luster which sublime appearance gently softened by the mixed discovery of extended groves of lofty cypress trees there planted in a sweet and natural irregularity and somewhat shadowing in many places the refulgent brightness of the spires and cupolas afford a prospect to the distant view so full of beauty and unknown variety that words want power to celebrate the object therefore see the cut annexed for further satisfaction  but having given this short description of the form extent and outward beauties of the sultans palace i will now proceed to lead my reader with a gradual curiosity through every inmost part of its discovered glories yet as the unnumberd differences which alternately occur to claim our observation may confound the prospect if i represent them jointly twill be much the safest way to separate the building into five degrees and treat distinctly of them all that so we may preserve an useful regularity  the first great court first then i will describe the outward court and all the offices and orders of the buildings which surround and form it into which all travelers who please have free access and uncontrolled admission  the second court secondly i will proceed to do the like by a more spacious square within the former and composed of far more rich and lofty architecture into which as to the first all strangers are admitted  the third where all ambassadors receive their audience thirdly i intend to open to your view another court within them both and far superior in its order and magnificence for in the rich apartments which surround this square the haughty sultans give their audiences to every minister of foreign nations at their first arrival in the turkish court  the royal lodgings next i lose sight of former writers and visit with a wonder equal to the object the prodigious statelyness and towering splendour of the royal lodgings so surprizingly transporting me with endless scenes of artfull pleasure pride and grandeur that for want of models to express their form by which is quite unknown nay even undreamt of in the christian world i have been forced to draw in the course of this chapter another plan of the amazing inside of that stupendous fabric which will give the eye a true idea of its wonderful contrivances  the discovery of the womens lodgings thought by most to be impossible but now appears a secret worth the hearing the discovery whereof i often since twas made stood by and heard the greatest travelers of several nations join in one old fashionable story and affirm to be no less than a downright impossibility yet i will not only trace the sultan to his amorous pastimes with the virgins of his pleasure but admit the reader to the close apartments of the fair seraglio ladies nay and into the retired magnificence of their bedchambers but show him all the various scenes of love and courtship which are practiced daily by their lord and them even to the consummation of their utmost wishes and if the british ladies are desirous of a further information still advance a step or two beyond it  as i told you in my preface that the absence of the sultan and his train of ladies then attending him at adrianople gave a liberty beyond the wishes of our keenest curiosity as a compliment bestowed for reasons there explained a double curiosity so i was willing to improve the opportunity as for as possible and while i pleased my eyes with the delightful prospect of engaging novelties i satisfied my ear with listening eagerly to the accounts our guides thought fit to give us of the proper use of every place and entertaining stories of the sultans customs  description of the great gate of the seraglio first then the great seraglio opens to the sea on either side with several low and private gates but such as never are made use of but when the emperor himself is pleased to order it the only common entrance faces the beforenamd temple sancta sophia and admits you through a vast and spacious portal of white marble arched and strengthened in the ancient way of building round the edges of the arch on either side appear cut deeply in the stone the hollow of the letters richly filled with lovely mixtures of gold green red blue and every other color some few arabian sentences almost defaced by mouldering time but such as turkish scholars told us signified as follows inscriptions on the portal glory to the god of mahomet and mahomet his prophet honor power trvth and justice trampling on the neck of sin and grandevr here erect the seat of never dying empire  a chapel built by constantine the great you are no sooner entered through this lofty gate than you perceive a court the square whereof contains almost three hundred yards and is surrounded by a sort of cloister which i will describe immediately a distant prospect through the gate at tother end presents you with a long and lovely scene of cypress trees and fountains charmingly adorning all the second court about twelve yards upon the left of your first entrance stands the round and broken wall of an old chapel built by constantine and by him dedicated to the virgin mary it has been curious for its building and contrivance but has yielded now to the voracious rust of time and ruin whose prevailing force is well described as follows by an old greek poet   what does not time and length of days oerthrow from times black current endless mischiefs flow by time the forms and names of things are changed and natures mighty self from her own face estranged   the trophies of the greeks hung up within it the unintelligible relics of an old inscription speak the chapel christian workmanship and all about its broken walls are hung as trophies of their cursed success the spears swords breastplates shields and other armor of those generous greeks who bravely scorning to outlive the downfall of their sinking country chose to die the martyrs of its liberty and though they fell above three hundred years ago live nobly in the praises of succeeding ages who behold their spoils here hung together strangely representing in a ghastly manner men in armor with their arms and legs bound cross each other which the turks have done by way of triumph to commemorate their fortune this may seem a barbarous action and the base effect of their vainglorious principles but ancient practices of the inhumane custom will excuse the turks when homer in his iliads often gives us plain examples of the like proceedings and aeneas is by virgil represented glorying in the overthrow of dead mezentius and dressing up an oak with his insulted trophies virg aen lib    ingentem quercum dicisis undique ramis constituit tumulo fulgentiaque induit arma mezenti ducis exuvias tibi magne tropaeum bellipotens aptat roranteis sanguine cristas telaque trunca viri and bis sex thoraca petitum perfossumque locis clypeumque ex aere sinistrae subligat atque ensem collo suspendit eburnum upon a rising spot of neighboring ground he placed a sturdy oak lopd closely round and with refulgent armor decked it over the spoils which king mezentius lately wore to thee great god of war a trophy due worthy the conquest and the triumph too high over the rest his waving plume he tied yet reaking with the blood wherein twas died to these were bound the spears which in the field had pierced or broken on the trojans shield his shining breast plate graced the trophies too hacked deep and pierced in twice six places through on his left side his brazen target hung and from the neck his sword all sheathed in ivory swung   the quarters and employments of the ajamolans the row of buildings which upon the left side bounds this outward court is low and mean containing lodgings for some thousands of those men called ajamolans or a kind of people bought as slaves from every country where the turks maintain a correspondence and educated from their youth or sometimes infancy in all the rough and servile practices of a laborious discipline till being qualified with strength of mind and body they are ordered severally by the overseers appointment to the various offices of the seraglio  the woodyard of the great seraglio within the court and still descending nearer to the sea upon the europaean side there is a plain and spacious square wherein are pild in most prodigious and unnumbred heaps the logs of wood and various kinds of faggots used in the seraglio which amount each year to such vast quantities that fifty thousand waggonloads are constantly brought in each wagon drawn and that not easily by two strong buffelos  pleasant places from this large woodyard to the wall which bounds the palace on the havenside are finely planted stately cypress trees cool groves and solitary wildernesses which indeed run round the whole seraglio in the space between the buildings and the wall about it but as i design to speak particularly of the garden part i shall defer describing this division till its proper place requires my doing it  the hospital of the seraglio directly parallel to the apartment of the latenamd ajamolans runs another higher and more graceful row of buildings bounded on the other side the court aforesaid this is the hospital for the seraglio sick divided into chambers and convenient lodging rooms for people indisposed according to the quality of such as want them two prime physicians and as many surgeons are appointed by the sultan to inspect the management of the distempered persons who are carefully attended by great numbers of white eunuchs two of which stand constantly to guard the entrance  the lodgings of the helvagees and their employment not far distant but behind the hospital are built the lodgingrooms appointed for the habitation of the helvagees a sort of boys who wear a dress peculiar to their office and are kept to carry messages from place to place within the palace or upon occasion may be sent about the town to bring in any thing the servants want for no man who possesses no employment in the great seraglio ever dares on pain of death attempt an entrance the number of these errand boys is generally reckoned to amount to near seven thousand  a fine ralld list or green for exercise about two hundred yards below the lodgings of the helvagees there lies a green of spacious breadth and railed about to keep out such as have not by their posts the liberty to enter here the sultan often comes to see the exercises of the managed horse and hurling the geritt before described and often orders equal numbers of his negro pages to maintain the lists against the challenge of selected whiteones giving frequently rewards of valuable price to those who conquer  other pleasant places shelving downwards toward the sea on this side also lie vast tracts of ground containing various scenes of rural fragrancy tall groves of cypress sweetly intermixed with rising banks declining greens delightful labyrinths and murmuring fountains  the gate and number of the men who guard the entrance of the second court the second court is entered through the former by a lofty gate adorned with trophies like the ancient chapel just now mentioned guarded constantly by fifty janissaries armed with muskets who oblige all horsemen officers or others to alight and walk if they design to gain a farther entrance for it is held the duty of the sultans subjects high and low to put off all the marks of pride and grandeur and proceed as humbly to approach his presence as they ought to do when they address the object of their daily worship  description of the second court of the seraglio this court is far more large and stately than the former near four hundred yards the square and curiously adorned with everspouting fountains round whose brims fine cypress trees are neatly planted forming various and delightful figures of a different magnitude all surrounded with a lofty cloister gallery or piazza artfully supported by amazing numbers of white marble pillars with their capitals and bases of the finest sort of polished marble and of that consists the spacious pavements which in several places cross the court and lead you plea antly to different apartments which appear at some considerable distance through the columns of this noble gallery  above the pillars of the great piazza and supported by them are the lodging rooms of several officers of no mean authority in the seraglio the stables of the grand signiors seraglio and on the left hand at about a hundred paces distance from it are the private stables which contain about five six or seven and twenty horses for the favorite exercises of the sultans pleasure above these stables are the rooms wherein are kept the bridles saddles rich caparisons and other furniture for his ledhorses most of which are so adorned with precious stones and rich embroidery that they amount in price to a prodigious and incredible sum of money as for the great stables they are placed behind the private ones and keep vast numbers of the swiftest and bestmanagd horses of their own and other countries  the divan or justicehall directly in a line with the abovenamed private stables but a little nearer to the third courts entrance stands a round and open place they call divan a sort of hall or council chamber where the grandvizier and lordschiefjustices with other ministers exhibit justice on appointed days to all the people in a public manner  the place is low and open to the view of all the people the roof supported by large wooden pillars and all leaded over in a curious manner wainscot gilt is all the ornament the inside boasts of on the floor is spread a carpet where on benches placed on purpose sit the judges of occurring causes an excellent policy in the administration of the turkish justice from the roof of this divan there runs along on the left side a little gallery which leads by certain private ways to the grand signiors lodgings who by that means often comes and hid behind a velvet curtain overhears the trials which are passing in the court and if he sees unjust proceedings frequently reverses or makes void the sentence as he finds occasion punishing the partial or unjust decider so that awed by doubt and never knowing when he is or is not there they are obliged to act with constant caution and against the grain impartially determine every lawsuit  on every councilday the turkish janissaries are drawn up and headed every company by their respective officers upon the pavement underneath the marble gallery which i before informed you runs quite round the buildings of this second court a piece of turkish ostentation and there it is that they receive their pay upon such days as the ambassadors of christian princes are admitted to the audience of the sultan or his ministers that so they may vaingloriously appear possessors of a rolling plenty by disbursing in the payment of that one militia for a few days service such prodigious heaps of money  another hall beyond this great divan or hall of justice stands another building not unlike it but of far less magnitude here they seat such christian ministers of state or merchants as may have occasion to apply themselves for justice to the turkish government  the quarters of the baltagees the space dividing these two halls admits you to a gate that opens to the left and leads you into a fine spacious square the quarters of the baltagees or hatchet men whose business it is to cleave and carry wood for every part of the grand signiors seraglio the building boasts no ornament but is divided humbly into many chambers fit for the reception of the slaves for whom they are provided  the garden wall prevents you from a further inquisition on the left of this large second court the kitchens of the seraglio so let us visit the right side and we shall find the vacant space behind the gallery politely terminated by a stately row of fine stone kitchens seven in number each whereof is managed by peculiar cooks and other servants who are severally busied in providing meat for different tables from the sultans own to those of his superior officers and from them to others of less rank and meaner quality  the confectionaries above these kitchens are an equal number of preserving rooms to which belong four hundred choice confectioners perpetually employed in making sweetmeats such as conserves preserves jellies fruits of all sorts dried or candied sometimes liquid syrups in abundance and great quantities of marmalade  besides these sweetmeats it is the business of the confectioners to make sherbets and limonades of rich and costly composition for the use of the grand signiors self and such of his great officers as will think fit to pay such prices as from time to time are put upon these rarities by those who make the profits the perquisites of the confectioners flowing from their perquisites this way the most considerable income of their whole employment  below the kitchens and the seven confectionaries which are placed above them at about some twelve or fourteen paces distance nearer to the gardens ending the declension an admirable aquaeduct stands the great and admirable aquaeduct extending both above and underneath the ground in very strong and stately arches vaults and cisterns well supplied with pipes of lead and brazen cocks of an uncommon magnitude and constantly attended by an officer whose title speaks him master of the waterworks under whose command two hundred workmen are continually in waiting  the kitchens butteries lodgingrooms and all the various quarters of the great seraglio are not only served with water from this noble aquaeduct for common uses strange and pleasant fancies but the numerous fountains murmuring currents artificial lakes and small meandring streams which dance along with tunefull cadence over a thousand artfull falls and pebbled precipices covered over with surrounding boughs or grass of lovely green and length incredible are all supplied with neverfailing sluices from the wonderful contrivances of that stupendous structure  description of the third court of the seraglio we enter now the third division or that part of the seraglio where the sultan constantly receives the several ambassadors of christian princes and you may observe that all the proud and haughty carriage which in ancient times distinguished eastern monarchs reigns conspicuously improved far rather than diminished in the turkish emperors who do not only with a sort of slight indifference refuse admission to a second audience even so much as to take leave at their departure but behave themselves that single time when they permit an interview with such disdainful arrogance and silent grandeur that it will amaze the reader to reflect upon their proud deportment alas how vainly do they swell their thoughts above mortality the common fate of death at last oertakes them but with this black difference that while the humble prince still falls lamented they are generally made the bloody victims to their subjects hatred and deserved resentment so that falling short in their too elevated race of power we may apply the words of juvenal to their unpitied destiny juven sat  0 ad generum cereris sine caede and vulnere pauci descendunt reges and sicca morte tyranni few monarchs die without some bloody blow or visit free from wound the shades below and tyrants who on earth dare heaven defy are very rarely found in beds of peace to die   how foreign ambassadors enter the seraglio a public notice being given to ambassadors when it is the sultans pleasure to admit them to his audience they contrive to make as splendid an appearance as their quality allows or honor of their country may require them to furnish gallantly attended by their retinue on horseback they proceed in order to the great seraglio where alighting as is usual at the entrance of the second court they are conducted to the third by certain officers of mean degree who there deliver the ambassador to the capigee bashaw or lord comptroler one who serves upon occasion for a master of the ceremonies  it is here they stay by the appointment of their guides till certain pages of the wardrobe come among them bearing each upon his arm a sort of vest or upper garment roughly wove with silver gold and yellow silk not neatly intermixed of length sufficient to hang down and trail upon the ground  their way of doing honor to ambassadors and their retinue they first address themselves to the ambassador and having covered all his other habit with this illcontrivd addition next proceed as ordered to bestow a certain number on his followers observing his direction as to their disposal thus adorned the minister himself and such of his attendants as before received the honor of a vest are beckoned to advance while those of meaner rank are entertained by men appointed for that service under the piazza or long gallery by which as i before informed you all the second court is gracefully surrounded  the ancient custom of giving changes of raiment observed among the turks this giving vests has been a very ancient eastern ceremony and was practiced formerly as now it is among the turks to give a proof of the respect they bore the person they so honored all ambassadors residing in the turkish court may judge of the esteem the sultan bears the prince they represent by the receiving more or fewer than is usual of these formal garments and it is by long continued custom now become a sort of due for the respective ministers of different nations to expect at least as many as some former precedent may possibly induce them to lay claim to a nicety about it and if they find the officers of the seraglio obstinately bent to give them fewer than were bestowed upon a predecessor they will oftentimes persist so strongly in the claim they lay to better usage as to turn again and leave the palace still refusing to obey their summons to an audience of the sultan till the turks consent to let them have it on the terms they sue for giving vests among the ancients may be proved in many places by the indisputable authority of holy writ particularly in the five and thirtieth chapter of the book of genesis and the two and twentieth verse where joseph sending back his brethren out of egypt it is said to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment  upon a warning given that the sultan is arrived and waits his coming the ambassador proceeds conducted by the lord comptroller and attended by such persons of his own retinue as are clothed in the abovenamd garments upon the entrance of the court which much unlike the former two the third court not so regular as the former is built irregular with many different apartments independent each on other you perceive directly opposite a lofty round and open hall the roof whereof is neatly arched and well supported by a double row of marble pillars  the gate guarded by eunuchs the gate of this third court is kept by eunuchs as too near the sultans lodgings to be approached by common soldiers all the ground between the portal and the hall of audience is enriched with carpets of the costliest workmanship on which the strangers walk till they arrive at a fine marble staircase which ascends to the abovenamed hall on either side whereof there issues from the wall through various artificial passages unnumbred streams of water falling with a different sound according to the bigness of their channels upon sloping shells of polished brass and thence descending to a spacious cistern flaggd and floord with exquisite mosaic work of various colors which easily perceived through the transparency of the included water wonderfully pleases the observing eye with a surprising and uncommon scene of beauties  description of the hall of audience the stairs are covered with the richest silks on which the introduced ambassadors must tread in their ascent to the extensive floor which though politely paved with curious squares of variouscolourd marble is all over covered with a golden carpet if it may be called so every thread whereof is little less than the genteelest sort of straws which form our mats in britain  about the middle of this spacious hall there plays a fountain in a very odd and curious manner from the cieling to the cistern not unlike a shower of rain the throne of the grand signior and opposite to the ascent there stands the throne of no great height but splendidly adorned with an extensive canopy broad backpiece and thick pleated bases all of black and costly velvet high embroidered over with a glorious mixture of both gold and silver wyre in the squares whereof are sewed turquoises diamonds pearls and rubys so contrived that they not only look magnificent but form a sort of easy figure so politely pleasing that against the will it captivates attention  upon this throne sits crossleggd the disdainful sultan looking round him with a sort of haughty frown to view the base and servile postures of the slaves about him  how he is attended on it and first the grand vizier stands humbly on his right hand very near him and at more submissive distance almost opposite appear the greatest officers of his seraglio ranged according to their several dignities holding each his hands across upon his humble bosom not presuming once to elevate those servile eyes which are not worthy so sublime an honor as to gaze upon the person of their mighty emperor thus formidably shining in his royal luster  the first approach of the ambassador no sooner the ambassador appears within the hall than there advance two officers who taking hold of both his arms attend him as he walks and still as he approaches nearer to the person of the sultan as it were by force incline his body so much nearer to the ground in three low bows the sultan condescends perhaps to look him in the face and now and then bestows a gentle nod while the ambassador is seated just before him on an easy stool all covered over with a rich brocado  the manner of his audience while the credentials are produced and reading by the druggaman in english the interpreter the presents brought and constantly expected from all foreign ministers upon their audience of the sultan are exposed to view and those of the ambassadors selected train who have been first distinguished as before advancing with their foreheads to the ground have leave to kiss the hem of the grand signiors vest which having done they silently retire and stand at some considerable space behind the stool of the ambassador  no sooner has the sultan heard the druggaman read loudly the credentials but he presents them to the grand vizier who purposely stands near him and the audience being over the ambassador takes leave but is not suffered once to turn his back upon the sultans person how he must retire and in order to prevent it he is led out backwards by the officers who before conducted him from this time forward he must make his application to the grand vizier and other ministers about the court for the grand signior though the head of all their business is himself above its practice leaving all the cares and hurries of a throne to his deputed instruments of state and power  the chambers of the pages or icholans along the left side of the court there run three rows of building parallel to one another called the odas of the icholans or apartments of the pages who ascending gradually from the meanest offices among the ajamolans are at last admitted to the lowest chamber of the pages where for full six years they are inured to all the practices of menial drudgery such as baking washing linen brushing clothes and such like labors  in

called according to their several standings to the hazoda or apartment for the pages of the presence to supply the vacancies there made from time to time by the preferment of the oldest to the greatest places of the empire  there is an officer appointed over every chamber to inspect the management of these icholans commonly amounting to almost a thousand men to him they are subservient in so high a manner that no imagination can conceive the strictness under which they live their restraint in the seraglio their beds are spread in order on each side of the extended building and themselves so rigidly denied a common liberty that they are never suffered to converse with any other quarter of the great seraglio  the baths of the seraglio directly opposite to these apartments are five rows of baths of different forms and structure as designed for the convenience of the high and low and every person in the sultans palace one row among them is the sultans own divided finely into numerous chambers paved with marble of an hundred colors and adorned with roofs and walls of crystal and a thousand other strange contrivances to render them beyond example pleasant and convenient  a barbarous custom of the turkish emperors among the buildings of this court there stands a low roofed hall of no mean length appointed for the lodging of the dwarfs dumb deaf crookbackd and other blots of nature many of each sort continually maintained for the diversion of the sultan who delights in sporting with those wretches miseries  the quarters of the white eunuchs the large apartments of the

and arbours rivulets and fountains reaches as you see to the very point of the seraglio plan of the turkish sultans seraglio at constantinople to the right honble charlot countess of warwick this plate is most humbly dedicated    the court on either side and reach within twelve paces of the garden walls their form is in the shape of large halfmoons embracing as it were the other buildings with their horns or corners  the mosque of the seraglio above the hall of audience and between the northeast ends of the two great halfmoons which form the eunuchs lodgings stands a mosque whose spires and cupolas are richly gilded and the pile surrounded by a lovely grove of lofty cypress trees it is here the sultan and his ladies daily come to their devotion yet unseen by any of those numerous crowds of people who assemble in the body of the church in that they are divided from the rest by a partition lettessd over with an admirable ingenuity but their devotion is no sooner ended than they all return the way they came and pass through private galleries unseen by any to their own apartments  pillars brought from troy directly from the mosque abovenamd runs an open gallery near thirty paces long and thirteen broad its roof supported by great numbers of fine marble pillars six whereof the turks report to have been brought from troy to constantinople when twas yet byzantium they are all of different color each from other one is blue another green and therefore held as sacred by the turks and every one so naturally bright that they are falsely said by common fame to be transparent  curious relics of antiquity the high raised fretwork of the floor is wonderfully fine and stately all composed mosaicly of great and little marble squares of all imaginable colors richly representing some historical and kingly figures which the superstitious turks have now defaced by picking out their eyes and quite deforming all their heads however the remaining beauty of this noble gallery sufficiently demonstrates that it was the workmanship of christian architects to grace some part of that illustrious palace while it flourished gloriously in the peaceful residence of grecian emperors  description of the grand signiors treasury a very large and noble portico or large piazza terminates this gallery on either side extending to an equal distance and completely forming a large semicircle at each end whereof there open two large doors each door admits you to some one of four vast chambers which contain the treasure of the turkish sultans  every chamber is alike for form and bigness making four halfmoons or semicircles two on either side at equal distance each from other with their horns or points directly contrary to those of the piazza just now mentioned and betwixt one building and another all the spaces being planted with the finest trees and odoriferous flowers in various artfull figures form a sort of charming prospect not to be imagined by the most capacious apprehension  six seals on either door and three large chains secure the entrance never opened but upon express command from the grand signior to the hasnadar bashaw or lord high treasurer each room is full of cupboards coffers ironchests and shelves extremely large all filled with riches of a different kind and shining brightly with collected heaps of most inestimable wealth and curious rarities which have from time to time been freely given bought or taken from the distant corners of the spacious universe  the royal lodgings directly opposite to the piazza which contains the doors that open to this treasure stand the royal lodgings which you enter by another great piazza not unlike the former but with its points so well disposed and so exactly opposite that both piazzas make a space of circular design and large extent the midst whereof contains a fountain spouting from its sides large streams of water which descending in a body on the center of the cistern form a figure pleasantly uncommon  two ancient obelisks amidst the space between the horns of the piazzas stand two obelisks of lofty height and wonderful contrivance but neglected by the turks no lovers of the venerable relics of antiquity are now oergrown with bushes and surrounding multitudes of brambles  a pavement leading to the midst of the piazza brings you to the entrance of the royal lodgings which complete another semicircle looking out upon the inmost gardens of the great seraglio and together with the gallery adjoining to it looking like two cs affixed together in the following manner  the wings adjoining to the royal lodgings two wings are added to the center either entered by a door which opens at each point of the piazza and extending their apartments in two large halfmoons directly opposite to those which form the treasury but standing with their horns the other way and pointing to the gardens like the sultans lodgings  all the space between these wings and the abovenamd treasury is filled with fountains cypress trees and curious flower gardens melancholy grottos and the vacancy on either side politely terminated by a semicircular grotto built of shells set here and there upon a rough hard substance exactly representing natural rock betwixt whose hollows artificial groves of fine impending coral seem to sprout and through their dropping branches murmuringly discharge small streams of water gently trickling down the rock in many places  the hazoda or apartment of the pages of the presence the right of these two wings the turks distinguish by the name of the hazoda where the forty pages of the presence have their lodging under the inspection of an officer of high degree here they first begin to taste the sweets of liberty and are permitted to converse with whom they please a privilege for many years before denied them  apartments of the great seraglio officers the left wing is divided into many fine and large apartments where are lodged the selictaraga or royal sword bearer hichokadarbashaw or bearer of the cloak and many other of the greatest officers of the seraglio such as always have admission to the presence of the sultan  the sultans quarter boasts no more than three great rooms but those so splendid and beyond imagination stately and convenient that one who never saw them cannot comprehend the twentieth part of their amazing excellences  description of the sultans glorious chambers the roofs are arched and all set thick with glittering spires and balls of crystal rimd about with gold and azure whence in many places hang great golden globes adorned with diamonds of surprising luster all the sides are richly flaggd in separate pannels with white black gray blue green and other colored marble twixt every one of which runs one of gold or silver reaching like the rest from top to bottom all the floor is veiny marble covered over with the finest and most costly cloth of gold that can be purchased neatly interwove with twenty other different colors close against the wall all round each chamber lie large cushions of a black green blue or crimson velvet embroidred in the richest manner with the finest pearls some long some round and some of every form and magnitude in short no part of all those chambers but possesses ornaments the most accomplished grandeur of the stateliest palaces of europe cannot equalize  a wonderful river flowing two ways behind the royal lodgings at about two hundred paces distance runs a river brought by art from the adjoining sea through subterraneous passages to rise exactly in the middle of the highest ground of the seraglio where it forms a sort of lake and through an artificial channel runs along with mighty swiftness down the hill on either side quite cross the palace passing through the garden walls on either side by a large iron grate and so descending to the sea two different ways from which it is constantly supplied as fast as it emits the rising waters  the impossibility of approaching the womens quarter it is this river that divides the great seraglio from the quarters of the ladies hindering all communication twixt the two divisions by the means of its impetuous current nor dares any man how bold soever once presume to straggle from his station toward the verge of this forbidden ground since could he pass the numerous guards of eunuchs which impede his progress though that bar alone is unsurmountable he must undoubtedly be seen by the grand signior or his officers and present ruin follow his discovery  lovely gardens from the buildings which contain the lodgings of the sultan and the semicircular wings thereto adjoining runs a spacious and delightful flowergarden curiously adorned with every kind of odoriferous plant and shady tree which can afford a smell or prospect any ways agreeable numerous fountains each of different form illustrate the appearance and the gardens reaching from one wall to the other terminate their breadth upon the bank of the abovenamd river all along whose edge there runs a row of breasthigh iron rails as on the other side appears a line of gilded banisters  there runs a little marble pavement from the sultans postern through a very stately wooden arch adorned with trees and twining jessamins which twist about it in the middle of the garden not unlike the famed triumphal arches of the ancient romans  this pavement is divided at about an hundred paces from the river into two distinct and semicircular galleries with banisters on either side about three foot in height adorned with spires and balls of gold two drawbridges which lead you to the ladies apartment which lead to two great drawbridges each guarded by a party of white eunuchs on the hither side and crossing the swift current on each side of the beforenamd source of waters at the other foot of either bridge there waits a constant guard of black or negro eunuchs and two other galleries exactly correspondent to the former lead two ways to such another pavement running also through an arch adorned and built exactly like the other  of the apartments of the women  and now we are arrived upon a ground where any man except the sultan is like juvenals rara avis in terris even as great a rarity as his black swan or any other wonder nothing here is seen but beauty strangely intermixed with rough deformity each small avenue leading to the women who inhabit this division black or negro eunuchs being watched continually by crowds of blackamores not only robbed of all the strong and virile marks of lusty manhood by a smooth castration or decision rather but elected from the most deformed and evil countenanced of that untempting race as if the cursed insatiate jealousy of the lascivious sultans could not think the incapacitating them from amorous practices with their distrusted women were sufficient to secure them but they must inhumanely contrive a way to keep the ladies inclinations chaste by the prevailing virtue of a strong antipathy  moral reflections how wide alas does this luxurious prince mistake the real road to greatness who instead of awing his audacious subjects by a warlike disposition and the even balance of impartial justice leaves his empire to subservient managements and meanly gives himself entirely over to the constant practice of voluptuous living neither knowing nor desiring other grandeur than the plenary indulgment of his carnal appetite not considering that as seneca says in his tragedy of thyestes sen tra of thyestes regem non faciunt opes non vestis tyriae color non frontis nota regiae non auro nitidae trabes rex est qui posuit metus et diri mala pectoris quem non ambitio impotens et nunquam stabilis favor vulgi praecipitis movet the transient honors which frail riches bring are not those royal proofs that mark a king not tyrian purple over his garments spread nor regal diadems around his head not graceful robes which shine in every fold with a polite embroidery of gold he only is a king who not oppressed by those black fears and ills which storm his breast bravely stands firm his justice to maintain and hears ambition tempt his power in vain who stands the established pillar of his state always alike still good and ever great   moral reflections content will make the meanest object of uncovered poverty a happier man than commonly the sultan is in all these elevated scenes of pomp and glory the towering height whereon he stands does seldom fail to make him giddy then he falls below the bliss of those who can in rags reflect on grandeur in the following notions of that admirable author rex est qui metuit nihil rex est quique cupit nihil hoc regnum sibi quisque dat that mans a monarch who can fear no fate sos he who never covets to be great and that which makes such sort of kingdoms best is that all men at will may be thereof possessed   moral reflections no man who seriously reflects upon the bloody ends which commonly attend the turkish emperors and overtake their pride amidst the sunshine they are fondly basking in would wish to change degrees with their uncertain majesty and surely death must fall with double weight on such as power and haughtiness of soul have lifted up beyond the apprehension of its ever reaching them for to make use again of senecas expressions illi mors gravis incubat qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritur sibi death on that man must heavy fall who by his grandeur shown known and respected too by all dies to himself unknown   a winding gallery but to return again to what i was about the pavement on the other side the second arch admits you to the entrance of a stately gallery perhaps the finest that was ever heard of for it reaches from one garden wall to the other winding in and out exactly as we paint a folding serpent all the turnings at an equal distance from each other and so often made that those who walk upon it lose the sight of one another every ten or fourteen paces  fine marble pillars it is supported nobly by two rows of pillars of a red and white large veiny marble all the bases and the capitals are black and the inverting floor on which they stand consists of spacious marble squares politely intermixed one half of red the other of a lovely greenish color  you ascend the top of the abovenamd gallery by a broad marble staircase with three stately landingplaces railed on either side with iron gilt and headed with large balls and spires of gold a golden floor you enter with a strange surprise to see the bottom floord to all appearance with thick plates of burnished gold which is indeed no more than copper gilt but every year or two renewed or polished so that it reflects a dazzling luster and amazing majesty on either side is built a kind of wall breast high whose inside like the floor is plated over with the copper gilt and all along upon its top on either side at five foot distance from each other stand vast numbers of fine golden pyramids each pyramid adorned upon its utmost point with one large globe of gold by four whereof the bottom is supported  the reader i presume will be inclined to think this place as i have now described it so magnificent and beautiful that it can scarce admit of an additional extravagance he will be consequently much surpised a lovely walking place when i inform him that on either side within the wall are very deep and artificial hollows filled with soil of a productive nature where are planted woodbines commonly called honysuckles jessamins low flowers and tuberoses which supported by a stronger and more spreading kind of lasting greens so sweetly intermix with one another meeting at the top and growing thick upon a frame of rich gilt box wood that you walk as in a dream through all the odoriferous ecstasies of natures blessings  the lodgings of the negro eunuchs the gallery is terminated on the left by a large door which opens sideways into the apartment of the negro eunuchs or blackguard of the secluded ladies which extends it self strait forward toward the point of the seraglio about two hundred yards in length and breadth proportionable it consists of only one large hall supported by large vaults wherein are all the cellars landries and conveniences required for the service of the ladies  the room is equally divided into spaces for the eunuchs lodgingplaces and its high arched roof supported by an hundred marble pillars fifty on a side about the middle opens a low wooden door and lets you out upon a gallery which fronts the gardens here they eat drink and divert themselves when out of waiting casting still an eye of observation on the womens actions  the lodgings of the sultans mistresses directly opposite and entered in the same manner lie the lodgings of the sultans mistresses consisting also of one room and gallery with offices below it the length breadth height and whole proportion just the same with the apartment of the eunuchs  the furniture of their apartment but as for all the ornamental part the roof sides floor and pillars of the ladies chamber are exactly like the sultans own division or if any difference appears it is because the womens quarter shines more brightly if it is possible with gold and crystal and whereas the rooms of the grand signior as you read before are panneld from the cieling to the floor with gold and silver every yard or two between the marble here instead thereof they sert the finest lookingglass which so surprizingly adorns the place that viewing as you walk along a strange confused irregularity of prospect in promiscuous mixtures of the various colored marble flags the cushions carpets and the numerous pillars which support the building you are agreeable amazed at so uncommon an appearance  their beds and way of sleeping their beds are only quilts or carpets five times doubled over which is laid a satin coverlet which being turned aside they enter in their shifts and mustin drawers and contentedly repose themselves till break of day beyond which hour they seldom are permitted to indulge themselves in slumber  how their beds are placed four rows of beds there are from one end of the chamber to the other and the number of the ladies sometimes more and sometimes less may commonly be reckoned at about five hundred two rows of beds are placed against the wall on either side and two between the columns which support the chamber  the governantes of the seraglio how chosen between each fourth and fifth of all the beds their lies a kind of matron if it may be proper so to call an aged virgin for they are always chosen out of those more antiquated ladies whose hard luck has burdened them with the vnsummond load of stale virginity and consequently made them fit for a succession to the vacancies of such a post as by requiring a malicious care to hinder wantonesses they are past the taste of speaks em enviously and extremely qualified for its possession  how the ladies live in the seraglio it is the proper business of these illnatured governantes to inspect the actions and behavior of the young recluses by day to keep em strictly to their work which for the most part is embroidery in various colors intermixed with gold and silver upon silk or muslin at other times to see they miss not those genteeler parts of education such as singing dancing and the like according to the turkish mode all which is taught em daily by black eunuchs purposely obliged to practice such accomplishments as twill be requisite to teach the ladies  a strictness to prevent immodest actions there burn all night not far from each beds foot a sort of fine wax tapers and the only reason for it is that by their light the governante may be able to discover all immodest or indecent pastimes which the wanton inclinations of the youthful ladies kept from the society or sight of man might prompt em to the practice of did opportunity and darkness favor their endeavors i could give my reader some amazing instances in that particular but since it may offend the modesty of my more chaste and virtuous countrywomen twill be more obliging if i spare their blushes by omitting the relation  the ladies gallery the gallery adjoining to the ladies lodgings tho exactly correspondent and alike in form and bigness to its opposite belonging to the negro eunuchs shines beyond it in a high degree by reason of the rich embroidered cushions cloth of gold and silken furniture wherewith the floor and saffrai are both covered looking out upon a garden filling all the space between the buildings and extending its avenues flowerplots fountains and cool grottos from the winding gallery to the bottom of the lodgings a stately quicksetthedge where it is terminated by a quicksetthedge of a surprising height and thickness forming a half moon the horns whereof embrace the inner angles of the two apartments open in the middle by a smooth and artificial gap which represents a large arched gateway leading to the entrance of a shady grove the spreading branches of whose various trees meet over head and form a hundred lovely bowers and cool retirements which i shall hereafter largely treat of  lovely gardens from the galleries which front the two apartments you descend from either end by a large marble staircase turning from the quicksett hedge and winding till they look toward the side walls of the seraglio these admit you to the entrances of many shady paths and graceful avenues of myrtle cypress orange trees and jessamins which wind delightfully from place to place sometimes admitting you to subterraneous grottos all supported and adorned by marble pillars from whose sides there issues water that by falling down from different heights on shells of brass of different thickness makes a sort of gentle music sweetly full of melancholy harmony  fine greens for the diversion of the sultans mistersses sometimes these walks or rather labyrinths lead you out upon fine greens round square oblong and of all forms imaginable moated round by wellstockd fish ponds in the middle of these greens there generally stands a tent each rope whereof is guarded by an eunuch here such ladies as are graver than the rest sit cross legged and observe the pastimes of their fellow beauties some of which run wildly up and down the field and form a kind of sport not much unlike our english country game of threading the scottish needle others dance upon another part of the same green here some are walking and conversing merrily there three or four are lolling in the shade stretching and rolling up and down in wanton postures and every now and then you may perceive some serious solitary virgin angling in the fishpond and unmindfull of all pastimes but her own sedate and innocent diversion  lascivious customs of the ladies in the seraglio it is not seldom that the sultan does in person grace their exercises and then they all contrive with eager emulation who shall most engage his fancy by the artifice of her behavior now modesty takes leave of these licentious ladies and the warmer arguments of loose desire incline them to the practice of the most lascivious dances postures and performances which serve to raise a lustful fire and may excite the passion of the amorous sultan to a cooling satisfaction of his heated wishes in a full possession of her happy charms who more than any other moves his inclinations  such gardens groves and fine plantations of delicious fruit trees as i have above described fill all the large remaining space within the inner wall of the seraglio which confines the womens quarter the great gardens of the seraglio and divides the whole from those vast tracts of garden ground which quite surround the palace and consist of fruits of every kind herbs cucumbers and every individual thing which is required even from the kitchen to the dining room these larger gardens are manured by men of common knowledge in affairs of husbandry but those belonging to the ladies quarter are not entered but by certain of the negro eunuchs purposely instructed in the art of gardening that they may be qualified to serve in that employment  another wall another wall divides the largest gardens from the outward wall of the seraglio leaving only space sufficient for the passing and repassing of those troops of soldiers who from time to time relieve the guards perpetually employed to keep the towers which as i said before defend the palace  i know the natural curiosity of my expecting female readers will induce them to condemn my want of complaisance if after having led them gradually through every corner of the sultans palace i should hurry em away without permitting them to look a little into his amors the hopes perhaps of which amusement was the only cause that brought em thither  to this i answer that i will immediately comply with their desires but must by way of prologue urge em all to lay aside those vulgar errors and romantic notions former authors or perhaps their traveling lovers have possessed their minds with  common fame a common liar common fame is both a liar and a magnifier of the falsities of all mankind where truth is doubtful or the fact obscure she strait contrives to fill deficiencies with a productive train of illegitimate assertions a mistaken notion of the grand signiors courtship nor ever could a subject more entirely prove the certainty of this opinion than the great seraglio of the turkish sultan and the ceremonious practices of his uncommon ways of courtship such as walking through them with a knott of handkerchiefs fastened to his girdle one of which he drops at every ladies foot he has a mind to make his bedfellow yet this erroneous story had the fortune to obtain so good a credit that the learned and judicious sir paul ricaut has not blushed to tell us in his maxims of the turkish polity that such as is above described was universally allowed to be the pattern of the sultans courtship  love affairs should be kept secret affairs of love the ladies tell me should be kept as secret as affairs of state and certainly if so it is doubly criminal when we betray the close amors of royal monarchs yet for once i will venture to transgress those rules of privacy and give as punctual an account as i am able of the scenes of love occasionally practiced twixt the sultan and his mistresses if any of my countrywomen should be so delighted with the pleasures i describe as to abandon england for the turks seraglio the nation will forgive me for the loss they suffer by considering the accident as such a wonderful surprise that not the sharpest mortal guess could ever have expected it  the notice given by the sultan when he intends a visit to his ladies first then the sultan almost daily visits the apartment of his ladies and gives notice half an hour or more before he comes by looking out from his back windows to the drawbridge guarded by the negro eunuchs and informing them of his intention by the words helvett gelerrum that is make ready i am coming  how he is received and what he does among them this notice is enough and all the inner palace rings immediately with the repeated sounds of this alarm all the ladies dress themselves with have wash shift perfume and polish their appearances for the reception of their master who upon his entrance is saluted by the whole assembly on their knees he sits drinks coffee tea and toys away an hour or two in kissing and embracing them with equal familiarity and then conducts them to the greens or bowers within the gardens where he takes delight to see their emulation in the several arts of pleasing which i just now told you they employ their time in  how the sultan chooses a mistress this is however but the method of his public conversation with the numbers of his ladies amongst whom the charms of one will often shine superior to the others her on some such day of public sport appointed purposely he beckons from the rest and leads her to some bower to talk a while in private and prepare her expectation for the honor he allots her to  how he courts her the eunuchs who attend acquainted with the reasons of their emperors withdrawing summon the repining remnant of the disappointed virgins back to their apartment while the newelected mistress of the sultans love receives perhaps the sweet advances of a kiss or two in token of the value she has heard her lord declare he bears her after which she is delivered by the hand of the grand signior to the charge of those black eunuchs then in waiting  the respect the other ladies are obliged to show her by them she is saluted with a low respect becoming the address of such as compliment the partner of the sultans bed and quite surrounded by her black retinue walks in state along the chamber she so lately was confined to all the other ladies as she passes by rise up and falling on their knees to kiss her vest congratulate the blessing she must soon become possessor of  their pride upon advancement transported by success beyond her self and giddy by the height of her advancement to such fortune reason which before perhaps had little place within her mind now quite forsakes the elevated creature who forgetting that her happiness depends upon the humor of a fickle monarch and must stand or fall as he is pleased or displeased with her first embraces looks about her with a scornful air of pride and grandeur and believes herself as much above them in her merit as she then appears by the respect they pay her hence spring a thousand jealousies malicious wishes envies and uneasinesses which are the neverfailing consequences of domestic preference among the ladies and undoubtedly gave cause to that old grecian poet who by the way it is ten to one was married to cry out  the envy of the women make mens houses downright bedlams  preparatory ceremonies the public wardrobe of the ladies lodgings is obliged to furnish rich variety of cloths and jewels upon such occasions and with these she is conducted by the grave matronas i before discoursed of to the bagnios of the sultan where she is not only stripped and washed from head to foot but scented with perfumes to add new charms to those of nature that she may appear at night deserving that affection which her royal lover has vouchsafed to crown her with  a pleasant custom besides the preparation of the bagnio previous to her bedding the grand signior she is offered wine to drink without control that so she may possess at night an artificial vigor more engaging than the modest bashfullness of her untried and native innocence  thus may the reader see how wantonly the monarchs of the turkish empire study means to swell their pleasures to the utmost pitch of taste and luxury whereby they madly hasten on their ends forgetful of that true but much unheeded grecian maxim an admirable grecian maxim   three things there are that shorten mortals breath and hurry us compendiously to death bathing and drinking wine to great excess and love of female joys to lustful wantonness   how the lady is conducted to the sultans chamber when night is come and the grand signior full of expectation laid in bed the eunuchs of his chamber notify his pleasure to the waiting lady who is thereupon immediately attended by the other virgins matrons and black eunuchs to the sultans chamber all the instruments of turkish music sounding round her and a hundred large wax tapers lighting her along they leave her at the door and wishing her a satisfaction equal to her honor separate and all return to their respective places  how received there mean while the trembling virgin knocks and is admitted by the kisler aga or great master of the negro eunuchs who attends her coming to instruct her in some necessary duties she must offer at performing after which he modestly withdraws and leaves her in the chamber  her first address to the grand signior the sultan all this while expects her in the bed to which she is directed by two large white tapers burning in the room i should have told you that she enters only covered with a wrapping nightgown and advancing to the feet of the grand signiors bed falls down upon her knees and in an humble manner asks this question a slave to your commands great monarch waits your beckon may or may she not be now admitted  you may be sure the sultan answers yes and if impatient to possess her beauties takes her in as soon and kindly as your self young reader would your mistress their pleasant method of creeping in at the bedsfeet but alas poor women common custom generally forces them to a more humble entrance for in token of submission dropping off their nightgown they must gently raise the bed clothes at the feet and so creep gradually up to those embraces which an englishman would be so civil to believe deserving of a kinder welcome and an englishwoman if i know them rightly think too worthy to bestow in such a mortifying and submissive manner  their salutation in the morning it is possible however that an aftergame of love and kindness may make full amends for the indifference of her first reception that we will not doubt of but proceed to tell you that when morning breaks they are awakened by the sound of music and the shriller voices of some tunefull eunuchs singing certain songs composed on purpose not unlike the epithalamiums of the ancient all these songs are handed up and down the city when the story of some new intrigue inclines the people to converse upon that subject i had several presented me and one among the rest i have translated to divert the reader a turkish epithalamium blessings crown the royal pair mighty sultan happy fair endless pleasures bless your bed angels wings around you spread godlike offspring grace your joys heavenly daughters lovely boys all that eithers wish can crave that let both together have long continue all your pleasure let your bliss be out of measure blessings crown the royal pair mighty sultan happy fair   the present he makes her in the morning alarmed by the repeated harmony of these congratulary songs the newmade woman rises from the bosom of her amorous partner who bestows at parting with a grateful kiss some precious jewel of inestimable value as soon as she is covered by the wrapper she threw off the night before the sultan pulls a silken string and presently come in the ladies and their matrons to attend her in another chamber while she dresses richly in the clothes i lately told you were demanded from the wardrobe having first been bathed and well perfumed all over in the private bagnio  the honor of a favorite if she has been so happy as to please the sultan in a more than common manner she continues queen of his apartment and affection served all day upon the knee by his superior officers and sharing every night the bed of her great master and it has been sometimes known that one has kept possession of his heart for many years together insomuch that all the other ladies have been slighted or forgotten while their monarchs thoughts were wholly bent to find new pleasures for the object of his passion  how the sultan and she pass their time when any lady is so fortunate as this the daily custom of the sultan is to lead her up and down from walk to walk and bower to bower about the garden courting her as amorously and as full of softness as a christian lover would a mistress he addressed for marriage all the while they walk the gardens must be private not so much as a black eunuch is permitted to remain to overhear or see the fond amors of the delighted sultan  other diversions sometimes they walk or sit in grottoes sometimes in the coolest part of some sweet grove where fine cascades and other water works seem to join harmony with warbling birds about their heads as if they strove to drown from any others ear the whispering softness of their voices sometimes they mount a sort of winding stairs that lead up to a little pleasure house contrived within the branches of an oak or walnut tree and covered over with embroidred velvet cushions where they sit stand lie and dally wantonly unseen by any thing but heaven in a mutual transport  a strange contrivance for a seat of pleasure amongst the numerous contrivances those gardens boast one seems to have been copied from an indian model for in certain thickest parts of the close groves is left a square about four yards in bigness at every corner of this square is planted a large tree whose branches growing very high and spreading far beyond the rest meet overhead and form a canopy that shades all underneath from the most piercing sunshine to the smallest of these trees low branches consequently such as any weight will move most easily are fastened strongly the four corners of a doubled canvass covered over with the richest velvet which is pulled so tight that it appears as even as a table yet when any thing of reasonable burden comes upon it all the branches giving way like springs it feels a very odd and pleasant kind of motion  a charming summer house a little wooden staircase winding round each corner tree admits the sultan and his valued mistress to this velvetcoverd canvas where they sometimes roll about and rocking up and down so toy away their hours in amorous pastime sometimes sitting crossleggd play at chess or talk away their minutes in a pleasing conversation while their ravished senses are enchanted in a manner by the twining honeysuckles jessamins and other odoriferous plants and flowers which growing out of certain pots of earth ingeniously made fast to the topbranches of the trees hang sweetly down between the boughs and form a lovely scent and prospect not to be imagined but by persons present this place so rich in pleasure tempts the passions of the toying couple to such ardent wishes that the shady canopy which covers them so well is often conscious of their wanton pastime  how the other ladies are disposed off after beding the grand signior besides these inward scenes of the grand signiors dalliances there stands a letticd kiosk or summer house adorned with cloth of gold and velvet cushions whence while they are drinking coffee tea or chocolate they have an open prospect of the asian mountains all the haven and the town upon the other side with the kaickgees or boat men rowing up and down and the said summer house being built upon the outward wall of the seraglio all the galleys ships of war and trading vessels foreign or their own must necessarily pass almost within pistol shot of their commodious situation  these are the favors constantly bestowed upon those happy ladies who obtain a monarchs heart in lieu of their virginities but the less successful women after they have one night tasted the embraces of a man are carried from the chamber where they live when maids and locked in a seraglio called kadin serai or ladies palace here they live a solitary life confined within the walls of an old building waited on by eunuchs and can never hope for liberty unless they chance to prove with child if so they are brought back to an apartment near the sultans and delivered in his presence ever after living there with liberty to wear a crown of different shape and value according to her quality which is defined by being first or second third fourth fifth or twentieth hasakee or concubine  a barbarous policy as for the sons they are delivered of the barbarous policy of their jealous government immediately imprisons them as soon as born in a dark underground apartment where they are instructed in their language and religion all their necessaries handed down through holes bored through the cieling being never suffered even to see the sun till on the death of him who reigned the eldest brother is elected from his dungeon to the throne of that great empire who of old as soon as he was father of a son or two himself was used to order all his brothers to be strangled in the prison but of late they have disused this black inhumane custom  the newelected emperor enjoys at pleasure any of those women who were brought to the seraglio for the pleasure of his predecessor only the sultanas or such ladies as he had enjoyed are instantly removed to the kadin serai i lately spoke of all the rest remaining pure undoubted virgins he possesses as he pleases the care they use in getting virgin here the reader may take notice that no women are admitted into the seraglio after eight years old that so the sultan may not be deceived as to her being innocent from even a thought of man nor then unless their beauties promise by the fineness of their bloom to ripen by degrees to full perfection  it now and then so happens that a full grown woman who is made the prize of war is sent to the seraglio by some great bashaw but then such a lady must be mistress of those charms which seem to mark her as a treasure only fit for the grand signiors keeping  how the sultans daughters are disposed of the sultans daughters at five six or seven years of age are married to bashaws of high command who in acknowledgment of the great honor he conferrs upon them are obliged each newyearsday to send a present to their royal fatherinlaw of such considerable value that it drains their coffers faster than they find fair means to fill em so that by this little artifice the sultan finds continual means to turn the danger of a subjects riches to his own advantage  how the women of the seraglio plague the sultan now will the reader be inclined to think that he who swims in such a sea of pleasure cannot be invaded by the stings of discontent yet as a proof that every mortal must be subject to the imperfections which attend mortality a thousand little anxietys torment and vex him and the quarrels of his women so distract his temper that he often will be absent a considerable time in hunting or some other pastime on purpose to avoid the trouble of becoming arbitrator of their frequent disputations  no state of mortal life entirely happy thus can no condition of our life be fully happy celibacy has its inconveniences and so has matrimony we often change sides like men in fevers yet can never reach the ease we aim at there are some admirable notions hereupon in a greek poem which is already rendered english by so great a hand that i will give em you translated as i found em         domestic cares afflict the husbands bed or pains his head those who live single take it for a curse or do things worse some would have children those who have them moan or wish them gone what is it then to have or have no wife but single thraldom or a double strife   to wind up my discourse of the seraglio i will only add that in respect to the grand signior mutes are there in great esteem and such an aweful silence always kept that they have learned a language on their fingers which is not only practiced by the mutes but all the officers in the seraglio who can readily by signs express themselves as fully as they can by speaking why mutes are made the executioners of turkey another thing the reader may take notice of is that the mutes are kept as executioners and sent to strangle such great men as the grand signior signs a warrant for the death of i know not why they more than others are appointed to that duty unless it is because by being deaf and dumb they are not qualified to hear and pity those they execute  chap xx of the revenues of the turkish sultan the reader must not here expect particular accounts of those prodigious sums of money wherewith the emperors of turkey still find means to fill their coffers private treasures how amassed in turkey i can only tell him that besides the public treasury i lately spoke of there is kept in the seraglio private banks of money in strong leather baggs the sum which each contains inscribed upon a label fastned to it these have been amassed by former sultans and are all distinguished from each other by the several names of the collecting monarchs deeply cut upon the covers of large iron chests which hold the leather baggs abovenamd  to what use reserved these private treasures though containing mighty sums of money which instead of lying dead might be increased each year by different improvements are esteemed so sacred by the superstitious turks that they believe it nothing less than heinous guilt or sacrilege it self to make the smallest use thereof till it may do their country and religion signal service at a time if such a time ever happen when the christian nations join against them and invade their territories a thing i fear too much unlikely but in which the turks are apprehensive of a universal danger  the yearly revenue of the grand signior as for the revenues of the turkish sultan such i mean as are his fixed propriety and the undoubted right of his imperial dignity they are at present reckoned at about eight millions and three hundred thousand pounds sterling yearly income a sum becoming the possession of a prince so absolute as the grand signior  the manner of collecting it the manner of collecting this prodigious sum is by assessing every subject of his empire at an inconsiderable yearly tax which he must pay as an acknowledgment of his dependence on and duty to the sultan and it is an admirable method they have got of raising all this money without any charge or trouble to the emperor  the petty governors of every little district are obliged to gather the respective quotas of the villagers about them and set out with guards sufficient to defend the money toward the next great town to their dependant residences here they must deliver it to the possession of the aga or the governor of the place demanding his discharge for their acquittance of a duty so incumbent on their offices  how carried to the capital the agas adding to this sum their own collections guard em in like manner to the sangiacks or the lords provincial they with the addition of their own deliver it to the superior beylerbeys or great archdukes of turkey and these last continue all in their possession till demanded by the guards who undertake to carry it in wagons safely to constantinople  the quarterly collections never are behind hand for on pain of ruin no man dares refuse immediate payment on the day appointed so that ten days after every quarter the remotest provinces begin to send away their money toward the city i so lately named in every province the timariots zaims and other standing soldiery are summoned to appear and form a general muster how guarded on the road whence with their commanders at their head they all advance and guard the wagons to the residence of the sangiack of the adjoining province  he with all his soldiers joining his additional collections to the former there receives the custody of all together and advances in like manner till he reaches his next neighbor who relieves him with another party and in this settled order they proceed still swelling their collections till the last delivers all the revenues of one quarter to the lord high treasurer at constantinople  it is observable that as the provinces which lie the nearest to their great metropolis must undertake the convoy of far greater sums than the remoter places so the number of their soldiers is proportionably greater as they are by far more populous for reasons mentioned in the chapter treating of the maxims of their policy  an admirable policy now though the sultans treasure is thus brought him by the universal labor of his subjects he is as i have said entirely free from any kind of charge this duty being fixed upon his governors of provinces as one of those incumbent on their places and consequently to be managed only by those officers  another way the sultan has of raising money but many are the means whereby the sultan daily adds prodigious sums to his revenues such as for example the obliging all the great bashaws and governors of his dominions every newyearsday to send him presents commonly in ready money which amounts to an incredible amassment  another which he often uses another way he has when his occasions press him to collect extraordinary sums by sending orders to the lords provincial of his empire immediately to raise as much as he requires which they must do without reply by means as absolute as the command of their great master oftentimes the sultan takes occasion to demand such sums from certain provinces as it is impossible they can supply him with but sending in compliance with his will as much as they can spare excuse themselves as incapacited for a further contribution  a barbarous avarice here the grand signior gains his end and finds a thousand fair pretenses for the execution of the governors of all such provinces he either sends em word that they have quite impoverished their governments by tyrannous oppression of their people to enrich themselves or that their lives must pay the forfeit of their disobedience having failed to execute his royal orders which obliges him to think them either traitors to his power or unable to discharge the trust he had conferred upon them  either of these reasons or indeed a weaker often none at all suffice to ruin those whose riches speak em fit for execution which is done as i have said before by strangling why the turks use strangling for it is esteemed a crime of an unpardonable nature to spill the blood of any mussulman the treasure of such governors is instantly declared confiscated to the grand signior and accordingly delivered into his capacious coffers  the turks very covetous thus does possession of a splendid wealth endanger those who own it yet it is observable that turks of every nation are the most inclined to aim at growing rich more zealously pursuing gain by how much faster it rolls in upon them and this in every age has been a vice as epidemic as unreasonable the poor are commonly the most contented with their fortune and juvenal has left it as a maxim that juv sat    crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit et minus hanc optat qui non habet the love of money does with money grow those wish it least who least its comforts know   the customs upon goods imported and exported are another means of bringing in considerable sums of money to the coffers of the sultan and occasional taxes of an hundred kinds imposed on christians and the turks themselves of which it was impossible to get a just account amount each year to such amazing heaps of wealth that the grand signior cannot tell the bottom of his income  but as the violent extortion of superiors tempts the rest to imitate their methods in a private dealing every man applies himself to study means of growing rich as finding a necessity of being so if they would make a figure worth regarding juv sat    vnde habeas quaerit nemo sed oportet habere no man will ask which way you wealthy grow yet would you gain respect you must be so   though all the nations of the world have ever disregarded ragged merit none despise it like the turkish people for their nobility becoming so but by the riches they are masters of the poor are looked upon with strange contempt and their successless labors slandered with the stain of want of industry and the curse of poverty were in any country an insupportable misfortune though it had but that one mark of inconvenience named by juvenal juv sat   nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se quam quod ridiculos homines facit unhappy poverty that heavy curse in its oppressive weight has nothing worse than that such men as griping want endure appear ridiculous by being poor   proceed we now to view the present state of the poor modern greeks and see how much we find among them of the ancient spirit of their glorious ancestors  chap xxi of the greeks in their modern state the learning and power of the ancient greeks the spacious earth affords no scene which plainlier represents to a contemplative genius the frail foundation of all human gandeur than the present condition of subverted greece that ancient theater of power and learning and nursery of the most illustrious propagators of wisdom and morality he who looks back on former ages and traces that unhappy nation to its meridian splendor will be strangely struck with an uncommon wonder at the degenerate principles of their unmanned posterity the vicissitudes of fortune will amaze his thoughts when he reflects sedately on the glorious state of power and knowledge in which they flourished under the instructive discipline of their jonick socratick cyrenaick platonic academick peripatetick stoic and pythagorean philosophers whose wise and virtuous dictates inspired their minds with an elevated sense of piety and honor in the practice of which as they exceeded and instructed most other nations they endeavored to outvie each other all contending with an emulative zeal for a wished superiority of speculative learning till by the long continued blessing of such aspiring inclinations they raised the fame of their illustrious governments above the rest of the submissive world and built themselves a glory whose increasing brightness could receive no shadow from the affected ignorance of contending nations  the degeneracy of the moderns but strangely different is the present genius of that metamorphosd people who have so widely deviated from the footsteps of their ancestors that to describe them rightly in their modern state of slavery we must place em in a diametrical opposition to honor worth and industry their very nature seems to have been changed with their condition as if their principles had sunk with their nobility mahomets massacre whom mahomet the great on his taking constantinople endeavored to extirpate by a general massacre imagining politickly that a revolt of the nation would be dangerously and unsuccessfully attempted when they should want a head to guide the rough resentments of an undisciplined multitude an emperor trodden to death their last emperor was trodden to death in one of the city gates and the greatest part of his family most barbarously butchered by the inhumane conquerors those few who with their wives and children escaped the tyrants rage retired to woods and places far remote from the imperial city where in disguises proper to conceal their quality they wandered up and down in all the wants and hardships of a miserable poverty till by the course of time their mean condition reduced the nature of their untaught posterity to so low an ebb that their so lofty extract which some remaining members of that family now vainly boast of serves but as an arrow to stab their thoughts with the shameful idea of their present miseries nothing can more deeply dictate the strange degrees and turns of fate a man is subject to than the rigid fortune of this illustrious family whose remaining branches scattered here and there and only known by the name of peologus are so strangely fallen as to live for the most part by a laborious practice of the most mechanical employments i was never more sensibly afflicted at the misfortunes of another than when i saw at constantinople in the house of mr williams an english merchant now at aleppo one constantine paleologus at that time a groom of his stables his posterity reduced to extreme poverty this man demonstrated by undeniable proofs that he was lineally descended from the emperors of greece but was most sordidly illiterate and inexpressibly ignorant in any thing beyond the dressing of his horses yet he had a peculiar majesty in his person and somewhat uncommon distinguished his extract from the vulgar dictates of his meaner education an awful gravity adorned his countenance and his silent postures had somewhat naturally noble but it grieved me to see him after having readily repeated the numerous misfortunes of his wandering family and proudly boasted of hereditary nobility run unconcernedly by his horses side trotting without thought through the dirty streets with his hardened hand upon his masters stirrup  the same fate which attended the blood royal involved the numerous branches of the grecian nobility so that scarce a gentleman now remains who can trace his extract to the third generation all are become alike unhappy and alike contented and though the greatest part of the inhabitants of bulgaria romania and several other parts of turkey are still greeks the effects of slavery they possess no land enjoy no liberty nor study any manner of learning but with an unaccountable indifference submit themselves to the pleasure of the turks paying them the greatest part of that miserable maintenance their labor gets em nor dare they think of shaking off the turkish yoke by a general insurrection though the fairest opportunity should court em to endeavor it choosing rather to live oppressed by tyranny than by an active valor undergo the fatigues of a vigorous war to regain the possession of forgotten liberty and the better to excuse the palpable grossness of their ignoble genius they have coined a maxim now current amongst em a greek maxim that they are wisest who choose to know least where knowledge of things past would only increase the weight of present misery  besides the european greeks asia major and part of africa is inhabited by great numbers of these people their gluttony but though resident in different countries they are all led by the same genius to the practice of little else but gluttony and ebriety which last vice they were ever famous for spending their time in dancing singing and when they merchandise in cheating to such a degree that the faith of a greek is now become a jear proverbially thrown at a man of dishonest principles some are masters of small vessels which carry passengers and goods from port to port in coasting voyages those in europe are employed by the turks to till the ground themselves but little skilled in husbandry they are allowed to plant vineyards for their own use and that labor they seldom spare retaining so much their ancient vice of immoderate drinking that the man is reputed a churl who suffers his friend to depart sober from an entertainment they drink in earthen cups replenishing them as fast as emptied each man for his neighbor and sending em round without intermission till their brains intoxicated with the fumes of the wine they begin without order to dance kiss and sing embracing one another with such antic gestures and a noise so disagreeable that it is very surprising to a stranger who is present at their meetings  mens habit they differ in their habit according to their professions ever imitating the turks as nearly as they dare which they are allowed to do in all things but yellow shoes green vests or a turbant of one color instead whereof most greeks use furred caps of what form or color they please their ancient habits are now quite out of date and they differ so much from them that whereas they formerly delighted much in long and spreading hair in regard of which homer often calls em  the long haird greeks they now shave all their heads and account it ridiculous in the franks not to follow their example womens habit the women as the turks wear long vests muslin shifts and drawers of cambrick reaching to their feet their girdles are of twisted silk neatly wove and embosd with gold silver or silver gilt set thick with saphirs emralds rubies or diamonds and those whose circumstances will not afford em to follow this fashion procure sophisticate stones and counterfeited metal to imitate it as nearly as possible  description of the grecian women their women are for the most part exquisitely shaped generally of a brown complexion excellently featured and their disposition of all people the most amorous which inclination of theirs is so well known to their husbands that they take all imaginable care to preserve them for their own embraces who esteem it no great crime to receive another as often as opportunity favors their industrious endeavors nature does so early teach em the advantages of beauty that they use all possible means not only to preserve their stock but to increase it by the counterfeit addition of a sophisticate complexion and so much do they esteem the art of painting that they stain the very nails of their toes and fingers with a certain lively kind of red  soon decayed it is to this perhaps they owe the numerous furrows of a wrinkled forhead before they have attained the age of forty five at which time contemned by their relations they are employed in all the business of the house and the most menial offices of a common servant  a kissing custom kissing any but their husbands is esteemed a crime unpardonable unless between the resurrection and ascension of our savior at which time both men and women kiss promiscuously all they meet the man first kissing the woman on her left cheek tells her in a voice as grave as the occasion god is risen when she upon his right cheek yielding back the compliment makes answer zealously his blessing be upon us  their houses are for the most part indifferently furnished not using featherbeds but like the turks content to sleep on mattresses their language different from the ancient greek their language is a much corrupted dialect and differs so extremely from the ancient greek now only known to scholars that they hardly make a shift to understand one word in ten when strangers speak it  their four patriarchs now though the greeks in all things but religion are subservient to the laws of turkey they have yet four patriarchs of their own who exercise a kind of mixed authority over them in temporal as well as spiritual affairs they are those of constantinople alexandria jerusalem and antioch or rather damascus these four have their several districts of government he of constantinople has by much the largest share extending his jurisdiction over all the greeks in the europaean turkey most part of asia minor colchis and the northern coast of the black sea those in egypt and arabia are under the patriarch of alexandria he of jerusalem has authority over those in palestine and all the parts adjacent and the greeks of asia major and armenia minor are subservient to the jurisdiction of the patriarch of damascus  how elected the patriarchs are all elected by a synod of bishops under whom in most of the abovenamd places the greeks are tolerated in a free and unmolested exercise of their religion in churches and in monasteries which notwithstanding they are not suffered to rebuild when ruined without vast presents to the ministers of state by which means all the places of their public worship decreasing daily they become if possible each year more ignorant than the foregoing this together with the tempting opportunities of turning turks made more desirable by the oppressive tyranny with which their crafty masters crush their spirits draws multitudes away to a profession of the turkish faith choosing rather the transitory enjoyment of a few small privileges here on earth than the lasting crown of glory in a promised heaven hereafter  what age their women marry at the women marry very young and yet are apt to fancy if they tarry for a husband till twelve or fourteen years of age goodluck has quite forsaken them the bargain being made between the parents or relations for till then love and goodliking must be kept at distance a door is opened and the lover admitted to his mistresses conversation who is generally of too kind a temper to put him to the trouble of a tedious siege and to avoid that incivility yields frequently upon the first attack perhaps because inclinable by nature to profess the same opinion with an ancient countryman of hers who gives us this advice   whatever you do do soon for if done late you rob the favor of near half its weight   description of their weddings the wedding day appointed certain men are invited after the manner of our bridemen who are generally rivals or such at least as the suspicious bridegroom thinks he has more cause than ordinary to be jealous of these must each man present a ring which by the priest is interchangeably removed from the brides to the bridegrooms finger after which it is esteemed a crime almost of an incestuous nature for these bridemen to commit adultery with the wife to whom they gave such a ring by way of renunciation from thence forward of all right or pretension whatsoever to her love or person  an ancient custom these lead the bridegroom through the streets as finely dressed as his circumstances will permit upon his head he wears a flowery garland which putting me in mind of ancient ways of crowning oxen when they lead em to the altar obliged me to reflect upon the horny fate which few greek wives fail of giving them and made me pity the dull victim moving on withthe smallest apprehension of his danger for a sacrifice to matrimony  he is surrounded by a company of his relations and acquaintance attended by a noisy number of boys and fellows with ghittars pipes drums timbrels and other music dancing antickly about the company with grinning faces and strange apish gestures as they pass along there follow men with bottles and glasses running up and down from one place to another and offering wine to every man to drink as they are walking through the streets thus they resolve to lose no time where wine or mirth invites their application still retaining spite of all their losses that vivacity of temper in their cups which formerly gave birth to an old proverb which describing gayety of humor does it by these words the original of an old proverb as merry as a greek  an explanation of the cut annexed which

country by which means they pretend to render the most vigorous bridegroom altogether impotent upon his wedding night  however armed against so unlucky a disappointment they go into church and by the

possession of the wedding sheets to be preserved as a perpetual proof of her dear daughters sure virginity  i will tell you a pleasant story and leave yourself to guess how admirably nature has endued the nimbleminded grecian ladies with the finest qualifications in the world for cuckolding their husbands  a pleasant story of a grecian lady there is a little village called belgrade about fifteen miles from constantinople wonderfully pleasant for its airy situation here a greek who was grown rich by merchandising kept a very pretty country house and in it a young wife extremely handsome but as somewhat brisker than he wished her she alarmed his jealousy to watch her strictly nor would he often let her walk alone in the adjoining groves and meadows  however i was one day going by a woodside at the bottom of a hill to angle in a river that ran by it and perceived upon the bank a charming youthful lady busy at her needle with a pot of water standing by her i immediately imagined right and guessed her the fine wife of the rich greek abovenamd i must own i was surpised to find her so beyond my expectation gay and beautiful i saw she was alone and ventured to address her in italian she returned my salutation in that language and permitted me to sit down by her and converse with all the liberties of decent familiarity  her familiar temper she presently began to make complaint of the restriction she was under by her husbands jealousy and the restraint which women in that country were obliged to undergo and really thence proceeded to make such kind advances and so prettily encourage me to hope her favor ever i asked it that i only wanted vanity to think i might have met success in any kind of offer youth or inclination might have tempted me to make her  a wonderful presence of mind but on a sudden in the height of her discourse and gayety we heard a voice among the trees upon the other side of the river immediately she knew it was her husband and expecting every moment when he would appear in sight was sure he must discover me to have been talking with her so the very minute that he called her she fell sideways on the ground extended both her arms with natural negligence let drop the silk she was at work upon and seemed as much asleep as if she really had been so  it was no hard task to guess the meaning of this counterfeited slumber so that willing to prevent all cause of jealousy instead of striving to get out of sight i started up and bending forward looked upon her face as if surpised to find a woman in that place and posture  i had hardly time to regulate my air of wonder when the greek appeared upon the bank directly opposite he started when he saw the posture of his wife and me so near her i pretended an amazement equal to his own at his appearance and was just about to ask him if he knew that lady when he interrupted my design by hallowing as loud as he could possibly to wake his consort  she poor creature was so fast asleep that all his noises were in vain she slumbred on till i as willing to give all the countenance imaginable to her politic contrivance took her by the arm and shook her pretty roughly an admirable counterfeit at this she roused and having rubbed her eyes with admirable cunning looked about her and was doubtless much surpised to see me there it having been so long since we discoursed together  however i was pleased to see how excellently she contrived to humor wonder mixed with an alloy of modesty both which i fear and ten to one you will think so by the sequel were alike strangers to her nature she started up upon her feet and fixed her eyes upon me with an artful wildness running backwards as i offered to approach her with a shriek or two enough to frighten all the tigers in the wilderness  the more to take all cause of apprehension from the staring husband i advanced as she retired still bowing and assuring her i meant no harm desiring her to apprehend no danger from my presence who was drawn by accident to walk that way and by her charms detained to gaze upon her person all this while the subtle female devil kept a sidelongglance upon her husbands countenance who seemed diverted at the fright my compliments had put her in she saw him smile and was resolved to keep up the conceit wherefore while i still continued bowing and addressed her with a thousand congees she inhumanely stooped down and snatching up the earthen pot which stood upon the ground threw full three pints of water in my face and bosom  an unexpected return of civility a reasonable woman one would think had been contented with this first attack but she it seems was of another mind for while i stooped to shake the water from my eyes and linen she fell upon me like a lioness tore of my perriwig and laid about her at so merciless a rate that i began to think the safest way would be to fly where fighting was esteemed dishonorable  accordingly i turned about in order to escape but my she adversary caught me by the collar on the backpart of my neck and pushed me on as fast as i well cared to run still thumping me upon the back and calling names as loud as possible till being got at some considerable distance from her husband who was all this while half dead with laughing a pleasant way of assignation she depressed her voice and in the softest accents she could utter cried fail not to meet me here to morrow and as soon as she had spoke these words she pushed me forward and ran back again as fast as she was able  the turn of this last part of the intrigue surprised me ten times more than all the rest however i ran back to fetch my periwig while she was crossing a small bridge a little higher to get over to her husband who as soon as his long fit of mirth allowed an interval cried out to me excuse her sir the grecian wives are never used to strangers company and only love their husbands conversation a mistaken husband as soon as he had made this speech he fell a laughing more than ever and it was with much ado i could forbear to follow his example when i saw the fool begin to kiss his loving wife and hug her in his arms till they got out of sight in their way homeward  i must confess i sped so ill at first that i had little cause to think my watery entertainment was an omen of success in the conclusion water will at any time extinguish fires that have but just begun to blaze and she had cooled my flames a little too soon to tempt em to a second kindling so that i forbore for many reasons going next day to the aforesaid place of assignation  a second meeting but twas about a fortnight after when as i was walking up a lane which ran along the backside of her husbands house she saw and beckoned me to a small summer house in which she sat at work as formerly goodmanners led me to embraee the invitation where the first demand was why i did not come the day appointed i excused it as i could and she proceeded with a number of assurances to tell me how concerned she was that she had been obliged against her will to use me so uncivilly and in short proceeded to such kind expressions that i every moment looked to have another invitation to the rivers side  a surprise as bad as the former but in the midst of her discourse instead of answering my expectation by renewing her kind summons she on a sudden raised her voice to double height began to spit upon me and abuse me to a wonderful degree however i had hardly time to be surpised before i guessed the reason of her change by seeing her turn round and call as loud as she could speak dear dear come hither dear and shoot this stranger through the head i cannot live in quiet for him the moment after came the husband peeping over his wives shoulder looking after me who never staid to justify my self against the accusation but made the utmost have to get away least he should take an opportunity to do as his goodnatured lady had commanded him  i staid at belgrade some weeks longer but took care to go no more that way and by the strange discovery i made hereby of womens temper i resolved to bear in my memory two maxims of this country which are if i mistake not left as follows  two grecian maxims the first is  a woman knows nothing but what she has a mind to   and the other  you that are about marrying look upon your neighbors   the grecian funerals they differ little in their modern from their ancient funerals the parent wife or nearest of the kindred catches the departing breath by joining mouths with those who die when dead they wash their bodies with the richest oils and then instead of putting on a winding sheet adorn em in the finest clothes they wore while living  mercenary mourners then they lay them on an open bier upon a quilt or mattress twisted round with garlands of a hundred various kinds of flowers and conduct em to the place appointed for their burial followed by the weeping friends of the deceased who are preceeded by a certain number of bird mourners commonly of jewish women who by constant practice of their hypocritical concern become such mistresses of tears and groanings that by howling as they go along with tearing off their hair beating their breasts and lamentably weeping in a counterfeited sorrow they extract a real flood of tears from many tenderhearted people altogether unconcerned in the occasion of their lamentations so that they appear exact observers of the following advice of that admirable tragedian seneca sen tra agam lacrymas lacrymis miscere juvat the mixing tears with tears affords a melancholy sort of comfort   they lay the body in the grave without a coffin cutting first his clothes to pieces with their penknives lest the corpse should be dug up by needy people for the sake thereof they throw great boughs of cypress on the grave and hang it as we do atcheivements over the door of the deceased persons house  an ancient custom the women generally cut a lock of hair and tie it to the body of their dead relation why they use so odd a custom none could tell me but it is certain they received it from the practice of their ancestors for that twas used among the ancient greeks appears in many writers but particularly in the three and twentieth iliad of homer where he speaks as follows of achilles celebrating the funeral of patroclus hom iliad           standing apart the pile where lay the dead he cuts the yellow tresses from his head tresses he long ever that to sperchius vowed and turning to his friend thus spoke aloud since i must never after all my toil return to visit my dear native soil on loved patroclus i these locks bestow that he may bear em to my friends below this said his comely hair he neatly spread and laid it in the hand of his companion dead   another ancient grecian custom besides their hair they often bury in the graves of their relations things of rich and costly value such as bracelets rings girdles and the like this also is an ancient custom for the greeks of note were burnt of old and had their funeral piles enriched with precious jewels gums sheep horses clothes and every thing of worth to serve their uses in the other world the ceremony may be well conceived by a description you may find in statius of the solemn funeral of archemorus stat lib    non unquam opulentior illo ante cinis crepitant gemmae atque immaue liquescit argentum and

will perceive the greeks extremely fallen from their ancient glory and indeed they have not only lost their wisdom but their very industry deserving nothing less than the encomium juvenal thought fit

as much decayed at present as their temporal affairs a barbarous ignorance possessing universally their notions of religion  widely do they differ as to point of faith from roman principles and though they often have professed a perfect reconciliation to the tenets of that church and frequently agreed on certain articles of union it was only at such times as being pinched by poverty or other inconveniences they hoped redress from flattering the papal clergy into a belief that they were willing to embrace the romish doctrine  the ignorance of the modern i have before informed you they are subject to the power of four patriarchs those in former times were men of learning and undoubted piety chosen to their offices for their integrity of life and exemplary gravity in conversation now the highest briber carries it and the declining dignity is strangely sunk from ancient worth to ignorance and poverty  two sorts of grecian priests however under these superior members of the modern grecian church are found two kind of priests the first a sort of monks despisers of the world and all its vanities who taking leave of temporal affairs immure themselves for life within the walls of certain strong and ancient monasteries which are spread in numbers over all their country and the second are those common parish priests ordained by the abovenamd patriarchs to teach the people the great duties of religion a task for which they are but ill provided while depressed by such a weight of slavery and ignorance  the monks called coloieros the first the greeks distinguish by the name of coloieros or monastics and among the many places which contain the brothers of their order mount athos is the chief for on that hill alone stand four and twenty spacious convents constantly maintaining near seven thousand monks who live retired by oath obliged to a perpetual celibacy and a life entirely separated from the layety of their religion  the coloieros way of living they wear a kind of long black gowns and hoods of a course hairy substance letting grow their locks to inconvenient length in contradiction to the shaving custom of the roman clergy they live by their own labors on what poor provision they can get by tillage spinning and improving every way the product of the country round em they are grave austere and modest of behavior and by the poor unknowing greeks set out to strangers with a thousand high encomiums on their learning and capacities but fall so short of expectation when conversed with by a traveller and are so much involved in the stupidity of their subverted countrymen that all i learned by making them a visit was the truth of an expression of the admirable juvenal who tells us fronti nulla fides there is no knowing a mans soul by his countenance and another honest spanish proverb that declares a spanish proverb no es tan bravo el leon come le pintan that is the lion is not half so fierce as they paint him  the parish priests described the other priests of greece if possible are still more ignorant than they and scattred numerously up and down the country not being very much respected by the common people nor in dress or manners very different from them it is a wonder if a man considers the oppressive burden of that slavery which crushes em how they have preserved the very faith of christians which they do not only rigidly profess but to support its doctrine still retain the following principles  their opposition to the romish church in opposition to the romish church which they esteem schismatical and laugh at the assertion of the papal title to the blessing of infallibility they hold that the holy ghost proceeds from god the father only  their notion of the eucharist they administer the eucharist in both kinds but as if the very practice of religion should submit to the intemperance of a licentious people they esteem the wine not any way available unless they drink it in considerable quantities a sign say they that what we do we do with satisfaction and a heartiness that proves we bear respect to the injunction while the moderate sipping of your western churches seems to speak a kind of force upon your inclinations  leavened bread they leaven all the bread they use in administration of the sacrament esteeming such as is not so prepared unworthy the great use they are to put it to  grecian paintings they admit of paintings on the outward walls and inward ornaments of all their churches drawing frequently the virgin which you may observe the eastern nations always represent a blackamoore the figure of almighty god like an old man with a white beard the holy ghost and many of the twelve apostles with the later fathers of the church as near as they can place em to the altar  the picture of st george amongst the paintings of the greeks armenians and some other eastern christians nothing is so common as the representation of st george on horseback fighting with a dragon as in the pictures on our signposts in great britain why they have this figure in such vogue among them i could never meet a priest of sense enough to tell me but am apt to think that  basilius and some other ancient writers are of opinion that much celebrated piece is nothing but an emblematical design an emblematical representation st george as painted like a well armed warrior representing a good christian strongly opposed by a great dragon that is the devil who is vanquished by him and thereby the kings daughter that is the church of christ preserved from being devoured by her dreadful adversary and this opinion is the more authentic because in every other place but england we shall seldom see the picture of st george but in some ancient church or monastery and in either of those places seldom miss it  the ignorance of modern greeks in painting now though they seem to value painting they have nothing of the genius of their famed apelles left among them what they do is very flat and scarce deserves a better name than that of daubing and it is observable that notwithstanding their respect for pictures they abhor all sorts of sculpture with a strange antipathy refusing to admit them in their churches or even dwelling houses out of a ridiculous opinion that the very looking on such pieces savours of idolatry  ever burning lamps vast quantities of oil they daily wast by burning it in lamps in all their churches never suffering them to extinguish as believing it a sort of duty well received by god and showing their respect to the receptacle of his divinity  their notions of the state of the soul after death they all agree in the necessity of using extreme unction which they practice as inducted by st james they rigorously dissent from the opinion of the roman catholics in relation to the existence of a purgatory maintaining most of them at least that the departed souls of mortal men are sensible of neither joy nor torment till the day of judgment  the grecian holy days the year they reckon in the roman way but mark above an hundred holy days to be observed on pain of excommunication this i take to be an undeniable example of their hatred to activity and inclinations to the practice of an idle and luxurious life forgetting misery while drowned in sloth and wallowing supinely in the down of idleness amidst those torturing proofs of slavery which ought to sting a generous mind with sense of his misfortunes  their fasts and feasts they fast on wednesdays fridays and all holy eves but feast on saturday because say they it was the ancient sabbath but i rather am inclined to think because they are unwilling to omit the least pretense whereby they may indulge a craving appetite  how far they tolerate matrimony the clergy are allowed to marry once but bigamy is looked upon too wanton a desire to be permitted them and trigamy is so abhorred by all the greeks that it is never known among them but forbidden with the strictest prohibition even to the laity themselves  their lents they keep four lents within the year so strictly that in either it is esteemed a damnable transgression and a sin beyond excuse to eat the smallest piece of flesh or fish wherein there is a drop of blood contained yet one exception may be made to this strict rule because the lent preceding easter is not held so rigid as the other wherefore all the laity are then allowed to eat what kind of fish their fancy leads em to or circumstances can afford em  their liturgies and universal ignorance and stupidity they read the liturgy of st chrysostom unless upon their festivals and then their priests attired pontifically read st basils but with little signs of decency or devotion and indeed so miserably are they led away by love of idleness and long captivity that they possess in any kind but few of those perfections which in former times distinguished their politer countrymen retaining nothing but their name their very language being as i said before entirely lost among them and that ruined nation sunk so low that from the dread and admiration of the distant world they are become at present the contempt and pity of the vilest wretches of the whole creation such is the uncertainty of humane blessings and the certain frailty of our weak mortality  chap xxiii of the armenians and their religion what the armenians are that christian church which calls its self armenian is in magnitude far more considerable than the grecian and consists of the displaced inhabitants of those large tracts of land which bore the name that now distinguishes her people who have widely spread themselves in many countries and are numerously scattered up and down the countries subject to the great mogul grand signior and the king of persia  their patriarchal seat at tyberis a large city in the territories of the last they live in very great respect among the natives and are very wealthy by the means of traffic here their patriarch has his seat and here the richest and most noble of their people fix their dwellings  great numbers subject to the turkish sultan but the occasion of my speaking of em here is that there are vast numbers like the greeks remaining subject to the government of the grand signior who possesses the dominion of their ancient monarchs by the unresisted force of an illegal usurpation from the right of conquest handed down from prince to prince for ages long since past so that they now retain no notion of their former liberty but live dependant on the power of a despotick tyrant  their privileges in this however they have better fortune than their fellowslaves the greeks that they are free from that unnatural duty of delivering their children to be sent upon triennial seizures to constantinople and enjoy a hundred privileges more why given them because a certain countryman of theirs a flatterer of mahomets and one who used to prophecy his future greatness gained a promise from him that he would injoin his followers if ever they should see occasion to invade armenia and the will of god should give it to their power that they would distinguish the inhabitants from other conquered people by such large immunities as should alleviate the burden of their losses  their character they are very ignorant but very honest industrious in their natures slow to anger and extremely willing to forgive an injury abstemious in their diet little drinkers and inclined to melancholy and sedate retirements devout and superstitious in a high degree patient in affliction nor too soon buoyed up beyond themselves by the successful turns of chance or their endeavors  the enmity between the greeks and them in former ages they were subject to the grecian patriarch of constantinople but about the time of the eutychian heresy revolted from his jurisdiction and had met with such unbecoming usage from the proud deportment of the greeks in those old times that ever since they have abhorred their memory and now profess so rancourd an aversion to the people of that name that if by chance for it but rarely happens any greek becomes a convert to the faith of the armenians they refuse admiting him a member of their church till they have rebaptizd him after their own method  the number and piety of their bishops there are above three hundred bishops of that nation scattered strangely up and down with poor allowances for the support of their degree which notwithstanding is sufficiently attond for by the veneration paid em from the common people and the humble dictates of their own morality which teaches them contentedly to spend their lives in peaceful poverty and raise their wishes to a future prospect far surpassing the chimerical advantages accruing from the gross and earthly blessings which attend the aim of prosperous ambition  the tenets of their faith are gathered from the several opinions of the eastern churches strangely shuffled into an obscure collection hardly one in fifty can inform a stranger in the principles and grounds of the religion he professes but the foundation of their faith is altogether built upon the following articles  their notion of one nature in christ they will allow in christ one nature only but yet maintain this notion with a difference from eutyches and the other introducers of that heresy for whereas they taught the nature of our savior to be one by a commixture of divine and human the armenians hold the union of those natures to be made by an entire conjunction as the soul of man is joined to his corporeal substance  some other tenets they administer the sacrament in both kinds but ardently deny all notion of the real presence in it they hold a purgatory but reject all praying for the dead they disallow of the supremacy of the roman church and join with that of greece in their assertion that the holy ghost proceeds but from the father only and that the souls of the departed good or bad must never feel the smallest share of joy or torment till the dreadful day of universal judgment  the abstemiousness of their priests their clergy like the greeks are once and only once allowed to marry and so very rigid and austerely exemplary are their lives that they abstain from flesh of any kind nor can by any means be brought to eat it oftener than five times a year nor would they then but in compliance with the humor of the common people who as superstitious in a high degree might be persuaded to imagine it a sin to feed on flesh should they observe their priests refuse to do it  their frequent fasting they place the greatest merit in the world in duly keeping lent which they observe with wonderful devotion and austerity and indeed the vulgar sort as knowing little else of their religion take such care to be beforehand in this point that i have frequently observed them fast day after day without complaining and it may be said within the bounds of truth that they fast three days out of every seven  they fast on christmas day among the many other days whereon the stamp of custom has enjoined their fasting it is observable they always do it upon christmassday with double strictness what their reason is they could not tell me use has made it now a law and they esteem it as their duty to obey and keep it  their methods of assembling to devotion as for churches they have very few and those they have are so decayed by time or accident that they are hardly fit to hold an audience wherefore they assemble to their public prayers and other ceremonies in low private chambers where they may be free from noise and undisturbed in the calm exercise of their religion they are seldom fond of painting but are so entirely of the greeks opinion as to sculptures that they cannot bear to see em in their houses  the turkish policy to destroy their churches it is observable that though the turks in many things give greater toleration to the armenians than their other subjects yet they use the same inhuman art to ruin their religion never giving them permission to rebuild a church when once decayed unless they are bribed to it at so high a rate that it is a very rare attempt to ask a license for that purpose from the turkish officers who always learn one art that is to make the most if not the best of their preferments  their postures of prayer their postures when at prayers is like the turks crossleggd those past they elevate their bodies to a straiter pitch and with the greatest silence listen to their priest who reads from the chaldean tongue such chapters as he thinks convenient still expounding as he goes along the mystery of what he reads  their forms of public devotion this service over they again repeat their prayers in the same posture as before the priest excepted who then always turns his face directly to the altar and with lifted hands and eyes invokes a blessing on his zealous auditory prayers once over every man as he goes round the room in order to depart kneels down before the priest or bishop if there is one present and while he kisses his left hand is strokd upon the head and blessed devoutly by the other  it is at these assemblies that the priest or bishop nominates the feasts or fasts which are to be observed the week ensuing after which no plea of business or extraordinary occasions can prevail to get a dispensation or acquit them from the duty and in order to prevent all expectation of succeeding in petitions of that nature they have formed a sentence which by common use is grown a proverb and is generally painted in the letters of their language on the walls or cielings of their places of devotion and the houses where they dwell the words are these an armenian proverb as the almighty god is infinitely greater than the world and all therein by so much ought our earthly business to give way to his great worship  i told my reader in the beginning of the chapter that the people of this nation are extremely poor and yet entirely honest an extraordinary character yet what they very well deserve as what i am about to tell you is a fair example  a story of a young armenian land his honesty there was at the abovenamd city of tyberis a young man not thirty years of age the only son of an armenian merchant who was yet so poor as hardly to be capable of living in a tolerable credit this young man was much in love with the fair daughter of a countryman of his who gratefully returned his passion with an equal value but both these families were poor and honest therefore could not see the smallest possibility of doing well should they by marriage suffer the fond couple to increase a charge they found it very difficult to bear without addition  a bad condition the hardship of their fortune and sincerity of their affection half distracted them when they reflected that the barrier which prevented their so much desired bliss was never likely to be taken off and found that every day as love increased their poverty grew greater  the poor young man industriously inclined had tried all ways of bettering his circumstances but had much ado by all his labor to support a livelihood and was become so melancholy by the misery of his condition oppressed at once by love and indigence that he could find no comfort but in the conversation of his mistress and that a sort of anxious joy an anxious pleasure because as often as it represented to his thoughts the blessings he should gain by her possession it recoiled upon his memory that twas almost impossible to obtain so great a happiness  he often walked disconsolately out of town and wandered up and down unmindful of his steps indulging solitude as a loved means of contemplation one evening very late the moon shone bright and led him on in a smooth walk that ran along the great high road till he was met by a grave man in habit of a pilgrim who saluted him and begged he would support him to the town or he should faint before he reached it the young armenian looking earnestly upon his face perceived his color gone and all the marks of sudden illness plain to be discovered  he asked the pilgrim whither he was bound who told him to constantinople and again demanding if he had any friends within the city of tyberis was informed that he was quite a stranger and designed to take his lodging in some public han or open place of entertainment such as is elsewhere described for inns and houses of accommodation are not met with in the eastern countries  a compassionate action the good armenian presently considered that the usage he would meet with in a public han could no ways be agreeable to his weak condition and invited him to lie a night or two at his fathers house by giving him a frank assurance of a hearty welcome this kind offer was immediately embraced with many thanks by the sick pilgrim so he returned again and led his guest back with him using him with great civility and entertaining him in every kind as well as the condition of the one required or the others purse could possibly afford him  an artifice to prevent discovery five days the pilgrim kept his bed and in that time would often talk with the armenian and his father still concealing who he was and taking every now and then an occasion to complain of his misfortunes and his poverty till on the fifth day in the evening he desired the company of the young man alone who came accordingly and as he used to do began to comfort the sick man with hopes of quick recovery  at last the pilgrim interrupting his discourse began to weep and taking him by the hand informed him that he found himself so weak that he had now no longer hopes of life but begged him as he wished for happiness hereafter to comply with the request he was about to make him  the speech of a dying pilgrim i am says he a merchant who have traded many years in jewels which by traveling on foot and in the habit of a pilgrim i have always carried safe when others have been robbed of all they had almighty god has pleased to bless me with considerable substance most of which is now about me in rich diamonds neatly fastened in some corners of my clothes i have no wife or child but one poor mother at constantinople long maintained by my good fortune her i make my heiress she knows best what poor relations at her death to leave it to now i design to write a letter and for fear she loses all if sent her by the caravan for god almightys sake do you in person take the charge of what i give you see her and inform her how i died and where you bury me the charges you have been so generously at and what my private funeral may cost you this small purse contains a sum of gold sufficient to repay you but to bear the charges of your journey to my mother and in some degree reward your goodness i will give you two good diamonds for your self and then deliver all the rest to your safe custody  a great surprise he ended there and from a pocket in the bosom of his vest that then lay by him took a purse in which were eighteen gold chequins of turkey value each ten shillings and delivered it to the armenian who was more surpised to see him rip the corners of his clothes and take out two and twenty noble diamonds which had been the business of the journey he fell short in two according to his promise he presented him withal each worth about an hundred english pounds the other twenty most of equal value he committed to his charge took pen and ink and writ a line or two directed to his mother and the next day died as he before imagined  a wonderful example of honesty here was a temptation few i fear in the armenians circumstances would so nobly have resisted he concealed the jewels least his father or his mistress should have tempted him to keep them owned the money buried the dead pilgrim who i should have told you was himself an armenian writ a letter and enclosed one diamond in it to assist his father and withal informed him of the whole concern he left this letter on his chamber table sold the second jewel for his own expenses and departed early one morning with the pilgrims weeds belonging to the late deceased first having sowed all up as they had been before the owner had unripd em for his satisfaction  in short he brought the jewels safe to constantinople gave em with the letter to the woman they were sent to would not take the least reward confessing he was paid beforehand and prepared for his return to persia after a short stay of thirteen days with the mother of his deceased countryman  a generous action of a persian envoy but virtue seldom fails reward the story was immediately spread round the city and among the rest a persian envoy then about returning to his country hearing the report resolved to see such worth encouraged sent for the young man informed himself of his condition took him back to persia in his train and there presented him before the king as an example of surprising honesty and an object highly worthy of his royal favor  a reward of virtue the king commanded a great sum of money to be given him and learning that he was brought up a merchant ordered him to be the man with whom the court should for the future deal for all their necessaries in his way of traffic and accordingly he soon grew rich by that advantage and the many which attended the great character it gave him so that he not only married his old mistress but in a few years raised his family to be the most considerable of all his country a happiness he very well deserved for such a rare example of an inborn honesty and generosity of nature commonly inherent to the people of that nation  chap xxiv of the copties the original of the copties it was in the infancy of christian doctrine that the old inhabitants of many parts of egypt chiefly such as bordered upon aethiopia were converted to the faith of christ by the successful preaching of the noble eunuch who had been inspired by philip with the purest notions of religion and morality those early converts who embraced the gospel there transmitted it industriously to the practice of posterity and multitudes of the egyptians constantly professed the doctrine of christianity through all the ages of inhuman persecution and the modern offspring of those ancient people are the sect named copties whom this chapter treats of  the causes of their ignorance but as humane nature is alone too weak a prop for faith and the mysterious knowledge of religion so the want of spiritual directors through the labyrinth of darkness which attended the disorders of successive persecutions has involved them in a gulf of zealous ignorance and taught em an unnatural and incoherent mixture of the superstitious practices of pagan ceremonies with the heavenly rites of their professed christianity  circumcision used among them and why it is this misfortune has confounded their religious observation of the sacrament of baptism with the heathenish custom of an early circumcision which they still observe but rather out of veneration to the practice of their ancestors than any notion of its efficacy in religious matters that it was an ancient custom we are undeniably convinced from the assertion of so old a pen as that of herodotus who declares it to have been observed among that people long before the age he lived in they circumcise their children at eight days old but baptize them not till on the fortieth  tainted with the jacobin herely they were originally tainted with the jacobin heresy and rigidly maintained the doctrine of one sole nature in our savior long before jacobus preached up that opinion in the eastern parts of syria they are so very cautious least by chance they should expose his person to the proof of a division that though they own him god and man and perfect in both essences they will not venture to distinguish one from the other  how agreeing with or dissenting from the church of rome they administer the sacrament in both kinds especially to infants just baptized they stigmatize the church of rome with heresy yet by the too prevailing vigilance of missionaries sent from many parts of italy great numbers of them frequently embrace the romish doctrine they value not the resolutions of those general councils held since that of ephesus and with an universal detestation of the notions of a purgatory praying for the souls of the deceased and extreme unction dissent from those three favorite points of roman doctrine  they have a patriarch over them who takes his title from the town of alexandria but commonly resides at grand cairo or sometimes at a large city called saieta an ancient city six days journey higher on the river nilus all inhabited by unmixed numbers of the copties here it is said our savior and the virgin mary lived when flying from the rage of herod they sojourned in the land of egypt till the death of that oppressive tyrant here likewise may be seen the ruins of a noble structure stately in the very dust it lies in which the copties tell us was in former times a chapel built by the religious helena mother to constantine the great and consecrated to the virgin in commemoration of her residence in that ancient city  the copties keep lent strictly they are almost as strict observers of lent as the armenians never eating flesh therein but in the night unless on saturdays and sundays but upon those days they hold it as a sin to fast  a painful form of worship peculiarly devout and painfully religious is their rigid form of worship for on saturday at midnight they are summoned to their churches where they neither sit stand kneel or use the common postures of a man but till the sunday noon support themselves by leaning on a kind of crutches  boys admitted into orders the priest officiating is covered with a veil of fine white linen and assisted by three little boys attired not much unlike himself on whom as on great numbers of young children they conferr the minor orders of their priesthood assuming their authority for such a practice from a weak interpretation of that part of the gospel where our savior uses the expression suffer little children to come unto me and prevent them not for of such is the kingdom of heaven  their public prayers they frequently exalt their voices and accompany the priest in strange and unintelligible noises using some the ancient genuine egyptian language now almost forgotten some the moorish dialect and some the turkish oftentimes the priest not much unlike the romish elevation of the host lifts up above his head a cloth of crimson color under which is placed the consecrated sacrament  other customs in useamong them they sing the psalms of david through at every meeting sometimes a chapter of the old but oftener of the new and more respected testament as penned by nicomedes they pay no reverence to the pictures of our savior and the virgin mary nor permit them to be placed about the altar though they commonly are met with in the other corners of their churches  relics of martyrs at the entrance of their churches which can seldom boast magnificence or ornament you see on either side square chests pild one above another and in these they keep the ashes bones or other relics of those who having been deluded by the strong insinuations of the turks to turn mahometans have afterward repented their apostasy and openly professing a return to the religion they before abandoned have been put to death upon it and defended their unshockd and persecuted recantation by the painful trial of a glorious martyrdom  men and women kept apart the women like the turks are separated in their churches from the conversation of the men and placed in galleries all letticd over to prevent inspection they kiss their hands at coming in and lay the right upon the left proceeding with a gravity becoming their devotion  their habits and subjection their habits differ from the common greeks in nothing but a kind of skullcap of a close and humble shape which all the copties wear upon their head they live in great subjection to the turks pay double taxes and are hourly liable to the oppressive violences of unbounded tyranny and swift injustice  sciences decayed among them their ignorance is great and universal and their morals consequently weak and poorly guarded sciences are almost lost at least decayed extremely in the practice of their students  however whether it proceeds from real inclination or a notion that the character of conjurer would better suit them than another people by the stories which the scriptures and tradition tell the world of the prodigious operation of those famed magicians among their ancestors who strove so wonderfully to excel the power of god in moses i say i know not which of these excites their study great lovers of magic but it is very certain that they all incline to practice magic or at least such juggling arts as with the vulgar may entitle them to that denomination  admirable jugglers they confidently boast a power by the assistance of familiar spirits to inform inquirers any thing they ask particularly in affairs of love and it is indeed a very pleasant entertainment to behold how some of the politest of these jugglers will impose on simple crowds of listners by the outward artifices of a learned appearance while by subtle means they learn the business of the querist from himself or company and then amaze him with a declaration of no more than what he just before has told him  it is pleasant to behold em burning leaves describing circles melting wax and using all the outward gestures which we read of in the works of ancient poets to have been observed by sorcerers or others in their magic incantations such as that of simaetha in the second eidyl of theocritus theoc eidyl  d       etc      etc go iynx on the wings of passion move and to my presence drag my tardy love delphis torments me but i will take my turn and for my delphis sake this laurel burn and as the laurel crackles in the fire destroyed by flames which burn it and expire till not the very ashes shall appear so let strong flames consume my perjured dear go iynx on the wings of passion move and to my presence drag my tardy love as i now melt this wax helped from above just so let myndian delphis melt with love and as i whirl my brazen wand around let him before my gate in circles trace the ground go iynx on the wings of passion move and to my presence drag my tardy love   no wonder that their morals are not excellent but certainly it cannot well be looked upon a wonder that morality should boast no fixed impression on the minds of men inured to artifice and treacherous practices by the perpetual dangers they have been exposed to by the wars and persecutions changes and subversions which have constantly attended their unhappy country through a course of revolutions for so many ages when we find that even our selves divided as we are from all the world protected from the miseries of war and rapine and indulged by heaven in all the blessings of productive nature have no great cause to think our morals generally speaking better than our neighbors  a strange and laboring sect among the copties among the many orders of religion now professed by these copties there is one very odd and new opinion prevalent among them a certain sect who contemplating seriously and with incessant application on the numerous frailties of humanity engage themselves by oath in the most solemn manner every year they live to take upon them some new mystery or way of living till they find if possible some state of life entirely happy these by turns are soldiers merchants husbandmen and every thing their substance can create them and the good they do by this uncommon practice of professed variety appears conspicuously in the repeated declarations which they daily make in public places telling those who gather round them that experience has convinced them true felicity attends not such and such a life for such and such occurring reasons weighing all the good with all the bad of every mans condition and discovering how much the weighty evils overpoize the balance  their never ending labors thus are the lives of these unwearied wretches spent in searches of content a fairy blessing talked of like the phoenix but unknown like that and never to be gained on this side heaven yet they toil incessantly and drudge away their moments in a kind of interrogatory contemplation like the learned ausonius who thus expresses the convincing proofs of mortal imperfection auson eidyl   th quod vitae sectabor iter si plena tumultu

mans race fortune by many means afflicts mankind by war by angry seas and winds combined by storms of passion and destructive snares unnumbred labors and entangled cares and though we think our present state a curse we seldom change it but we make it worse   the humor of the copties the generality of these copties are curiously inclined to hear the customs of remote dominions and are overjoyed to get a gentleman of learning who is traveling through their country into their acquaintance they receive and entertain him with a deep respect and waiting patiently till he has asked as many questions as he pleases of their way of living put great numbers of inquisitive demands on him and listen with a close and wonderful delight to hear the stories which a stranger tells them either of his own or other countries  nor is it any ways improbable that this should be the reason which induces such vast numbers to profess the business of a guide attending travelers from place to place as often as the arabs will permit them an arbitrary practice of the arabs but these last are lords of them and their pretentions and are well acquainted with the profits thence arising wherefore they will rarely give the copties liberty to serve as guides to christian travelers but undertake the task themselves and thence extort considerable sums of money in proportion to their carriage avarice or honesty  chap xxv of the zinganees or the race of the gypsies now reader have i brought you to a sort of people who for every kind of villainy and unexampled practices of guilt in its most elevated insolence may justly boast themselves without a rival impunity encourages them all to sin and independent arrogance protects them in it they are shunned by all degrees of men and all men equally by them detested they are natures outcast and the black infesters of humanity and common goodness and of all the world may best lay claim to the profession of a maxim which the roman satyrist expresses thus juv sat   aude aliquid brevibus gyaris and carcere dignum si vis esse aliquis probitas laudatur and alget would you be great and dreaded by mankind dare to do mischief never yet designed contrive some ill that may the rope deserve then shall you thrive if good be praised and starve   you shall rarely apprehend a zinganee or execute him for a crime but he will readily confess vast numbers more than ever he was detected in their only aim is wickedness and that they grow inimitable proficients in they seldom differ one from the other or if some have accidentally been more successful than the rest in bringing mischiefs to perfection it is because their opportunities have been more favorable and proceeds not from a weaker inclination to the practice of iniquity their guilt is thus the same and therefore i may well excuse the universal wishes of the honester inhabitants of the eastern countries who profess an open and deserved abhorrence of the wretches and their customs desiring nothing more than their very race might wholly be extirpated juv sat    nam scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum facti crimen habet cedo si conat a peregit for he who has his will to evil brought and secretly dares form a wicked thought commits the crime that his consent has won or sins as much as if twere really done   but ever i paint the morals and inhuman nature of these people twill be proper to inform my reader who they are and having traced em to their black original i will proceed to the relation of their present state and lay em open in the scattred baseness of their modern circumstances  the history and original of the zinganees twas in the reign of sultan selym the successful turkish emperor who overthrew the government of the circassian mamalukes and added egypt to his own dominions that the few remaining soldiers of that name who had escaped the slaughter and retired in little numbers to the borders of the desert were encouraged by a certain daring slave named zinganeus to assemble in one body and make use of those offensive arms their hasty flight had left them to their best advantage they consented to the motion and upon examination found themselves a formidable body able to defend their ground by reason of the difficulty of access against the power of all invaders  a salvage kind of life thus they lived some time made nightly inrodes to the fertile pastures on the banks of nilus plundered towns destroyed inhabitants drove off their cattle and committed all outrages void of fear and free from punishment not only keeping so secure a guard that they defended their possessions but admitting daily numbers of their old companions who deserted to their party in considerable bodies as often as they found convenient opportunities  the turks who dreaded what might be the consequences of this threatening growth of power sent great commanders with some regular forces to reduce them to obedience who fell short in their designs and were sent back half ruined to assure their officers they were to cope with greater strength than they imagined  in short the turks perceived so great a difficulty in the method they must take to bring em to subjection that they rather chose to offer terms of friendship and accommodation which the mamalukes as readily accepted of as growing weary of the dangerous alarums they were hourly subject to so that a peace was soon concluded articles of accommodation and the articles thereof obliging the circassians to lay down their arms permitted them to exercise what other way of living their desires would lead em to make choice of  but civil discipline agreeing rarely with the military genius of licentious multitudes they grew unruly and became so prejudicial to the common interest that the offended turks at last grew weary of forgiving and enacted a degree that every zinganee for they were so distinguished from the name of their ringleader should in fourteen days depart the kingdom they are banished egypt this was so severely put in execution that in less than two months space not one remained who publicly durst own himself of that denomination for it was made lawful for what man soever met them when their date expired to take kill enstave or use them as he thought convenient  no man from that time forward ever knew certainly what became of zinganeus their commander tho it is commonly believed he staid in egypt where at present his posterity and that of his companions openly dare own themselves a certain prophecy is spread about relating to some future hopes predominant on the opinion of the zinganees tho few among the turks regard or value it the prophecy as it is expressed in the egyptian language varies nothing from the following purpose a gypsy prophecy years over years shall roll ages over ages slide before the worlds control shall check the crescents pride banished from place to place wide as the oceans roar the mighty gypsy race shall visit every shore but when the hundredth year shall three times doubled be then shall an end appear to all their slavery then shall the warlike powers from distant climes return egypt again be ours and turkish turrets burn   a vain and groundless hope this prophecy has won so far upon the miserable romnant of the zinganees in egypt that they all expect as certainly to see the restoration of their empire in the downfall of the turks as the most rigid jews believe and wait for the return of their messiah but how wide from probability their notion lies let any man decide who will reflect on the prodigious difference between the turks and them in number and authority  the wandering lives of the banished gypsies those zinganees who had not courage to continue in their country in contempt of the decree exhibited against them spread themselves in banishment through every corner of the world and finding it a necessary prudence to consider on some means of livelihood they took upon them the denomination of foretellers of the accidents attending every persons life pretending to a natural gift of prophecy and finding it an easy matter to impose upon the world by such pretentions the rather because many families among them had by art or nature really reached a wonderful ability in such like practices they flourished for a while and grew considerably rich in many countries  their first arrival in england among the rest great numbers flocked to england traveled up and down from place to place with children at their backs begged leave to he in barns told fortunes for their livelihood and when they could not fairly get provisions stole em with an admirable cunning till the many mischiefs which attended the permission of these stroling hypocrites occasioned several acts to pass in order to extirpate their fraternity  the laws which were from time to time enacted to that end had such effect that they were soon transported hence in such surprising numbers that the few mean wretches now pretending to the character of gypsies are not really so but such whose miserable circumstances have reduced em to a sordid imitation of the vices and pretenses of those banished persons the original of the word gypsy to whom originally our forefathers gave the name of gyptians or egyptians to denote the country they belonged to but the word has been corrupted by the course of time to the present vulgar pronunciation gypsies  but though the prudence of our cautious ancestors found means to rid this nation of such troublesome inhabitants few other countries took that care to free themselves from their encumbring multiplication turkey very full of gypsies every part of turkey is especially so pestered with em that you seldom travel four and twenty hours without encountering them  their way of living they are divided into tribes acknowledge no dependence on or duty to the power of any government whatever they have no laws among themselves but mingle lustfully together in the most incestuous manner never marrying but using all in common women goods and all they boast of  they wander up and down with asses laden with their tents and other dirty necessaries always pitching their black camp as near some town of note as possible excellent smiths and working commonly as smiths particularly famous for the making hatchets of an edge so excellently tempered that no nail can turn it they are hired sometimes for every kind of drudgery but frequently refuse to work and never tarry longer in a place than till they have obtained as much as stealing or their labor can induce em to the hopes of  thus in time they visit every part of every country hated by mankind and preying on the losses of their fellow creatures void of principle and consequently of humanity if any of them die they make a hole within his tent and bury him about a foot below the surface never using coffin shroud or decent ceremony scoffing publicly at every law and all religions their atheistical principles openly declaring they believe no god but impiously use no other argument than that of insolent and ignorant obstinacy telling christians who rebuke their wickedness that they have daily reason to distrust the notions of a godhead since if there were a power so mighty and omniscient as god is represented he would never hear himself blasphemed and ridiculed at such a rate as he is hourly by their common practice without some speedy judgment on their guilt this simple notion made me think upon an ancient precedent delivered to posterity by martial in his book of epigrams mart epig nullos esse deos inane coelum affirmat selius probatque quod se factum dum negat hoc videt beatum selius affirms there is no god in heaven and the sole cause for that opinion given is that while thus he dares a god deny he prospers daily and no plague draws nigh   their customs and humor they commonly go naked or at least the major part affect not dressing nature stains them of a tawny hue and the unresisted influence of a continual sun increases their deformity they never wash their hands or faces but permit their hair and nails to grow to most amazing lengths they will not suffer travelers to pass without accosting them extracting money by repeated declarations of the good or evil fortune which is likely to attend them but what most amazed me is that they assume the impudence of giving good advice exhorting them to piety and all the graces of humanity concluding commonly their hypocritic lectures with these words be dutiful to god your parents and your prince and let the blessings of them all be showered upon you  when i perceived that such as these could give advice who are the open enemies of common goodness i reflected with a wonderful surprise upon the truth of an old maxim i remember to have read in some greek author a grecian maxim   how readily do all our natures tend to give advice with prudence to a friend but if we err our selves we know it not at least our selfaffection cloaks the blot   a story of the impudence of a certain zinganee the native insolence of these licentious wretches may be guessed at by a story i will tell you at a little country town in turkey where great numbers of the zinganees had pitched their tents a friend of mine who kept a summer house retired to pass a month or two and having been informed how skillful they were famed to be in making hatchets of an admirable temper had the curiosity to purchase one at the dear rate of three and twenty shillings in the money of that country  he tried his hatchet which was neatly made and had a fine turned helve and leather case to keep the head from wet and found it so exceeding good that he commended it extremely to the man who made it and professed he would not lose it for its double value  a cheating temper nothing could have been more welcome news or fairer invitation to the zinganee than this he presently resolved to find some opportunity of stealing back the hatchet that he might oblige the gentleman to buy another or reward him well for the pretense of having found the old one  in short he watched a day or two and having made his observation of the place twas laid in soon found means to get it and was met one morning by the owner as he hastened from the chamber with the mark of theft about him the gentleman surpised to see a zinganee in his apartment took him by the arm as he was passing by and asked him somewhat roughly what his business was and whither he was carrying his hatchet the gypsy an experienced artist answered nothing but with elevated eyes and shaking head endeavored silently to get away a wonderful assurance but when the gentleman increased his anger and began to call his servants to secure him with a bold undaunted look and tongue as nimble as his fingers he began to talk away his guilt in speeches to the following purpose the speech of a gypsy fool that you are but christians will be blind and who can help it now i know you think that i came hither with design to steal your hatchet o poor frailty of your common understanding i have skill honest infidel and by that skill knew certainly that if this hatchet was not taken from you this morning at eleven a clock and just three minutes after you would have been inclined to try its metal on you log of wood and so had surely cut your right leg half asunder i have skill and valued you and so prevented it by seizing on the evil instrument see here i will not be dismayed i prize your good above your friendship and will notwithstanding this prevent your danger  he had no sooner spoke these words but off he ran as fast as he was able nor was overtaken though the servants followed him till he had reached a well of an unfathomable depth and there he stopped but first threw in the hatchet which he knew could never be recovered from so deep a bottom  the success of a cheat the gentleman who guessed the zinganees design could scarce refrain from laughing at the air with which he carried off his impudence twas dangerous to beat him though he wished he could have ventured it in short the gypsy won his point and still maintaining that his value for the person of the gentleman had made him throw away the former hatchet got the making of another like it  i should have told you that they always choose some even spot of ground to pitch their tents where the men and women sing and dance in awkward gestures all day long run hop and toy away their hours in various kinds of active entertainments  another story of the gypsies i lay in company with several other english gentlemen at a large town in thrace now called romania i think the place was named burgoss upon a spacious plain without the city stood the tents of several tribes of wandering gypsies who were used to entertain themselves in dancing till near midnight and expressed their satisfaction in each others conversation by the number of their exercises  we walked out one day to take the air upon the plain i speak of and were very much surpised to see a company of naked people of both sexes joined promiscuously in a kind of antic dance and leaping up and down with uncouth noises and indecent postures which declared them strangers to the smallest grain of common modesty  we came as near em as we could and were immediately surrounded by their numbers every person striving to foretell our fortunes by inspection of our hands which we prevented them from doing by an obstinate refusal to admit them near us  an english modesty one young gentleman among us of a very modest or indeed a bashful nature was half frighted to behold himself encompassed by a band of naked women and instead of striving to defend himself from their endeavors kept one hand before his eyes and all on fire with blushes turned his head aside and begged us to depart from that society of devils  a very dexterous and pleasant cheat the zinganees immediately perceived the opportunity he gave them and with all imaginable expedition joining hands danced round him in a ring and pulling him about from place to place laughed sung and kissed him with a strange extravagance while several others came about us with a thousand artful postures and discourses to prevent us from observing what they did with our companion who was so amazed to find himself touched kissed and pulled about by such a naked multitude of females that he knew not what they were about till they had thrown him down and rolling him along among themselves found means to pick his pockets of his gold and silver two good rings and a fine watch of english workmanship  the impunity of zinganees in turkey we were so much diverted with the accident that we could hardly frame our tempers for a necessary quarrel which was all in vain for they had done their business and went on with their diversion never minding our repeated exclamations that they would restore the gentleman the prize so lately taken we complained to the chief magistrate upon reentring the city but found no redress all men declining to concern themselves with people over whom they boasted small authority and from whose punishment they could not hope retaliation of an injury received but would be sure to suffer by a swift revenge and never failing malice so extremely burthensom and dangerous are the gypsies in the eastern world beyond those here in england or indeed in any other part of western christendom  but notwithstanding the abovenamd character of the zinganees in general may incline the reader to believe the stories he has heard of gypsies and their wonderful performances are all chimaeras and the wild production of distempered fancy some gypsies better than the rest there are really some among them in whose families the spirit of foreknowledge seems to live beyond examples common in our country  there is nothing a more certain truth than that the masters of some merchant ships have been advised to wait a happy hour least on such and such a coast they should be shipwrecked which advice when slighted has appeared of more solidity than they imagined by the fatal loss of both the vessel and the lives of all her mariners  strange stories told of some of them not only these but many other such like accidents and some more strange have happened frequently in many parts of egypt and the other countries where these gypsies live i could relate surprising things which have been told me with a good authority but i forbear imposing facts upon my readers faith which notwithstanding the concurring evidences of undoubted witnesses and sometimes ocular demonstration really seem to shock my own  one story i will here however tell you and so leave you to your liberty believe or not believe that some of those called zinganees inherit naturally the prophetic blessing of foreknowing things to come which they pretend to i can only say they give such staggering demonstrations of a power beyond a common guess that though i was unwilling to give credit to their attestations i perceived them built upon too sure a ground to give me any opportunity of contradicting them  a story of an accident which befell the author in his travels i traveled once with a considerable number of my countrymen and other people through this country and was musing pensively behind my company on horseback in an easy pace when from a kind of bushy covert on one side the road there started out a man of venerable age long beard and decent habit in his shriveld hand he held a staff and a convulsive palsy shook his head with an incessant motion  he came forward slowly beckning me to stay as if he had some business of importance to communicate i stopped my horse whose main he strokd with his right hand when he came to me and seizing on my boot top with his left let fall his staff and looked so earnestly upon my face that i was struck with a surprise at the uncommon method of his salutation  i asked him if he knew me or had any thing to tell me that he looked upon me with such eagerness he skook his head with double force and after having used some wonderful expressions which for certain reasons i forbear to mention here he told me that a dangerous cloud hung over my head and threatened me with sudden death an unwelcome salutation perhaps young man says he you have not half an hour of life to come but heaven which only can avert the omen  you must needs imagine i was somewhat startled at this declaration which the old man had no sooner made than he departed looking back almost at every step he took and lifting up his eyes in seeming sign of some concern which looked like pity  a wonderful adventure at last i fansyd him a kind of madman and converted contemplation to a fit of mirth so galloped on as fast as i could ride to overtake my company and entertain em with the story of my odd adventure but i had not rode four hundred paces when from a cross road leading through a kind of wood on either side appeared some horsemen armed with javelins who with elevated weapons stopped my passage and made signs that i should presently alight or they would throw them at me  here the sudden turn of a reflection on the probability of that short space of life alloted me by the old man more deeply terrified me than the presence of my enemies a surprising turn of fortune i made a shift unknowing in a manner what i did to lay my hand upon a pistol and had just presented it when all the horsemen galloped off together with a motion equally surprising for its swiftness and occasion  that very moment struck my ears with the loud sound of a large brazen trumpet which a member of our company had carried with him and the noise of horsesfeer as if they galloped a timely succor presently appeared the major part of my companions who had missed me and came back by the advice of an old guide among them who informed em twas a dangerous thing to straggle from ones company in such a part of such a country  reflections on the accident now tho this strange deliverance might possibly have been unknown to the old man who met me and the notice which he gave me of it the effect of chance or a strange whim inspired by providence it is surely far more reasonable to suppose him master of a more than common share of knowledge or at least if this relation does not tempt the reader to the same opinion yet some private circumstances which attended it gave me such convincing proofs of his just title to a supernatural wisdom that i cannot help declaring i must still believe him blessed with a prophetic inspiration  chap xxvi of sestos and abydos the castles commanding the hellespont now called dardanelli and of the ruins of old troy sestos and abydos and now we are about to travel into egypt by the way of constantinople we must first sail down the hellespont whose entrance from the archipelago is defended strongly by four castles of considerable force the outward two whereof are sestos and abydos celebrated by the pens of ancient poets for the famous loves of hero and leander  methinks i found a certain secret pleasure in the very looking on a place of such antiquity and while i sailed along the river the complaining murmurs of the rolling waters seemed to mourn leanders drowning and i could not look upon the venerable turrets of those aged buildings but they brought to my reflection the idea of those dulcid strains wherein musaus warbles out the circumstances of the melancholy story musaeus de her and leand             in ancient days upon the famous shore where hellaspontic waves incessant roar close to the sea on either side the flood here sestos there the near abydos stood here his strong bow the wanton cupid bent and one swift arrow to both cities sent the youth vowed love the virgin owned the same both felt one passion and professed one flame leander was the lovers name and she was hero called as fair as maid could be she dwelt in sestos in abydos he both blessed alike in beauty and in love like two fair stars both in their circles move but you kind listner if by chance you roam and for those distant climates leave your home if in your wanderings you by chance come there and led by choice or business curious are inquire of some old liver grave and good where once a certain ancient turret stood whereon the sestian hero chose to stand and held a lantern in her tender hand to teach her betterhalf which way to move and act the pilot to leanders love look next upon those seas which hourly roar and wash the sands of old abydos shore weeping as over the guilty scene they fly that constant lovers loss whom there they forced to die   a caution of the turks and indeed a traveller has here a spacious opportunity to follow the advice of this old poet for he is detained three days by a fixed custom of the country and must then submit to be examined whither bound what countryman and wait the searching of the ship by officers deputed from the castles ever he may have liberty to sail beyond the reach of their artillery  its causes this caution is occasioned by the necessary policy of their sharp government whose ever wary eye forbids the clearing foreign ships till after such a stay within the entrance of the hellespont least they should have committed any breach of articles before they left the city  reflections on the modern ignorance of this country but oh how much in vain musaeus bids us ask the people of these ancient towns for places which they are not only strangers to the knowledge but to the names of ignorance and insolence have clouded learning in the very inclinations of the modern masters of this country endless revolutions in the very face of furrowed nature have eracd the characters of former wisdom and destroyed in an obscure and deep oblivion those lamented monuments of high antiquity  the dardanells and why so called the present owners call these castles dardanelli and it is a more than probable opinion that their etymology derives its birth from their vicinity in situation to the trojan shore their strength is little if compared with the more artful forms of regular and modern fortifications and are incapacitated to defend themselves against the power of seiges carried on by land entrenchments all their use arises from the large and monstrous bore of many cannons planted on a level with the surface of the water and discharging bullets made of stone of such prodigious size that tho it has been known that ships have passed in safety by the favorable opportunity of a great gale and swelling waters it is a rash and dangerous attempt and ten to one but all who hazard it are sunk in the performance  reflections on the present state of troy we sail from hence and presently gain sight of troy at least the shore whereon troy stood that towering city whose imperial turrets braved the fury of confederate nations and repulsed so many bloody times the powerful armies of the grecian heros under whose renowned and long defended walls the flowing blood of hostile nations bathed a soil which nourished laurels of immortal memory whose unbounded sway and unexhausted plenty drew the wonder of an emulative world as her brave fall and celebrated ruin moved the pens of the sublimest poets in the universe to eternize her glory this illustrious scene of wonders this amazing field of action now lies silent buried and overwhelmed in the too melancholy fate of troja fvit troy was  nothing is remaining worthy of the monument of so renowned a city the relentless teeth of iron time have gnawed away her beauties and the miserable remnant of her ancient grandeur is confined to such a poor and little measure the mistake of many travelers that those hasty travelers who think it a sufficient satisfaction to have seen a place at distance have informed the world that all is now converted into pasture ground or that in short a just idea of the present state of that subverted city may be comprehended fully by the tuneful chorus of a good old english ballad which as i remember tells us wast lie those walls which were so good and grass now grows where troy town stood   however as i was too curious in my inclinations to rest content with the reports of other men in places where i could inform my self by ocular experience i resolved to go on shore and was the more desirous to become a witness of the miserable blot which had defaced so fair a copy the grounds of that mistake because i very well remembered to have met a jew in portugal who had assured me there was more to be discovered on the shore of troy than commonly was credited but the dangerous barbarity of the inhabitants was such as rendered it a hazardous attempt and consequently frighted many people from landing in that country  the captain of the ship wherein i sailed obliged me with his boat while adverse winds detained us on the coast and one francisco condaliso an italian priest who had been long a missionary in the eastern countries and at present if alive resides at padua consented to accompany me the author lands at troy we landed in a very fair and spacious harbor probably the same which formerly received the boats of greece returning to and fro with soldiers and provisions  we walked about three miles up through the country on a ground still rising from the sea with small acclivity but overgrown with brakes and brambles as indeed is every part which borders on the sea for many miles along that land so that the first remark i made in this my trojan expedition was that my old countryman the balladmaker was mistaken in his calculation  an account of what he discovered there we looked about as eagerly as possible but looked in vain and had begun to doubt or even despair of finding any marks or ruins of antiquity when francisco struck his foot with accidental violence against a stone and casting down his eyes imagined he discovered something like a piece of building scarce an inch above the ground all over grown with moss and in a manner covered by the gross about it  a piece of the old walls of troy upon a closer view and digging up the obstacles which interposed themselves we plainly found it was a part of some old wall and with our scymetars removing all the brambles and low bushes near it we discovered it to be near thirteen foot in breadth but narrower and higher in some places than it was in others  tracing it with more than common difficulty through a little knot of bushes we had soon lost sight of it and dug in vain as deep as we could thrust our swords to find if it continued farther on however having met so fair encouragement we cheerfully proceeded near a quarter of a mile and there discovered at considerable distance something like a rugged wall or broken ruin of an ancient building  coming near it we perceived it was the same continued piece of building we had lately lost and on a close examination found it of a black and solid stone appearing joined by mortar which the length of time had notwithstanding hardened into substance of an equal firmness with the stone it self  a description of it the sizes of the stones were very different but rather small than of extraordinary magnitude for few exceeded half a foot in their diameter the length of this old piece of wall was sixteen yards the height at most exceeded not four foot but was in many places broken and in some scarce half a foot above the ground  twas strangely overgrown with little shrubs and diverse plants appeared between the joinings of the stone which wore a melancholy sylvan dress of most and houseleek overgrown with laurel but the most engaging part of the whole prospect was a seeming grove of spreading laureltrees which flourished on the top and hanging down on either side protecting as it were the building from the injuries of weather methoughts i never saw those kind of trees so justly planted and i could not help remembring that they looked as naturally placed on these old ruins as upon the celebrated tomb of the harmonious virgil in the neighborhood of naples  a new discovery above an hour we feasted curiosity with a repeated observation of the pleasing object and had tarried longer in the same employment but were called away by the discovery of certain other ruins at a little distance from us which we found to be no more than a continuance of the wall we had before been looking on  three monuments or tombstones but while we eagerly examined every part we both took notice of a great disordered heap of stones near which there stood three things like tombstones and upon approach we found em to be really such at least designed to represent them they were two yards long and four foot broad of common stone raised near two foot in height and covered with three fine flat marbles which by the inscriptions on em seemed to have been done in christendom to gratify the humor of some curious person willing to amuse posterity when they should find such tombs in such a place and never know which way they came to be there  by the workmanship and the decayed condition of the monuments we judged em not the children of the present age if possibly the last was old enough to father them with much ado upon the first we came to we could read the following epitaph which i presently remembered to have met with in ausonius on the death of hector an epitaph found upon the tomb of hector hectoris hic tumulus cum quo sua troja sepulta est conduntur pariter qui periere simul this is brave hectors tomb with whom his troy found grave one fate did both consume both one sepulcher have   the tomb of king priamus a little farther stood the second tomb which was it seems designed to represent the monument of priamus the epitaph which like the first and third is borrowed from ausonius seems to speak a royal mourner and paternal sorrow qui tumulum priami quaerit legate hectoris ante ille meus nato quem prius ipse dedi hectoris and patris simul est commune sepulchrum amborum quoniam juncta ruina fuit his epitaph he who inquires for priams grave should first on hectors look that is mine the tomb to him i gave for my own use i took one common sepulcher must hold the father and the son because at once to ruin sold they jointly were undone   the tomb of hecuba the third a little shorter than the former two contains an epitaph upon afflicted majesty in the known name of hecuba the wretched wife and mother of the latenamd priamus and hector quae regina fui quae claro nata dymante quae priami conjux hectora quae genui hic hecuba injectis perii superobruta saxis sed rabie linguae me tamen ulta prius fidite ne regnis and prole and stirpe parentum quicunque hoc nostrum  legitis her epitaph i who was queen who was the daughter too of dymas whose bright glories all men knew i who was priams wife who first gave birth to hector whose great actions shook the earth i hecuba fell here overwhelmed with stones but curses ever i fell revenged my battered bones who ever you are who shall hereafter see this  dogs sepulcher which now serves for me learn to depend on neither sons race state or any other slippery gifts of fate for what am i now dead though living more than great   these are the most and i may say the only things worth observation there though they deserved the notice of a traveller and i am therefore much surpised that none have mentioned them at least no countryman of mine i have been told how true i know not that a french book published very many years ago and called l history d asia a rare french book mentions these particulars the book i never met with but am apt to think that since they only have the notion it was one of their own countrymen who found the ruinated wall and added the three tombs i have so lately spoke of  yet it is a certainty beyond dispute that englishmen have landed there at least one countryman of ours has left behind him a convincing argument of his arrival in those parts for underneath the marble flat which covers hectors tomb we found these lines upon the side of a smooth stone they seemed to have been carved with difficulty by a knife and spoke their author a salt water poet a piece of poetry made at troy by an english sailor in the year      i do suppose that here stood troy my name it is william a jolly boy my other name it is hudson and so god bless the sailors where ever they do go i was here in the year of our lord      and was bound to old england god bless her   we staid some hours with a wonderful delight and gazed about the country with a satisfaction equal to our curiosity but finding nothing more to entertain our observation we began to think of getting back and so returned the way we came we were not well on board before the wind came fair and we set sail immediately  the island of tenedos we passed by tenedos an island celebrated for having hid the grecian navy from the trojan view while they believing the besiegers gone took in the horse which entered big with their destruction the place is now not worth a strangers notice but upon account of the abovenamed story few inhabitants are found upon it and those few the worst and meanest of the countries thereabouts so strangely subject is the fate of nations to the common changes and uncertainties of frail mortality  chap xxvii of the islands in the aegean sea the islands of the archipelago famous anciently the many great and little islands which compose the archipelago have been at least most of them so extremely famous for peculiar attributes appropriated to em in the memorable works of ancient poets that i cannot pass em by without a transient view of such as most deserve our mention some there are so very small as never yet to have been honored with a name and many of the largest being sometimes seen and sometimes not in sailing from constantinople to the coast of egypt i will only speak of such as mariners obliged sometimes to shift their course by adverse weather may by choice or force go nigh to touch at  the names of the most considerable and those are lemnos chios metelyn and samos icaria patmos zea rhodes and coos sometimes a ship is driven more westerly and sails by delos pretty near the continent sees thebes and delphos athens corinth and the famous creto now candy every one of these abovenamed places i will therefore treat of that the reader may conceive a just idea of the wondrous difference between their modern and their ancient circumstances  how it came to be called the aegean sea but ever i come to the particular description of these several places twill not be a miss to speak a word or two in explanation of the sea in general called aegean from aegeus father to the famous theseus who leaped headlong thereinto believing that the ship which brought his son from fighting with the monster minotaurus was returned with the account of his miscarriage the abovenamd theseus having failed in his promise of converting his black sails into white if he came back victorious  its extent it is a part or arm and that the largest of the mediterranean it reaches to the entrance of the very hellespont dividing greece from asia minor it is a dangerous place to sail in but especially by night the islands lying so extremely close that oftentimes a ship is driven forcibly upon a rocky shore in open day by stress of weather  lemnos and its product terra sigillata now let us visit lemnos a considerable island not so much for its extent of magnitude as the unthought advantages accruing to the turks it is present masters from the yearly exportation of a valuable earth called terra sigillata from the small impression of a seal which marks the balls wherein it is sold with turkish characters and so prevents the danger of an imposition on the merchant  it was in ancient times esteemed of weighty virtue in medicinal performances and gathered yearly by the priests of venus with a thousand ceremonies and often mingled with the blood of goats in order to be offered as a sacrifice to that imaginary goddess  lemnos was formerly of no small note for being taken notice of by homer as the place whereon the limping vulcan fell when jupiter thought fit to kick him out of heaven hom iliad       when once i dared oppose my brother jove and warred against him in the realms above he snatched me by the foot then raised me high and hurled me headlong from the starry sky downward all day i tumbled and begun to draw near earth at setting of the sun on lemnos then i fell   chios and its etymology next chios claims our observation anciently receiving that denomination from the greek word  signifying snow because her mountains frequently are covered with it now her name is changed to zio or as some pronounce it sio it is near an hundred thirty odd miles in compass lengthning from the southward to the northern point and subject to the turks who notwithstanding suffer many greeks to live among them with far greater privileges than they give to any of their countrymen in other places  a description of the city and inhabitants the town of sio is considerably large and made convenient by a spacious haven the city is defended by a castle of no little strength upon a hill exceeding steep the buildings of the town are very neat especially the public ones and the inhabitants i mean the greeks so very merry in their easy slavery that all night long a stranger is diverted with their songs and dances and their instruments of music sounding briskly through the streets the women as esteemed of old are yet the mistresses of admirable beauties framed by nature for an amorous conversation and possessing sweetly the politest marks of gentle affability they frequently appoint a kind of balls and merrymakings which are given alternately from house to house and spend their days in all the gayety of wealth and liberty  the manufactures of the island the product of the island is the finest corn and oil some silks and cotton and the best sherbets which can be made by reason of the excellence of a rich kind of honey found in mastick trees i call them so because the gum of that name is in great abundance brought from thence and is a distillation from the rind which being cut in august still continues to emit great quantities thereof till the beginning of october following an old tradition they have an old traditional account that when saint theodore was led to martyrdom he wept extremely for the blindness of the world and every place which then was moistened by a tear of his now bears the tree affording mastick though the tour he took must have been very large for all the south part of the island bears them in great abundance  arvis or amista a large mountain in the middle of the country still abounds in that rich wine so celebrated formerly by virgil in his eclogues then called arvisian now il vino amistano an italian appellation virg ecl   et multo in primis hilarans convivia baccho ante focum si frigus erit si messis in umbra vina novum fundam calathis arvisia nectar when elevated with a lofty joy our hours in bacchus pleasures we employ if cold by the kind warmth of some bright fire or if it is hot to shady bowers retire then with gay mirth will we recruit our souls and with arvisian nectar crown the bowls   and indeed the present owners of the wine agree with virgil in the same opinion  chios challenges the birth of homer among the many things for which the island chios is remarkable she claims the honor due to homers birth place challenging a right to that pretention from a thousand several circumstances and showing travelers an ancient monument which they would fain persuade us to believe was homers tomb they either are mistaken in their claim or the old distich on that subject should have mentioned chios in the room of ios and have made the verses run as follow     the seven contending cities for him it would be easy to translate the lines verbatim and inform the unlearned reader that the towns contending for his birth were smyrna ios rhodes salamin athens argos and colophon but i have met with an admirable thought in some late english poets writings though i cannot say directly who he was and rather choose to quote his words since they not only touch upon the present subject but will represent a very true and lively image of the little honor writers get till past enjoying it seven wealthy towns contend for homer dead through which the living homer begged his bread   mitylen or lesbos both those names how given lesbos or mitylen another island next appears considerable in her magnitude near two hundred miles in circuit not far distant from the phrygian continent a very healthful country of a temperate air and soil productive of the finest corn in christendom the island takes its name of lesbos from the adventurer lesbus son of old sapithus who was sent by the directions of the oracle mitylen from mitylene the sister to methymna daughter of macarius and the wife of the abovenamed lesbus  the town of mitylen the city mitylen upon a small peninsula the capital of all the island likewise claims from hence her etymology her buildings are magnificently fine and beautiful her situation high and stately and the brisk inhabitants of this delightful country gay and honest in their poverty like those of chios and like them now subject to the turkish government which here maintains a constant fleet of well appointed galleys to secure the islands thereabouts belonging to the sultan from the daring squadrons of the bold maltese or florentine adventurers  the virtue of the lesbian wines the wine of lesbos is at present looked upon exceeding good and boasting one convenient property beyond most other sorts for let a man debauch as much as possible with an excess thereof it never hurts him nor is troubled with those heady qualities which grecian wines are generally subject to  if you will allow the taste of horace to have been polite and he methinks should know its relish who so admirably well describes its virtues you may see his thoughts upon the matter hor l   ode    hic innocentis pocula lesbii duces sub umbra nec semeleius cum mart confundet thyoneus praelia here under some thick shade by meeting branches made shall you while no sun beams upon you shine drink cups of harmless lesbian wine nor shall thyonian bacchus tempt your rage to rise to disoord or with mars engage   spirits or frightful apparitions on the coasts they have a notion that in some few harbors of this island frightful apparitions flutter dreadfully about a ship all night that dismal shrieks are often heard and i have been informed by many that they could not sleep without the trouble of the most tremenduous and amazing dreams imaginable this last assertion is a certain truth but i am rather apt to think the matter an effect of the unwholesome vapors rising from the sea or lakes about it near those harbors  the island samos and now we come to samos not considerable in its self but on account of a commodity thence brought in very large and frequent quantities  a dangerous tempest forced our ship to seek a shelter in a certain creek upon the southward of this island where we anchored pretty safely and were drawn by the delightful prospect of the shore to land upon it about six in company  a pleasant accident we left the boat which brought us from the ship within a little nook or bay nigh land locked by the high and rocky ground about it and were walking on the shore in order to ascend the country when we spied upon the waterside a thing which at a distance looked not much unlike a washingtub  we walked directly to it and perceived it was a vessel of a very small and incapacious hollow full of oil in which were swimming up and down near twenty little engines which upon examination we discovered to be sponges each containing upon either side a little piece of cork which being fastened to the middle kept the sponge it self afloat and only suffered half to move in or imbibe the oil within the vessel  we were busied a considerable time in looking on these things and wondering what should be their use in so remote a place from any town as that appeared whereon we found em but at last resolved to sit us down upon the sand and wait the coming of an owner to the vessel for we thought it probable there was one and believed he could not long be absent  but while we talked to one another of the wondrous smoothness of the waters in the bay while those without were ruffled by the storm and cast our eyes upon their stillness a strange surprise we were all surpised to see a thing not much unlike a basket pop with force above the surface and continue moving up and down a little space then up there started something like a man who shook his head rubbed clear his eyes and swam directly inwards to the place we sat on pushing in the basket just before him  this second figure really startled us beyond the first and brought to our remembrance an idea of the sea god neptune for we hardly could believe him mortal who had risen from the water by whose side we had been sitting nigh ten minutes  the man for such he proved to be no sooner saw us but he seemed a little shy of landing till we beckoned him and called as kindly as we could and so persuaded him to come ashore and bring the basket with him he had left his clothes and other things behind the rock not ten yards from us and immediately ran thither for them a diving basket in the mean time we approached his basket found it quite bound round with cork and covered with a canvass in the midst whereof appeared a slit through which we put our hands and drew out sponges of a surprising bigness  the man returned as soon as dressed and finding us more civil than he had expected told us in a kind of lingua franca that those sponges grew on rocks ten fifteen sometimes twenty fathom deep that there were many hundred diverse in the island some of whom had left him just before who got their livelyhoods like him by gathering sponges  a curious diving project then he showed us how they were enabled to perform it in the following manner half the sponge as i have said is soaked in oil the other half is dipped before in certain stiptic waters to prevent the oil from penetrating farther than it ought to go when so prepared they take the sponge and thrusting it within their mouths the oiled part outward but of that almost an inch within the lips they press their teeth a little hard upon it and by that means force the oily sponge to close the entrance of their mouths against the water  how the sponges are gathered thus they dive and with a little difficulty in a streightend suction make a shift to tarry under water a considerable time they sink the baskets by the help of stones which they contrive to fasten at the bottom and with instruments they carry down on purpose cut the sponges from the sides of rocks till having filled the baskets they take off the weights and then they rise with ease by reason of the cork about them  how long they tarry under water by constant practice many of these diverse are arrived at such perfection in the art that they can tarry under water till the oil corrupts which it will always do in less than two hours time there is a law among the diverse of this island that no man shall be allowed to marry till he can demonstrate by a trial he is qualified to dive for one continued quarter of an hour the novelty engaged us all to make experiment and i who more than most men was averse to diving did without great difficulty keep my head two minutes under water but the secret of the stiptic preparation he refused to teach us though we would have gladly bribed him to it  samos boasts no other trade than this of sponges which is yet so profitable that they yearly send away vast ship loads of them and grow rich thereby beyond the emulation of their less industrious or less skillful neighbors  why juno is said to have been born at samos the constant clearness of the air in samos gave occasion to the poets of antiquity to feign that juno taken allegorically for that element was born upon this island and the excellent pythagoras adorned the country with the honor due to the respected birthplace of so great a man they also still pretend to show the rock whence aesop was thrown headlong and a cave where in the reign of numa pompilius heriphile a sibyl prophesied of christ  description of the island icaria icaria now niceria is a small and inconsiderable island creeks it has but no commodious haven bearing corn in great abundance but possessing very few inhabitants and famous for the fornoli a ridge of sharp and dangerous rocks much feared by sailors in a foggy night it is ancient name the poets feigned to have been given it together with the sea it lies in from the fictious fall of icarus attempting to have flown with artificial wings of which thus ovid in his metamorphoses ovid met    oraque caerulea patrium clamantia nomen excipiuntur aqua quae nomen traxit ab illo he fell and on his father called in vain for as he sunk in the relentless main skycolourd waters stopped his eager breath and took the name they bear from his untimely death   and in another place icarus icariis nomina fecit aquis the icarian sea from icarus took name   that the island took its name from the same accident appears from daedaluss burying his son upon it thus described by the same poet in the book abovenamd devovitque suas arts corpusque sepulcro condidit and tellus a nomine dicta sepulti he cursed those arts which drew his ruin on and built a tomb upon his breathless son from whose unhappy fate well known to fame the ground wherein he lay received its name   description of the island patmos patmos is an island very small and full of rocks extremely barren not affording even the common necessaries for support of human life which therefore the inhabitants supply themselves withal from other islands of the archipelago the land is mountainous and has no more than one small city which equips a fleet of trading vessels to import conveniences from foreign parts the ancient name is changed at present to palmosa  this place is famous for the character it has of being the seat st john made choice of while he penned his revelations a monastery on a hill and upon a mountain in the northern parts there stands a monastery of the grecian coloieros who profess that saint their patron and pretend to show some relics to inquiring travelers  the notice which i had hereof obliged me to the hopes of seeing patmos and a tempest was so favorable to my wishes that we anchored in a haven not far distant from the monastery and the opportunity inviting me a shore i landed with design to walk and visit it  the northern side of patmos is but very thinly peopled and as i was destitute thereby of any means to get a guide so either want of curiosity or indisposition by the roughness of the storm dissuaded those on board our vessel from consenting to go with me  the author lands at patmos however since the road appeared but short and seemingly conspicuous i resolved to undertake the visit single so i landed with a pair of pistols and a scymetar and crossed a little kind of plain which brought me to the bottom of a hill on which the monastery had its situation  the hill was overgrown with a large wood through which appeared no other passage than a small foot path and that not beaten but a very unfrequented way which led me through an hundred several turnings to ascents extremely steep and intricate as labyrinths  loses his way in a wood i came at last where i perceived the wood grow thinner and could see a pretty way before me there i stopped and looking up discovered on the brow of an impending precipice a little hut or cave which seemed the habitation of some melancholy hermit or unhappy lover like the swains of ancient times who being baffled in their hopes forsook the world for some forlorn and solitary wilderness to spend the remnant of their silent days in grief for their misfortunes  discovers a cave surpised at first by the romantic air of this low cave i stood a while to think if it were safe to venture forward since it was a probable belief that some wild beast had chose that den for the rough scene of his retirement but that groundless apprehension vanished instantly for while i yet continued in suspense methoughts i could discover plainly something like a door that stood a jarr and consequently rendered it a place improper for a salvage mansion  i advanced with equal doubt and curiosity till having gained the summit of the precipice i found it was a cell the door of which stood half way open and contained upon its smooth outside a piece of course and halflost painting with the following latin sentence in a homely character with an inscription on the door hic and in coelo quies here and in heaven is rest   the softness of this first discovery invited me to make a step beyond it so that with a gentle force i pushed the door quite open and was all amazed when i perceived the inside of the cell as still as possible no ornament appeared to set it off but just against the entrance burnt a lamp on either side a little altar and the weak and broken light which they afforded faintly striking through the dullness of the place finds a man in a black coffin discovered in the midst a large black coffin filled with something not to be distinguished but as black and dismal in its first appearance as the coffin it was laid in  nothing i then thought could add to my surprise which yet was doubled when there rose with a deliberate silence from within the coffin something like a man or rather spirit who no sooner sat upright than looking on me with a frightful aspect he pronounced these words in a low voice who invites him into the place che sei se un christiano benvenuto who are you if a christian you are welcome   by the language of his salutation i perceived him an italian and the trembling of his limbs persuaded me to think that the appearance of my scymetar and pistols had as much surpised him as he had me i therefore took immediate care to undeceive him in the apprehension he had framed that i was some armed robber and informed him that i was a briton traveling the world and thrown by chance upon that island where i landed with design to visit the greek monastery  the old man seemed transported with the news made shift to rise and led me to a seat hewn roughly from the rock within the cell he laid his hands upon my head pronounced a grave and honest blessing and proceeded modestly to take the liberty of asking some few questions which i willingly obliged him with as ready answers to  which proves to be a hermits cell he then abandoned all the coyness of his first deportment and informed me he had lived a hermits life in that poor cell nigh two and thirty years together that he frequently was visited by the friars of the monastery not far distant that they sometimes brought him meat and wine which he consented now and then to take for the support of nature though he rather chose to live on roots and clear spring water that he always slept in that black coffin never to be absent from a strong memento of his frail mortality that he was born i think at zant and named antonio giacomo malaviso  a chapel in the wood i purposely omit some hours discourse i had with this old hermit because digressive from the cause for which i mention him and only will inform my reader that he would accompany me to a small chapel in the wood at no great distance from his cell built over the stone cave wherein st john is said to have resided while he writ his famous book of revelations  he left me there first recommending me to the civilities of certain priests who kept the chapel they received and treated me with wonderful respect and having talked away an hour in questioning each other as we thought convenient they proceeded to unlock a private door which opened from a corner of the chapel to a very dark and narrow passage  the cave wherein st john is said to have writ his revelations we descended some few steps and having walked about six paces farther came upon a sudden to a very large and lightsome cave the light was introduced by very artificial hollows from the surface through the rock and in the midst of one of the four squares which formed the cell was cut a seat exactly like the niches made for statues in cathedral churches  just before this niche there stands a solid rocky table of about a yard square and here they would persuade us to believe the saint was seated at his daily studies relics in the cave to confirm me in belief of this opinion they made long harangues of those authentic proofs which justified tradition and desired that i would take particular and serious notice of a kind of round impression on the area or superficies of the table which they say was caused by the perpetual standing of the brazen vessel which contained his ink and on the floor they showed me several little marks like spots of black which they assured me were the drops occasioned by the shaking of the pen wherewith the saint was used to write the dictates of his holy inspiration  the monastery of st john with these obliging priests i visited the monastery and was there received as civilly as i coud possibly have found an entertainment in the house of an acquaintance or relation every thing was neat and plentiful without extravagance becoming the decorum of religious livers yet not void of relish form or delicacy  a miracle of st johns hand among the many relics they delight to boast of and communicate to travelers they showed me a large bony hand which seemed to be a mans cut off not far above the wrist the bones were dry and full of little holes as if wormeaten yet there seemed to sprout at all the fingers ends a little sign of something which the friars told us were the nails of the latenamd st john  how they came by st johns right hand they could not tell me but attested that on every second sunday of the month the nails were cut as close as possible and that they always grew again they brought me a large silver box wherein the parings of these nails were safely kept as sacred relics never to be used the virtue of his nails but when some father of their order was extremely sick and then they said a few of those thrown piously upon a fire and the smoke thereof ascending at his nostrils are a very quick and neverfailing remedy provided the sick mans appointed hour of death prevents not his recovery  description of the island zea from patmos let us look on zea a small island of about twelve miles in compass hilly and extremely full of woods productive of a large and fatning acorn of such noted goodness and of such abundance in this island that the few inhabitants upon it who are generally greeks but subject to the turks authority enrich themselves considerably by exporting yearly great shiploads to other islands and some places on the continent  asses excellent at climbing but what is most worth notice here is the prodigious usefullness of certain asses which the natives saddle and upon their backs so well do those poor creatures climb can travel over rocks and craggy precipices so extremely steep and rugged that a man on foot would find himself put to it to ascend without assistance  the island boasts one little town but that entirely void of stately buildings or indeed the poorest ornaments of common decency for not a door in all the place is four foot high but people almost creep who are obliged to enter them and this they do because the turks who often come to buy or plunder asses in this island would if possible make stables of their very houses  a description of the island rhodes rhodes is an island famous now as it has ever been for all the blessings liberal nature can bestow upon a country in ancient times her valiant people were the envy but withal the wonder of their neighbors skilled in every science grace and virtue the temperate air convenient harbors fertile pastures and unnumberd benefits she justly boasted of were admirable and peculiar and the sun so constantly was known to shine upon this country that clara rhodia rhodes the bright distinguished her among the ancients for that glorious blessing  famous for two things two things of old she was particularly famous for the first discovery and planting of the vine and that stupendous fabric the colossus striding on the sea from rock to rock that ships might sail with ease between the legs and when thrown down the very brass whereof twas formed was found enough to load almost a thousand camels  about the year of christ   0  emanuel emperor of greece bestowed this island on the noble knights of st john de acre just then beaten from their last asylum in the holy land when conquered by the turks in their possession it remained till the year      when sultan solomon the turkish emperor became its master at a bloody price and the surviving remnant of its brave defenders were by treaty suffered to remove to malta  in the possession of the turks it still remains well fortified and strictly guarded and has often since its loss proved fatal to the christians intercepted navigation justly punishing their base neglect in the implored dispatch of timely succors censured sharply in the following lines by scaliger a reproof of scaliger to the christians negligence clara rhodos sed clara olim nunc horrida nimbis obnubuit nitidum dira procella caput ah dolor ah mors ah aliquid morte atque dolor durius aut etiam tertius esse potest stertitis and ferus amenti lupus optima carpit o jam sit jam aliquis velle perire pudor bright rhodes but bright of old darkclouded now a dreadful tempest shades thy shining brow oh grief oh death oh something worse than both or than that worst even worse oh shameful sloth sloth that with slumber did your eyes betray while the fierce wolf snatched your best prize away o this base shame if any sure will stain not only to be tied but even invite your chain   description of coos coos or longo is a little island plain and pleasant in its situation jointly peopled by the turks and graecians full of admirable springs and rivolets abounding greatly with a noble wine fine cypress trees and turpentine with many rich and useful druggs exported thence to almost every part of christendom but what this island is most famous for is that it was the birthplace of the great hippocrates that sacred demygod of physic and improver of a science so extremely useful to mankind in general  description of delos delos now called diles is an island all encompassed by a ring of rocks and lies conveniently directly in the passage between greece and asia twas famous anciently for the great oracle and temple of apollo and received its name of from  signifying clear delos from the clear and pertinent responses querists met with to their questions of all kinds whatsoever hence apollo oftentimes was worshipped by the name of delius  the ruins of apollos temple the island now is uninhabited but well deserves a strangers view for there remain the ruins of apollos temple still majestical and full of grandeur many stately marble pillars lie neglected in the heaps of rubbish and a very precious kind of stone is sometimes brought away to many parts of italy  upon the death of christ the oracles grew silent and from thenceforth delos lost her honor and has never been frequented since that time we read in plutarch a remarkable relation of an accident which happened to the knowledge of one epitherses who was formerly his tutor in the reign of tiberius emperor of rome the story is as follows  a story from plutarch between corcyra and leucadia lay the paxe two small islands where this epitherses sailing for the coast of italy was suddenly becalmed and while the passengers uneasy at the slowness of their voyage walked upon the deck a frightful shrill and mournful voice alarmed em from the shore distinctly calling thamus thamus thamus  a voice from an unknown shore thamvs was a pylot then upon the poop one born in egypt who was silent with amazement till the call was thrice aloud repeated then he answered faintly and demanded why he summoned him the voice replied as soon as thou art come to the palodes let it be proclaimed aloud that pan great pan is dead  a sudden horror seized the company to hear this strange and unexpected salutation presently the wind came fair and as the ship drew near the place abovenamd thamus as he was desired stood high upon the poop and with an elevated voice cried pan is dead when in a moment all the air was torn with groanings and a mixed confusion of complaining accents so extremely dismal that it cannot be imagined  caesar hearing this report commanded thamus to be brought before him who attested it with the concurring evidences of the sailors then on board the cessation of oracles great pan was christ the universal shepherd and his death had bound the devils power no longer suffering his delusive oracles to impose upon mankind they therefore upon hearing this unwelcome news bewailed their miseries with the abovenamd lamentations  sometimes it happens that you sail along the continent and see the ancient venerable thebes renowned of old for admirable virtues skilled politely in all arts and sciences mistress of the rules of war and policy a government made famous by the wonderful successes of a race of heroes but particularly glorious in the never dying memory of brave epaminondas who was yet ungratefully rewarded for his matchless actions and neglected rather than encouraged by the factions of his country a very ancient vice and still i fear too fashionable in the modern world i wish it were not in my power to quote examples  thebes as she now is thebes is now entirely subject to the turkish government and groans beneath a weighty burden of oppressive tyranny some stately ruins of antiquity may still be seen and feast the eye with wonderful delight while with a melancholy contemplation of the short continuance of vain magnificence they entertain the understanding  delphos as at present delphos memorably noted for a thousand causes humbly rears her miserable head as if remembring former splendor she reflected mournfully upon her present fall and blushed to be discovered in her changed condition the mountain of parnassus now no more pretends to boast the muses residence the lofty songs of ancient poets are forgotten on the nowneglected streams of helicon and the delightful harmonies once celebrated there are now converted into howlings of strange salvage beasts and brayings of wild asses  athens described athens still may call her self a city but can only do it as the skeleton of some dead man continues long to represent the shape of human body for her ancient temples are defaced and buried even beyond the knowledge of the very ground they stood upon her exemplary forms of government and order ruined and demolished by the arrogance of infidels more arbitrary and unjust than all the tyrants she opposed in former ages no longer now do the judicious laws of the incomparable solon sway her natives bribery prevails and justice yields her balance to the rapine of an uncontrolled and barbarous authority  but notwithstanding the destruction of her valuable liberty she still retains her ancient plenty constantly affording all the delicacies require to be obtained by even such as would encourage pride and pamper luxury  corinth and her product corinth situated on that narrow neck of land which joins moreae to the undivided continent is only famous for her mines of brass in great esteem among the romans and affording still the finest metal in the world but that in small and inconsiderable quantities  description of crete or candy crete or candy as at present called was taken by the turks from the possession of the brave venetians who defended it some years against a constant siege and made the place a bloody purchase to the turkish army it is an island very large its capital containing stately houses and defended by a regular and modern work of admirable strength and artifice provisions here are very plentiful and the inhabitants exceeding numerous many harbors of commodious form and a capacious magnitude invite the traffic of the foreign merchant and it is observable that crete is blessed with a surprising property which some have thought peculiar to the soil of ireland for nothing poisonous is bred therein nor can the reptiles of another country long survive their importation thither  very subject to thunder twas in this island jupiter was born and thinking when i saw the place upon the fiction of the poets i observed with pleasure that the judgment of the ancients still moved regularly for nothing could have been more natural than representing jove a native of this island since there hardly passes one whole day throughout the year wherein it does not thunder with a mighty violence  chap xxviii of alexandria in egypt the origin of alexandria now have i brought you into egypt at the common landing place the ancient alexandria so called from the successful macedonian who desirous to perpetuate his memory there resolved to build a city which he did upon or near the place where now the modern alexandria has its situation  its ancient state he peopled it with greeks and so amazingly adorned the streets and houses with the richest gifts of art and nature that twas long the celebrated paradise of all the east the houses were supported upon marble pillars and as much of them were hid belowground as appeared above unnumbred statues of the nicest workmanship adorned the place and every stately ornament was purchased to complete its excellence  how different from the present but oh how different from this does she appear at present the houses which remain are low all meanly built and thinly peopled those excepted which are situated on the haven the form is almost square encompassed round by double walls with many turrets in the ancient way these walls are commonly believed the same which ptolemy so many ages since commanded to be built for the security of the thenvaluable city  its situation it is seated in a very barren desert country and has no allurement trade excepted to invite inhabitants the castle of alexandria upon the entrance of the haven formerly the island pharus now converted into continent so great a change does time produce in all weak sublunary beings stands a castle ill supplied with water or conveniences for long defense the ordnance of the walls salute all ships upon their coming to an anchor for the port of alexandria is free for traders of all nations whatsoever  this pharus which is now a part of the main continent was not only divided from it in times past but if we may believe the affirmation of old homer was an island situated at considerable distance hom odys l       midst stormy seas there does an island stand which men call pharus before egypts land so far disjoined that when the brisk winds play on a ships poop the speedy vessel may with swelling sails get thither in a day   the face of nature has been strangely altered since the days of homer and the only reason men can give for this effect is that it has been caused by gradual discharges of the sand brought down by nilus in his annual overflows and so thrown up in heaps between the island and the continent till in the course of time the sea was banished and the whole became firm land as it remains at present  the ancient pharus or egyptian lighthouse once the pharus had a bridge built from it to the shore of egypt and upon a very steep and rugged promontory of the island stood the tower on which the mighty philadelphus built his lighthouse which obtained the honor to be ranked among the worlds seven wonders it took its name of pharos from the place it stood in and has given that old denomination to all those buildings which are raised to hang out lights for the direction of such ships as else would labor in a dangerous darkness  the lake of maroeotis there is a place now called buchatra anciently the lake of maroeotis famous for its depth and even incredible extent which took in water at the yearly overflow and by the means of sluyces of amazing fabric kept it in the whole year round supplying numerous canals of artificial length and breadth beyond belief on which the old egyptians mad with luxury continually delighted to sail up and down in stately barges gilt and painted full of amorous men and women brisk in wantonness and sounding music as their oars divided the complaining waters singing and enjoying all the loose and airy pleasures of a juvenile extravagance  but those canals are now at least the greatest part dried up and lost by everrolling heaps of sand a gloomy labyrinth the lake however still remains but quite deprived of all appearances of that stupendous building which consisted of an intricate and artfull labyrinth that led by many thousand windings dark and dismal to the seven and thirty glorious palaces appointed for the meeting of the seven and thirty jurisdictive powers of that formidable country and at the end whereof we read that there stood once a stately square and wonderfully vast fine marble pyramid supposed to be the sepulcher of king ismandes the original contriver of the lake and labyrinth at least the founder of the pyramid  there is not any thing in alexandria worth the mentioning but some few venerable relics of antiquity which still proclaim with silent eloquence the onceaspiring and unrivaled stateliness which crowned this city with a dazzling majesty  the tomb of alexander the great and first they show the tomb of that brave monarch alexander the great whose body taken from perdiccas by ambitious ptolemy was brought by him to egypt where when he was killed by soldiers in a desert alexanders body was by them conveyed to alexandria and lies entombed in a mean chapel visited but rarely by some curious travelers and held in great esteem by the mahometans themselves who pay a twofold veneration to his memory as a mighty warrior and a holy prophet for tradition tells them he was both while living  josephs granaries another rarity they show most strangers is a very lofty pile of buildings all composed of solid stone but ruined much by natural decay containing many large apartments strangely wild and void of regularity some would persuade us to believe that these were josephs granaries or places which he ordered to be built within the seven years of plenty to preserve the magazines of corn against the following years of famine in those parts  cleopatras palace upon the rising of a hill which overlooks the haven stand the ruins of a spacious and aspiring structure probably the palace of the famous cleopatra whereof remain some pillars yet entire and some few arches of polite contrivance they pretend to show the ruins of a private gallery through which that queen received mark anthony on his return from the defeat at actium  pharaohs needle upon the place where alexanders palace stood of old remain two hieroglyphic obelisks of theban marble one quite fallen the other standing of considerable height and vulgarly distinguished by the name of pharaohs needle  upon a little spot of rising ground without the city walls and on the southwest side there stands a column of a substance much like porphyry in height near seventy foot and five and twenty in circumference it stands upon a cube or pedestal far less in compass than the bottom of the pillar  the conquering caesar here erected this fine column as a memorable trophy of his victory over pompey and left it to posterity as an ambitious monument of his successful conduct but to let men see how vain are their endeavors when opposed by heaven he lost his aim and has instead of triumphing over routed pompey given the vanquished all the honor he himself aspired to gain from future ages by the credit of this victory pompeys pillar for now the christians know the column by no other name than pompeys pillar so that many thousands hear him named who never read or dreamt of such a man as caesar  the martyrdom of st mark at alexandria trajan was emperor of rome when they condemned st mark to suffer martyrdom in alexandria where accordingly they burnt and buried him his bones were afterward removed to venice by the natives of this city who profess that saint as patron of their country there stands a chapel now upon the place where once he lay entombed and near that chapel is a house in which resides the grecian patriarch of alexandria  ceremonies there to be observed by strangers thus much of alexandria scarce worth mentioning but as it is the place all travelers must land at and pay custom for the goods they bring proceeding thence for cairo or rosetta by the virtue of a teskaree or passport from the governor  the christian nations such i mean as trade do here maintain their consuls or subordinate officers to manage the respective interests of their countries the mixed inhabitants of alexandria and the few inhabitants residing there are gathered from all nations under heaven jews indians copties turks and graecians moors armenians french italians zinganees and now and then an englishman there was i think an honest gentleman or two my countrymen when i was there employed in managing the business of our traffic but i staid not there so long as to become acquainted with their characters which i the less desired because in company with some italian gentlemen of an agreeable and airy disposition who accompanied me throughout the country  one thing i must observe that as they are a mixture of all nations so they commonly are found the worst of each and i may very well apply a word or two of juvenals to the inhabitants of alexandria the rather too because it suits the country as adaptly as the people juv sat    rari quippe boni numero vix sunt totidem quot thebarum portae vel divitis ostia nili  virtue is here so rare that men exceed not if you miss the vile the gates of thebes or mouths of fruitful nile   chap xxix of aethiopia and the source of the nile with the cause manner and continuance of its annual inundation before i enter on the subject of the chapter promised by the heads abovementioned twill possibly be needful i should say a word or two to undeceive such gentlemen as by the general title i have given my book may be induced to think i meant to write a full description of the present state of aethiopia in regard to its extent inhabitants and forms of government which though perhaps my opportunities enabled me to do more fully than most former writers yet it would require a length too tedious and digressive from my purpose to enlarge upon that subject  how far the author treats of aethiopia i only mean to speak so far of aethiopia as the country interferes with my discourse upon the source and channel of the river nilus as i have had occasion elsewhere in this book to mention the religion of the persians customs of the tartars and some other points relating to such countries as were widely distant from my purpose and were therefore treated of no farther than they had dependence on or interest in the turkish empire  a discourse of aethiopia however that vast tract of land distinguished amongst christians by the name of aethiopia is not as is commonly believed commanded by the arbitrary nod of one great monarch whom we vulgarly call presler john but by corruption of the genuine word which is no more than prissirjan which in the language of the country signifies renowned or mighty emperor  the government of aethiopia it is true he is possessor of the greatest share of honor and authority having more than thirty tributary princes under his command whose reigns are limited and power created by his undisputed will and sovereign pleasure but there are monarchs wholly as tyrannical and absolute as he nine several kings possess vast territories free and independent on each others government and all these princes so extremely jealous of their neighboring equals and so careful to preserve their own prerogative that they permit no traffic twixt their subjects cautiously preventing with the strictest prohibition all communication whatsoever and condemning to immediate death all subjects of a foreign prince they find amongst them  how divided in their interests and as the interests of these princes are so widely separated so are their professions of religion and morality those under the dominion of the late named prissir jan are christians or at least usurp that title i say usurp because unfortifid by truth or learning they have grossly mingled sordid remnants of their old idolatry with the diviner practices of christian duty  they first received the faith of christ by the industrious labors of the ethiopian eunuch philips convert and retain a dusky and traditional account of the uncertain circumstances of that famous action whereby they are misled to strange opinions widely differing from each others tenets but alike mistaken in the universal end they blindly aim at  and religion some prefer our savior as the greatest person of the trinity some esteem him lowest of the three some believe not in the trinity at all and many ignorantly zealous in their folly still prefer st philips merits to the worth of our redeemer  their character they are a people generally speaking of a slothful disposition obstinate and rash extremely swift to anger and of daring courage when provoked by the temptation of a strong resentment they are jealous to excess and very avaritious temperate in diet nor inclinable to drunkenness they are tall of stature strong in constitution and robust in their proportion and as i said before most resolute defenders of their valued property  why difficult to travel there it is perhaps to their unreasonable hatred of all kind of strangers that the civilized inhabitants of europe owe their ignorance of those remote and darkned corners of the distant world for as they are prohibited by principle to entertain or even preserve the lives of curious travelers it has been hitherto impossible to make discoveries by the endeavors of adventurous men alone or amicable parties and the mighty distance they are at from christian powers the spacious countries interposing their extensive lands the mountains lakes and deserts inaccessible to all approaches were in every age and still continue formidable barriers to the aim of curiosity or efforts of ambition  the princes who have been baffled in the search of the head of nilus it is this alone that was enabled many ages since to baffle the attempts of powerful monarchs men possessed of every help which power and riches could afford their resolution it is this alone that could have foiled the often repeated efforts of egyptian philadelphus or the roman nero it is this alone that could have disappointed the resolved attempts of great cambyses famed sesostris and the macedonian alexander all these princes have at several times endeavored to no purpose an entire discovery of that mysterious sourse of waters so concealed by nature that it seems to speak our very search unlawful and prohibited thus nicely touched by lucan lucan   0 arcanum naturae caput non prodidit ulli nec licuit populis parvum te nile videre amovitque sinus and gentes maluit ortus mirari quam nosse tuos  nature o nile forbids to look on thee where thy faint streams declare thy infancy thy rising fountains she thought fit to shroud and wrapped thy mantled bosom in a cloud thence teaching nations to admire thy stream and choose applause not knowledge for their theme   a discovery of the sourse of nile however if we may believe the confident reports of such egyptians as inhabit countries bordering on aethiopia or indeed such aethiopians themselves as will or dare converse with strangers nilus rises in a great extent of marshy grounds surrounded by prodigious mountains of an almost inaccessible ascent the weeds and rushes so incumbering the uncertain waters that no boat can pass from hill to hill and it is a more than dangerous attempt to venture any other way on so deceitful a foundation yet it is said that some have passed secure and seen a rock of a stupendous magnitude whence gushed a stream of roaring waters with impetuous violence  it is said these marshes lie near twelve degrees beyond the equator and that the nile forsaking his entangled bed is found to wander in maeandring labyrinths quite through prodigious deserts spacious kingdoms and remote dominions sometimes forming wondrous lakes and seeming to forget the order of a river then recovering his spreading waters and continuing a course for many leagues together calm and gentle swelling as he passes on to great increase by the reception of encountring currents all imbibed and carried on in his superior channel every now and then surrounding some delightful piece of ground and making islands pleasant in their situation and agreeably productive of the gayest sweets of aided nature  the course of the river sometimes rolling headlong from a mountainous and rugged country to the valleys under it it forms those loud and dreadful cataracts so famous for the noise created by the waters violently rushing from the lofty precipices and resisting rocks that many authors of antiquity have joined in the reports that such inhabitants as lived too near those horrid waterfalls were by degrees made deaf with their continual roaring  where divided thus this great and celebrated river prosecutes his course through many nations till it enters egypt there grown deep it smoothly runs within its banks in one broad stream till near five miles below grand cairo it becomes divided into two distinct and navigable branches that toward the east discharging all its waters from a mouth at damiata situated on the mediterranean and the western branch the old canopus likewise falling into the abovenamed sea not far below rosetta in the neighborhood of alexandria  five of the seven mouths of nilus now quite lost excepting many channels cut by art for the convenience of letting waters in upon the country in the yearly overflow there now remain but these two branches out of the so often mentioned seven sometimes nine which pliny herodotus ptolemy diodorus siculus and other ancient writers tell the world of they are now if ever such have been choked up by sand or other common accidents which are not seldom known to change the course of rivers in our europaean parts as well as egypt  the rise or increase of nilus but now i come to treat of the surprising inundation which this river causes yearly in the land of egypt where it very seldom rains and when it does it is rather mist and never falls but in the winter season about the midst of june the nile infallibly begins to rise thence swelling by degrees till august following and mounting in that space the height of two or three and twenty cubits  when thus it has increased to a convenient height the grand bashaw of cairo solemnly attended by the best of all his people comes upon the bank and having given with his own hand the warning stroke they cut it through in many places where the water rushes in with an impetuous current overflowing all the country upon either side the river so continuing many days its effects then suddenly decreasing and retiring orderly within its banks leaves all the land before a desert covered richly with a propagative slime of such an admirable virtue that the corn upon abatement of the waters scattered carelessly about the surface constantly produces two good crops and sometimes more with equal plenty and decrease not quite five months the waters take in rise continuance and abatement for about the first or second of november all the country lately deluged is entirely freed from the invading current which is then returned to its ordinary bounds and so continues till the year succeeding  it is a prospect highly pleasant for a stranger to behold a country suddenly overwhelmed and that become a sea which just before appeared a desert men and women briskly rowing up and down still more rejoicing the more deep they find the waters their presages by the rising of the river for from the great or small increase of their presaging nilus they foretell with ease the neverfailing consequence of plenty or a famine  the great advantages accruing to this country from the yearly overflow of nilus being so extremely plain and constant the rejoicings which are made on that occasion are accordingly extravagant for when the banks are cut as i just now informed you all the noblemen attend the great bashaw of cairo to an ancient castle built upon an island in the middle of the river where three days together they are entertained and feasted with the greatest demonstrations of delight imaginable  the public rejoicings made in egypt at the overflow of nilus nor are the common people equal sharers in the blessings of increase less grateful in acknowledging a sense thereof but join unanimously in a course of mirth for many joyful days together forming fireworks singing dancing feasting with their women and employing all their time in one incessant search of pleasure and the constant practice of uninterrupted gayety  now let us search a little into the received opinions of the learned world and see if we can apprehend the cause of this effect so wonderfully different from the common course of gradual nature  euripides opinion of the cause thereof and first we find euripides and many others of opinion it proceeded from prodigious thaws of snow then melted by the sun upon the ethiopian mountains but as we are certainly assured the constant heat of that too sultry climate cannot suffer snow to rest since even in egypt it is never known not even on those mountains which confine her borders so the modern judgment of politer naturalists has quite rejected that mistaken notion  the opinion of thales milesius thales milesivs affirms that he believes the inundation to proceed from the continual blowing of the rough etesian winds which then begin to bluster from the northern quarter full upon the mouth of nilus hindering it thereby to enter the mediterranean and violently driving back the flood upon the low and sandy ground of egypt  the opinion of diodorus siculus but this is controverted by the famous diodorus siculus in his first book who to disprove the argument of thales nominates some other rivers equally exposed to the etesian winds which yet are never liable to such like inundations he therefore in dislike of this opinion has preferred his own that rain or snow disolvd from distant aethiopia is the only cause of an effect so wonderful  the opinion of herodotus directly opposite to these is the assertion of the learned herodotus who imagines that the sun exhaling moisture in a great abundance from the river nilus as he forms his journey in the winter tropic causes it to run in an unnatural narrowness but when advancing toward the northern climates the recovering river swells again with native grandeur then possessing all its streams and flowing uncontrolled with full authority till the returning sun again demands the tribute of its waters  the most received and probable opinion among all these the most received and probable opinion is the first belief of diodorus siculus that the increase of the waters is occasioned by continual rains not melting snow upon the hills of aethiopia and the reasons which are given in defense of this assertion are as follow  its reasons first for many days before the inundation happens all the skies are seen in egypt full of black and treatning clouds incessantly producing rumbling noises and by northern tempests driven fiercely toward the southern parts where always follows rain in great abundance frequently near threescore days together  another reason for this last opinion is the muddy thickness of the waters when they overflow the country for rushing violently through so many tracts of fertile land they tear up great and hourly quantities of fatning soil which mixing thickly with the swelling streams is left upon the scorched and barren sands of egypt of a very deep and slimy substance  many other reasons are by the inhabitants produced to prove the justice and solidity of this accepted modern notion but as tedious observations and unnecessary repetitions grow prolix and heavy on a reader i will say no more upon the present subject than that all the naturalists reputed famous in the eastern countries agree among themselves in full belief of this assertion  the goodness of the water of the nilus i must inform my reader now that as this river boasts peculiar properties in fractifying nations to so rich a plenty so its blessings many other ways are equally particular his waters are observed to be for ever free from mists or vapors sweet to such an admirable and uncommon relish that it is difficult if hoodwinked to distinguish it from milk  how clarified it is famed for many operative virtues in medicinal essays and has but one known fault which is a certain dusky thickness clouding its appearance with a kind of dark unpleasant color which they clarify however in an hour or two by casting into certain earthen pots wherein the water is contained small quantities of bitter almonds bruised on purpose fish by reason of the just named muddiness afford no delicate or pleasant taste and therefore is by strangers seldom eaten and neglected commonly by even the natives of that country  the breadth of nilus when within the bounds of its own natural course is equal to the thames a mile or two below the bridge at london and upon the banks on either side are built small poor and inconsiderable villages inhabited promiscuously by turks and arabs the danger of sailing on the nile those last named so insolently daring and extremely dangerous to unsuspecting travelers who pass in little boats upon the river from grand cairo that they frequently attempt with javelins in their mouths to swim at dead of night from some small creek of the undreaded shore and coming on them unawares kill take or plunder them as they may think convenient  a necessary caution however led of late to think of their own safety by the many fatal accidents which have from time to time attended such as rashly trusted to implored goodfortune and were disappointed of her favors they have found a way to free the passengers of their own country or a foreign one from those presumptious insolences of arabian robbers for at present none attempt a voyage on the nile without providing useful firearms and very frequently a guardian janizary by whose faithful care and honest courage they may be protected safely from those villainous outrages whose effects have often proved unhappy to the headstrong resolutions of unguarded obstinacy so cautious ought a traveller to be who ignorant of danger from an ignorance of custom may unknowingly involve himself and company in the unfeard misfortune of some treacherous swift and unexpected ruin  chap xxx of the government of egypt the history of egypt from the roman conquest in order to inform you of the present state of government in egypt twill be necessary to inquire no further back in ancient history than the times in which the great octavius emperor of rome converted that extensive and subjected kingdom to the meaner title of a roman province which in that condition was enlightened by the glorious rays of introduced christianity from the unwearied labors of st mark who suffered martyrdom as i have said before at alexandria  conquered by the greeks the grecian emperors upon the fatal weakening of the western power by the division of the roman government became the lords of egypt and her people till oppressing them inhumanly by heavy taxes and an arbitrary tyranny they forcibly revolted from their yoke of slavery and in order to expel the greeks authority invited to their aid the hardy saracens  saracens however these about the year of christ six hundred thirty five were beaten from the government they gained in the expulsion of the greeks by the successful arms of omir kinsman and successor to the power of the impostor mahomet and mahometans who satisfied with tribute left them free to the profession of their own religion then fell they under the dominion of the babylonian caliphs  afterward they chose a caliph of their own who was succeeded in a long uninterrupted line of full three hundred years when almeric the sixth king of jerusalem invaded and reduced them to a great extremity  amidst this exigency they entreated succor from the syrians whose designing sultan sent immediately a greater aid than was demanded from him but as soon as they had beat the christians back to their possessions sarco general of the syrian forces murdered basely the egyptian caliph and usurped the kingdom to his own dominion  the original of the circassian mamalukes the mighty saladine succeeded sarco and for the space of seventy six years the syrians held possession of this kingdom till ambitious melecsalhaa jealous of the courage or integrity of his egyptian vassals yearly bought prodigious numbers of circassian slaves from their allies the tartars and depending wholly on their valor and fidelity armed thousands of them till he had completed his designed and numerous army  by the assistance of these bold and hardy men he grew successful in the wars he made upon his foes the christians till at last the slaves too well acquainted with the fatal power wherewith he trusted them ungratefully revolted from their just obedience murdered melecsalhaa and upon the bloody ruins of his broken power erected a new form of government among themselves inviting into egypt all their countrymen or purchasing in every place as many of them as had formerly been taken  thus the government of these revolted slaves became in time extremely powerful dreadful to their enemies and rich in their possessions still maintaining their dominions strongly and with resolution very near three hundred years whereby they grew a famous people and were known by the denomination of circassian mamalukes their overthrow and downfall till sultan selym emperor of the turks in the success of long and bloody wars oerthrew their government and so brought egypt under his subjection  egypt how governed by the turks in the possession of the turks it still remains and is at present governed by a kind of viceroy full possessor of an arbitrary power given him as deputy or great vicegerent to the absolute grand signior he takes his title from the city of grand cairo is the first bashaw of all the turkish empire continues seldom in his government above three years and constantly resides in that imperial city  dependant on the power of this great bashaw are the twelve beys or lords provincial constantly elected from among the natives of the country and assistant in the framing laws and other matters to the grand bashaw who therefore looking on them as inspectors of his actions and set over him as spys or curbers of his inclinations does generally hate and contradict them hence proceed intestine jarrs and frequent tumults not a little prejudicial to the interest of the turkish sultan  the militia of egypt in order to support this power a standing army is established in the turkish manner which consists of twenty thousand horse and eighty thousand foot accomplished hardy and experienced soldiers all dependant on respective zaims or their timariots in the nature treated of at large in the beginning of this book  egypt in its modern divisions the modern egypt is divided into three distinct and spacious provinces that part which lies between rosetta and the famous alexandria is distinguished by the name of hersiah that part which lies between grand cairo tunese and damiata is now called marhemha and the land which lies upon the south of cairo is in turkish called saihid  the humor of the people these different provinces produce inhabitants as different in their natures some are rougher than the rest and more uncivilizd in common conversation but it is a general observation that the nearer to the port of alexandria or the sea about it so much more polite is found the humor of these people  their justice the military power is in egypt as at constantinople mixed entirely with the civil administration and the laws of both exactly copied from the turkish government so that neither in religion customs habit or the forms of justice can be found the smallest difference from what i have explained in the foregoing part relating to the turkish policy it is money only arbitrary eloquent persuasive money can prevail in egypt as it ever does in europaean turkey to decide a contest  their superstition the many graces which in former times enriched the minds of their illustrious ancestors are all forgotten but to show how prone mans nature is to ill they still retain their ancient superstition and though they do not practice the abolished ceremonies of a rank idolatry they yet impute such power to every little accident or work of nature that they tread as near as possible in the detested footsteps of those old egyptians whom the roman satyrist has well derided in the following verses juv sat    quis nescit volusi bithynice qualia demens aegyptus portenta colat crocodilon adorat pars haec illa pavet saturam serpentibus ibin effigies sacri nitet aurea cercopitheci dimidio magicae resonant ubi memnone chordae atque vetus thebe centum jacet obruta portis illic coeruleos hic piscem fluminis illic oppida tota canem venerantur nemo dianam porrum and cepe nefas violare ac frangere morsu o sanctas gentes quibus haec nascuntur in hortis numina lanatis animalibus abstinet omnis mensa nefas illic foetum jugulare capellae carnibus humanis vesci licet who knows not what fond worship and vain praise mad egypt to prodigious monsters pays this part the crocodile a godhead makes that honors frightful ibis fed with snakes there golden images of monkeys shine and sacred worship crowns the apish shrine where magic spells make halfleft memnon sound and ancient thebes now lies a ruined ground thebes which twice fifty gates did once surround here seafish there the river fish they own to dogs whole cities bow but to diana none a wondrous wickedness indeed to eat a sacred leek or make an onion meat o blessed people in whose gardens grow these gods to whom such wondrous helps you owe from woolly animals each board abstains to kill a kid pollutes their soul with stains yet none by conscience led from humane flesh refrains   the effects of misery the miserable poverty whose ill effects have crushed the spirits of the warlike graecians and subverted valor to contented slavery has worked so deeply on the humble minds of the depressed egyptians that they daily more and more become effeminate neglecting meanly the once loved practices of martialdiscipline and idly sinking in a stupifid forgetfulness of all the calls of liberty or honor  their character they are very lazy proud and insolent in carriage dirty in their dress and stiff in their behavior haters and despisers of all other countries scarce affording love to one another and so very nasty in their tents or houses that the very entrance is offensive to a christian stranger  the egyptian moors there are besides the offspring of the old egyptians certain tawny natives of this land a sunburned mongrel kind of race descended from the arabs and in strength of body humor shrilness of their speech and great agility not much unlike them for distinctionsake these men are called the moors of egypt but are commonly more honestly inclined than are their numerous copartners in that wide denomination  their government a copy of the turkish the towns of egypt are not many and those few they have but ill defended rather trusting to the number of their people than the strength of walls or tedious helps of modern fortification each town and village has its governor and as i said before the nature of their government is so entirely turkish that i need no longer dwell upon the subject of this chapter but will hasten in the next to look a little into the condition of their learning and morality and see if we can trace the footsteps of their great forefathers in the modern applications of their lost posterity  chap xxxi of the learning and morals of the egyptians egypt in her present ignorance a proof of humane frailty the curious searcher into humane changes and the various miseries attending life can never find a fairer proof of sublunary frailty than he has before him in a nice reflection on the present state of the egyptian learning egypt which of old possessed unbounded knowledge and unlimited dominion egypt which outtowrd not only the felicity but even the imitation of admiring neighbors egypt from whose source of wisdom greece originally drew those channels from whose unexhausted store she afterward supplied the spacious universe egypt the neglected mother of our arts and sciences is now involved in stupid ignorance and boasts no more than that unpolished common sense we owe promiscuously to liberal nature  the black effects of time and discord have amazingly subverted ancient splendour and the glorious state of learning which in former ages flourished in this country left her with the blessings of that wealthy peace she once could boast of knowledge fell a victim to the sword and the destruction which befell them was so very universal not alone to power but even the well established principles of literature and morality that when i think upon the ruin of the old egyptians who survived the loss of all worth living for and then fell lastly solitary victims to their nations enemies it brings to my remembrance the expressions seneca thought fit to use upon the fate of priamus in his tragedy of troas sen trag troas  felix priamus felix quisquis bello morions omnia secum consumpta videt  o happy priamus and happy all who when in war they die in one destructive fate see all things with them lie   the origin of the egyptian ignorance the gloomy cloud of unaspiring sloth and dull stupidity which now possesses fallen egypt hence received its fatal origin and ever since has skreend the sun of banished learning from that miserable country nor has even the most retired and private state of life escaped the general calamity which spread its influence with an uncontrolled and universal ruin  and indeed it is a vain and groundless hope for an unthinking man to flatter his opinion with the strange belief of even a possibility to live contented in a sinking government or stand unshockd in the destruction of his country though the share he boasted in the management thereof was never so small or inconsiderable or even though the trifling part he acted in its welfare was so far from helping to support the state that he appeared the most unknown and useless member of his nation  the admirable solon an unequalled former of the wisest laws and consequently an undoubted judge in rules of policy has left us his opinion on the matter in the eloquent expressions following solons opinion of a public ill     when publickills do commonwealths impair each private subject feels a public share no barring gates can its effects exclude over highest walls it climbs and will intrude still it oertakes you if to shades you fly and finds you though in latent beds you lie   sciences invented by the old egyptians the old egyptians first invented music and geometry with the useful knowledge of arithmetic they first inspected heaven and bravely traced the sun and stars through their diurnal motions they first divided years by months and from a knowledge of the various aspects of caelestial constellations grew diviners of portended consequences philosophy and the transporting flights of a poetic harmony were first known there  hieroglyphics what they were mechanic arts though since improved were numerously owing to the deep invention of egyptian fancy hieroglyphics used instead of characters explained the meaning of the wisest thoughts by silent images of various kinds whereby they strangely represented humane nature in its different passions with a very still but moving eloquence  but now the very memory of these perfections is itsself forgotten by the deviated souls of the possessors of this country in its modern state of folly pride and insolence and all an author is enabled to inform the world of the condition of their learning is that they have really none among them no learning in egypt now it is a wonder if in many villages of egypt well inhabited ten men are found who boast capacity to read or write my reader will not therefore be surpised when i assure him that for any more refined and elevated kind of knowledge they are altogether strangers to the very notion of its usefullness  nor can i give their morals a much fairer character than i have justly fixed upon their learning morality is commonly the good effect of honest thoughts produced by some improvement of the mind in serious contemplation on the worth of virtue and the only way to reach the power of so bright a contemplation is by aiming at as great a share of common knowledge as we can with ease attain in humble stations why morality is seldom found in egypt it is not therefore probable or possible that these egyptians void by the tyrannic and oppressive constitution of their government of any means to reach such practice nor indeed desirous by the bent of inclination to endeavor after it should ere attain the happy end it constantly produces  i have in the preceding chapter spoke in general of their obvious principles the less will therefore serve me here since i can only use the same expressions or at least in other words declare the same assertion should i now enlarge upon the shallow subject the egyptians very covetous i will therefore only add that they are avaritiously inclined almost beyond a parallel and as desirous eagerly of growing rich will scruple nothing to obtain the blessing hence it will be an easy thing to guess how far from virtue honesty or justice lies the course they darkly steer in  nam dives qui fieri vult et cito vult fieri sed quae reverentia legum quis metus aut pudor est unquam properantis avari for he who has on riches bent his mind would still to wealth a speedy passage find but what respect to laws what fear or shame restrains the eager wretch who does at avarice aim   i hasten from a subject melancholy in its truth and thence oppressive and a clog upon my fancy but alas we find no part of earth but has sometimes experienced rugged changes and our own examples may convince us daily that the scourge of fortune triumphs frequently in other parts as well as egypt  chap xxxii of the beasts birds and serpents of egypt among the numerous observations travelers may make in egypt of a thousand things peculiar to that country none deserves remark more justly than the virtue it can boast of in producing creatures as uncommon and particular as are the many artificial rarities they have in every age been famous for  the hippotamus or seahorse and first to mention none of those more common animals which may be found promiscuously in almost every country the hippotamus or sea horse of old more frequently observed about the river nilus than in later times for pliny herodotus diodorus siculus and many other authors have described them in their writings some of which have authorized their full descriptions by their own eyewitness  described but at present it is a curiosity not often met with to obtain an opportunity of seeing any of these creatures they have heads of a prodigious size their jaws of very large extent and full of tusks in color not unlike the whitest ivory but sharp as needles and their bite of very dangerous consequence to wounded passengers  their strength and fierceness in shape they differ not extremely from a boar but are so much beyond him in proportion that we seldom see an ox of greater magnitude their color is a dusky brown and all their backs so armed with scales of an impenetrable substance that the sharpest weapons seldom wound them they are commonly of such a fierce vindictive nature that they rarely fail to turn with violence upon a boat when any in it have attempted to ensnare them and have oftentimes been known to rear themselves stupendiously above the water and by overturning vessels prey upon the mariners they thence grew masters of  the river bull there is another beast of an amphibious nature commonly distinguished by the name of river bull not much beyond a calf in bigness nor unlike him in appearance only so superior in the strength of body that the spacious nets the natives make of twisted ropes have often proved too weak to hold him they have finns upon their feet which spread at bottom to considerable breadth and serve as guides to their unweildy motions which by plunging forward with an unresisted violence break fiercely through the strongest obstacles  the crocodile the treacherous crocodile so called from a traditional account that this deceitful animal commands his tears at any season and by counterfeiting a complaining human voice allures the curiosity of passers by and then devours them is very common on the banks of nile and ever has been looked upon peculiar to the land of egypt the shape exactly like a lizard is so fully known in europe that it is needless here to say much of it  their natures their nature is oviparous and when they lay their eggs they hide them in the sand with such an admirable cunning that the overflowing of the river nilus never reaches them though frequently it comes within a yard or two and hence the country people finding now and then their artfull nests are taught how high the inundation will advance the waters in that increase a turkeys egg is equal to the crocodiles if not superior in its pristine magnitude but afterward they grow to such amazing length and size that many have been found eleven yards long and in their bulk proportionable  the common notion entertained in egypt is that every female crocodile can lay one hundred eggs and that their age has often reached the hundredth year  their way of catching men their tails are very long and sharpning to the end whereby they constantly entwine and seize their prey and it is a very dangerous thing for travelers who pass the nile in open boats to sleep with heads inclined upon the side for these observant creatures gather frequently about the vessel watching cautiously some favorable opportunity which when they spy they swim up close upon the surface of the water and enfolding the unwary person by a sudden throwing out their tails have often so unhappily succeeded as to draw him headlong from the vessel and devour him in the river  how taken the natives of the country bait sharp iron hooks of mighty magnitude and sometimes take them they esteem their flesh of savory relish and as such will seldom scruple eating it but as this creature is extremely hurtful on the water playing on its surface in a moonlight night so he is no less destructive on the land by day for then he generally wanders up and down in search of mischief preying on whatever he can meet with  how to be avoided they are mighty swift at running in a line but having only one continued joint along their back are tedious in a motion circular or any ways uneven and thereby with ease avoided by a man acquainted with the country and their nature oftentimes they lie a foot or two below the surface in the places whence the peasants living on the banks of nilus fetch their water and have sometimes seized a man or woman by the arm and drawn them in but to prevent such dangers for the future the egyptians generally take the pains at present to secure their watering places by a kind of hedge which they support with stakes and so protect themselves from these designing animals who have been long so hated by the prejudiced inhabitants that they have used a thousand arts to compass their destruction and it is not common now to see a crocodile within the space of some days journey from the city of grand cairo  a wonderful observation of the crocodile and little bird it is observable that there is found in egypt though but rarely known a little bird about the bigness of a common quail its color of a lightish gray the bill extremely sharp and small and both the wings containing feathers at the end whereof are certain prickles not unlike the bristles of a hog this bird as often as she finds the crocodile lie basking in the sun and slumbering as he often does upon the banks of nilus with his mouth wide open flies directly in and fixing near his teeth erects her prickly wings not much unlike a porcupine or hedge hog so preventing him from closeing his great mouth upon her while she feeds herself by picking somewhat from his teeth the bird was formerly more taken notice of than she has been of late and commonly distinguished by the name of trochileus  ichneumon or the river rat but while the crocodile diverted by a kind of tickling pleasure which the pecking bill of the bird trochileus affords him gapes considerably wider than he generally does the river rat a little beast about the bigness of a ferret clean in shape in color black and of a skin extremely smooth his teeth long sharp and very numerous his tail of an uncommon length his legs but short and ears of a peculiar roundness of a nature very bold and fierce beyond example this small beast i say who bears a strong antipathy to the abovenamed crocodile observing narrowly the tempting opportunity comes slily round jumps through his mouth and with a wondrous swiftness passing down his throat gnaws forcibly a passage through his belly thence escaping with the triumph of a sure destruction to his mortal enemy  its fierceness and great hatred to other creatures this river rat is sometimes called ichneumon which appears to have been anciently the name by which he was distinguished by the curious and more learned egyptians then inhabiting the country he is found in they are of a mischievous nature killing all the pigeons hens and poultry they can possibly find means to get at cats and dogs they hate extremely and will kill as often as they conquer them nor ever fail assaulting them as often as they find convenient opportunity but as in some things they are hurtful to the interests of the people so in many others they appear not only useful but even necessary for the good they do by seeking constantly the eggs of crocodiles and breaking them when they discover where they lie as also for their universal hatred to all kinds of serpents snakes or reptiles whatsoever whom they often fall upon and kill with wonderful dexterity  moral reflections how wisely and beyond the apprehension of our weak capacities has the supreme creator of our earthly beings guided the performances of his divine omnipotence to what an height of piety and necessary contemplation on the bounties and omniscience of almighty god must that man needs arrive who seriously reflects upon the numerous works of his creation yet amongst so many millions of surprising differences and directly opposite existences in nature cannot find one needless insect but perceives them strangely mixed together in the joint advancement of one common interest  the chamaelions in many orchards near grand cairo may be found great numbers of those creatures called chamaelions falsely said to live upon the air which notwithstanding is indeed their principal subsistence though they prey continually on flies and extend their tongue with wonderful celerity which is in length not much inferior to his body naturally hollow in its top whereby he may more easily attain his ends and serve himself in the destruction of the late named insects with a little trouble  described in shape and size they are not much unlike the lizard their eyes and head extremely large their necks unjointed and of consequence not moved without the turning their whole bodies its native color is a greenish yellow with small spots of white about the belly they are seen with difficulty though you pass at little distance from them for they constantly assume the color of most places which they stand upon and generally change their hue as often as they find occasion to remove their station  their antipathy to serpents these also bear an innate enmity to every kind of serpent and it is remarkable that when they have discovered any sleeping underneath a tree they never rest till having climbed the branches they direct a little shining drop of moisture from their mouths exactly on his head which by a certain natural virtue it possesses never fails to give immediate death to the unwary serpent so invaded  the ostrich i must not here omit the ostrich though but very rarely found unless in the remoter and more inland parts of egypt it is a bird of mighty size long neck and feet with head and every other part of shape extremely near the pictures which we draw to represent them how hunted they have wings of spacious size yet fly but heavily so near the ground that it is an entertainment very pleasant and not seldom used for gentlemen to hunt them with a kind of spears on foot for the resistance awkard motions and unweildy flight they make afford their hunters an agreeable amusement  an eater of iron but the most remarkable peculiar and surprising property the ostrich boasts of is that he not only eats but even digests the hardest iron picking up with pleasure broken horseshooes rusty nails and many other things especially at certain seasons of the year when they incline i know not for what reason to take more delight than usual in the swallowing that metal and hater of women pregnant it is a thing worth notice that from certain hidden dictates of directing nature ostriches are led to an abhorrence of a woman big with child and it is a certain truth from a repeated observation that they are not only sensible when such a person is brought near them but will make directly toward her and with lifted feet endeavor to oblige her to withdraw or patiently submit to their unwelcome violence  the salamander the salamander famous for resisting fire is in egypt often found but it is a false and groundless notion that he lives in flames but probably that old mistake first took its rise from something that appeared like reason how resisting fire for a certain cold and mucous substance full of moisture is the only flesh that creature boasts of who when put upon the fire can emit a certain quantity of black and slimy matter which extinguishes for some short time the coals about him but by that time he has once or twice repeated the experiment he becomes exhausted and is forced to yield his body to the irresistible invasion of the flames he lies in  the basalisk or cockatrice the famous serpent called a basilisk or in our vulgar english tongue distinguished better by the name of cockatrice does still remain in many parts of inmost egypt but was falsely by the ancients said to be possessed of such a penetrative venom that his very look gave present death to every man he fixed his eyes upon whose subtle poison lucan thus describes among the many noxious serpents cato met with in his march with the brave roman army through the sands of africa lucan lib   sibilaque effundens cunctas terrentia pestes ante venena nocens late sibi submovet omne vulgus and in vacua regnat basiliscus arena the basilisk whose dreadful hisses fright all other serpents into distant flight whose subtle venom humane life confounds nor needs a touch but kills before it wounds drives meaner snakes from his frequented plains and on the empty sands in frightfull horror reigns   why said to kill with a look but those which now are called the basilisks of egypt are not so extremely dangerous as the abovenamd poet chose to represent them yet it is certain that they bear a kind of natural malignity about them which affects a man though at a considerable distance with a strange uneasiness but whether seated in their eyes or caused by the effluviums of their noxious bodies does not come within my purpose and is therefore left to the opinion of the reader  the asp described the asp another hurtful serpent is in many parts of egypt dangerously known a small black creature running swiftly and is generally found within the hollow places of a rock or rotten root of some decaying tree their bite is mortal and the death they give attended frequently by various symptoms but overtaking all he bites with equal swiftness some die laughing others weeping many sleeping but this last effect should seem to be the most peculiar to the asps of old since lucan thus describes the nature of that serpent lucan lib   hic quae prima caput movit de pulvere tabes aspida somniferam tumida cervice levavit plenior huic sanguis and crassi gutta veneni decidit in nulla plus est serpente coactum here the sleepcausing asp with swelling head rose first from poysonmingled atoms bred full of the thickest blood gorgon over libya spread nor amongst the many snakes which thence did spring can one be found who boasts a more envenomed sting   a story of a gentleman bit by an asp some years ago an english gentleman residing at aleppo and in company with many merchants belonging to the factory there established went a hunting and amongst an heap of stones upon the sand perceived an asp run swiftly to its hole which fatally mistaking for a little squirrel he immediately alighted from his horse and thrusting in his arm as far as it would go felt something sharper than he thought to meet withal and drawing out his hand upon a sudden brought the asp still hanging by the teeth upon his middle finger the immediate exclamations of the gentlemen in company obliged him presently to shake it off but all in vain the poison had affected him too deeply and though with much ado they got him on his horse he strait grew mad laughed wept and fainted by successive turns till they had brought him home to his unhappy family where instantly he died by the unfortunate event of this lamented accident  chap xxxiii of the cities of grandcairo memphis and babylon the venerable marks of mighty age declare the towns i am about to speak of children of antiquity nor did they only flourish when the world was young but were from time to time the glorious scenes whereon were represented the prodigious sallies of ambition starting suddenly to universal empire then as suddenly declining from its pinnacle and yielding fortune for a transitory spurt to the possession of some other rising monarchy  the changes which have happened in grand cairo memphis and babylon twas hence that these renowned and stately cities have successively beheld the haughty pharaohs and luxurious ptolemies the roman caesars and profuse extravagance of the unhappy cleopatra have beheld em swollen above mortality with elevated pomp and splendid royalty and after all the triumphs of a shortlived grandeur seen em sink the miserable victims to some sudden strange and unexpected ruin  twas here of old that the almighty hand of god himself performed such miracles twas here the hardened heart of pharaoh drew down vengeance on his tortured nation twas here the israelites were chained in long captivity and in returning hence their great redeemer proved his power by dividing seas to let them pass and guiding them alternately by clouds and fiery pillars through the numerous dangers of a tedious pilgrimage  this train of wonders and amazing scene of human changes were in ancient times transacted here the decay these   cities and the abovenamed cities which so many ages have withstood the shocks of time or accident and gloriously outlived the frequent downfalls of unnumbred rulers now begin to sink themselves and prove by slow though sure experience that the strange vicissitudes of earthly strength involve alike the prince and peasant town and hovel in a dark oblivion  cairo now the best cairo is the only city of the three which now retains the smallest mark of an unruind majesty and has its situation near four hundred miles from alexandria upon the eastern side of nilus not above twelve furlongs distant from the river  bowlac the port to cairo the boats which commonly bring passengers to cairo land em at bowlac a small port town supported by the trade the river brings her where a sort of tax or imposition by the way of poll is laid on every christian traveller who comes on shore amounting to about a crown a head and here it is that we are all obliged to hire a nimble kind of asses with their owners running by on foot to carry us to cairo a barbarous baseness of the turks at cairo where the reader may take notice that the barbarous insolence and blinded zeal of the rude turks inhabiting the place oblige all christians who would ride about the city to be mounted on those creatures in a strange derision of our blessed saviors choice who rode upon an ass when the transported multitude saluted him as he advanced with the repeated acclamation of hosanna to the highest  the town and its extent the town is built about the foot of a large mountain called muchaat extremely rocky and extends its buildings in a semicircular form above half round it it is walled but ill and taking in the suburbs which are very large is so prodigiously extensive that the measured compass has been found full sixty two italian miles  description of the houses and manner of their building streets the streets are crooked long and narrow all the houses those excepted which the turks have built of later years of solid stone and many stories high their roofs are flat and open in the top with artificial neatness to let in the breezes which at certain seasons of the day regale the air with comfortable coolness the streets are every night locked up at either end by welldefended gates at each whereof is kept a guard of able watchmen so that all the mischiefs of nocturnal robberies are here prevented by the visible impossibility that thieves would find to get away if they should chance to be discovered  the gates of grand cairo the high street is of a considerable breadth extending from the gate naufrei to that they call zueelia the first admitting you from the great road which leads to the red sea the last directly fronting nilus and bowlac the ancient town i lately spoke of these two gates confine the length of this extensive city  a pleasant lake another gate distinguished by the name of futulee which opens on the northern side directly leads you to a spacious lake called esbikee that in the overflow of nilus is supplied with water and frequented while it is so by the painted barges of the gentlemen of cairo shaded over with the greenest boughs and rowing up and down with wine and music in delightful pastime but when nilus is decreased and all the water dried within the lake it changes its appearance to another scene and by affording corn in plentiful production yields a prospect equally agreeable  some other gates besides these three chief gates are many other for convenience of free egress and regress through the city but as those are only portals for a private use not public ostentation they deserve not the unnecessary trouble of remarks upon their number forms or situation  their way of darkening the streets the sun is here so greatly incommodious that to skreen the city from its power they commonly place rafters cross their streets and cover them with mats which by preventing the abovenamed inconveniency is found to cause another nigh as bad for by excluding the sunbeams from shining on them they are forced to walk as in the dark in many places where the narrowness of streets and jetting form of all their buildings added to the dullness they are cloakd in by the matts and rafters join together in a close alliance to keep out the day and cloud the houses even at noon with the unpleasant veil of counterfeited midnight  wooden locks and keys one thing deserves remark among the many others which a stranger may observe in cairo that is they have so excellent an art in working upon wood that all the locks and keys they use about their houses are of a hard kind of tree in color blacker than the box and in its substance far more hard and doubly durable  the streets are all unpavd and full of sand and many lakes of half a mile or sometimes more in compass scattered every here and there about the city which with certain wells of no small depth or number serve the people with the water fit to be employed in common uses such as washing houses cooling streets or such like purposes water brought on camels backs but as for what they drink it is brought on camels backs from nilus that abovenamd being neither clear nor sweet enough for that nice purpose  a noble market place directly in the center of this spacious city stands a building not unlike the besesteen or vaulted marketplace i spoke of in the chapter of constantinople and designed exactly for the same occasion hither flock vast numbers of all kinds of people who would purchase any thing of value for it is here they may be sure to meet with what they search for and it is observable in cairo that they never mingle trades together but appoint the men of each profession rows of shops by one another every one whereof must shut his doors at five a clock in the evening the cooks alone excepted who by reason of their common usefullness few families in cairo dressing their own meat are suffered to continue open till whatever hour they think convenient  pleasant gardens within the walls of cairo are vast numbers of delightful orchards gardens and the like in which are ever growing most delicious fruits of almost every kind but apples which are here but very rarely met withal their oranges and limons almonds dates and many other sorts do here arrive to such mature perfection that i never tasted them so richly pleasant in another country  their bagnios and hospitals their public buildings are both numerous and stately bagnios in grandcairo fall not short of those i mentioned to be built at constantinople and the rich endowments of not only those but hans or hospitals for several uses are so very splendidly increased in this egyptian city that they cannot be exceeded by the buildings of their kind in any part of the grand signiors empire  mosques an incredible number their mosques are so magnificent in structure and prodigious in the number commonly reported that twoud perhaps be thought a falsehood should i tell my reader what my guides told me that they surpass in costliness of building all the royal mosques of constantinople and are so extremely numerous that they are reckoned almost twenty thousand  both these opinions i believe untrue though i perceived that in the first they have not stretched veracity to any great degree but in the second i presume they have made full amends though all a traveller can do is only to pursue the dictates of a reasonable probability when he directs his judgment on that point since they are really so stupendous in their number that it is morally impossible for any single man to know exactly  the great mens palaces the great mens palaces are very stately and have large courtyards before em opening to the street with wooden gates of an uncommon magnitude they have a very insolent and idle custom here to pull a christian from his ass as he rides by the house of any turkish officer of note and make him walk till he is passed the wall in token of submission and a mute acknowledgment of inferiority  cairo very populous this famous city is so very populous though of so vast a magnitude that as we rode along the streets about the center we were so extremely crowded that our guide who went before with a long pole and cleared the way by crying out bdaharack adamlerr bdaharack that is make room good people pray make room had much ado to open us a passage  the castle of grand cairo upon a very steep and lofty precipice upon the southern side of cairo stands the castle where resides the grand bashaw in pompous state becoming his degree attended by a chosen guard of turkish janissaries here on the three first days of every week they hold divan at which the grand bashaw is always present and administers their justice as they practice their religion both in imitation of the settled forms and ceremonious customs of the turkish government established as before described at their metropolis constantinople  its ascent and prospect this castle is to be ascended but by one way only which is hewn with admirable art and labor from the solid rock and twining round permits a horseman easily to mount its summit it is of vast extent divided in the ancient manner into courts and squares which seem to have been formerly designed for warlike exercises  and prospect hence the city may with ease be overlooked from any of the walls which are all built of massy stone upon the rock it self and entered by a port amazingly secured with iron gates and leading to the castle by strange intricate and winding passages  fine relics of antiquity of old the mighty sultans of the brave egyptian mamalukes resided here in all the grandeur empire could afford em and though sultan selym the victorious turk defaced its ornaments in many places yet there still remain such towering piles and marble columns of so strange a bulk and workmanship so excellent that they to this day show a thousand proofs of regal majesty and that prodigious stateliness wherewith it flourished in its old magnificence  an hieroglyphic obelisk directly in the midst of a large court upon the backside of this castle stands an ancient hieroglyphic obelisk near nineteen foot in height whereon are represented such distinguishable figures as do plainly prove it to have been placed there by the ptolemies in commemoration of the victories they had obtained in war and the surprising grandeur in whose bliss they flourished  several ruins near grand cairo there are not many relics of antiquity at present to be seen in cairo besides this castle there remain the ruins of some famous palaces but so disguised by their decay that travelers can only guess at what they were when many ages since they proudly flourished  the place where moses was found by pharaohs daughter they show such strangers notwithstanding as are curious in their searches many things worth observation and among the rest a certain bank upon the side of nilus where they say of old king pharaohs daughter found young moses on a bed of rushes  the etymoligy of the word cairo the etymology of cairo is from the arabian in which language el caiairo signifies a forcer as to the original foundation founder and historical account of this extensive city scaliger and leo africanus with a hundred other authors have so fully treated on those subjects that i cannot judge it necessary to enlarge on such notorious circumstances  it only then remains that i should mention the condition of the people now inhabiting grand cairo whom we found in rolling plenty and the blessed possession of the richest smiles of providential nature trading greatly and increasing wealth with wonderful dexterity the plenty of that city nor can provisions of all kinds be any where more reasonably sold than in the wellstord markets of this spacious city  a way of hatching eggs in ovens among a thousand other customs in some kind peculiar to the people of grand cairo they have got a way of hatching eggs by artificial heat which they perform by building certain rows of ovens of considerable depth which they contrive on either side a room one row above another within these ovens they take care to lay a kind of course rough hemp on which they spread a mat and cover it with camels dung or that of pigeons to considerable thickness so that by preserving artful heats by constant fires within the stoves built under the abovenamed ovens they continue from the month of june to the declining of december to produce vast quantities of chickens from innumerable thousands of these eggs which notwithstanding are observed to fall far short of natures unassisted efficacy  the inhabitants of cairo famous for instructing beasts i could not help observing here that the inhabitants of cairo seem possessors of a quicker genius than our western people in the arts of teaching wonderful performances to asses goats dogs horses mules or any other creatures void of reason  a story of a goat i have been shown a man who kept a goat so dextrous in the poizing his instructed body that he could not only stand upright upon a little staff ten inches long but climbed with ease from one to stand upon another and proceeded without falling from that second to a third fourth fifth or more till he who owned him was no longer capable of adding to the height by one staff more  a pleasant story of a fiddler and his ass a merry kind of fellow of a moorish extract used to walk about the city with a sort of fiddle and divert the passers by with the repeated airs of one dull tune and in return for this it is true he did not beg reward yet by a subtle stratagem came off so well that he succeeded generally better than a downright beggar could have reasonably hoped for  the ingenious fellow kept an ass that always followed him from street to street without the trouble of his leading him along he carried on his back a little budget which contained provisions and the necessary utensils his master wanted in his daily journeys  an ass of good address every man the fiddler met he bowed his body to by way of information that he hoped for the receipt of a small piece of money from his grateful liberality and still as often as the fiddler bowed the ass bowed too as he had been instructed in so strange a manner and an air so truly like himself that all who passed the streets were moved to laughter and not seldom gentlemen have given the man a present for the pleasure they received from the surprising prospect of his asses novelty who constantly with such another cringe returned the compliment  a cunning practice but if it chanced that any man passed by regardless of the fidlers music or request nor thought it worth his while to pay him for his harmony the ass who cunningly came on behind at a considerable distance and observed all passages but yet pretended not to mind em watched their coming and took care to snap a piece from off the britches of the unsuspecting person or if he went by at too great distance on the other side the way he frequently turned back and bit out his revenge as soon as he had overtaken him this pleasant humor of the fiddler and his ass became at last so very noted that both the masters profit and the great respect they showed the beast grew daily more and more for really twas a dangerous accident to meet em in the street for such as happened to be unprovided of a charm to soften his resentment  another trick they have of getting money is by training camels up to dance about the streets upon the sounding of a drum or any other instrument of music this they do with admiraabe quickness in the manner following  their way of teaching camels to dance they make a large square hollow place on some stone pavement not unlike a bath of such a depth that nothing let down thither can get out again but with the same assistance he was first put in by under this paved floor consisting purposely of well experienced firestone is built a furnace into which they put a necessary quantity of wood and heating it to what degree they please the stones grow hot like some mild oven  then they put the poor meek camel into this square hollow heated as it is and standing round the edges of the place begin to sound their drums or other instruments continuing so to do while the vnhoofd and tenderfooted camel all impatient of the heat first draws up one leg then another changing swifter as the heat increasing burns his feet with greater anguish till at last he rears himself an end and capers nimbly on his hinder feet as if he strove to imitate a dancer  a lazy kind of living on the labors of a beast thus they use him till by frequent practice the unwellcome smart has made impression on the creatures memory at which time they begin to lead him up and down the city where at certain corners of the noted streets they suddenly strike up the tunes they used to play which the poor beast no sooner hears but dreading the hotstones he formerly was wont to feel when he had heard such music he begins to dance and skip about with strange agility which soon becomes not only easy but even natural to his performance and is daily practiced by him to divert the common people who assemble in great crowds to see the sport and pay the owner a small sum by voluntary contribution  the ancient memphis the ancient memphis which has been by many authors falsely thought the city now grand cairo was of old the residence of egypts monarchs flourishing in all the grandeur wealth and royalty could crown her sons with here they kept their apis and had once a stately temple sacred to his worship here also stood the glorious temple of the goddess venus and a thousand noble monuments of power and antiquity all buried now and only showing their defaced and broken relics great in ruin and amazingly majestic in those heaps of dust wherein now lie confusedly mingled marble pillars stately towrs and battered statues of prodigious workmanship  why so called this ancient city took the name of memphis from the daughter of king ogdo whom the poets feign to have been ravished by egyptian nilus in the form of a large bull its situation it stood about five miles to the southeast of the so celebrated pyramids of egypt and not above two miles full west of nilus distant from grand cairo sixteen miles or somewhat over  babylon of egypt why so named not distant far from the south side of cairo lie the ruinated ruins of egyptian babylon which took that ancient name from certain babylonian colonies who here assembling joined their parties in one body and solicited a license from the king of egypt to lay out a considerable sum of money in the purchase of a spot of ground whereon to build a place of habitation  they obtained a grant from the then reigning ptolemy for the possession of the land on which they built the town i lately called according to its old denomination babylon which now has changed its name to that of misulhetic and is known to all the people of this country by the last named appellation which i think may claim arabian etymology  the ruins of a stately cistern among the numerous ruins whose confused appearances amuse a traveller there is at babylon the broken remnant of a spacious cistern formerly a mighty and stupendous labor and receiving water from the river nilus to supply the castle lately mentioned through a very strong and artful aquaeduct supported on some hundreds of the loftiest arches stone could build or resolution finish nor has time prevailed so much as yet but that it is repaired to a condition which enables it to serve a little for the ancient uses to whose necessary practice its wellmeaning founders first designed it  the magazines which joseph built in egypt not far from hence stand certain vast unweildy structures of prodigious height and antique figure all supported by a number of huge buttresses and seeming to remain in that strange form they bear to tell the modern world how their deceased forefathers built before em we were told by the egyptians that these venerable piles were those seven granaries or public magazines which joseph built at the command of pharaoh to preserve the product of the seven years plenty which preceeded as long time of dreadful famine repairs have fitted one or two for the same use at present but the rest are so exposed to the inclemencies of weather that they cannot be employed in such a service  the wonderful extent and prospect of egyptian ruins there is not in the world a more uncommon mortifying scene than egypt represents to every stranger for above the space of eighteen miles on either side the river nilus in this part of that depopulated country where you cannot sail a hundred fathoms but you must discover if you look about you the afflicting marks of misery and desolation ancient turrets have disrobed their tops of that aspiring grandeur which their youth once boasted of and hoary age has whitened the remainder of their craggy relics with a melancholy aspect heaps of dirt have buried palaces and every here and there appears the halfsunk capital or basis of some noble pillar those prodigious masterpieces of elaborate art which once supported the resplendent roofs of glittering courts and palaces of princes now lie low in rough obscurity nor are so much as seen by passengers while covered with the grass which flourishing in the destruction of such stately pieces seems to spread with a malicious pride and triumph in their downfall  moral reflections on the worlds uncertainty oh blind wilful vain mistaken man unthinking weak and shadowlike mortality why do we still grasp eagerly at riches why esteem the transitory blessings of a wealthy splendour why delight in worldly grandeur or the noisy pomp of momentary majesty when not the stony scenes of ancient pride and countenanced vainglory can preserve the memory of their forgotten founders but the stongest and most stately cities of the universe submit their marble to the teeth of time and prove in ruins the undoubted truth of ovids elegant reflections on the worlds uncertainty ovid met l     sic tempore verti cernimus atque illas assumere

name   now let us hasten from the ruins of these fallen cities to some more lasting structures which in spite of time have proudly stood from age to age and baffled strangely all the shocks of age or accident  chap xxxiv of the pyramids of egypt and of several new discoveries therein which were never yet published the pyramids of egypt upon the western side of the aforesaid memphis near the borders of the lybian desert stand those vast and towering pyramids which have so long amused the world with strange reflections on the strong ambition and vain glorious aim of their aspiring founders but before i enter on a full description of their building number form and situation twill not be amiss to tell my reader that i look upon it as a needless trouble to repeat the many various notions and received opinions of the ancient world concerning the original design of such stupendous fabrics  what designed for by their founders for it is now an uncontested and apparent truth that they were first designed as lasting sepulchers wherein such monarchs as might claim interment in those lofty mausolaeums were induced to hope they might outlive their dissolutions and continue known to after ages by the striking grandeur of their barbarous monuments  to this opinion not to mention pliny strabo herodotus diodorus siculus and many other ancient writers lucan seems to be a strict adherer especially in his eighth book where he exclaims against the base injustice of king ptolemy upon the account of pompeys murder in the following verses lucan l   vltima lageae stirpis perituraque proles degener incestae sceptris cessure sororis cum tibi sacrato macedon servetur in antro et regum cineres extructo monte quiescant cum ptolemaeorum manes seriemque pudendam pyramides claudant indinaque mausolea littora pompejum feriunt truncusque vadosis huc illuc jactatur aquis degenerate last of lagus failing race to an incestuous sister yielding place must pompeys headless body seawashd over be dashed by swelling surges on the shore whilst you the macedonians ashes keep and royal relics in tall buildings sleep while the base ptolemys ignobler race vast pyramids entomb and mausolaeums grace   and thus in many other places the abovenamed author takes occasion to repeat his notions of the use to which the ancients put the pyramids  one of the worlds seven wonders it is certain and has been allowed in every age to whom these mighty piles were known that they deserved the character they ever bore of one of those stupendous prodigies which justly merited the title of the worlds seven wonders their amazing height an old greek writer nicely touches on as follows an old greek writer on the pyramids     in faithless stories an account is given that when titanian arms assaulted heaven pelion and ossa from the earth they drew and at the skys those rocky mountains threw but those tall pyramids near nilus found oerlooking with proud heads the distant ground guide to the realms above by sure degrees and kiss the golden stars which form the pleiades   the number of the pyramids the pyramids extend themselves for many miles along the desert and are near fourscore in number most of which are small and inconsiderable in respect of three which stand within a little space of one another and are built upon a certain hill of sand which covers rocks of a stupendous depth and wondrous magnitude  the height and bulk of the great pyramid the altitude in perpendicular of the most large and stately pyramid is near five hundred english feet but if we take the height as it inclines ascending toward the point we find it equal to the latitude of its prodigious basis every way seven hundred foot by moderate computation  the second and a third the second pyramid is equal to the first in height and not above a bow shot distant from it but the third appearing scarce half finished leaves no room to make comparisons and only gives us cause to think by the proportion it at present bears that had it been completed as the others are it had been higher far and more polite than either of the former  the stones of which the first is built the first great pyramid is built of vast and solid stones which some pretend were brought from quarries in the mountains of arabia but the gross absurdity of that opinion is extremely evident from many demonstrations but by none more fully disanulld than the remaining pieces of sawn stone which lying up and down upon the sand about the pyramid sufficiently convince a thinking man that they were dug no farther off than from the solid rocks not many foot below the surface of the desert  some stones and those not seldom met with near the top of this amazing structure are no less than five and twenty often thirty foot in length and depth proportionable it is a wonderful but very pleasant and engaging prospect to observe the art and strange economy whereby this mighty pyramid was built so loftily to be ascended on the outside you may ascend it gradually on the external sides or steps which lead you safely to the summit of the building  the architecture of the pyramids about the bottom of the pyramid there runs a strong degree of stone near five foot high and four in breadth upon the inner edges of which round degree is placed another somewhat smaller upon that a third yet smaller than the second on that third a fourth still leaning inwards more and more as it advances in its altitude and growing less and less till at the top thereof it forms a square consisting of three several stones close knit together in the compass of about fifteen or sixteen foot of english measure  the form thereof and number of the steps thus are the four sides for i should have informed you that the pyramid is quadrilateral encompassed by above two hundred of these vast degrees or steps of different height and magnitude which appear like long and narrow walking places but are now so much decayed by time and weather that it is a dangerous trial to attempt ascending but in certain places where the stones continue firm unbroken and of promising appearance  the founder of the greatest pyramid this pyramid is said to have been built by cheops king of egypt who by that amusement kept his subjects from the dangerous rust of a rebellious idleness and erected for himself a mausolaeum so prodigious that it has already stood almost four thousand years and may according to the dictates of undoubted probability continue near as long again before it is ruined  how long in building so vast was the command and great the labor requisite to carry on so strange an undertaking that for the space of twenty years there were employed about the building it above three hundred threescore thousand constant workmen  the second pyramid the stones whereof the second pyramid is built are white and shining not to be ascended on the outside which is very smooth and has its sides extremely equal by whom built this pyramid as herodotus and some other writers tell us was originally built by cephron brother to king cheops the great founder of the former  the third pyramid the third unfinished pyramid is built of a fine hard bright white and clearer kind of stone than either of the rest which some though groundlessly affirm to have been brought from the remotest mountains of the sultry aethiopia  it is more than probable this fable sprang from those old writers observations of a mighty quantity of theban marble not unlike the product of an ethiopian quarry which now lies in heaps not far from this third pyramid and with which stone perhaps they anciently designed to cover it but were prevented by some cause which god alone is capable of telling us  the several persons said to be its founders there go almost an hundred different stories of the founding of this pyramid some say twas built by macerinus son to cheops king of egypt some say by dorica a courtezan or harlot some again make mention of another famous strumpet aesops fellow slave called rhodope who when grown rich by frequent prostitution built this pile to eternize her memory  a pleasant story of the building a pyramid another story gives a strange romantic air to the original hereof and tells us how the latenamd rhodope inhabiting the city of naucretis went one day to wash and bath herself in a delightful fountain in the middle of her garden and that leaving all her clothes upon the verdant brink a sharpeyd eagle seized upon her shoe and bearing it aloft flew out of sight nor staid a moment till he came to memphis where he dropped it in the lap of amasis then king of egypt who surpised at the extraordinary event and pleased extremely with the shape and beauty of the ladys shoe gave orders instantly that strict enquiry should be made about his kingdom for the owner of it who at last was found and being brought to memphis was immediately declared the wife of amasis with whom she reigned for many years as queen of egypt and upon her death received a stately mark of his affection to her person in the orders which he gave for the erecting over her so fine a monument  the remoter pyramids there are but very few of the remoter pyramids whose forms or magnitude deserve the trouble of a strangers observation yet have all been closely shut from age to age whereby the wisest writers of antiquity itsself have been enabled to report no more than what they guessed at randam or received traditionally from the vulgar notions  shut close in all ages i know not why the entrances of all the pyramids the great one only still excepted were originally closed against the view of an adventurous curiosity nor by what strange means they have so many ages scapd discovery from the ingenious scrutinies and nice inspections of our later ancestors or the refined and more polite inhabitants of egypt when converted to the doctrine of the christian faith  the superstition of the people the cause thereof but twill be nothing difficult to guess the reason of their being still kept close from the establishment of turkish government in that subverted country for as the ancient nature of the true egyptians was defiled extremely with the mud of superstition and exceeding prone to look on omens and all insignificant and idle observations as the sure proclaimers of portentous prodigies that senseless vice or humor has increased of late to double folly by the cursed commixture of their own erroneous principles and the delusive superstitious tenets of the fond mahometans  the madness of bigoted zeal this illcontrivd conjunction of ignoble follies kept back inclination to the search of knowledge and to such amazing height did their resentment fly when any man of whatsoever quality he was presumed to offer at an entrance of the pyramids that the desires which some bashaws of cairo have thought fit to mention upon that account have caused such mutinies in the distracted nation as the sword of justice was too weak to pacify  nor will it be unpleasant to the reader to inform himself of the validity of their traditions by reflecting seriously upon the following notion which till very lately was esteemed as orthodox  a pleasant notion of the egyptians relating to moses and the magicians they told such travelers as asked them why the entrances of every pyramid but one were closed so strongly that the sorcerer moses for it seems they so distinguished that illustrious prophet having wasted egypt by ten grievous plagues their great magicians vainly strove to check the mischiefs he designed and did them  the ten plagues of egypt imprisoned in the pyramids but at last when tedious practices of vain experiments convinced them plainly of their want of power to stand unshockd against the miracles the hebrew showed them they resolved to try another way and finding it impossible to hurt the person of the hated moses they invented strange and admirable talismans whereon by fixing certain hieroglyphic characters and shutting them securely up within the pyramids they instantly found means to free themselves from all those plagues superior power had brought upon them  and hence the superstitious natives of this country believing those vast piles locked in their miseries prohibited the opening any of the pyramids least on admission of excluded air the charms upon the talismans should lose their power and all the plagues rush out again and overwhelm the nation with impetuous violence  a resolute bashaw of cairo however notwithstanding the antiquity and strength of this egyptian superstition some years since when i was happily at cairo there arrived a new bashaw from constantinople a man of an uncommon share of courage and ambition eagerly desirous of increasing knowledge and with pleasure snatching every opportunity which offered a temptation to his swelling curiosity  this man who knew full well the power he was master of and scorned to fear the insults of a poor unthinking mob which he was sent to govern framed a bold and sudden resolution to inform himself immediately by the convincing proofs of ocular demonstration of the various wonders and surprising strokes of art which he had often heard discoursed of on occasionally mentioning the pyramids of egypt  a journey to the pyramids no sooner was his resolution spread abroad than he perceived a thousand marks of discontent and anger in the common people but despising those effects of ignorance and folly he prepared convenient instruments of every kind and ordering a necessary number of his servants to attend his person took a journey to these famous pyramids in order to observe the nature of their buildings and procure himself a great and lasting satisfaction in the wished for pleasure of some new discoveries  nor fell he short in his expected ends of going thither and as the discoveries he made were such as never yet were told the world it will not be unwelcome since my self and five more christian travelers were suffered to accompany him if i here particularize the gradual advances which with curious notice of the most minute or great remark then led us leisurely through every part of that stupendous fabric  the entrance of the greatest pyramid arriving at the place where stands the great and first named pyramid we all ascended a steep hill of sand near forty foot in height upon the northern side thereof which brought us to the entrance a dark hole not four foot broad nor in its height exceeding such a measure so that it appeared designed for the reception of a stone to close that mouth and so prevent the times to come from aiming at the knowledge of those silent mansions of imperious death whose undisturbed and darksom hollows kept the bodies of departed majesty  a noisome narrow passage we entered after certain guides who undertook our conduct through this dismal passage and descended as upon the steepness of some narrow hill almost one hundred foot before we reached the bottom and were all that while obliged to stoop or rather crawl along with torches in our hands annoyed extremely by the suffocating heat and closeness of the place but more by certain black and dreadful batts a kind of bird whose shape is frightful and her wings like leather flying up and down and oftentimes with dangerous violence repulsed by striking on the heads or faces of such travelers as entering there must necessarily encounter them  an open space the bottom of this close and gloomy way admits us to a place considerably broad and of an height which frees us from the great uneasiness of stooping for a passage all the stones about this space are broken and irregular but yet appear to have been rendered so by force because not answerable in proportion or politeness to the universal harmony which crowns the other building  the first gallery of the pyramid from hence we were obliged to clamber up an huge and massy kind of stone near ten foot high which brought us to the entrance of the lowest gallery whose pavement of a polished white and shining marble gently rises with a smooth acclivity the breadth thereof was near five foot the height a little more the sides and roof were flaggd with stones of an unpolished rough and softer substance than the marble of the pavement the height of this first gallery exceeded rather than fell short of six score foot of english measure  this gallery was terminated by a very thick and solid wall through which a hole about the bigness of the first by which we entered to the pyramid admitted us directly to another gallery of very fine and stately workmanship but in its length inferior to the former a very dreadful horrid well hence we entered on an open space which led us to the brink of a most dreadful well a strange descent of such forbidding horror in its black appearance that the very apprehensions of its depth and danger has for many ages frightened the desire of curious men from even aiming at a further satisfaction than by passing hastily along its edges to attain the entrance of another passage leading to apartments which i shall describe hereafter here we stopped and by direction from the grand bashaw who was himself amongst us with a lighted torch surrounded the descent whose mouth was near three yards in its diameter  the bottom how discovered the light occasioned by so many torches was by far too weak to penetrate the thickness of this gloomy place so that finding it impossible by their assistance to perceive the bottom of the well we stood by we contrived to cast in certain balls of oakam dipped in pitch or other fit bituminous ingredients to prepare them for the blazing offices they might be put to  these balls once set on fire and thrown down discovered at the bottom of the pit a strange disordered heap of sand and rubbish it was near ten yards in depth and had no stairs whereby descent had formerly been made but certain hollows cut like pidgeonholes quite round the inside of the well directed those who would think fit to venture down to use promiscuously their hands and feet and so enable them to satisfy their curiosity without great danger to their persons  how cleared from rubbish revolving ages of continued time had robbed this well of a considerable depth by filling up great part with sand and stones by accident thrown thither but this weak obstacle the resolute bashaw found present means to render void by making several of his men descend and dig away whatever they met with stone excepted which by some above was instantly drawn up in little baskets and by those means a free passage opened to the solid bottom of this rocky hollow  a new discovery at the bottom of a well there the well grows vastly larger and in circular extent is dug on every side much deeper in the same degree to use an ordinary comparison as is the body of a common bottle to the neck thereof this great additional extent of space is graced far rather than supported by a stately circle of fine pillars of thebaic marble or at least a stone not much unlike it and in the center of the circle which those pillars form there stands an ancient monument the tomb perhaps of that great architect who built the pyramid  a tomb found there the tomb exceeds not much six foot in length its breadth is hardly four appearing hewn from the main rock but covered with a flat of polished marble on the top whereof as on the sides of the whole tomb were strangely carved a thousand hieroglyphic images and odd devices  a wooden coffin in it we found it no great labor to remove the stone which covered the sepulcher and were much amazed when contrary to expectation we beheld therein a wooden coffin or at least appearing to be wood by touch and figure  upon the coffin lid were represented in a kind of inlaid gilt work the distinct and several figures following  hieroglyphics on the coffin lid an eagle first appeared upon a sort of throne supported by four winged faces not unlike the notions we conceive of cherubims but by their swelling cheeks and blustering breath sent forth four different ways i rather guess they were at first designed to represent the four great winds of heaven  the eagle with severe and sullen aspect looked directly at a man who held in his right hand a pair of compasses and had his left extended in a form which represented him demanding mercy while half sinking in an opening gulf which loosening likewise the foundations of a towering pyramid which stood before him that also seemed just tumbling after him kicked downward by the foot of an old man whose right hand held a scyth while with his left he drew along a cloud which he appeared designing to throw over both the man and pyramid thereby to cover their appearance in a thick obscurity  the meaning of them now among the many hieroglyphic images whereby the old egyptians represented god they often chose the eagle in regard to the sharp sightedness that bird is famed for as an emblem to express his attribute of sure omniscience as the four winds there placed were meant to represent the vast extent of his unbounded power over every corner of the world the winds can blow upon  the eagles looking so severely on the falling man may probably denote gods anger at the pride and vanity wherewith he had indulged his merits on the building that huge fabric which appeared before him the authors opinion whose the tomb was for i take this sinking man to have been done for the great architect of the egyptian pyramids  the tumbling of the pyramid i guess to signify that though the builder perished first yet even the strongest master pieces of his artful labor must succeed him in a sure though slower downfall and to show that nothing though of never so stupendous strength and grandeur can resist the shocks of powerful time old time himself there represented spurning down the building spreads a cloud of darkness over it to prove that he is not alone enabled to destroy the pompous pageantries of human ostentation but to bury even the memory of their overthrown existence in a black obscurity  so that if i may be allowed to have guessed right in the interpretation of these hieroglyphic figures they will be found to signify as much as if in common characters we should set down the following sentences the hieroglyphic word for sense translated almighty god whose undisputed power extends it self to east north west and south and every corner of the spacious universe sees and despises human insolence for while men vainly think to raise themselves beyond mortality by some proud undertaking they are overthrown by time and buried with their labors in a dusky cloud of ever dark oblivion  from these persuasive circumstances i profess my self induced to think this monument contained the body as i said before of him who built this wondrous pyramid the coffin broke open but perhaps the reader will be more inclinable to that opinion when i tell him that the coffin by command of the bashaw was with great difficulty forcibly broke open by the blows of pickaxes and that we found therein the undiminishd body of a perfect man embalmed and wrapped about with many thousand folds of aromatic searcloth like the mummies which i shall at large describe in the seven and thirtieth chapter  a mummy found in it with hieroglyphics on his breast those folds wherewith his breast was covered seemed to have been varnished over with a lasting kind of glewy liquor upon which were represented all the various sorts of instruments used of old by the professors of encouraged architecture  when we had seen as much as we could possibly discover in the tomb the body was again enclosed as it had been before and the abovenamd marble cover placed again upon the sepulcher a further search of new discoveries from whence we went about the circle in the midst of which we found the monument to try if we could find no passage that might lead us on to new discoveries of something which we then began to form strong hopes of meeting with  moral reflections methoughts the strange disordered heaps of dust and broken stones over which we walked and the uncertainty we had of knowing when those massy piles were built and to what founder they have owed their origin then struck me deeply with a melancholy thought and often brought to my remembrance the reflections of an old greek poet on the arbitrary power which times prerogative entitles him to exercise over frail mortality   the length of time shocks monuments of stone even i am it self must times dominion own all things on earth his powerful rule obey and fall before his arm in one appointed way   a stone door we walked sometime about the place and with our torches narrowly inspected every thing we passed by till at last we spied a door of stone so closely shut and joining with the wall that twas not easily distinguished from it here believing we should meet with somewhat worth our observation several men were ordered to come forward and employ their pickaxes and other instruments in forcing open this discovered place which seemed to offer us no other hopes of gaining entrance  broke open twas not without much difficulty that the arts they used at last prevailed the door flew open with a mighty violence and caused a sort of frightful sound as sudden as a thunder clap but what was most remarkable was that the hinges upon which it turned were all of stone the joints contrived with an amazing ingenuity to knit together close and admirably held by certain strong and clumsy iron pins whereby they were for ever hindered from all possibility of accidental loosning  dangerous vapors i know not how so dry a place as this contained such damp and noxious vapors as at the surprising opening of the door abovenamed presently extinguished several torches and struck dead for some considerable time two sturdy laborers who were foremost of the company  forewarned by the example of these men we cautiously proceeded to inspect the entrance of a dismal cavity and that we might the better see the nature of the place cast in before us many of the balls i lately spoke of which by flaming greatly did not only clear the prospect of that gloomy passage but diffused an efficacious kind of warmth how dissipated which dissipating soon the hurtful vapors or unwholesome closeness of the place encouraged us to enter with our lighted torches  the discovery of many subterraneous chambers we advanced with equal pleasure and amazement through a very lofty broad arched way on either side whereof were hewn elaborately from the solid rock great numbers of square chambers every one of which had small low benches carved quite round it and in some appeared large niches of an exquisite contrivance but convincing or at least inducing us to think they were designed for other uses by their not retaining any marks of having ever held the burden of a statue  hieroglyphic figures upon the sides floor roof and the abovenamed benches we discovered plainly certain ancient hieroglyphics most of which were unintelligible or at least extremely difficult to all our apprehensions  some however i took pains to think upon and flattered my belief with the opinion that i could interpret their significations and among the rest it may not be unpleasant should i mention one for the diversion of the reader  first figure near half a foot above the bench the hieroglyphic took beginning in the figure of an infant sleeping in a cradle on the lowermost stair of ten which reaching to the roof upon the uppermost supported an old man extremely feeble in his aspect bending with the weight of age and misery and seeming ready to fall down and die immediately  second figure a man who seemed to be of middle age was represented on the sixth or seventh step his left hand full of certain chains in number equal to the stairs he had ascended to the respective ends of each long chain were fastened many things like globes of different sizes his right hand seemed with eagerness employed in grasping many other chains as he ascended further  these figures what designed to represent the stairs which as i said before were ten in number were intended as i guessed to represent the ten great stages of our human life which very rarely goes beyond one hundred years the child there sleeping in a cradle on the lowest stair i take to signify the ten first years of helpless infancy the weak old man was lifes great period and the utmost age of frail mortality  the man of middle age upon the sixth or seventh stair was nothing but an emblem of our mortal life twixt theescore years and seventy the chains with globes of different sizes fastened to one end which he endeavored eagerly to grasp as he ascended signified no more than that a man who travels toward old age should make good use of every moment in collecting knowledge and retaining it with resolution how the old egyptians in hieroglyphics represented wisdom for the old egyptians represented wisdom by the hieroglyphic figure of a globe or circle to denote that it was boundless and the different magnitudes of all those balls expressed the great variety of worth in arts and sciences  the application therefore of this hieroglyphical contrivance seems conspicuous to my probably mistaken judgment which by putting the abovenamd thoughts together framed immediately the following interpretation of the dubious emblem the interpretation of the hieroglyphic he who will hope to reach a good old age and bear the weaknesses and great infirmities it is always subject to must never fail in every stage of life he passes through to gather wisdom and improve his mind with learning and morality  moral reflections and excellently good is the advice this admirable hieroglyphic gives mankind how heavily and full of sorrow sits old age on that unhappy wretch who in the fruitless journey of his growing life has still omitted all his opportunities of laying up the treasure of a serious contemplation or improved capacity whereby to soften the unpleasant harshness of the burden time misspent has laid upon his shoulders  but the wiser man who never knew to live in vain but daily gathers an increasing stock of learning and discretion to enrich the dry and barren soil old age must bring him to will never feel the stings of ignorance and discontented solitude but when he finds himself decayed in strength of body can reflect with solon on the virtues of his mind and banish grief in the transporting repetition of the following sentence a saying of solon  it is true i grow more old but if i do as i wax older i wax wiser too   the reader must not blame me for presuming to interpret the abovenamd hieroglyphics since the wonderful variety of fancy they afford a subject for gives scope enough to every mans opinion and the dubious meaning cloakd in their disguise may very easily mislead our judgment  a passage stopped with rubbish after we had passed with gradual advances from one chamber to another we arrived at last at what repulsed our eager curiosity though probably it was not anciently the uttermost extent of those strange subterraneous hollows there we found the passage quite choked up with stones and rubbish nor could force an entrance any farther though we zealously endeavored by an universal labor to remove the obstacle  several opinions on the use the caverns were designed for god only knows how these vast heaps of dirt and ruins came originally there and what remains unseen behind them possibly there may be found in future times some wonderful conveyances for water as the common notion seems inclined to credit or perhaps these chambers were designed of old for tombs or probably they were the habitations of a kind of ancient priests who lived the life of a secluded votary or melancholy hermit in or near the doleful monument of some great prince or man of honor and had all the necessaries of their life provided daily by the legacies of the deceased  the authors own opinion indeed i am the most inclinable to a belief of this last guess for many reasons two especially the first because the numerous hieroglyphics carved upon the rocks have been such as seem to em fansyd for the contemplation of religious persons and because had all those places been designed for the conveying water from the river nilus hieroglyphic had been certainly a very odd and needless ornament  its reasons and secondly because without the pyramids in many places still remain the rows of caves hewn deeply in the rocks where formerly the superstitious priests of egypt used to dwell employed in several different services in the romantic offices of their religion  whatever they be we found the utmost of our labor vainly spent in hopes of gaining further knowledge so returned again the way we had descended till we came to the beforenamd rugged place which brought us to the brink of the deep well i have been speaking of  a passage leading to a square within the pyramid ascended from the well we went directly forward and exactly in a line with the beforenamd second gallery we entered a small neck or passage scarce five yards in length and very narrow this admitted us to a large square a little finer than the former but in magnitude not far exceeding it the stones whereof it is built are so extremely large and yet so wonderfully closely jointed that the nicest eye can scarce distinguish where abouts they join together and it is the mighty size of those prodigious stones and the politeness of their workmanship that yields such cause for travelers amazement when they see the fabric of those towering pyramids  the dimensions of the square we found this square no less than near an hundred foot and thence proceeded to a vaulted chamber sixteen foot in height near twenty long and eighteen broad or thereabouts the stones which flagg the angled roof of this large chamber are of admirable smoothness and surprising magnitude but all the walls are plastered over with a limy substance wonderfully firm and not inferior even to stone it self for its appearance or duration  a niche in the wall just equidistant from the eastern angles of this room and on that side thereof we found a kind of hollow niche which seemed at first to have been made to hold some statue as an ornament or idol but upon a nice inspection we imagined it was possible there might be something of a passage into other undiscovered chambers of the pyramid whereupon the men had orders to endeavor by their instruments to find it out  a new descent discovered by thrusting in their iron betties where they thought the joints a little of the widest they found means to force out a large stone which stopped a hole near three foot square and opened to the view of all the company a narrow shelving passage leading downwards with a dismal gloominess  and entered we entered and descended strangely struck with gravelike smells and dusty odours there was cut a passage down by certain stairs whose winding turns and labyrinth of changes led us on with wonderful surprise and eager curiosity till we imagined we had gone almost the height of all the pyramid below its bottom all the way was hewn laboriously from the rock it self and commonly so very low and narrow that but one could possibly go down fullbreasted and that one was forced to stoop with incommodious forwardness  a vaulted passage under ground the bottom of these stairs at last admitted us to a low vaulted passage strait but narrow which continued in one form for a considerable way together letting in a glimmering light which looked like day through certain little holes of almost undistinguishable size and workmanship  a strange ascent in all the horror and amazement possible from the surprising oddness of the place we walked in we proceeded till we found the straitness of the passage terminated by another winding staircase leading upwards in as strange a manner as the other downwards  the passage closed we ascended here and found no difference in form or magnitude between this passage and the former till we perceived it closed by certain massy stones above our heads and several other on each side the staircase  here we stopped and for a while amused our selves with strange reflections on the nature of the place and thoughts which way we might get out without returning the same road we came some passage out we were assured there was else could not comprehend the use of all those steps by which we had ascended  a moveable stone discovered at last some men belonging to the great bashaw and famous masters of the art of architecture as in fashion in the eastern countries looking earnestly about the place perceived one stone much smaller than the rest and by the application of their irons after many fruitless efforts found it stir and by repeated labors so prevailed at last that they quite lifted it from out the place it stood in and by forcible addition of a doubled strength quite thrust it from the hole it stopped  a storm of sand but we had little reason to be pleased with this success for in the very moment that the stone was lifted out there showered down on us such impetuous tides of rolling sand that in the space of half a minute we were almost buried quick and wholly overwhelmed with its amazing violence  no sooner was this sandy storm and our surprise thereat abated but we opened all our eyes and found our selves half swallowed by it yet those men who stood the nearest to the hole perceived it wider at the top than bottom and the stone which filled it being likewise so had served to stop it up effectually and till then prevented all that sand which lay upon it from a possibility of entrance  the author and his company rise without the pyramid on either side the hole and rock below it there were cut square nooks wherein by thrusting hands and feet a man without great difficulty might ascend and by those means we all got up in order as we stood and were beyond belief surpised not only to behold an open sky which plainly showed us that we were without the pyramid but to perceive our selves within a spacious hollow on the lofty head of that great rock which pliny and the other writers of antiquity distinguish by the name of sphynx  plinys opinion of the sphynx the author just abovenamd would persuade us to believe that twas the sepulcher of amasis king of egypt and of his opinion are most modern writers who have had occasion in their books to mention it  the authors dissent from it for my part i must own my inclination leads me to dissent from the belief that it was ever meant for that employment i am rather tempted to imagine it was anciently an idol from the hollow of whose head the priests deceived the common people as they thought convenient  and the causes thereof and indeed to what end else were those strange subterraneous passages contrived which lead from the great pyramid and caves adjoining formerly the habitations of a superstitious priesthood why but for this cause should they have carved the rock it is made of like an ethiopian virgin or why else have made the head so hollow and the passages thereto so very secret  why called a sphynx twas called a sphynx because from the breasts upwards it was said to represent a virgin and a lion from the bosom downwards if there ever was the lions shape belonging to it hills of sand have covered its appearance for there now remains no more above the surface than the head and neck and something of foundation which those men who please may take for shoulders  its situation and dimensions it stands on the east side of the great pyramid but very little distant from it its height exceeds not seventy foot and is defaced extremely by the violence of those bigoted turks who hating images believe it meritorious to abolish the remembrance of their very being  how decayed by time the arabs call it abulholhon and express a satisfaction in the hopes they have conceived that it will shortly fall by reason of the weakness of the neck decayed extremely by the shocks of time and frequent tempests from the neighboring deserts whence the winds from time to time blow storms of sand and thence came that which so unwellcomely invaded us when first we forced the passage open  they return to the pyramid we placed the stone as we had found it by the strength of certain men whom the bashaw obliged to stay above on purpose and reenter by the common way the pyramid we were returning to we fastened in the stone belonging to the niche and going back to the abovenamd well began to climb another passage not far from it  a graceful gallery this brought us to a graceful gallery of six and twenty foot in height still rising with a very smooth but somewhat steep and difficult acclivity this gallery is almost seven foot broad and benchd with solid seats of stone near two foot high on either side and flaggd with stone politely joined and of a magnitude almost surpassing credit it is in length one hundred fifty and odd feet and leads where it terminates to two large round  stately chambers opening into one another and indented square and certain nooks which seem to have been formed for sitting places  a chamber with a tomb in it hence a square and marble passage brought us to the entrance of the middle room the loftiest most amazing and prodigious building of the pyramid the chamber which contains the tomb of him who built it thought as i have said before to be king cheops an egyptian monarch  the amazing dimensions of the chamber the length of this vast room is five and thirty english feet the breadth a little more than seventeen the height within an inch or two of twenty and the sides roof floor and every part thereof flaggd richly with fine glittering tables of thebaick marble so prodigiously extensive that the place is roofd by nine great squares thereof and all the sides are flaggd by six vast rows of equal magnitude and beauty inexpressibly surprising  description of the tomb a little distant from the western side of this great chamber stands the monument i just now mentioned it is about seven foot in length three deep and thereabouts in breadth it is empty and uncovered and consists of one entire piece of admirable porphyry which being struck by any swordhilt stone or other solid body yields a sound not much inferior to the tone of some great bell in christian churches  a further passage from hence a passage leads you steeply to some other chumbers none deserving a particular description and continuing to ascend as far as possible we searched in vain for more discoveries and at last descended by the way we came  how the top is to be ascended the top must be ascended from without and is not what it seems to be by reason of the distance from below a point but an exact and perfect square of fourteen foot which space three single stones contain joined artfully together and all over covered with the names of travelers of every nation there cut deep and left to tell succeeding comers they were there before em  other pyramids entered many of the other pyramids besides the two adjoining this we entered finding tombs in every one and several things worth speaking of but should i name them all it would require a greater space than i can here allow my self and having therefore largely treated of the most remarkable discoveries we made let it suffice to tell the reader that i have some thoughts of publishing a treatise of these famous pyramids unmixed with any other observations when the worlds goodnature speaks it self deserving or my own spare time appears permitting it  the uncertainty of their number the number of the pyramids was ever as uncertain as their founders and antiquity nor are they all of the same magnitude some being far inferior to the smallest of the three so celebrated yet perhaps were those away the meanest of the little ones would well deserve the name of wonders  extent of their situation they extend themselves in great unequal distances for near the space of twenty miles and may be seen at large from the square flat upon the highest pyramid but whether it proceeds from any difficulty owing to their strange position or is caused by the unwary negligence of those who strive to count em i am yet uncertain but it has been found as much impossible to do it justly as to tell the monuments of stonehenge upon salisbury plain a task most english writers have reported difficult  how many little pyramids the author told from the top of the great one i looked as nicely as i could direct my eyes from the abovenamd place and could distinctly tell no more than five and twenty other authors have reported them an hundred many modern writers say there are but eighteen or at most but twenty  a probable cause of the different accounts on this subject whence these different accounts should rise i cannot guess unless a kind of foggy weather often known in egypt might obscure the prospect at such times as those who lessen the just number of the pyramids have chanced to take their observations  a question how the stones were raised it is a question not a little curious how the ancients could contrive to carry stones of such amazing bulk to such an altitude whereby the fabric was erected and to this i answer that i have collected all the notions worth remark to be answered in another treatise which with the draughts of several fine machines and admirable engines i design to publish when i find this book so well received that gratitude not recompense may urge me to the setting forth the treatise i so lately spoke of  why the author is not fuller on this subject i hope the reader will not think me blameable in that i have not dwelt much longer on the subject since it was so copious to afford me matter those who may imagine me too short must certainly forget how many things i am to treat of equally deserving notice and how much i should outswell the volume i proposed should i enlarge to a prolixity on every subject which afforded room enough to bear that way of writing  chap xxxv of the trade of egypt the introduction a conquered nation must be subject among other shocks of inauspicious fate to deviate from her genius as she dwindles from her power and the same destructive hand whose unresisted violence has crushed the liberty of a subverted country may undoubtedly be said to triumph over the minds of her unhappy natives when it has depressed their courage and enslaved their persons  egypt brought to turkish customs as therefore egypt wholly subject to the lawless tyranny of an insulting monarch knows no wished partiality of freedom nor is suffered to possess peculiar tolerations it must consequently follow that her fixed dependence on the turkish government must strongly bend her biased people in their modern slavery to an encouraged practice of those very customs forms and ceremonies which are publicly professed by their imperious masters  why the egyptians love not traffic hence the reader having long since been informed of the prevailing genius which has still inclined the warlike turks to never resting search of conquests will be apt to guess that their egyptian subjects aping eagerly their strange example cannot be inclined or qualified indeed for the encouragement of any thing so different from the perpetual hurries of fatiguing war or martial studies as the softer practice of a trading life and the less dangerous rudiments of peaceful traffic  extremely fond of war ambitious aims and swelling hopes which take their beings from a love of war have changed this nation from her ancient searches after arts and sciences to an imperious disregard of every virtue not exerted in a martial manner arms alone are the encouraged white they universally direct their towering shafts at and a different cause has now produced among them all the same effect which animated gloriously the ancient world to scorn of danger and the practices of war which how esteemed may plainly be discovered in the numerous writings of those early ages handed down to late posterity with a deserved applause and universal admiration particularly in the following verses of tyrtaeus a greek poet flourishing about the thirty fifth olympiad tyrtaeus a greek poet in the   th olympiad                     the quotation englished i scarce can think a man deserves a name or can regard from fellow creatures claim not though in wrestling he is grown complete and skilled in all the virtues of the feet not though he boasts a cyclops strength and grace or can outrun the northern winds of thrace tho in his form he tithons self excells and midst such endless heaps of riches dwells as not king cynaras or midas fate gave in possession of their wealthiest state not though he had more powerful kingdoms won than ever blessed pelops tantaluss son not though more music on his accents hung than ever graced the sweet adrastus tongue not though he was with every talent blessed and all heavens gifts but that of war possessed nor can he truly boast a martial soul who cannot bravely stand where seas of slaughter roll who does not nobly scorn repeated blows and dares not wish to fight surrounded by his foes this is true valor and this grace possessed of all rewards we aim at is the best he is well adorned who has such actions done and that youth richliest dressed who his own trophies won hence common good to every city slows and every subject some advantage knows he who amidst the battle grasps at fame forgets base fear and a retreating shame who hazards life on a contested plain and bends his soul to a content in pain who tempts his right hand man to lose his breath and yield without one groan to an approaching death this is the man whose praise shall echo far and speak him bravely fit for the great toils of war   yet is not egypt wholly destitute of such commodities as egypt not quite destiture of trade notwithstanding all these disadvantages entice the merchant to adventurous search of profitable traffic which their seaport town of alexandria is in its situation so extremely fit for the manufactures of egypt thither once a year repair the galleys of the turkish sultan loading first with wood from the blacksea a scarce commodity in egypt and returning back with many rich and costly manufactures of grand cairo and the country round it such as drugs of excellent and noted virtues in medicinal operations fine perfumes the skins of beasts peculiar to this place vast quantities of dates much larger and of better taste than any other sugar canes in great abundance and a stately kind of carpets made at cairo in appearance richer and by far more durable than those they make in any other part of the grand signiors empire  what english ships import from egypt besides these merchandises which our english ships have constant trade with egypt for we often are supplied at easy rates with many of the rich and valuable silks and other products of the indian countries brought to cairo by the monthly caravans and thence exported at convenient opportunities to every distant part of trading christendom  what they export to it by way of barter for the merchandises we receive from thence we load our ships with nothing more than these commodities the product of our own and foreign manufactures which i have largely mentioned in the chapter treating of the trade at present carried on between our countrymen and those of turkey  how the french dutch and venetians trade with egypt the french and dutch both carry on a trade with egypt but inferior much to that we manage in the port of alexandria but the venetians deal for a peculiar kind of ashes made of lime calcined with the broad leaves of certain low and spreading herbs which grow on the else barren deserts of this country of which when they have used some arts at home in the refining and new moulding it they make the famous crystal and so celebrated glasses which are much esteemed and numerously sent about to every part of europe  before i close this chapter twill not be digressive from the subject i am treating on to tell the etymology from whence we give the name to paper  whence our writing paper took its name there is a very common herb which grows in the egyptian marshes called of old papyrus nilotica from the appellation of the river it is a kind of stringly leaf of filamental substance which the ancients used to strip in flakes of which it is almost naturally composed then spreading them upon a board they moistened them with certain waters of a stiptic composition and by pressing them with weighty instruments so well enabled them to bear the writing on that they were used by all men for that purpose and composed most part of those unnumberd volumes in the library of philadelphus  why the author is so short upon this subject it is needless to enlarge on the particulars of the abovenamd manufactures hence exported since they are not only long since extant in the lists of many writers but are now become familiar to the trading part of england who alone are those to whom a full account thereof might even formerly have been imagined welcome  chap xxxvi of the revenues of egypt and to what uses they are applied as the unbounded power of the turkish sultan authorizes his pretensions to an undisputed sway in the egyptian government so does it thence entitle him to the possession of a certain annual income or revenue the revenue how gathered in egypt which is raised collected and in all kinds managed as i have before related in the other parts of his dominions till deposited at cairo in the hands of the bashaw then governing as viceroy for the turkish empire  how employed thence guarded by proportioned bodies of the standing forces kept in egypt it is severally employed to certain settled uses and from hand to hand delivered carefully in order to be used for the respective purposes to which it was decreed since first the arms of the victorious selym made him master of this fertile country  a calculation of the whole revenue the whole revenue as it has been calculated justly by some late inquirers into the condition of the turkish treasures is no more than eighteen hundred thousand gold chequins that is nine hundred thousand english pounds a year and such a sum is annually raised and distributed with great exactness in the just proportions of the three divisions following  the first third how disposed of three hundred thousand pounds a year are set apart for the possession of the turkish sultan and delivered to the care of certain chosen regiments of horse whose duty it is to guard it safely to constantinople and receiving a discharge from the lord tefterdar or treasurer return when they have left it in his custody to be employed according to the will and pleasure of his master the grand signior sometimes it happens that the turkish fleet with formidable strength is ready to depart from egypt at the time wherein the guards set forward with the money and in that case it is embarked on board the admiral who saves the soldiers their expected trouble and acquits them from their charge at alexandria though this but rarely happens and is found a very dangerous way because the treasure undefended by a mighty naval force would probably become a prey to the industrious valor of the christian squadrons ever cruising on the coasts of turkey  the second third how disposed of three hundred thousand pounds a year are next appropriated to defray the charges of the numerous offices dependent on the great bashaw and other necessary uses in relation to the posts incumbent on such men as are deputed by and thence subservient to the great supreme and arbitrary monarch of the conquered egypt  the last third how applied the third three hundred thousand pounds a year are still employed in bearing the expenses of the many thousand zealous pilgrims who resort each year with a bigoted faith to the great rendezvous at cairo whence they all set out with wonderful devotion and a superstitious ignorance in order to complete the necessary pilgrimage to mecca their false prophets birth place  these three abovenamed uses are the only ones to which the turks apply the sums they gain from the egyptian tribute nor is it lawful by the fixed decrees of the grand signiors empire that the sums thence rising should be any ways perverted to what use soever devious from the ends to which they are appointed  why the revenue is so small it is true nine hundred thousand pounds a year are no great income from the conquest of a country so exceeding famous for her known fertility that when the romans conquered her of old she gained the name of granary to that successful empire but as wealth decreases by a long continued series of destractive war it is no great wonder if we now find egypt far from the capacity of yielding such amazing heaps of spoil and plenty as in ancient ages blessed the plunder of victorious legions  how the turks make up the deficiency however though the sum exacted thence by the grand signior is a smaller burden than they well might bear yet are the turks so dexterously skilled in managing authority to the advantage of their purses and their masters safety that the vanquished natives are not only crushed beyond all hopes of growing rich but kept below the very possibility of framing with the smallest shadow of success a dangerous rebellion  chap xxxvii of the egyptian catacombs and the mummys which are found in the ancient sepulchers of their dead by the foregoing descriptions of cairo memphis babylon and the stupendous workmanship of those prodigious pyramids whose outward magnitude interior passages and subterraneous cavities have so deservdly styled them the worlds chief wonder the curious reader may have formed a notion no ways disagreable of the valuable antiquities whose still remaining splendours speak amazingly the former grandeur of the egyptian nation  the antiquity of some of the mummys i shall now proceed to give a strange but true account of those vast catacombs wherein the old egyptians were embalmed and buried and whose black horrid wombs do yet contain a formidable proof how long our humane bodies may preserve their substance when defended by the help of art from the destructive power of a natural corruption for in the dark recesses of those gloomy caverns to this day remain unnumberd thousands of those very people who lived and triumphed over the subject israelites before the hand of god delivered that ungrateful nation from their long captivity  it is a curiosity however dangerous extremely satisfactory for an adventurous traveller to behold those lifeless bodies which from age to age have been interred in these surprising monuments and bidding strong defiance to the course of nature remain untouched by piercing putrefaction and have for several thousand years lain undisturbed entire and sound in every part nor will undoubtedly for many ages yet to come be any ways subject to the smallest diminution  the extent of the catacombs these vaults and dark sepulchers of their ancient dead extend themselves in greatest numbers from the neighborhood of memphis to the distant borders of the libyan desert containing thirty miles in length and breadth proportionable many have been broken up from time to time and often entered by the daring curiosity of european travelers but many yet remain unopend nor is it an attempt consistent with the dictates of a selfpreserving humor to visit frequently those dusky palaces of death known only by the sight of some large stone unnatural to the place which turned aside discovers under it a narrow descent not much unlike the mouth of such a well as we may often see in british villages the manner of descending the vaults the passage down was formed by gradual steps cut circularly through the neck of this descent but time or accidental ruin having now defaced those old conveniences some rope or other neat contrivance is made use of to let down those who are desirous of enlivening their contemplations by such a strange and melancholy prospect the bottom of this steep descent admits them instantly to one large vault which leads to many others high and dismal built securely with a small square stone of color black and shining not unreasonably supposed by some those famous bricks so celebrated in the scripture for the workmanship of the poor captived israelites who labored hardly under the harsh injunctions of an egyptian bondage  the greatest part of these dark arches remain entirely whole and stately but in some few places are defaced and fallen so as to render the passage through them almost impracticably difficult some are distinguished by small pillars oppositely placed in graceful order others wholly unadorned and naked leading like the streets of christian cities one through another and forming with a sort of venerable majesty a gloomy labyrinth of death and horror the order in which the mummys lie for on either side lie ranged in measured order at near three foot distance from each other promiscuous bodies of men women and children some whereof such likely as were rich and honorable have flat stones a little elevated at the head and feet placed neatly under them others lie meanlier in the common sand but all embalmed and wrapped about with numerous folds of searclothlinen which forcibly untwind from their defenseless bodies looks not much unlike the middle rind of some decaying oak and leaves the corpse entirely solid whole and perfect in its full dimensions of a blackish red or dusky brown in color its substance hard like pitch or rosin their backs and breasts are often stained with hieroglyphick ciphers and on their bosoms lie small figured idols made of artificial stone baked hard and durable or sometimes folded scroles of rough and painted parchment some of which devices i shall in the course of this chapter describe to the judicious reader with my own opinion of the likeliest significations of their diverting fancies and hieroglyphical contrivances  the danger of too great a curiosity the danger of descending such of these repositories as are most curious is extremely great by the distance they are at from the cities aforementioned which exposes frequently the unwary traveller to the barbarous violence of the inhumane arabs who watching secretly for a favorable opportunity will often close the mouth of the sepulcher and by that means starving the unhappy strangers return some few days after to divide the plunder of those miscarried gentlemen  a strange accident which befell the author in a vault amongst the mummys an accident occurring unexpectedly to my own experience may perhaps divert the reader in the relation of what i can with pleasure now reflect on though it gave me little satisfaction when i was liable to its danger about    miles southeast of memphis lie several famous catacombs but  as dangerously seen are commonly neglected however a strong desire of seeing something that for so many ages had continued shut from mortal view excited my curiosity to forget the hazard and procure as guide a native of that country to conduct me with three fellow travelers to the place abovementioned the fellow was a little backward alleging in excuse of his unwillingness that twas an inconveniency to lie a night abroad upon the open desert but assuring him we would rather travel all night long he consented to go with us we rode on mules and traveled with a wonderful delight through a rough and sandy country till we arrived at a place where stones of vast uncommon sizes pointed out the passages to what we looked for we were pleased to see the coast so clear that not the smallest tract of man or beast appeared to give us cause of jealousy we alighted from our mules and tying them together went toward the largest stone we saw amongst them and turning it with much ado aside were all surpised to see securely fastened and rolled up on the inside a ladder of ropes but imagining it might have been left there by some who had descended formerly we spared the trouble of making use of a convenience our guide had with him and having unfolded what we found there ready went backwards down with each man a pistol in one hand and a lighted torch in the other a strange uncommon smell saluted our first entrance with an odor not to be imagined by such as have not known it by experience and the blazing torches striking a faint glimmering light through the thickness of the gloom discovered as we walked along on either side the discolored faces of the dead with a strange and inexpressible horror we had scarce passed three yards within the vault when the foremost of our company stumbling accidentally on something that lay in his way fell headlong over it whereupon holding down our torches we perceived two men in christian habits extended cross each other and appearing newly dead with all the pale and frightful marks of a convulsive horror in their contracted joints and faces between the feet of one there lay a pocket book and pencil which taking up and opening we read with great difficulty and more concern the following lines there written in italian but in a character that was hardly legible for besides the confusion of one letter running into another the lines were here and there writ upon certain others which seemed to have been designed as memorandums for several private businesses two gentlemen found dead in a vault lorenzo and ferdinando bonavoglia dear unhappy brothers born at pisa a city of italy died here by grief and hunger barbarously shut in and lost for ever june    th   0  good christian if thy dear eyes shall read our misery pray for our souls o jesus o mary mother of god hear and pity us  it should seem by the melancholy contents of this small pocket book that these unfortunate gentlemen had been observed to enter by some arabian murderers and the sequel of this relation will i think incline the reader to the same opinion by the date of the abovenamed sentences we found they had not long been there for to the best of my remembrance twas on the twenty second of the same month that we came thither  amazed and half confounded at the miserable objects which we saw before us we began to think upon the danger we were in the apprehension whereof increased immediately to a double magnitude by the ghastly looks and trembling agonies which shook the heartless guide with fierce convulsions as we knew him more familiar than our selves with the customs of his country so we guessed our danger more extraordinary by the fright we saw him in and judging it a necessary prudence to make the best of time and opportunity we retreated with the utmost have to the place we came in at a dangerous surprise but to our great surprise perceived the stone placed over the mouth of the descent the very moment we came directly under it with all the fright imaginable we began to seek the rope by which we had descended but twas taken up and all the hopes of our deliverance from that dreadful prison were entirely dashed to nothing by the unexpected turn of such a sad catastrophe twas here we felt the fear of death in all its roughest attributes and the guide who should have given us comfort in our deep extremity increased the weight of our concern by piercing cries and oftrepeated curses on our rash attempt which had involved our selves and him in one promiscuous ruin and would destroy in him the chief support and poor subsistence of his unhappy wife and family for my part though exposed in equal measure to the threatened misery i was so strongly moved by the sighs groans tears and wringing hands of this complaining wretch that i forgot the nature of the place i walked in and forming strange unreasonable hopes that we might find some other passage urged the company to ramble farther through those dismal cavities but considering the horror which in such a place the want of light would soon produce and willing to keep back the evil hour as long as possible we extinguished four of our five torches and with the sickly light of the remaining one walked on with heavy hearts from vault to vault quite through those dismal mansions till at a little distance from the guide who bore the light before us we perceived with more than common terror the faint ideas of six pale faces close against the wall that stood before us we started at the sight and saw them move as if they stalked to come upon us undiscovered so that rightly guessing they designed no good with one consent we fired our pistols it is impossible to make the reader sensible of the prodigious loud report and rumbling noise this one discharge created in the vault it rolled above our heads like some uncommon clap of thunder and continued still increasing a considerable time whether fear or some unlucky accident produced the cause i cannot well determine but the frighted guide let fall his torch which presently extinguished and running backwards with impetuous fury beat down a gentleman of our company and tumbling on the ground lay still in a most profound and breathless silence when the report was over we expected every moment to have heard or felt the persons we had seen before us but all was strangely still no tread or voice alarmed our fears nor could we guess what accident had rid us of our danger till through the wall before us we perceived a sudden ray of light break briskly in and coming to the place found there a hole dug through the stone or brick an explanation of the plate which represents the strange particulars of an accident that happened to the author in the catacombs of egypt a the entrance by which we descended to the catacomb with the mules tied together about it b the stone that covered the mouth of the descent c the guide d the pocket book e the two italian gentlemen found dead in the first vault f one of the english gentlemen who fell by stumbling over them g g g g mummies in several allies of the catacomb h the six arabs against the wall i the stone that covered the other entrance of the catacomb k two of the arabs making their escape from the vault l l others of them

writers depiction of the authors accident in the catacombs of egypt to the right hon ble charles earl of peterborow and monmouth ye authors honored patron and encourager of his undertaking this plate is most humbly dedicated    which opened largely into another catacomb through which we saw the passage that had let in so much light upon us and heard an unintelligible noise of hallowing descend as from the mouth of that uncovered cavity through which we could perceive distinctly six tall men climb swiftly up and seemed confused as if afraid of some approaching danger the authors strange escape from the vault the fear of dying in that horrid place had banished every other from our thoughts so that getting eagerly though the broken wall we ran immediately to the entrance of the vault and hearing neither voice nor any other sign of their continuing above we ventured to ascend as they had done and certainly the light of heaven did never more enliven man than it did our joyful company at such a strange deliverance  no sooner were we up but looking round we could perceive four arabs riding hastily toward the left side of the desert leading away our mules as lawful booty and followed at some distance by six others on the right of our unlucky station we perceived a troop of turkish horsemen whom we knew by their appearance to belong to the bashaw and to be part of those convenient forces kept on purpose to patrole from place to place and guard the country from the presumptuous insults of these arabian villainies till then i never met a turkish party with the smallest satisfaction but was now transported with a boundless joy at the welcome prospect of their first appearance  we walked to meet them and informing their commanding officer of what had passed he strait detached a number of his men to gallop after them who were no sooner seen advancing by the wary arabs but they set our captived mules at liberty and soon outran the hopes of their lessswift pursuers however we were very well contented to have sped so well and fearing we might lose our safety by the dangerous absence of our newcome champions we agreed to give the officer the value of five and twenty shillings a piece upon condition he would see us safely to the neighborhood of cairo he accepted the proposal and invited us to descend again while he with several of his men would keep us company and leave the rest above to watch for our security his offering to accompany us convinced us of his honesty and missing the poor guide who had been left below they descend again we ventured once again to visit the late scene of our misfortune being entered with three lights which the captain ordered to be carried such as i have elsewhere largely treated of and which afford a flame much brighter and more powerful than our small torches we proceeded gradually from place to place and searched in vain over all the vaults for the poor frighted fellow we had left behind us till at last arriving at the farthest end of that first catacomb which we descended we observed one mummy higher than the rest and drawing near to view it more particularly we could perceive it stir at which surpised and calling for the lights to know its meaning the first thing they find the guide hid under a mummy we saw was the poor guide who being crowded in between the wall and the mummy was creeping under it as far as he was able and turned his eyes upon the lights and company with such a dismal languish that it threw us into a long and violent fit of laughter the honest mans simplicity had persuaded him that if he lay close he might pass for a mummy and having crawled from vault to vault he chose that place for his asylum from those arabs for whom he now mistook the turkish soldiers  a joyful transport he heard us laugh and looking earnestly about him found with a surprising joy that he had been mistaken in his apprehensions and the rapid transports thence oppressing his recovered spirits made him start from his unnecessary shelter and embracing me who then unluckily stood nearest him expressed the sense he had of his scarce credited delivery with such ungovernable signs of satisfaction in the leaping up and down that treading frequently upon my feet i was obliged to shake him off with roughness unbecoming the soft airs of due congratulation  now had we time without the fear of a succeeding danger to inspect with all the zeal of an unlimitted curiosity those gloomy tracts of death and terror in whose dismal paths we had before been so amazingly surpised by dangerous interruption  the observations they made in their second descent the observations then which favored by so fair an opportunity we made were these the bodies of the mummies not exceeding in their stature those of common height now living are a certain confutation of that old mistake which teaches many to believe that as the world increases in her age mankind decrease in strength and magnitude  the many thousand folds which swathed some bodies in the catacomb were wound about the corpse with so much smoothness and such admirable art and neatness of contrivance that the nicest hand modern times would fall so short of equalling that they could never imitate the beauties of the practice should they now attempt it  we all took notice that the heads of many mummies were divided from their bodies and perceived that part the weakest and most prejudiced by time even in those corpse which seemed entire and no ways robbed of their original proportion  the faces of such bodies as appeared the richest by their ornaments and ways of lying we observed all coverd over with a very thin and shining aromatic searcloath of such admirable form and such a skilful preparation that it only served to keep the head more lasting and entire which else was found a part most subject to decay without obscuring the appearance of the countenance or altering even the minutest turn of any feature  the painted rolls the rolls which lay on many of their breasts contained as i have said before a thousand different kind of hieroglyhic figures some done in gold some red some blew some green and others black in short of every form and color thence a man may reasonably claim the liberty to guess he could distinguish many things relating to the age death quality life virtues and profession of the person to whose breast they are affixed  thus for example on the bosom of one mummy whole and fair in every there there lay a roll whereon in lines of gold and azure we distinguished plainly among many more the following figures  an hieroglyphic image in the catacombs upon a very high and craggy rock there stood a throne whereon in all the state of ancient monarchs sat a man in royal robes and wearing on his head a regal diadem his right hand highly elevated held a sword with threatening fury and his left extended with a kind of a disdainful air appeared to mock the fruitless efforts of a numerous company of men in arms who seemed with eagerness to grasp the rocks and vainly aimed with angry looks at reaching the defended king who sat secure and triumphed in their disappointments  an explanation of the plate which represents exactly an egyptian hieroglyphic found upon the bosom of a mvmmy in the catacombs a a king upon his throne or an emblem of a prince who governs justly b an emblem of designing underhanded treachery c an emblematical description of the great stability of justice and moderation d d d d an emblematical representation of ungovernable headstrong treason and its difficulties hieroglyphic found on a mummy in the catacombs of egypt an egyptian hieroglyphic to the right honble carry countess of peterborough etc this plate is most humbly dedicated      an emblem of crafty treason but on the other side the rock behind the monarchs back appeared a brisk and fiery youth who having mounted by the help of a tall ladder was just steping from its topmost round upon the rock it self with seeming resolution to attack and kill the king with a long spear presented at him was witheld from his intent by means of a large chain descending from a cloud above his head and twining suddenly about his arms while he himself was wounded in the bosom by a sword directed by a hand which issued likewise from the cloud abovenamd  now in my imagination it is a task of no great difficulty to unfold the mystery contained in this intelligible hieroglyphic perhaps i am mistaken but as probably am not however right or wrong i will give the reader my opinion let him judge as he thinks proper  the meaning of the hieroglyphic the monarch represented in his regal ornaments i take to mean a king who rules with state and power the sword denotes the justice of his office the disdainful look implies a scorn of treason and its practisers  the rock whereon he sits enthroned was doubtless meant to signify his governments solidity its craggy roughness was designed to show what dangerous precipices we are led to by ambition  emblem of open rebellion the rash armed multitude who strive in vain before the face of the abovenamed monarch to ascend and wound him are as emblems of of those daring and imprudent rebels who will openly presume to carry on their hate to just authority and prosecute the dictates of their impious wishes in the face of majesty  their numerous repulses and the fruitless efforts of their eager application serve to show how much it is impossible by open practices of lawless villainy to shock the throne of an established government or succeed in the endeavors of a treacherous inclination  the siery youth just mounting from a ladder to the summit of the rock behind the king and holding up a spear as if with design to kill him signifies in my opinion that more crafty kind of treason carried on by underhand intrigues and subtle secrecy and powerfully assisted by prevailing parties  emblem of heavens justice the descending cloud from which appears the chain that binds him and the hand which wounds his bosom with a spear was meant by the egyptians of antiquity to represent that great but unknown power by whose sure though secret means of justice they perceived the sacred persons of just monarchs safely guarded from designing treachery and very rarely knew a villain die unpunished  now if the ingenious reader will but put together these interpretations of the hieroglyphic mystery he will soon perceive a nice connection of its several parts which we may read as follows the hieroglyphic literally interpreted that princes throne who governs justly is so strongly seated on the rock of power that he can look with scorn upon the vain attempts of those mad rebels who invading his prerogative with open violence encounter such prodigious and undreamt of difficulties that they fall in their endeavors wretched victims to the disappointment of ambition  but that more crafty politic and private traitor who ungenerously aims at a success in his rebellion from the undiscovered practices of close disloyalty though he may prosper for a while in undetected villainies is notwithstanding his great cautions watched in every step he makes by the unknown omniscience of some heavenly being who when his plot seems ripe for execution chains his will oerthrows his treason and amazingly converts his unsuspecting malice to his own destruction    the particular application of the hieroglyphic this general interpretation led me to conclude the hieroglyphic was designed a monitory lecture to dissuade mankind from practices of treason by an artful declaration of its fatal consequences and the application in particular directed me to guess the mummy on whose body it was represented had been formerly some youth made wretched by the knowledge if not executed for the practice of some treason or rebellion  they reascend from the catacomb when we had made as many observations as we could we reascended by the way we entered at and were conducted safely to grand cairo by the faithful captain and his party on the terms beforenamd  inquiring when we were returned if any news had reached the city of the loss of two italian gentlemen and hearing nothing of it we imagined it our duties to acquaint a person of that country who resided there in public business with the strange particulars of the abovenamed accident he presently informed us that he knew too well the gentlemen we spoke of that they had been recommended to him in their travells thither and had been forewarned how dangerous it was to visit those remote and dismal catacombs that they refused to listen to persuasion and had taken a guide and several servants with them none of which had since been heard of  what became of the dead bodies of the two italian gentlemen in short the gentleman with melancholy marks of thanks rewarded our civility in giving him this sorrowful intelligence he hired the captain who had been our convoy to remove the bodies of the two unhappy brothers from the catacomb to cairo whence he afterward embarked them on a vessel which was bound for europe and which brought them soon  god knows a shocking and unwelcome cargo to their country and relations  how they were betrayed it seems their guide since taken and impaled alive for his abominable villainy had held a correspondence with the arabs and betrayed his charge by entering with them to the catacomb and giving them the slip at a convenient opportunity through the other hole set open purposely the servants who remained above were siezd on and made prisoners by the arabs who returned to plunder their dead masters at a time when they unhappily found us an unexpected booty in the gin they came to  probably the reason of their leaving the italian gentlemen unplunderd when they shut them in was owing to the distant prospect of some turkish party frequently patroling as i said before from place to place about those deserts  as our escape was wonderful so were our praises and thanksgiving great and hearty yet the horror whose unnatural shock when we sustained the danger startled nature is by time converted to a certain inexpressible contentment in the sweet remembrance and reflection on the oddness of the accident nor is it a new thing to change our passions with the change of time in such a manner seneca has left us his authority to prove it common in the following words sen trag herc  quae fuit durum pati meminisse dulce est mens memries commonly delighted are to think on what they once found hard to bear   the catacombs nearer cairo not worth describing i could enlarge extremely on the subject of the catacombs but think it altogether needless since the finest of them all are those which i have here so largely treated of and which are very seldom visited by any travelers nor to my knowledge have been ever yet described in any of their writings all the wells or little places nearer cairo which contain the bodies of egyptian mummies are not only so inferior to these catacombs as scarce to merit mention but have been already taken notice of so frequently by other travelers in almost every book of this kind extant in our language that it is neither worth my trouble in repeating the particulars or an ingenious readers in perusing the relation  chap xxxviii of that part of egypt formerly the land of goshen and of the passage of caravans through the libyan deserts delta why so called amongst the many fertile tracts of land enriching egypt with an annual plenty there is one called delta by the ancients in regard to the resemblance it was thought to bear the grecian letter of that name  two streams of nilus the river nilus not above four miles below grand cairo is divided into two distinct and navigable streams one running eastward and the other toward the west the first emits his waters into the mediterranean not far distant from the old pelusium now called damiata and the second loses his swift channel in the same sea just below rosetta  these two abovenamd channels form by their triangular course a very rich and spacious island even the fattest soil and most delightful part of fruitful egypt and it is this portion of the country which as i have said before was once distinguished by the name of delta  the land of goshen this though many contradict the notion i imagine to have been in former times the land of goshen and am much confirmed in my opinion by the holy scriptures undeniable authority as for example in the tenth verse of the forty fifth chapter of genesis where joseph tells his father genesis chap    v  0 and thou shall dwell in the land of goshen and thou shall be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou have  by the words near unto me in this verse it is evidently certain that we cannot guess with greater probability than in believing delta to have been the place since it is the nearest fruitful spot of ground to memphis then the residence of joseph in the whole egyptian country  goshen proved a fruitful country and that the land of goshen was not only near the capital but preferable in a thousand other blessings to the rest of egypt we may be assured by the authority i just now quoted and some other places  in the fourth fifth and sixth verses of the seven and fortieth chapter of genesis we find the sons of jacob pleading for and pharaoh granting them the land of goshen in the following sentences genesis chap   v       they said moreover unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy sevants dwell in the land of goshen  and pharaoh spoke unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee  the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell    again in the six and fortieth chapter pharaoh speaks to joseph in the following manner and take your father and your household and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land  also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours    delta by the author thought to be the land of goshen by these abovenamd passages of holy writ we may without absurdity conclude that the triangular tract of land called delta by the ancients or at least some part thereof is cettainly the same which formerly was dwelt in by the bondagd israelites and bore the appellation of the land of goshen  the common notion of it but many are of an opinion opposite to this and judge the land of goshen to have been that part of egypt situate betwixt grand cairo and the libyan deserts why absurd not to enter into a dispute on that account i only shall beg leave to make one observation and that is a country so extremely barren nor productive of the smallest mark of competent increase much less of flowing plenty cannot reasonably be imagined reconcilable to the ideas of fertility we take from the accounts the scriptures give us of the land of goshen  proceed we now from egypt to the holy land to which the common passage from grand cairo lies through part of idumaea and the dangerous deserts of arabia the stony  the way of traveling in caravans caravans which i have elsewhere in this book explained the meaning of pass to and fro continually and afford conveniences for christian travelers who either ride upon a camel or a dromedary not unlike it but a little smaller certain bails of merchandise are bound on either side the shoulders of the beast and in the hollow thence occasioned there is placed a kind of quilt or cushion whereupon we are obliged to ride crossleggd defended from the sun by a large canopy of canvass purposely erected  it is a very toilsome and fatiguing way of traveling by reason of the native height of trott peculiar to those creatures who without the smallest sign of discontent will travel four whole days together destitute of water but upon occasion can so far exert this blessing of their nature as to live without it near a fortnight  the caravans how ordered the caravans which pass from palestine to egypt commonly consist of six seven eight nine hundred or a thousand persons with their camels and conveniences which we must all provide from the brasskettle to the drying pan if we would eat or drink with christian decency an admirable order is observed among them and continual watch kept night and day to guard the caravan from the attacks and robberies of the wild arabs who infest the desert and of whom i shall more fully treat when i am come to the description of their laws and ways of living  jews who go to die at jerusalem it is really a diverting entertainment for a sprightly fancy to observe what multitudes of superstitious jews swarm up and down in every caravan the oldest ugliest and most decrepit of all mankind who flock from every distant corner of the spacious universe to die as near jerusalem as possible and load themselves and other beasts of burden with the musty bones and tattered relics of their dead relations  three castles in the deserts you traverse desert sands and miserable countries for about a tendaysjourney then arrive at gaza in the holy land first passing by three several castles strongly garrisoned who claim a certain sum by way of toll from every passenger both for himself and camels nor is this the only trouble travelers are subject to for such is the prodigious power and inhumane nature of the upstart officers commanding in these places that they never fail exacting with the utmost insolence and avarice whatever force makes easy to their rapine the necessity of a passport from the bashaw of cairo so that every stranger who would travel unoffended from grand cairo to jerusalem must purchase a full passport from the great bashaw residing at the first of those two towns by which he may be sure of a protection though he meets with no respect but if imprudently he ventures undefended by the virtue of that necessary safeguard ten to one the persecutions he must meet with damp his curiosity and he returns deep laden with repentance in the room of satisfaction  chap xxxix of the present state of the holy land palestine justly called holy by the christians at last the reader is arrived in palestine the land which anciently was chosen by the voice of god himself for the possession of a people whom he long distinguished by an undeserved partiality of favor and affection a country justly called the holy land by christian piety because our savior blessed her cities with his residence and conversation and in this selected climate paid the debt of an assumed humanity in ignominious death and bitter agonies  not else deserving of the title but far from holy has it ever been if we consider the rebellious principles incorrigible strange and unexampled wickedness of the unhappy jews her old inhabitants a nation disregarding laws imposed by god himself who in their very sight vouchsafed to hold a conversation with their more religious leader the neglected moses  the obstinacy of the jews a nation who in midst of the possession of those showring happinesses consequent to the increasing favor of their great creator and delivered by amazing proofs of his affection nay defended in their greatest perils by a thousand miracles and often repeated marks of the almightys mercy i say a nation who possessing these and many more peculiar blessings could amidst their obligations slight their duty and neglecting him from whom they boasted all their fortune deviate from the rules he set before them to the shameful practices of black idolatry  how greatly punished but as the heinous nature of these peoples sins exceeded far the most enormous crimes of other nations so does that surprising punishment inflicted on them full as much exceed the misery which even the most despised and wretched outcasts of the spacious universe are forced to suffer  strangers in their own country abhorred in the society and banished from the habitations of mankind in general they wander miserably up and down possess no property and wish no excellence in any art but that of cheating scorned and persecuted wheresoeer they come and to so shocking a degree the tennisballs of fortune and unpitied exiles of the world that they are no where greater strangers than in palestine it self of old the right of their subverted ancestors and making them while they possessed her not alone the pride but terror of the universe  not any country of the habitable world is known to have been subject to so many changes or has felt the ill effects of such stupendous bloody and successive revolutions as if the just allwise and mighty hand of heaven inflicted never resting torments on the place for having been the scene of our redeemers sufferings by the insolent decrees and obstinate stupidity of her inhumane natives  palestine in the turks possession among the many changes she has felt she groans at present under the severest weight of galling slavery that ever she was subject to entirely in possession of the turks and governed by bashaws sangiacks and other officers in all degrees presiding and exerting their authority as in the other countries subject to the government of the unlimited grand signior  how inhabited at present her old inhabitants eradicated wholly by successive shocks of war and poverty have left the ancient seats of their possession to be peopled by a mixture of the scum and refuse of most other eastern nations such as greeks armenians moors egyptians and the like for turks there are but very few among them nor would those continue there but out of a design to plunder and exact as much as possible from the unhappy wretches subject to their tyranny  the soil itself changed nor is the once sublime and flourishing condition of her ancient government the only thing which time has changed to this surprising disadvantage even the land itself as if a curse from heaven attended the detested climate has disrobed her surface of those amiable beauties and attracting excellencies of fertility and prospect which in former times were wont to crown not only the valleys but the very hills and rocks themselves with a productive gayety  reflections methoughts it grieved me when i trod the paths which in forgotten ages have perhaps been traced by the repeated footsteps of the ancient patriarchs and their posterity methoughts i say it grieved me then to think that lands of old possessed by the religious patrons of gods holy doctrine should now be owned by the defiling outcasts of humanity by swarms of infidels  it shocked me strangely when i cast my eye from hill to hill about the country and beheld almost on every mountain the remaning ruins of some chalky fabric mourning as it were its founders downfall it shocked me when i saw such rugged relics of oerturnd antiquity and yet by what my guides informed me was obliged in looking on them to reflect there once stood jericho in all her grandeur there damascus anciently erected her aspiring head there stood the famed metropolis of israel bright samaria and in former ages yonder despicable heap of ruins was the proud jerusalem  moral reflections oh how can man be led to flatter his ambitious passions with the groundless hopes of riches permanence or an unshockd possession of the smiles of fortune when that very ground is grown a dunghill for the filth of nature which the promises of heaven and the god of abraham confirmed to his posterity with the repeated character of a land that flowed with milk and honey and the strong assurances that it should dwell with him and with his seed for ever  bread made of roots i know not whether it proceeds from the defect of nature in some wondrous alteration of the soils fertility or universal negligence or want of skill in those inhabitants who now possess it to improve it as they ought to do but this is certain that the land is so extremely barren or deficient in producing corn that for the space of many miles about jerusalem the people eat no other bread than what is made of beans or certain roots of an unsavory relish but they say of mighty virtue as to the effects they have on those who eat them  it is indeed a diet only fit for those mean slaves whose abject souls can stoop to servitude with a regardless easiness and such alone would condescend to live among such arbitrary tyrants as oppress all kinds of people by extortion and injustice in this miserable country  rapine encouraged in turkey it is true the practice of unbounded rapine is allowed nay even encouraged in the mildest scenes of turkish government but here in so particular a manner that honor power and riches can by no means be obtained but by the help of such unjust and wicked courses as by universal custom are become not only safe but fashionable  the evil consequences of example and indeed where not alone licentious education tolerates an evil but an universal approbation justifies its practice it is a task extremely difficult for any man to shun the common course of vice he sees before him an evil conversation and the ill examples set mankind deceive their senses into an opinion that such practices are just as they see common hence injustice is become so natural to the turkish government and hence we find how useful it would be for all young men to study well the precepts of theognis in the following verses the advice of theognis           cyrnus i will kindly teach those rules to thee which good men taught my unsiedgd infancy be wise nor power nor wealth nor honor gain from deeds whose foul injustice all will stain be careful next ill company to shun but to a good mans converse always run eat drink and sit with him and still take care to make your court to such as powerful are from good mens conversation good will flow whilst with the ill you lose what you already know   proceed we now to take a view of the remaining tokens of antiquity and zeal which yet adorn the modern state of lost jerusalem  chap xl of jerusalem the sacred antiquities therein contained and the entertainment of strangers in the christian monastery on mountcalvary old jerusalems condition now reader we are come to a description of the celebrated queen of ancient cities whose aspiring turrets raised her pride beyond a rival whose peculiar blessings spoke her long the mistress of command and glory of the universe whose impious walls contained the scene of our redeemers agonies and shook with earthquakes at his mighty crucifixion  how different from the modern but now alas she can no longer boast those gayeties of nature and combining art which swelled her excellence in former ages all those bright and towering marks of splendor and authority are sunk to nothing rocky barrenness now stares a stranger wildly in the face where once he might have charmed his senses with a glittering prospect of refined magnificence and craggy precipices in the very midst of this depopulated scene of sorrow seem to groan out in complaining murmurs mortal glory comes up and is cut down like a flower and passes away like a shadow and is no more seen  reflections on jerusalem oh poor unhappy city great even in the memory of what thou once were thought deserving of how fully have thou seen accomplished the prophetic sentence of thy crucified director oh how much better had it been for thy deluded natives to have listened gratefully to the repeated woes denounced against them then had thy splendid temple stood unshockd and not exposed to verify a sentence which had she deserved no overthrow had never been inflicted math    chapter v   verily verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down  how evident alas are all thy miseries how vainly do thou groan in an unpitied ruin and how stupidly inactive must be that mans fancy who beholding thee surrounded by thy present curses does not mournfully reflect how much in vain our tender savior pitied thy misfortunes when he breathed these piercing proofs of heavenly compassion mildly over thee math    chapter v       o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and ye would not  behold your house is left unto you desolate    the shocking weight of those oppressions thou art subject to give lively proofs of the just cause our blessed savior had to say weep not for me but for your selves o ye daughters of jerusalem  new jerusalem how situated modern jerusalem has changed her situation from the very ground on which the old one stood for when she flourished in her ancient grandeur mount moriah and mount sion stood directly in the center of the city and the mount called calvary the place of crucifixion was without the northern gate at a considerable distance but the new jerusalem is built so much more toward the north that sion is without the wall upon the south side of the modern city and mount calvary now stands almost directly in the middle  the castle of jerusalem upon the right hand of the western gate there stands an old decayed castle inconsiderately garrisoned and mounted with a useless number of great pieces of artillery  the walls and gates how fortified the walls are weak and all the town much stronger by her natural situation than the art wherewith she has of late been fortified the gates are guarded by a constant number of foot soldiers and defended by the largest of their cannon the remaining houses for i cannot say there is a street now standing are of very low and humble fabric built of mud and not exceeding one poor story widely straggling from each other and without the smallest sign of order or an aim of regularity  some broken remnants of old buildings which the natives tell us were the palace of king david theater of herod and the like serve only to remind a traveller that once jerusalem was what she now is not no jews suffered to inhabit jerusalem no jews are suffered to inhabit here the town being wholly peopled by zealous christian bigotts of promiscuous nations and such turks as dwelling there in hopes to use an arbitrary power to the best advantage are subservient to the government of a sangiack or deputy provincial  since then there is not any thing uncommon in the form of government here practiced and abundance of our modern writers have described the place with geographic nicety and as for the historical accounts thereof they are already fully known i will purposely omit the naming any thing but what is shown most travelers as relics of antiquity which i believe is what an english reader will receive most welcomely at least it is what i chiefly aimed at in this treatise and will consequently lead me into no unnecessary deviation from the tenor of my subject  first then i will inform my reader what we see within jerusalem and round about it not including the franciscan monastery on mount calvary or near it secondly at large describe both that the sepulcher of christ the temple over it and every other thing worth notice thereunto belonging  the father guardian why so called i should first inform you that the chief of the franciscan monastery is entitled to the name of father guardian from the privilege he has of granting his protection to all christian travelers whether protestants or roman catholics who are constantly obliged as long as they continue in the city to take up with a monastic entertainment in the convent for a stranger not of the mohammedan persuasion is not suffered to reside in any of the turkish houses or indeed in any other corner of jerusalem  the convent at jerusalem how maintained the europaean princes of the romish church contribute largely toward the maintenance of these religious friars who expect rewards of far more worth than is the entertainment which they give to travelers and least such gentlemen as curiosity has led to see jerusalem should possibly be ignorant of what is still expected from their purses they are ever careful by repeated declaration of their poverty and want of christian charity on all occasions to insinuate how welcomely they would receive a generous gratuity  how the friars live there thus live they easily in flowing plenty using all the pampering gifts of liberal nature with an unreservd and gratifying luxury which is so fully known to the designing turkish governors that they are seldom found to miss the smallest opportunity of squeezing their possessions to the best advantage  a ceremony used to strangers these politic franciscans versed politely in the well dissembled practice of a great humility receive all strangers with a wonderful respect the father guardian always condescending by a long continued custom to kneel down and wash their feet while others wipe them many of the order standing round devoutly singing certain hymns appointed for that purpose  how they are treated after this a certain number of the friars are directed by their padre to accompany the strangers up and down within the city and without and show them every place worth observation which they constantly perform with admirable artifice appearing wondrous civil and exciting those they guide to think their curiosity a meritorious zeal in hopes thereby that others may at their return to their respective countries be induced to undertake a journey thither and by that means swell the perquisites of their dependence to additional abundance  a question always asked at jerusalem it is a question always asked if you design your visit to those holy places from a motive of religious zeal or common curiosity if from the first they pester you with beads and other superstitious tokens of devotion which direct the strict injunction of repeating two four six eight ten or twenty pater nosters at such and such more sacred or less holy places but if you assure them that the latter motive tempted you to travel thither they are complaisantly passive in the matter and accompany you about from place to place without observing your deportment in them  a register kept in the monastery the friars of this monastery keep a register wherein they enter both the names and country of such travelers as visit the renowned jerusalem it is impossible to know exactly the just number of our countrymen who have been there because the different inclinations of some men engage them to pretend themselves italians when they are really spaniards french men when they are britons and renounce their countries for some ends which they believe most prudent  how many english men have been there these hundred years however we were suffered to look back upon the books which have been kept these hundred years last past and found there entered to the best of my remembrance one hundred and ninety eight who since that time have in their travels from the english shore had will and opportunity to see jerusalem  the sacred relics ancient buildings or whatever else deserves remark are these which follow eagerly asserted by the priests to be the same whose reputation they have taken on them  herods palace the glorious palace of the haughty herod speaks in a decay not quite so bad as ruin the unbounded pride of its imperious founder there still remain some rooms entirely whole particularly that wherein he used to sit enthroned beneath a canopy and listned to the business of his numerous addressers near which they show another square but low roofd chamber where our savior christ derided by the scoffs of impious villains was saluted on the knee with the ironical address of hail king of the jews  some stately arches prove the architecture to have been magnificent and lofty and the place is now so well repaired that it is the residence of the sangiack or turkish governor  solomons temple they show a building which they call the temple of solomon but are neither suffered to go in themselves or gain admittance for a christian traveller not even though bribery an almost never failing orator among the turks should plead for the permission  pontius pilates house the house of pontius pilate still remains and there they show the place where stood our savior when they crowned him with the thorns and bound him to a pillar which supported the apartment but oh shocking thought and strange effect of times vast changes that very place where christ was scourged by the command of pilate is at present made a shop where an old man of seventy years of age frys cakes in oil and sells them in the street to common people  the pool of bethesda inclining to the east side of the city stands the celebrated pool of bethesda now almost dried up and filled with rubbish where the angel formerly descended and by troubling the waters made them efficacious in the cure of great diseases  the melancholy way with melancholy sighs we walked along the melancholy way through which our savior passed oerloaden with the burden of his cross in order to the tragedy of his stupendous crucifixion here we pass by an old ruinated place where lived the pious veronica who beheld when christ went by that he was fainting with his load and brought him out a napkin to wipe off the sweat from his afflicted face which napkin amongst other relics is retained and shown to strangers in the chapel of the monastery  the houses of simon and lazarus next stand almost contiguous to each other two old heaps of building in the first whereof they say lived lazarus whom christ restored to life when he had long been buried and the other they report to have been formerly the habitation of that simon who perceiving jesus faint before his door took up the cross and bore it for him to the place of execution  the virgins chapel hard by there stands a chapel dedicated to the virgin mary where they say she stood to see her son go by in order to be crucified and swoond when she beheld him  st peters prison the prison where st peter was confined is still remaining and employed at present by the turks for the same purpose here they show a hole cut deeply in the wall to which they would ridiculously force you to believe the chain was fastened which was used in binding the imprisoned saint abovenamd and not far distant from this place they show a remnant of the judgment gate through which our savior was conducted to the sentence of his condemnation  the house of annas they show the house wherein our savior visiting one annas then its owner stumbling accidentally and almost falling down a little precipice in order to support himself laid hold on the sharp corner of a wall the stones whereof to this day bear a mark which represents the print of his four fingers if we may depend on the assurances our friars gave us  a miraculous stone the house of simon the pharisee contains a stone whereon appears the print of a mans foot the mark they told us which our savior made when standing on it he forgave the sins of mary magdalene it seems the sacred virtues of this stone are so extraordinary that though the turks have frequently attempted to remove it from its place it has not only strangely baffled all their efforts but when once the governor himself a mighty enemy to any who professed christianity endeavored it with obstinacy flames of fire broke fiercely from the floor and scorched away his resolution  the room where the virgin mary was born beneath the hollow of a certain rock on which was built the house of joahim and anna there is shown a small low square apartment where was born the virgin mary as the fathers told us  st mark and st james they show the ruins of a little chapel situated where st mark once lived and not far from it a small church first founded by the spaniards in commemoration of st james and dedicated to him for i think they say it stands upon the ground on which he was beheaded  these as far as i remember are the most remarkable of all the places we were shown within the city i will now proceed to give you an account of others equally deserving observation which are found without the walls at several distances  a monastery in the place where jesus met the two disciples in the road to emaus in the road to emaus westward of jerusalem near six miles there stands a monastery founded by the pious empress helena directly on the place where jesus met his two disciples not far from hence they show a valley where they say was fought the famous battle before which the sun and moon stood still at the desire of joshua  the sepulcher of the prophets at five miles distance from the northwestgate are several hollow caves cut deeply in the bottom of large rocky mountains one whereof was formerly the sepulcher of the inspired and celebrated jewish prophets  the burying place of the kings of judah almost directly opposite to that remains the burying place of the renowned and formidable kings of judah which is entered by a square descent of near five foot each way  a narrow passage this leads us through a passage somewhat narrower and still descending with no little difficulty by reason of great heaps of rubbish driven by time to choke the entrance the passage fifteen foot in length is terminated by a broad and lofty level arched above and benchd though roughly upon either side  a wonderful door the end of this large place which i may term a gallery admits you to a very wide and graceful chamber which you must descend to from the gallery by two or three stonesteps of admirable workmanship this chamber has a door belonging to it which we found quite open of an exquisite contrivance made entirely of the rock it self with hinges of the same on which it moves though of prodigious weight and bulk with an incredible facility  on either side the chamber into which you are admitted by the three stone steps abovenamd stand the monuments of such as formerly were buried there the number is considerable and the order they are ranged in very regular  description of the tombs the tombs are formed alike and of a magnitude exactly equal they are smaller otherwise they differ little from the monument of porphyry i mentioned in the chapter of the pyramids of egypt some retain their covers still upon them others have been opened by the eager curiosity of christian travelers  characters within them upon the insides of them all we found decypherd certain unintelligible characters which could we have interpreted their meaning might have probably informed us who was buried in each stony and capacious hollow that they were the kings of juda we have no great cause to disbelieve but that among them were interred king david and his son the mighty solomon as the too credulous inhabitants of palestine are taught by their tradition appears too widely distant from the reach of probability to fix a reputation on the groundless notion  the corpse found in them however it is certain that at breaking open any of these tombs we may be sure to find the body of a man embalmed and uncorrupted but extremely different from the mummies found in the egyptian catacombs for these are so incredibly diminished both in bulk and stature that they scarce retain the bare resemblance of the shape they once were masters of  a melancholy sight the broken pieces and disjointed bones left carelessly about the bottom of some tombs afford a very odd and melancholy prospect and in others the remaining firmness of the jointless bodies light and thin like some dried fish which i have seen in england gave our thoughts a mournful subject for the following contemplations contemplations on it is this alas our boasted mortal state is it for this we covet to be great what happiness from envied grandeur springs when these poor relics once were mighty kings o frail uncertainty of human power while graves can majesty it self devour while death distinguishes nor sex nor birth and regal graces moulder into earth alas how strange how sad a change is here in what a dress does royalty appear o where is now the globe of thy command or where the scepter that adorned this hand where is now the crown which once these temples bound or where those trailing robes which swept the ground where are those brawny guards which awed thy state and where those cringing crowds which once were proud to wait are those thin jaws the same which used to treat thy pampered palate with such choice of meat can narrow limits such as these contain the changed extent of thy once larger reign can thou at whose least frown a nation shook and dreaded lightning from thy stormy look can thou alas be passively content to let intruders search thy monument thou who were once too great for vulgar touch can thy proud majesty be changed so much that common men unknown to kings like you thus poize you turn you round and wonder at the view   bethlehem how situated west from jerusalem about six miles stands the renowned and ancient bethlehem our redeemers birthplace and upon the road which leads you to it you are made to observe the following relics of antiquity by your guides the friars who attend you thither  solomons aquaeduct the ruins of a great and noble aquaeduct which formerly brought water to the celebrated temple of the glorious solomon appear between two rocky mountains every here and there delightfully conspicuous high above the superficies of a flowery valley  bathshebas fountain the fountain where bathsheba washed her self when david spied her from a neighboring turret still continues extant or at least a spring inheriting its reputation by the virtue of tradition and a little higher on the summit of the utmost corner of mount sion stand the ruins of the tower whence she was discovered by that powerful monarch  elias s rock another rarity they show most travelers is a large rock whereon they zealously affirm the prophet elias used to sleep and to confirm the story they oblige us to take notice of some natural hollows which are found upon the rock created as they say by the miraculous impression that the prophets body made in his repeated slumbers  jacobs house the ruins of a church or monastery point out the ground whereon in former ages stood the house of the old patriarch jacob and the tomb of rachel stands within six furlongs of this place not far from which the town of rama where the voice was heard of rachel weeping for her children still continues a considerable village  these and many other rarities of venerable age and sacred virtue if the priests may be believed upon their verbum sacerdotis give a stranger frequent opportunities of gazing round him in the road which lies between jerusalem and bethlehem to which last however we are now arrived  a temple built by helena at bethlehem directly in the place where stood the inn in one of whose mean stables the neglected virgin mary was obliged to lie when she so greatly blessed the sinful world in our dear savior christs nativity the pious helena that happy mother of the glorious constantine erected long time since a stately temple representing in its form the figure of a cross near which is built a little monastery now possessed by certain friars of franciscan order and in all kinds of the same fraternity with those i mentioned in the convent at jerusalem  three dismal grottos they give all strangers torches in their hands and lead them through a narrow dark and winding passage to three several grottos one a vault wherein they say the children murdered by the barbarous decree of herod were thrown headlong to be buried and within the second stand the tombs of good st jerome and his scholar famed eusebius the confessor the last cave containing nothing but a monument erected over the grave of the fair convert paula a great roman lady of the noblest extract who together with her son eustochius was interred at bethlehem were she built four monasteries and endowed them richly which are now entirely ruined  the birth place and manger of christ within a little space of the abovenamd grottos you descend to a large chapel flaggd with marble gilt and ornamented in the richest manner here they show the very spot of ground whereon the virgin was delivered of her son the holy jesus with the manger into which she laid him and the place where it is reported that the wise men of the east directed thither by a star knelt down and worshipped whilst they offered up their presents  jacobs meadow it is at bethlehem that they show the field where jacob sed his flock and where the angels visiting the shepherds ravished them with the transporting news of our great saviors blessed nativity the field to this day bears the name of jacobs meadow  josephs house not a mile without the town they show the house where joseph lived before he fled to egypt and the cave wherein he hid the virgin and her son while he prepared conveniences for his intended journey  many other places worth remark besides the places which i have already mentioned there are many others equally deserving observation but as it would oblige me to an inexcusable prolixity should i so much as name them all i will omit enlarging any farther than to give you a description of some certain things which justly claim the readers notice who may rest assured that not one memorable place in scripture has escaped the knowledge of the zealous romans and bigoted christians of some other churches who will boldly undertake to show you almost every thing you possibly can ask for  acceldama or the field of blood sovth of jerusalem and not far distant from the walls thereof is that cursed piece of ground of old acceldama the field of blood a purchase made by the reward of villainy returned again by the repenting judas this in former times the scriptures tell us was employed as a receptacle for the dead bodies of all kind of strangers  a burying place for christians nor has time had power to change the use to which it was ordained so long ago it is still the common burying place of all those christians undistinguished by the name of franks that is all such as are the subjects or at least the tributary slaves of the grand signior  how walled round the field is all enclosed by a stone wall of mighty thickness roofd with art so very closely that there is no passage to the soil within it but by certain holes considerably broad which rise like cupolas upon the top and are from time to time set open in a different place to let down such dead bodies as have right to be interred within that compass corpse that rot in a days time where the earth is certainly endued with such a penetrative virtue that in two days time the soundest body of a man or woman will be eaten to a skeleton  to search the causes which may probably produce this odd effect is devious from my subject i will therefore only tell you that the stench is so offensive that it is no agreeable amusement to inspect that horrid mansion of corruption yet we ventured to look down the hole which then stood open and discovered as distinctly as the places duskiness could possibly permit the lately buried bodies of some six or seven persons a horrid prospect four of which were so far skeletons that there appeared the shless bones in many places and the rest were coming on to such degree that they appeared half rotten and afforded such a strange and dismal spectacle that we were frighted from the thoughts of an exact remark or curious observation  shiploads of earth the roman catholics have frequently exported whole shiploads of this prodigious soil which has been long known publicly at rome and paris and at pisa i my self have seen a churchyard covered four foot deep therewith in which they used to bury persons only of an high distinction  other sepulchers besides the sepulchers abovenamd all the rocks for a considerable distance round this place are full of caves against the mouth of every one of which is rolled a stone of ponderous magnitude according to the ancient custom mentioned in the holy scriptures  it would be endless to enumerate the many venerable places shown a traveller on every side without jerusalem i will only therefore say in general that we saw them all but took a more than common notice of the following places  memorable places the valley of jehosaphat the old oak roguel the pool of siloa the sepulcher of zachariah and the stately pillar which was built by absalom with a design to eternize his memory before the period of his black rebellion  other memorable places we likewise saw mount olivet the famous gethsemane and the garden where our blessed savior was betrayed by judas with the place whereon he prayed in his amazing agony the village bethany the place where the repenting judas was interred and a remainder of the tree whereon he hanged himself bethphage the place where once stood bethphage a considerable village whence our savior on an asses colt came riding to jerusalem  let these suffice to give the reader an idea of the entertainment christian travelers receive who led by curiosity or sometimes zeal engage the friars to direct their notice to the most considerable relics of esteemed antiquity helenas temple proceed we now to take a view of the beforenamd temple founded on mount calvary a very low but craggy hill all cut and polished from its ancient form for the convenience of building this illustrious temple which was left by the religious helena a memorable monument of the respect she bore professed christianity  its situation the temple is magnificent and covers not the hill alone but a considerable part of the surrounding plain one side whereof was that into whose unfrequented wildnesses the ancient jews were used to throw the stripped dead bodies of their executed malefactors from which common custom it received the name it bore of old when it was called the valley of carcasses  its description the finest buildings of the temple front the south the roof thereof is arched and stately ornamented in two places by a couple of indifferently large but somewhat ruinated cupolas the one to be ascended by a kind of staircase on the outward side the other open at the top and rising from the chapel which encompasses the sepulcher of christ  two tombs you pay a certain sum of money to the turkish officers who grant a license for your entrance which you have no sooner made than you perceive upon your right hand an old fashioned tomb and on your left another which enclose the bodies of the famous godfrey of bulloigne and king baldwin his successor the two first christian monarchs of redeemed jerusalem  upon the tomb of godfrey on the right hand as i said before is found the following latin epitaph godfrey of bulls epitaph hic jacet inclytus godefridvs de bvglion qvi tot am is it am terram ac qvisivit cvltvi christiano cvjvs anima reqviescat in pace amen here lies the famous godfrey of bulloigne who conquered all this country to the christian worship o may his soul rest in peace amen   the other monument upon the left hand of the entrance tells the traveller it is king baldwins by the following inscription king baldwins epitaph rex baldwinvs jvdas alter machabevs spes patriae vigor ecclesiae virtues vtrivsque qvem formidabant cvi dona tribvta ferebant cedar egypti dan ac homicida damascvs proh dolor in modico clavditvr hoctvmvlo another judas machabeus famed for glorious acts like his king baldwin named his countrys hope and churchs champion too in whom united both their honor knew whom cedar the egyptian dan nay more damascus with her homicidian store whom all these feared and to whose powerful sway their willing duties constant tribute pay alas in this small tomb is shut from day   the rent in the rock not far from those two monuments you rise upon mount calvary and there are shown the cleaving of the rock which split asunder at our saviors crucifixion naturally rough and plainly proving art could have no hand in the prodigious rent wherein they tell us was discovered adams head which had been buried there unknown to mortals till the death of jesus  christian chapels farther in the temple there are many chapels or divisions constantly inhabited by several different sects of christians who imagining it is a very meritorious act to spend their lives within the temple of the holy sepulcher embrace confinement and possess apartments independent each on other never stirring but on great occasions from the altars of their worship  the hole wherein was placed the cross of christ the highest of these chapels checkered over with a various colored marble which they will not let you walk upon with shoes is built upon the very spot of ground on which our savior suffered on the cross the hollow of the rock wherein the cross was placed remains unbroken richly plated with the finest silver gilt and piercing through the midst of a large remnant of the cliff which was not cut away at the foundation of the chapel but continues whole near half a yard above the superficies of the marble pavement  the ceremonies there performed by pilgrims here it is that christian pilgrims in a zealous extacy are seen to practice airs and postures not much differing from down right madness rolling up and down with strange extravagance endeavoring to creep as near the hole as possibly they can embracing kissing and half deluging with tears the solid stones as if they knew them not to be insensible and would extract a sympathetic sorrow from their rocky hardness  the two thieves crosses on either side of the abovenamd hole there stands a cross directly in the places where the thieves who suffered with our savior hung in crucifixion here as in the other chapels of the temple they adorn the sides and roof with a considerable stock of ever burning lamps the melancholy air of which appearance helps to strike a sacred terror through the breasts of all who enter  the place where christ was nailed upon the cross another chapel entered through the former brings you to the place where christ was laid upon the ground and nailed as usual upon the cross he died on on the floor which is composed of many colored marbles you perceive the figure of the cross directly as the priests assured us in the place whereon lay that which this is but designed to represent the form of here again the pilgrims of both sexes exercise their vigor in those zealous kind of motions i described so lately  another sacred place within a little distance from these places you are shown a marble stone which covers as they say that very spot of ground whereon the virgin mary stood when from the cross our savior recommended her and his beloved disciple to a mutual love from that time forward  the sepulcher of christ how enclosed you pass by many little chapels through abundance of large pillars to the sepulcher of christ enclosed by a small temple upon which is built the open cupola i lately mentioned the wood thereof is cedar and the chapel quite surrounded by a range of cornishd marble pillars standing close against the wall and thence affording something that deserves the name of ornament  description of the sepulcher directly in the midst appears the sepulcher of our blessed savior hewn by manual labor in the rock it self near two yards long and one in breadth twas anciently exposed to public view unpolished and in native roughness but is now politely covered with a spacious marble to preserve it from the zealous robberies of such religious pilgrims as imputing a miraculous effect to the possession of such holy relics often used to break away small pieces of the rocky sepulcher  placed in a narrow space the tomb not quite a yard in height enclosed in such a narrow space as scarce affords sufficient room for four to kneel is now converted to an altar ornamented brightly with a constant number of fine lamps the dark effects of whose perpetual smoke have daubed the roof with an unsightly blackness  the stone which the angel rolled away near the entrance in the middle of the floor there lies a stone near two foot square whereon some say the angels sat when they declared that christ was risen others would persuade us to believe twas that which had been rolled against the entrance of the sepulcher according to the jewish custom though they showed us in another place a stone which has with more success assumed that reputation  the pillar of christs scourging not far from hence they show the remnant of a broken pillar which is said to be a part of that whereto they bound our savior while they scourged him it is four foot long and veind with dusky clouds but sprinkled on one side with certain spots of reddish color which they would persuade us to believe were made by the most precious blood of the reviled and tortured jesus  the honor paid the relic this relic is enclosed within an iron grate through which it must be touched by nothing but a certain stick the priests provide you with which being thence immediately conveyed to pilgrims mouths is steadfastly believed of never failing power to infuse a certain balmy virtue to the soul of him who blesses his internal faculties by kissing eagerly the holy stick which has been honored with the touch of such a sacred relic  knights of the sepulcher there was a custom instituted in the year one thousand and ninety nine of constituting gentlemen knights of the sepulcher by kneeling on the place and taking there a certain oath to be eternal champions of the church of christ and lead a life sincerely pious and continue members of the roman catholic religion which with certain other ceremonies such as girding on a sword and hanging a gold cross about his neck being performed by the father guardian of the franciscan monastery upon mount calvary he rises dignified with that religious quality  by whom instituted the sovereigns of this once respected order were the kings of france who instituted it originally but when the avarice of the priests inclined them to accept of any man how mean soever who desired the honor of this sacred knighthood could he but afford to bribe them highly it became at last so very common that twas disregarded by degrees now almost disused and now is very rarely practiced or so much as sought for  christs prison they show a little low and darksome grotto hewn but roughly in the body of the rock wherein they say our savior was confined betwixt the hour of his sentence and moment of his crucifixion  the place where they cast lots for his garments here likewise is the place wherein the soldiers cast their lotts according to the custom then in practice with the jews for our condemned redeemers garments not far from thence the bottom of a tedious narrow pair of stairs cut also from the rock it self admits you to a kind of gallery supported by four marble pillars of a greyish color which for ever sweating or emitting a perpetual moisture by the native dampness of the subterraneous place wherein they stand are shown to strangers for a miracle weeping pillars and said to weep with sorrow for our saviors crucifixion  the place where they found the cross upon the southern side of calvary eleven stone stairs admit you to a vault which helena first founded on that part of the valley of carcasses wherein among vast heaps of rubbish bones of men and mossy stones they found the cross of christ and those of the two thieves who had been crucified with him after they had lain unthought of and forgotten full three hundred years or somewhat upwards  the conclusion i think that having said thus much it would be needlessly prolix to tire the reader with additional relations little else deserving a peculiar observation gives me opportunity to swell the subject i have dwelt so long upon and which when i beheld the numerous scenes of our redeemers sufferings possessed my bosom with an ardent flame of zeal for that religion he so dearly fixed amongst us by his death and passion  grant indulgent god of my desires that i may long retain a fresh idea of those moving scenes which stirred the passions of my melting nature to a lively sense of duty and affection for that compassionate and tender savior who descended from his father to assume the frailties of a weak humanity and died for the offenses of an undeserving race of stubborn sinners  nothing more worth viewing nothing after you have seen all this can tempt your stay in sad jerusalem you therefore take your leave of the franciscan friars who pretend an humble condescension to all kinds of people but have often given demonstrative occasion to the protestants who travel thither to mistrust the truth of their fairfronted compliments by the miscarriage of some englishmen whole companies of whom have died within one week i fear by other motives than the complaisant intention of accompanying one another to the other side mortality  chap xli of the cities of palestine as they now are i now proceed to let the reader know that such as is jerusalem just now described such also are the other cities of this miserable country once they flourished in a state of glory if not equal yet not much inferior to their famed metropolis but now like her subverted and disrobed of ancient beauties they exhibit to the view of every traveller a melancholy cause of contemplation on the changes mortal excellence is ever subject to and the undoubted truth of senecas asserted maxim sen tra troas quicquid

holy land observe the nicety of geographic regularity but taking first the seaport towns in order as they lie to the southeast of egypt thence come back the other way and so include a full description of as much as now remains worth notice in that tract of land extending as of old from dan even to beersheba  the seaport towns of palestine the most remarkable of such as were of old or still continue seaport towns or near the sea are these which follow gaza which i elsewhere mentioned ascalon and joppa acre tyrus and the celebrated sidon  the inland cities the inland cities anciently of most repute and now remaining most deserving of a strangers observation are no more than these which follow old damascus caesarea nazareth samaria jericho and hebron and to sum up all the famed beersheba  gaza described gaza now called gazra was in ancient times most famous for the wonderful performances of sampsons strength it is situated on a hill and stands amidst the fruitful valleys of a pleasant country inhabited promiscuously by turks and christians it is about a mile in circuit all the houses low and meanly built of muddy substance yet many relics both of marble pillars and a polished kind of porphyry buildings give fair proofs of her magnificence in former ages  ruins of the philistines temple there yet remain upon the hill the splendid ruins of a massy arched and lofty piece of architecture which is generally said to have been anciently the place where sampson standing blind betwixt the pillars to make sport for the philistine noblemen pulled down the house with sudden force and with himself destroyed such mighty numbers of that warlike people  sampsons foxes they show the field wherein the just named sampson tied the foxes tail to tail and burnt the standing corn of the philistines and among the many places famous in his memory oblige you to take notice of a very steep and craggy hill to which when he had been disturbed in gaza he ascended with the city gates upon his brawny shoulders  an old castle there is a castle now remaining founded by king baldwin in the year one thousand one hundred and forty eight a very mean and despicable fabric where the great sangiack of gazra has his residence and rules the city and the country round it with an uncontrolled and arbitrary tyranny  ascalon described about twelve miles southeast of gazra close upon the sea is built the city ascalon now called schalon inhabited by turks and guarded by a kind of fort wherein they keep a ragged garrison this place deserves remark in that it was of old the city where was built the celebrated temple of the great philistine idol dagon part of whose decayed foundations they pretend upon inquiry to point out to travelers it is now a kind of inconsiderable village worth regard for nothing but the garrison the turks maintain to guard their castle  joppa described joppa famous in the scriptures for a sea port town is ill accommodated with a dangerous haven open to the fury of the northern tempests all her buildings are of mud or an unpolished kind of stone of anappearance not agreeable the place is peopled by promiscuous numbers of the turks and christians certain merchants have their dwellings here in order to export such quantities of cotton as they can procure about the country other merchandises they are seldom stocked with annual numbers of the christian pilgrims traveling to visit the sepulcher of christ and other sacred relics at jerusalem are landed here and by their frequent passages maintain but not enrich the miserable natives of this worthless city which is famous for the boasted height of her antiquity reported to have been first built by japhet noahs son or as some say before the deluge  acre described acre is a sea port town directly equidistant from jerusalem and tripolis of syria it is built upon a plain its form triangular two sides whereof the sea for ever washes once it was a place of strength impregnable and fortified by all the helps of art and nature which the mighty ruins still remaining like stupendous mountains well demonstrate  how much blood has been shed there successive seas of blood were shed between the turks and christians in the holy war each side alternately possessing and obliged to quit the fatal city it is now entirely governed by a turkish sangiack and inhabited by men of pretty good condition on account of the convenience the sea affords them of a trade with britain holland france and every other navigating part of christendom  tire described tyrvs the famed metropolis of old phoenicia celebrated anciently for wealth and power and particularly famous for her purple dye which lives so frequently in many of the works of former writers is at present subject to the turkish government and peopled by a mixture of moors greeks and other kinds of christians and mahometans together it is situated close upon the sea to which she opens on her northern side with a delightful and commodious harbor  her ancient state once she was not only gloriously magnificent in all her buildings but surrounded by such numbers of delicious trees and lovely gardens that she seemed to form the very paradise of nature and misled the senses of her proud inhabitants to all the practices of villainy and arrogance which tempted them to live a life of luxury and wallow in the taste of carnal bliss unmindful of a truth the ruinated aspect of her modern figure sadly teaches every stranger who may chance to visit her sen trag thy nulla sors longa est dolor ac voluptas invicem cedunt brevior voluptas ima permutat brevis hora summis no lot is lasting grief and pleasure too alternately each other still pursue but pleasures reign is shortest of the two one short hours change makes meanest things most great   sidon described sidon is of rather more than less antiquity than tire built and named as most agree by sidon canaans eldest son it is situated in a very rich and healthful country not far distant from the cedar mountains of the famous lebanon and upon the other side made pleasant and convenient by the sea which washes it  the modern sidon the present sidon stands on a foundation somewhat distant from the ancient city and is very meanly built and despicably peopled scarce worth mention but upon account of some antiquities particularly an old tomb which they affirm to be the sepulcher of zebulon it stands among the ruinated buildings which appear to mark the place where the proud sidon stood in former ages  its manufactures many merchants here reside exporting yearly quantities of cotton silk and other manufactures the government of sidon the town and country round it are entirely subject to the turkish government but in a manner somewhat different from other places for their great emir or governor possesses an hereditary power and free exercise of a religion between mahometanism and christianity by virtue of a patent granted them on their submission to the turkish yoke when they had long defended those possessions left them by the famous godfrey of bulloigne king of jerusalem who brought them from their native country france to serve as christian soldiers in the holy land where their posterity have in the course of time degenerated both from their religion and their honor to the evil principles and mean subjection they profess at present  description of damascus eastward of sidon two days journey stands damascus situated on a plain well watered and surrounded by a graceful ring of fruitful mountains now the seat of a bashaw and peopled with the wealthiest inland merchants of the turkish empire all her houses are indifferently built of stone or brick unbakd and of a small duration numerous fountains fish ponds orchards gardens avenues and grottos gracefully adorn the celebrated city which of old was famous and in great measure still continues so for the invention or improvement of ingenious arts and useful sciences  the town caesarea caesarea once the famous city dan is now extremely changed to disadvantage by the course of time and overthrow of governments it is notwithstanding still a town of great importance famous for a castle of so strong a situation and contrivance that the turkish sultans looking on it as a kind of berwick upon tweed think fit to honor it with a perpetual mention in the titles they affix to every public proclamation in the following manner i even i the mighty sultan amongst whose numerous places of defense the impregnable castle of caesarea is esteemed the least and in regard to whose vast power the macedonian empire was a very trifle  nazareth in her present condition nazareth the birth place of the blessed virgin scarce deserves a mention upon any other consideration it is situated in a valley all the hills about it craggy and unfruitful not above an hundred houses form the village built at present on the old foundation of the galilean nazareth  how inhabited poor are the people who inhabit here a mixed conjunction of the turks and christians yet the last by far the fewest nothing here deserves remark but certain venerable ruins on the hills adjoining and a kind of chapel which they say is built upon that very spot of ground whereon stood formerly the virgin marys house and room of her nativity  samaria as at present samaria lying almost in the center of the holy land continues still a formidable city peopled only by mahometans and but in that it is somewhat strong deserving no mans observation as to any thing but some fine ruins of antiquity which seem to have been formerly no less than kingly palaces by their remaining marks of faded royalty  the city jericho amidst a spacious valley nine miles broad upon the ground where once stood jericho we found a miserable little village near the wilderness wherein is situated the prodigious mountain quarantania an italian etymology now called quarantania because twas from the top thereof the devil tempted christ by showing him the kingdoms of the universe and urging him without success to think on sin for forty days together  jericho was once a place of fame and the surrounding country tolerably fertile now the very face of nature is so strangely altered that the piercing scarcity of all lifes necessaries tempting the poor arabs who inhabit the rough mountains round it to make prey on all such passengers as they can overcome by downright force or subtle ambuscadoes it is become so dangerous an undertaking to attempt a journey thither and the place it self so barren and unpleasant that it gave occasion in the holy war for the original of an old proverb the original of the proverb would you were at jericho when you would revenge your self on any man who has affronted you to say in england would you were at jericho  hebron described hebron which was once the residence of david till his conquest of the jebusites possessed him of jerusalem stands not many miles from gaza nor far distant from the celebrated lake of sodom and gomorrah the place is held in much esteem and often visited with wondrous veneration by bigoted jews who hold it as a meritorious deed to make a pilgrimage on no account but to perform a kind of ceremonious mourning over the tombs of their old patriarchs who here lie buried  a pleasant place nothing certainly can yield a more delightful prospect than those lovely valleys fruitful hills large plains and flowery meadows which combining the perfections of their natural beauty seem to paint the land round hebron with so odd a gayety that even the dullest eye is sweetly ravished with an object so delightful  bersheba as at present bersheba opposite to gaza and the southern boundary of old judea now distinguished by the name of geheblin remains an inconsiderable village boasting neither relics of her own antiquity nor tasting the advantages of other cities in her traffic situation or the character she bears when put in competition with the places i have treated of  and now i think i have as briefly as is possible described as largely as is necessary all those cities of the hapless holy land which may deserve remark or bear regard enough in modern servitude to claim a place in the remembrance of a traveller  i cannot help repeating the concern i had upon me to behold this country once the seat of justice and religion groan in a subjection to the enemies of both it is true the jews her old inhabitants had more deserved a strangers pity had they less invited their foretold destruction for we may be allowed to say with seneca sen tra hip quem fata cogunt ille cum venia est miser at siquis ultro se malis offert volens seque ipse torquet perdere est dignus bona queis nescit uti that man whose troubles from fates curses flow though miserable is with pity so but he who does unforced self torment choose deserves to lose a good he knows not how to use   chap xlii of the river jordan and the dead sea or lake of sodom and gomorrah i bring my reader now to a description of a river worth remark in that it is the only noted one the holy land can boast of and a memorable monument of the almighty vengeance on a wicked people in the stagnate sea of heavy waters which at present covers those oncelovely plains on whose delightful surface stood the cities which by obstinate adherence to the blackest vices drew down showers of fire and brimstone on their vnrepenting and supine inhabitants  the etymology of dan dan of old the southern boundary of palestine received its name from a large fountain near to which the town was situated and from a kind of lake or well of mighty depth and magnitude some miles above that ancient city flows the celebrated river jordan running thence through subterraneous passages to the aforenamd fountain dan emitting there and at another fountain somewhat smaller very near and anciently distinguished by the name of jor the etymology of jordan those rising streams which gradually swell to a considerable breadth and form by their continued course the river jordan  description of the river neither the length the breadth or depth of jordan are extraordinary where broadest not exceeding half a quarter of an english mile and no ways navigable for a bark of burden slow in motion smooth and clear in all her channels and from north to south dividing many pleasant tracts of land for more than half the length of palestine  its course and beauty there is not in the universe a river of a more delightful prospect or agreeable contrivance as to the meandring forms and winding labyrinths wherein it glides with an uncommon gentleness along the midst of plains and valleys sometimes through an open country then enclosed on either side by rising ridges of fine woody hills and every where adorned on both its banks with shady groves of poplar aldertrees the mournful willow and a thousand other lovely greens surprizingly enchanting every eye with sudden wonder at the unassisted gayeties of virgin nature  yet does the river sometimes change its proper form and wander till it is lost a while in certain lakes amongst whose number two there are which anciently were famous for their magnitude and depth and still continue highly worth a strangers observation  the lake hoolee the first is situated in the upper galilee and now called hoolee spacious in the winter but in summer almost dry and yiedling a production of such quantities of reeds that commonly wild beasts find shelter there and dangerously lie in ambush for the vnsuspecting traveller  the sea of galilee the other formerly the lake of tiberias or genezareth and sometimes called in holywrit the sea of galilee is fifteen miles in length and ten in breadth affording numerous kinds of fish of admirable relish and so strangely fatning all the soil which borders on it that it well deserves the name of the most fertile part of all the holy land  jordan how swallowed up thus glides the river jordan with a natural face of pleasure till it is swallowed up in the dead sea to which it enters with a full discharge of all its waters but is seen no more from that time forward nor the sea itself observed to swell by such a tributary affluence of increasing waters whence it is reasonably guessed that there must be some subterraneous channels to disgorge the streams received so plentifully  etymology of the dead sea this lake is called the dead sea from the heavy stagnate nature of the water it contains which neither currents nor the force of tempests have the power to stir from its amazing stillness and it is observable that though the river jordan runs into it it continues a considerable space entirely clear and long unmixing with those thicker waters  its extent and original this sea or lake is sixteen miles in breadth and seventy long now drowning all that paradise of pleasure that delightful plain once called pentapolis amongst whose five aspiring cities sodom and gomorrah were the two most wealthy ever since their fatal burning by the fire and brimstone of vindictive heaven entirely sunk beneath the surface of this dismal lake which now overflows the ancient habitations of luxurious wickedness and does at certain seasons of the year especially preceding rainy weather constantly emitt a kind of mist or smoaky cloud in five distinct and distant places which the superstitious people thereabouts would needs persuade us to believe point out the several situations of those miserable cities  its nature and description the salt or brackishness peculiar to the waters of this lake is so extremely great that heavy bodies thrown upon the surface sink not down without much difficulty and it is reported that the roman emperor vespasian commanded certain sentenced malefactors to be bound and thrown in headlong for a proof of the experiment which was confirmed by their strange floating up and down incapable of sinking through the surface of the waters whose sulphurous quality prevailed so far upon their skin that it peeled off in every part as if they had been scalded and this last effect it now produces to so piercing a degree that it will flea the fingers of a man who rashly goes about to wash his hands in that untempting monument of horror and iniquity  why called asphaltites it likewise bears the name asphaltites from a prodigious quantity of pitchy or bituminous substance called asphaltum which is bred in time upon the surface of the lake and being cast on shore all round it gathered by the country people and employed in many uses often anciently exported into egypt for embalming the dead bodies of the vulgar not capacitated to afford the purchase of an aromatic composition  why the lake of sodom and gomorrah among the many names it is distinguished by twas justly called the lake of sodom and gomorrah in commemoration of the dreadful punishment inflicted by the hand of our almighty god upon a sinful people once inhabiting the cities which had there their situation  a vulgar error concerning the dead sea it has been commonly reported and confirmed by the assertion of some modern travelers that all such birds as dare attempt the flying over it are suffocated with the vapors rising from the lake and fall down dead upon its surface this i can assure my reader is a most egregious falsehood for i have not only seen vast quantities of fowl fly up and down about it but descend sometimes in search of meat upon such floating reeds or other swimming heaps as lie upon the top thereof perhaps the story took its rise from the repute which poets gave avernus and some other lakes on that account thus touched on by lucretius luci lib    nomen id ab re impositum est quia sunt avibus contraria cunctis e regione ea quod loca cum advenere volantes remigii oblitae pennarum vela remittunt praecipitesq cadunt molli cervice profusa  that name is justly given because the killing nature of the place is still destructive to the feathered race who when they leave their tracts of milder air and hither with adventurous flight repair forgetting how to fly they strangely fail through the infected air on wings to sail and with extended necks fall headlong down   one good quality of the dead sea i shall only add one observation more before i end this chapter and that is this lake among its many ill has one good quality for by the briny nature of its waters and the soil about it it yields such mighty quantities of salt as furnish all the holy land with unexhausted plenty of that necessary product  lots wife and the pillar of salt yet one addition more accosting my remembrance must implore the readers pardon if i stay to mention it it is that amongst a ridge of mountains not far distant from the lake i have been treating of they show a hill of an indifferent magnitude which is or seems to be a kind of rocky salt unfit for use and thence unvalued upon any other reason than the reputation of being what the scriptures call the pillar of salt into which lots wife was metamorphosd when her female curiosity inclined her to look back against the angels order and behold the ruins of her flaming city  chap xliii of the present state of the christian religion in palestine a shocking contemplation it would be perhaps impossible in traveling about the spacious universe to find a scene more strangely shocking to a christian zeal than what the holy land affords at present for it cannot surely be a welcome contemplation to a man who owns the faith of christ to see that place have least of his religion which had most of his good wishes  the vilest soil the earth possesses yields increase when it is sowed with liberality but this ungrateful clime this miserable country enriched by the inestimable blood of christ himself is yet so far from an improvement of her not alone prodigious but peculiar blessings that the disencouragd practice of repulsed christianity is disregarded more in palestine than even the most remote and barbarous corners of the turkish territories  the common christian inhabitants of palestine the scattered christians who inhabit with the turks in any of those towns i mentioned in the former chapter commonly are such as are attracted by the summons of a profitable way of living and forgetting every call of their humanity but that of interest give their minds entirely up to a continued practice of such advantageous courses as engaging totally the bent of their desires prevent their souls from the neglected execution of those holy duties which would better far become their application  many sects who live in the temple of christs sepulcher however there are many different sects of christians here who led by piety and the prevailing love of their religion and its practices abandon all the gayest follies of the gilded world and spend their days within jerusalem nay commonly within the very temple of our saviors sepulcher with all the marks of a sincere repentance and ingenious resignation to the smarts of poverty and unalluring rules of an unseignd austerity  how converse with strangers some hundreds of these zealous families perpetually reside within the temple so as never to eat drink or sleep in any other place nor find a possibility of conversation with the people of the town at any other time than when they bring provisions thither and by ringing one of a great number of small bells by different cords made fast within the several apartments of the christians there give notice to the persons they desire to speak with who immediately come out to be acquainted with the reason of their summons  but since it may not be an unacceptable amusement for the reader to be made acquainted with the different tenets of the different sects residing at jerusalem i will enumerate the several doctrines of such christian zealots as are comprehended in the following denominations  the names of christian sects residing in jerusalem armenians coptees abyssens and graecians jacobins nestorians georgians and a kind of people who have many monasteries on mount lebanon and are distinguished amongst christians by the name of maronites  the armenians the faith of the armenians who are next the graecians here most numerous has been already told you in the three and twentieth chapter largely treating of those peoples customs and their tenets of religion  the coptees and graecians i likewise have informed you that the coptees are the remnant of the old egyptians and at large described their doctrine and condition in the four and twentieth chapter of this treatise nor can i enlarge without a flat prolixity on what i have already said concerning greece and the religion of her natives  the toleration given them let it then suffice to say that all the three abovenamd sects administer in the respective offices of their religion at jerusalem with as unbounded a permission and the same degrees of ceremony as they are allowed to use when in their several distant countries  the rest i will proceed to treat of as distinctly as i can and first the abyssens more ancient than their fellows in conversion to the faith and worship of our savior christ require the preference  the abyssens they are no other than the ethiopian race whose ancestors embraced the christian doctrine from the preaching of their queen candaces eunuch philips convert much about the year of christ four hundred and seventy  the tenets of their religion they circumcise their children authorized as they imagine by our saviors own example and extend the duty of that manual operation to both sexes equally  the man at forty days old and the woman at threescore they constantly baptize repeating every year that sacramental ceremony on the twelfth day of christmas in commemoration only of the condescension of our lord who stooped that day to be baptized in jordan by st john the baptist  confession keeping lent and praying for the dead are points wherein they join exactly with the roman catholics as they oppose them rigidly in not admitting images in churches or the use of crucifixes and permitting priests to marry freely  a jewish inclination in one odd point they seem to favor the opinion of the jews with whom they side in abstinence from certain meats and keeping saturday as holy as they do the christian sahaoth  i need not tell the learned reader that the jacobins are called so from the founder of their heresy a syrian of mean parentage and fortune named jacobus  the religion of the jacobius his dictates taught his followers and their posterity to make the godhead of our savior passive and subservient to his manhood they believe the soul of man immortal but with this reserve that it continues slumbering with tho body till the day of judgment  confession purgatory and the prayers of roman catholics for the deceased they disregard as needless innovations their priests may marry and administer the sacrament in both kinds and unanimously join to disbelieve the truth and disobey the orders of the ancient fathers and their synods for the most part  the nestorians nestorivs in the reign of theodosius was bishop of constantinople and a native of the upper germany he introduced an heresy which has prevailed extremely in the east and gives the denomination of nestorians to its professors  in the administration of the eucharist this sect deny the real presence nor permit the virgin mary to be called the mother of god they read the scriptures and pretend to practice a reserved humility but make a strange division in our savior christ between his divine and humane nature  the georgians the georgians called so from the country of that name in ancient days albania or iberia are in many ceremonies and opinions imitators of the greeks and most distinguished by the following principles to which they long have been most strict adherers  they take a liberty from their religion to indulge their senses almost to the highest pitch of incest by permitting marriages within the rules of christian prohibition they are great admirers of loud instruments of music in their churches and have seldom deviated from an honesty of mind which speaks em justly qualified for the respect and care of europaean governments who might with little charge or labor bring them over from their inoffensive ignorance to a more lively and illuminated knowledge of the christ they worship  the maronites the maronites took name from maro an old abbot who won em over from the jacobin opinion to a new one of his own or as some say from a large village called marona situated near their famous monastery on mount lebanus or lebanon  there have been frequent conferences set on foot between the roman catholics and the abovenamd maronites wherein the former have so well succeeded that they are come wholly over to the church of rome some few reserves excepted two of which are these they hold it as a superstitious ceremony to make use of extreme unction one of the seven romish sacraments and look upon all prayers for the deceased as helpless offices of a mistaken zeal or ineffectual bigottry  the government these sects are subject to these then are all the noted christians now inhabiting jerusalem or any other part of palestine each several order subject to the government of their respective bishop abbot or elected guardian but so much more subject to the turkish power that they must miserably stand depressed by want of riches or authority and see the ground which once the good the holy jesus honored with his habitation made the property and ruined by the insolence of those audacious infidels who dare upon the very scene of his prodigious agonies blaspheme his person and deride his crucifixion  the conclusion of the chapter in this condition reader lies the holy land at present scarce enough esteemed by the few turks who live therein to make em guess their profits worth their pains and yet in vain desired with longing wishes by many christian princes who for want of a sufficient power by single efforts to expel the conquerors are forced to see that land more wretched now than any other which was once declared by god himself the happiest of the universe  chap xliv of arabia the stony arabia not all subject to the turk now let us look a little into the dominions of the three arabias many parts whereof are subject to the turkish sultan but far more are not yet do those lawless and imperious monarchs claim the honor of the government of all by adding to their titles an illegal claim to the entire possession of the wide arabia  since therefore though not really his he calls them so i will as briefly as is possible to satisfy the reader give a just description of the three divisions of this mighty country and first attempt a thorough view of that arabia called petraea  arabia petraea why so called arabia petraea or arabia the stony either took its name from petra now called ratalallah by the turks its masters the metropolis of old of all the country or as some will have it from the rocky mountains which confine it and the great stone quarries at the bottom of the sand in every part within it  the situation of the stony arabia it is bounded on the northern side by syria on the west by egypt on the east it borders on the deserts of arabia and the southern confines touch the northern shores of the red sea and the delightful frontiers of arabia felix  description of the soil the land is very desolate and barren to a vast degree the ground lies wast overwhelmed a thousand times a year by fluctuating waves of rolling sand if i may call them so impetuously driven up and down hills changed to valleys and the valleys suddenly transformed to mountains nothing here can boast the certainty of one half hours duration all the face of fickle nature varies in a moment and you see no more the vanished prospect you have just been looking on  its barrenness no tree here flourishes but now and then a solitary palm the ground unstable can produce no more than two or three low kind of herbs the hyssop and another with a spreading leaf which wanting little depth for root grow here and there upon the grassless surface of the naked sand  great want of water but what is more than all the rest intolerable is the melancholy want of water travelers are subject to who often are obliged to ride till almost dead with thirst before they find a spring sufficient to emit a pint of water for the service of a multitude  the misery of the inhabitants excepting the wild arabs whom i shall distinctly treat of by and by those miserable wretches who inhabit this untempting country commonly are such as being driven from their native places by a barbarous oppression choose to change a forced for a no less but voluntary misery  reflections on the ill effects of poverty o pinching poverty that men should yield their noblest virtues to be crushed by thee how strange are thy effects and to what unaccountable attempts do thou push on the minds of such as feel thee no men had certainly ran headlong to these deserts to avoid the shame thy power exposed em to unless thou art indeed as terrible as the old poet thus has represented thee theognis upon poverty           poverty cyrnus ames a good man more than fevers age and all he felt before to fly the heavy curse of being poor what ills o cyrnus should not men endure they rather ought to meet some briny wave and midst thunfathomd ocean find a grave twere better far to rush against some rock and dash their brains out with the bloody shock for every man by povertys deprest nor can he speak or act or live at rest but tonguetyed silence binds his knowing breast thence cyrnus should we strive by land or sea from poor mens burdens to live ever free for it is far better we should death endure than bear the weight of life if life must still be poor   reflections on the vanity of pride yet is it on the other hand as wretched a condition to be swelled beyond the knowledge of our selves and the remembrance of our frailties by the transitory preference we gain above our fellow mortals by the shortlivd honors wealth bestows on our deluded wishes sudden changes and undreamtof storms invading our possessions may reduce us swiftly even below a level with the meanest of our menials and to punish our ambition shipwreck our goodfortune  a story of a proud rich man at hamburgh i very well remember once at hamburgh to have seen a melancholy instance of the strange vicissitudes to which mortality is hourly subject for as i was looking on the monuments which graced a church of the abovenamd city i took notice of a certain tombstone fixed up sideways to the wall on which besides a deal of sculpture there were deeply cut the strange particulars of the relation following in the german language   frederic leopold lavsserbvrg a person of obscure birth and an illiterate education grew so rich by great mens favor and a thousand unexpected blessings of an undeserved goodfortune that he was advanced to the most envied dignities the magistracy of the city could bestow upon him and increased in wealth and power to so prodigious a degree that no six gentlemen in all that country could outbalance his possessions  a weakness of nature pride the consequence and common tinger of triumphant beggary quite turned his senses in this height of exaltation he forgot the means by which he rose and looked upon the blessings he possessed as framed for his enjoyment insolence and vanity so clouded his small share of understanding that he used all people with such vnbred haughtiness that he became the universal hate of town and country  good advice unhappily slighted providence endeavored to oblige him by a warning from the mouth of a free speaker his relation who attempting to dissuade him from the odious practice of so scornful a deportment urging that though now he was above the malice of the world a time might come when he should cease to be so had this vain and senseless answer thrown upon him  alas poor fool an ass might sooner learn to play upon the bagpipes than the curse of poverty be taught a way to make me miserable  a midnight alarm advice was ineffectual and the gentleman forbore repeating it the haughty lausserburg went soon that night to bed and waked about the hour of midnight with a wonderful surprise to hear the noise of rustic music in the street and as he thought before his windows with a hundred exclamations such as lord deliver us protect us heaven and the like from all the windows opposite to his whose casements shutt and opened with a strange confusion  a wonderful apparition tempted by the noises he got out of bed and running to his chamber window threw it open and the first remark he cast his eyes on was a kind of phantom representing the exact resemblance of an ass erected on his hinder legs and dancing up and down to an uncommon tune of his own playing on a perfect bagpipe while the frighted neighbors all amazed before were now far more surpised to see the apparition vanish in the very moment he looked out at window and beheld it  the startled lausserburg in agonies at this appearance presently reflected on the wicked answer he had made his friend and from that hour became so melancholy that he never relished former pleasures but neglected strangely all his great concerns and sunk almost to a downright stupidity  a sudden downfall amazing accidents by fire and robbers lawsuits and neglect in two years time consumed his wealth to so incredible a change that being hated by the townsmen they refused to give him the relief he wanted so that he who lately judged himself too great to know an equal or converse with an inferior was by providence reduced to beg his bread from door to door and hope a charity from even the meanest of those people whom he had before uncharitably dealt with a miserable condition nay so far illfortune tortured him that not admitted under any roof that very friend who had forewarned him of the possibility of falling coming late one moonlight night along the street in very cold and rainy weather saw him sitting huddled on a heap of dirt half naked sheltred from the rain by nothing but a kind of wickerd basket which being close at bottom but as open as a cage in every other part he had drawn over him to keep his head from the severity of weather  the use of the story this story carved at large upon the tombstone quickens pity and amazement at one time and may be useful as a mirror to present the world with an exact idea of the rise and fall of vanity and the misfortunes drawn by pride upon the bubbles of mortality  shells and shining sand upon the desert before i close this chapter twill be proper to inform the reader that the sandy deserts of the stony and indeed the other two arabias are covered thickly with a thousand kinds of little shells and nitrous atoms which appear with glistering beauty at a distance from you which with several other proofs are reasonable grounds for a belief that once these plains now desert sands were a large part of the main ocean  chap xlv of arabia the desert the deserts of arabia the mighty deserts of the wast arabia south of the foregoing are confined that way by the arabia well called happy from the aromatic blessings of its climate but on every other side run wildly on toward babylon and media mesopotomia and armenia in such endless tracts of sand and desolation that the undiscovered reach of their prodigious surface frightens curiosity from thoughts of searching for the just extent of such a dangerous territory  different from the rest of the world heaven has here laid wast the work of earths creation or contrived these blots of nature like a mole in a fine face to serve as foils and add an ornamental luster to the brighter parts of the more temperate universe  the elements themselves are here at war the sun inflames the sand and the tempestuous sand invades the air with waves of fire whose rolling heaps like stormy billows of impetuous heat hiss dreadfully against the breath of those prodigious tempests which remove them hourly and make a chaos of the horrid desert  wild beasts and serpents in the deserts not a shrub grows here or any thing at all which looks like nature in her common decency the hiss of every kind of poisonous serpent aggravates the terror of a trembling traveller who all environed by the dangerous snakes and salvage beasts which scaring others are themselves as often scared by the unstable motion of the trackless deserts is obliged to seem at sea upon the scorching continent and travel day and night without the smallest guide but the assistance of a compass  the virtue of fire in the deserts the raging heat of a perpetual sun so burns the sands they travel on that they are scorched as if they walked through halfextinguishd heaps of ashes yet are they still obliged to carry fire and fix it round the places where they rest to fright away the monstrous creatures who would else assault em  the skill of the arabians those arabians who are knowing in the nature of the horrid climate guess by certain motions of the clouds the coming of a storm of wind from any quarter and the distance it is at and consequently suit their travels through the deserts to their best convenience  the misery of christians traveling without a guide in the deserts of arabia but christian strangers wholly ignorant of all those signs nor daring to confide so far in the suspected arabs as to take em for their guides are sometimes miserably overtaken by the danger of a storm which agitates the ground they travel on with all the violence of the severest earthquake lifting men and camels from the desert or at least so fills the air with clouds of sand driven up and down by unresisted whirlwinds that the wretched traveller quite blinded with their fury stands unknowing what to do while the dried dead bodies of men and women who have perished ages since in passing over are with a surprising horror blown upon them whiskd like paper through the air all dreadful and deformed with those suspended carcasses and flocks of serpents hurried violently through the winds with the uplifted tracks of glowing sand they lately crept in  who knows but many of those dead mens bodies which are blown so frightfully about the desert are the same who perished when the roman legions under warlike cato bravely passed this sultry climate in the search of glory and on whose account the poet lucan thus describes the nature of these deserts luc l  0 sic orbem torquente noto romana juventus procubuit metuensque rapi constrinxit amictus inseruitque manus terrae nec pondere solo sed nixu jacuit vix sic immobilis austro qui super ingentes cumulos involuit arenae atque operit tellure viros vix tollere miles membra

malorum qui nullas videre domos videre ruinas jamque iter omne latet nec sunt discrimina terrae vlla nisi aetheriae medio velut aequore flammae sideribus novere vias while thus disturbing earth the south wind blew the romans on the ground their bodies threw and fearing swiftly to be blown away bound fast their clothes and graspt the soil whereon they lay nor does their weight alone secure them there a clinging strength they make the surface bear scarce can they thus the southern storm withstand which over their prostrate heads rolls mighty hills of sand buried therein the soldiers scarce can lift their limbs the monumental dust to shift those who dare stand upright unmoved remain kept strait by heaps of sand which overwhelm the plain prodigious stones rent from some broken wall fly in the tempest which supports them all and in some distant clime with wonder lets them fall they ruins see who can no houses spy no beaten path salutes the longing eye no different roads in this sad place appear like mariners by stars their doubtful course they steer   the wretched condition of travelers who are lost in the deserts horror and confusion overtake the traveller who by a thousand little accidents is hourly liable to lose his company imagine reader what a miserable state you would believe your self reduced to were you left alone amidst the wild and unfrequented sands of these unmeasured deserts nothing near you nor within the reach of the most sanguine hope but dreadful serpents unknown monsters and a thousand barbarous enemies to nature and humanity no distant prospect of a smoking chimney to direct your footsteps nor the comfortable sight of beaten roads to guide you in your journey day assaulting you with scorching heats ghosts and apparitions in the deserts and night confounding you with the repeated shreicks and shrill complaints of ghosts or apparitions which it you believe the people of the country wander nightly up and down about these deserts  mischievous hobgoblins the arabs told me fifty frightful stories of the mischiefs done by these hobgoblins who delight  it seems to exercise deceit and make poor travelers not only lose their way but perish in the desert  however there was some years since a certain better natured spirit than a man has commonly an opportunity to get acquainted with and since it is pity she should lose the honor due to her civility i will record her for as honest and obliging an hobgoblin as ever can be found in all arabia  a story of an armenian merchant lost in the deserts of arabia there was as i was told by my judicious turkish author an armenian merchant called demetrio who lived for many years in egypt and as i remember in the city of grand cairo till by his industrious application to the art he practiced he became considerably rich and flourished mightily  it seems the man was of a grateful temper and remembered that when he had lived while young in babylon in a condition very mean and much depressed by servitude and poverty he had received extraordinary civilities from a good natured turk by whose assistance only he had been enabled to engage himself in that successful way of living which had now so happily improved his former circumstances  the grateful design of a dangerous journey he made a resolution that he would go pay a visit to his friend in babylon and let him see that he remembered gratefully the many bounties he had formerly received and would reward at least acknowledge his extensive obligations and accordingly he went in company with the great caravan which crossed the deserts to the very place he had designed a journey to  the water falls short he traveled pleasantly enough till he was got almost half through the danger of his passage when it happened that the caravan fell short of water which they searched in vain for among the sands so that their thirst increasing daily almost all their beasts of burden fainted under it and many of their company unable to support the anguish it reduced them to fell sick and died in miserable torment  they detach parties to seek a spring prodigious offers there were doubtless made for the reward of any who should then discover the glad tidings of a spring which though they could not reasonably hope to find the zeal of their desires and sharpness of their appetite inclined them to endeavor it by sending out detachments every way with orders not to lose the sight of one another  they divide and straggle from each other the wants of nature notwithstanding this precaution urged their courages to a contempt of any other danger than the death they dreaded from the want of water wherefore little minding the advice they had received they frequently divided their small parties and would ramble singly up and down regarding nothing but the thoughts of keeping still within the hearing of each others hollow  a dangerous wandering among the rest one moonlightnight demetrio it seems was gone a water hunting and had straggled to considerable distance from the party he went out with but imagined he discovered all about him many companies belonging to the caravan employed on the same errand he was busy in at last he heard a voice on his left hand which called as from the nearest party with the welcome repetition of these words ho this way this way we have found out water  a delusive prospect full of joy he looked about him and perceived at least imagined he perceived the parties of the caravan run all one way as if they followed the transporting summons which invited them to crowd that way and taste the water he believed so happily discovered  in short he ran as fast as he was able close upon the heels of certain men whose faces he was very well acquainted with and knew them to belong to the great caravan he came with the malice of a company of ghosts till at last when he had followed them above an hour they turned upon him shook their heads laughed loud then disappeared and vanished like a shadow  natures dictates may inform the reader what convulsive agonies alarmed the breast of the deceived armenian when he saw those guides dissolve to air on whom he had depended as his safeguards and directors but his fright increased to double horror when he looked all round him and could see no sign of man or beast but found he had been led away from all his company by the delusive beckons of malicious ghosts and illdesigning apparitions  a sad condition in vain he cursed the hapless motives which inclined him to the journey and with bitter cries bewailed his misery lamenting the misfortune of his lost condition with a flood of tears which bathed the sands over which he wandred void of comfort and instead of finding the far distant company he looked for hourly rambled farther in the desert while his a king eyes saw nothing in his way but trackless regions of unstable sand and both his ears were deeply pierced by frightful hissings of the serpents round him and the doleful shrieks and horrid yells of unseen ghosts and hovering hobgoblins  a despairing resolution two days and nights were thus passed over when despairing evermore of seeing man and weakned by fatigue and want of food and water he laid himself upon the sands and was resolved to wait his death with an heroic resignation to the will of providence  he had not lain two hours before he started at the repetition of a voice which called three times in a shrill melancholy accent demetrio demetrio demetrio  a wife goodnaturd even after death he lifted up his eyes with great amazement at the mention of his name in such a place as that and scarce believed himself awake when he beheld his wife at two yards distance from him with a pot of water in one hand and a dry biscuit in the other  she placed em by him and made signs that he should eat and drink which an halffamishd appetite obliged him to endeavor after he had offered to embrace his wife who glided from him like an airy phantom and forbad him touching her  the speech of a ghost to a man in the deserts i am said she no more the partner of your earthly blessings death has interposed his obstacle betwixt our meeting to embrace as formerly thy friend at babylon is also dead and thy poor children motherless at cairo want thy comfort follow me and i will lead thee to thy company and show thee water for thy self and them which when thou have discovered and received the great reward that will be given thee go back with me i will lead thee safely to the borders of the desert whence thou may return to egypt though alone in safety a check to curiosity but thou must not ask me any questions of my present circumstances too mysterious for a mortals comprehension  overjoyed but wondering at the strangeness of the accident he followed his obliging wife quite cross another part of the wide desert till she brought him to a place where she assured him if he dug he should find water but enjoined him not to grieve that she was dead repeating many times that she was happier now than she had been while living  a lucky discovery he could from hence behold the caravan a third part of whose number had already perished by the drought they were exposed to he immediately went to them brought em to the place and showed em where to dig till they found water in sufficient quantity to satisfy them all and fill the vessels for their use in the remaining part of their sad journey  a dead wife doubles her husbands fortune his wife invisible to all but him attended all this while and whispered in his ear the best directions she could give him a considerable sum of money was presented him by the commanders of the caravan which almost doubled what he had before obtained by a successful industry a happy escape from the deserts he presently exchanged the present for such jewels gold and other riches as would lie in the least compass and conducted by his wifes kind spirit left the company and went in safety back to egypt holding a delightful conversation all the way and being told a thousand wondrous things by his aerial guide who having brought him to the borders of the desert left him with a charge to give her love to all her children and advise em how to live secure of happiness by means she had informed him of  he did as she directed him and when he came to cairo found his family in mourning for the death of his dear wife who left the world according to his computation just a week before he met her in the deserts  how they mark the water places in the deserts this story reader told me by a turk who thought himself a man of great sincerity and of no small judgment please to take as i received it twill at least divert you and may serve to give you an idea of those horrid deserts on which subject i shall add no more than that such travelers as find a spring of water tolerably fresh by digging in the sands too well acquainted with the misery of wanting it endeavor to preserve the memory of the place by fixing up a pike or sometimes two bound fast together to make the mark more lasting by its length these have a kind of ensign at the top but seldom stand a month before whole mountains of the sand entirely bury them at least so cover them that scarce three foot of all the pike appears above the surface such a dreadful visage bears the desert country of the scorched arabia  chap xlvi of arabia the happy arabia felix justly so named this country aromatically happy in the spices she produces and distinguished from the other two by all the blessings of indulgent nature sometimes known to be a partial mother well deserves the name of felix not alone because most happy in her wealth and products but as she is doubly so when placed in competition with the two arabias her deformed and barren neighbors  providence bounty to this country providence has here made full amends for the deficiencies she caused in both the other and the people who inhabit this delightful country are as far superior to the rest in their humanity and fair deportment to the strangers they converse with as their soil exceeds the other in its beauties and fertility  arabia felix how governed arabia felix has a sultan of her own possessing arbitrary power and ruling in the inland countries but the seaport towns at least most of them have been long subservient to the turkish government as valued most by that encroaching people on account of the prodigious profits rising to their owners from an open traffic with the indian countries and the great advantages they reap by exportation of their own rich manufactures and the product of their climate  the cities of that country they have many cities of considerable magnitude the chief whereof are mocha zenan siam ermin surac demmar almacarhan naghelsaamar rabataaman tais mousar doffar and the port of aden  their way of building most of these and many other cities are adorned with very fine and stately buildings of a lasting kind of stone well polished and joined close with admirable mortar gardens orchards and large ornamental suburbs generally grace the towns with beautiful appearances and many of them are indifferently fortified with walls and outworks  the merchandises of arabia the merchandises of arabia felix are the aromatic gums and spices it was ever famous for olibanum and frankincense and myrrh of many kinds rich balsam sugar canes large coconuts and coffee in abundance  they have grapes and almost every kind of fruit in fullest excellency mutton beef and other meats both good and plentiful and live in the enjoyment of the gayest pleasures nature unassisted by the helps of art can furnish their delights with  plenty of wild beasts bred  the inland countries are extremely woody and afford convenient shelter for the numerous herds of lions leopards tigers wolves and other beasts of prey abounding greatly not alone in this but all the three arabias i have treated of  the air very pleasant and healthful the air is constantly salubrious and notwithstanding the warm situation of the country reaching from near thirty to eleven or ten degrees of northern latitude the heat is so delightfully alloyd by frequent breezes which like wanton zephyrs fan the air and wast the scent of odoriferous spices on their gentle breathings that you feast upon the richest banquet nature can prepare you as you travel on the road from town to city and the moderated climate softly mixing vernal mildness with the beams of summer makes all seasons equally engaging so that the greek poet who in the following verses wishes for a constant spring may properly be said to have described the blessing of arabia felix bions choice of seasons        i love not summer for the sun then reigns and scorches me on the unsheltred plains i love not autumn for diseases then bred by her fruits afflict the healthiest men pernicious winter does sharp snows create and all coldweather nature bids me hate let spring that longwishd season then appear and bless me with her presence all the year for then we neither heat nor cold can fear all things look smiling then nature grows gay and men divide their hours in equal night and day   chap xlvii of the red sea the red sea is so fully known already by the geographical descriptions of our own country writers and the exquisite performances of the mathematic authors of most christian nations that i mean not here to touch on those notorious observations which have long ago been made by others but inform my reader of some new discoveries of little matters which i made my self  but first it will be requisite to say a word or two relating to the etymology and ports of the red sea which having done i will proceed to mention the remarks i made as they occur to my remembrance  why the red sea is so called rhythra in the old egyptian language signifying red was formerly the name of a great monarch of that country who gave the sea his own denomination which has been since mistaken by affinity of sound and misinterpreted the red sea by those who fixed the name upon it which it bears at present  a second opinion others think especially the jews inhabiting the eastern countries that it was called the red sea from the prodigious ruin and great overthrow of pharaohs army in their passage over it in the pursuit of moses and his goddefended israelites but as the blood there spilt was very little though such multitudes were drowned i look upon this guess as an improbable opinion  a third and the most probable another notion and perhaps the truest of the three is that it is called the red sea from the redness of the sands oerspreading all the bottom whence the waves receive a kind of red reflection and the water thence appears as if twere stained with certain juices of a redish color this is made more reasonable from the etymology of the euxine commonly called the blacksea from the blackness of the sands which lie at the bottom  the sea port towns are very numerous and very different from each other in magnificence or the conventency of harbor some are much exposed to dangerous shelves and rocky shallows others both commodious large and stately aden the great seaport town but the only place deserving a particular description is the port called aden in possession of the turks and not alone the largest but the richest and most celebrated sea port town of all arabia  its description it is situated in about thirteen degrees of northern latitude directly in the center of a kind of amphitheatre or semicircular ridge of mountains jetting out prodigious promontories into the sea for a considerable length on either horn the harbor is not only safe but capable of holding at an anchor near a thousand sail of ships by the most modest computation  the town how built the town it self consists of near four thousand houses built of stone and rendered pleasant by vast spaces unemployd to other uses than the planting orchards gardens and a kind of favorite wildernesses much in practice with the eastern people  the general inhabitants of aden are considerably wealthy and enjoy their pleasures with a greater gust than elsewhere is permitted them now much decayed yet is the city much decayed from what it has been formerly for once the town extended to a double length to that it now contains and all the buildings though they are not despicable now were anciently adorned with a far greater beauty and magnificence  the fleets of the red sea the turks build vessels in the ports belonging to this sea and constantly maintain a fleet of galleys for support of their authority besides the merchant ships which trade about from place to place and by the customs paid on the commodities they carry bring considerable profit to the coffers of the sultan  a new discovery of a monument near the red sea upon the northern shore of the red sea not far from a small haven now called pozi stand the ruins of a monumental heap of stones appearing very ancient by their forms and way of building by the remnant of the work we may suppose it to have been erected pyramidically and about one hundred foot in height the breadth of each square of its basis much the same upon the bottom stones and certain fallen ones we could discover unintelligible characters which seemed to have been carved to tell succeeding ages what the monument was there erected to perpetuate the memory of  it is pity ignorance has incapacitated the inhabitants from letting strangers into any light of knowledge in relation to antiquity else probably they had been able to inform us what this heap of ruins was originally thought to be the same which moses left in memory of his passage now we can no more than guess at random for its doubtful origin unless we will believe the not impossible traditional account the natives give us who would fain persuade us to believe twas built by moses when the israelites miraculously passed that sea and left by him a memorandum for posterity to make mankind depend on god and not diffide in his secure protection though reduced to never so fatiguing and oppressive exigencies  opium made of poppies there grows upon the shores of the red sea a certain heavyheaded poppy only differing in the bigness of its stalk from ours in england at a certain season of the year i think it is july or june they gather many of these poppies beat em in a mortar lay them by for many days then take em out and adding several unknown herbs make opium of the composition but of far less efficacy than the other sort more frequently exported into foreign countries  indigo how made of an herb there likewise grows a little violet colored herb in mighty plenty all about the sea shore which they take care to gather in the suns meridian height and mixing it with certain weeds which float like scattered samphire on the surface of the waters make thereof the die called indigo in full perfection  pearls found in the red sea mighty rocks in many parts of the red sea erect their heads above the water and it is not seldom that they find upon them something like a shellfish yet unlike an oyster which is opened with the greatest difficulty imaginable and contains within it great round pearls sometimes but one and sometimes more of equal value with the richest of their magnitude from any other part imported into christendom  a wonderful fish at certain seasons of the year it is a common thing to see a fish not much unlike an hippotamus or great river horse whose strength and swiftness is so very wonderful that it is almost impossible to take em but by some surprise or cunning stratagem  a rich perfume these creatures when they happen to be caught are carefully dissected for besides a kind of rich perfume beyond the scent of ambergrease it self which lies like fat about their spinal joints and yields a vast advantage to the man who finds it a carbuncle found in the head of a seahorse there often is discovered in the head of this strange animal a glittering stone which may be called a carbuncle for it is of globelike form and quite transparent yielding if produced in a dark place a light so striking that a man may see to write by its assistance in the duskiest winters midnight  the danger of attempting more discoveries these are all the observations i could make deserving my remembrance nor can any man discover in this sea or upon its extensive shores more rarities or creatures worth remark than have already been communicated in the books of travelers unless his curiosity becoming master of his reason tempts him to a rash endeavor of opposing laws and dangers to instruct himself in matters probably unworthy half his labors  chap xlviii of the turks pilgrimage to their prophets birthplace and their ceremonies at mecca and medina telnabi the force of superstition never sure did a bigoted superstition lead away the minds of thoughtless mortals to so wondrous a degree as it has done in turkey where the annual practice of a pilgrimage to mecca has prevailed so strangely by the fixed injunction of their prophets law that it is by all believed the surest passport from mortality to paradise  a strange notion nay they carry it still farther and persist in the assertion that unless a turk shall once at least before he dies perform that pilgrimage or bear the charges of some other man to do it for him if the want of health prevents his piety it is impossible that he should ever reach those gross enjoyments they expect from the romantic blessings of another world till they have purified their persons from the guilt of such omission by a long continuance in the tortures of the grave inslicted on them by the two black angels as i have at large informed you in the part foregoing  moral reflections oh miserable frailty of deceived mortality so strangely open to the strong assaults of our mistaken passions and unguarded commonly against the weakest efforts made by nature to delude our senses but by far more liable to the persuasive ills of superstitious zeal and the deceitful gloss of an illchose religion there our vices sculk with undetected art behind the masque of a pretended virtue and how easily alas are we misled in execution of our duty when the dictates of our reason are themselves too often biased to a partial sentence and our judgment which should ever rule a wise mans actions bribed unfortunately by erroneous principles  a vulgar error concerning mahomets tomb however ever i enter on the subject of the chapter i am now about to treat of i will undeceive my reader who has probably been led astray like many others by a vulgar error which inclines them to believe that mecca as the place to which the turks direct their pilgrimage is the town wherein the great impostor mahomet lies buried when it really is no other than his birthplace and as such made holy by his own injunctions that with such and such appointed ceremonies all his followers should visit that great city in commemoration of his being thence produced amongst them  of mecca and medina some few days journey north of mecca stands the celebrated tomb of mahomet in a small town distinguished by the name of medina telnabi where he died and now lies buried in the form i shall describe hereafter no believer as they call themselves is by their prophets law obliged to visit this place in their pilgrimage but as they were assured by the impostor that if not a meritorious twoud at least be an acceptable acknowledgment of zeal for their religion and his memory it is never known that any annual pilgrimage is made to mecca but a certain number of the most bigoted of the people turn aside and pay their offerings ere they return to medina telnabi  another vulgar error and here another vulgar error challenges a confutation which experience as the surest judge may be allowed to give it it is a general belief that mahomet was never buried but is hung suspended in the air within an iron coffin by the strange attractive force of certain wondrous loadstones so surprizingly affixed to the high roof of a great temple that they cannot be perceived by the most exquisite inspection  very groundless that this is false the reader will discover presently but whence it grew so common a report i can by no means guess since i have ever found the turks so far from justifying the pretended miracle that they exert their utmost wit and raillery to ridicule the fond credulity of christian nations led so easily to a belief of such a gross absurdity  the place of rendezvous the numbers which compose the mighty caravan of meccan pilgrims generally swell beyond imagination zealous turks of every country quality profession or capacity assemble at grand cairo the great rendezvous appointed for that purpose by the first of august or within a few days after for about the tenth or fifteenth of that month the caravan most commonly sets forward on the journey  their public proclamations within six days of their departure notice is by public proclamation given the people to get ready by the time then set and that they must be subject to the government of such a person whom they name both going and returning in whatever cases may require his arbitration  their chief how chosen this officer is called emir hadgey which signifies as much as ruler of the pilgrims he is always chosen by the great bashaw of cairo and makes a vast advantage of his post besides the settled sum of near two thousand pounds which he receives from the grand signiors treasury by many perquisites and opportunities of gain like these which follow  the order observed in registring their names as soon as the emirhadgey is proclaimed all people who accompany the caravan must presently resort to him or one deputed by him paying a considerable sum of money for the registring their names the number of their camels and the names religion quality and sects of every passenger they carry on them  the emirhadgeys power his power is so unlimited and so decisive is his sentence while the expedition lasts extending even to life and death and every little matter criminal or civil that to bribe his favor no rich gifts are thought too costly nor that money ill bestowed which recommending those who give it to the favorable eye of such an arbitrary ruler frequently prevents the hand of rapine from invading their most valuable property  his perquisites another perquisite and that no mean one rises from a law severe and barbarous by which all christians whatsoever are prohibited from coming within three days journey of their prophets birthplace or his place of burial while the pilgrims are employed at either in the ceremonious practices of zeal and superstition the turks true to interest for notwithstanding this decree if any europaean traveller has courage to confide in the fidelity of turks and really where their interest binds them they are generally very punctual in performance of their articles he may by making a considerable present to the emirhadgey not alone be sure of his protection in the places abovementioned but possess an undisputed liberty to travel openly throughout the journey and select what company he pleases to converse with in the caravan which he accompanies  when every thing is ready all the caravan have public orders presently to quit the town and rendezvous fifteen miles from it in an open sandy plain along the borders of a pool called birquey  the gallantry of the emirhadgey hither two days after the emirhadgey comes gallantly attended by a company of such among them as pretend to be distinguished by the name of gentlemen and have resolved that year to make the pilgrimage all these have many servants waiting on them with a tripple change of camels to prevent the inconveniences they might be otherwise exposed to by the accidental deaths of those they rode on  the dress of his camels all the camels are adorned as finely as is possible with ribbons spangles rich caparisons and every other gay contrivance which may serve to show the universal joy with which they snatch the wished occasion of so troublesome and dangerous but holy a peregrination  the alcoran how carried among the camels which compose the number for the proper use of the emirhadgey one venerable old one is elected to be richly ornamented with embroidered trappings thick beset with precious stones of admirable luster on whose back is carried a square golden box which holds the alcoran extravagantly bound and all enriched with valuable jewels yearly sent by the grand signior as an offering due to the great mosque of mecca in respect to mahomet  camels how respected at their return from mecca this camel if it happens to outlive the journey is for ever after free from labor as indeed most others are which have returned in safety if their owners can afford it and interred upon their death in orchards gardens or some other private place that so they may not be exposed like other beasts to dogs and vultures  the departure of the caravan as soon as the arrival of the emirhadgey has been confirmed throughout the camp for they pitch tents like armies all the caravan make ready in an instant and the women children and acquaintance of the pilgrims who have hitherto accompanied them begin with prayers tears kisses close embraces and a thousand marks of friendship and affection to take leave of all they know and recommend them to the smiles and care of providence so that for a considerable time there is nothing to be seen but a confused extravagance of sorrow and its consequences  their order in marching now the caravan begins to march the emirhadgey riding at their head or sometimes in their center as he thinks most proper all the camels are tied tail to tail and follow one another in strait lines of different length some hundreds often going in a knot their riders sitting on them in the posture elsewhere spoke of in this treatise and some thousands of the most accomplished warriors in a manner quite surrounding the whole caravan protect them from the dangers they are often subject to in the attacks they meet with from the wild arabians who insest the deserts  their amusements on the road they are generally very merry sounding all the way an hundred awkward instruments of music and diverting one another with the tedious repetitions of such old wives tales as commonly pass current in the conversation of the vulgar people of the eastern countries  their lights on the journey the violence of heat is so excessive in the climates they are bound to pass through that they seldom travel much by day and therefore carry a prodigious quantity of links or flambeaus for the lighting them along and really when the moon denies her influence in directing their advances they supply the want occasioned by her absence with such glorious numbers of these flaming torches as afford a prospect so surprizingly agreeable that it is not to be guessed by such as have not seen it  the dangers they are subject to the sultry influences of a scorching sun and pestilential blasts of an unwholesome southern wind together with the want of water bitter springs excepted and the scarcity of all provisions with a thousand unavordable fatigues they meet with in so long and disagreeable a journey frequently occasion such mortality among the caravan that it is a common thing in its return to cairo to have left eight thousand persons dead behind them  their common numbers as for the numbers which this annual caravan does commonly consist of they are so uncertain that i cannot form a general calculation better than by telling you that they are seldom known below the full of fifty thousand souls but very often to a great degree exceed an hundred  another of the emirs perquisites all the goods clothes camels and conveniences belonging to such persons as sall sick and die upon the journey are the property by perquisite of the emirhadgey who unless a man of admirable principles is consequently no great wellwisher to the welfare of his people  the distance between grand cairo and mecca the distance between mecca and grand cairo is five and forty large days journey in which passage they are forced to rest three days together such is the fatigue of traveling upon a desert country where the sands unstable to the footsteps of their beasts of burden slip away and make the roads extremely tiresome  a remark concerning camels and here we have a spacious scene for contemplation on the alldirecting wisdom of the hand of providence who in the countries naturally stony has provided horses of a hard and solid hoof to serve the uses they are there designed for but in desert places such as these i now am speaking of has formed the camel qualified by nature with her spreading fool to overtread more easily the sinking sands which horses hoofs with difficulty pass through  the place called marah in the scriptures two days from cairo bring the caravan to a place called mizhaana anciently that marah spoke of in the scriptures whither moses brought the israelites just then delivered from egyptian bondage and miraculously aided by almighty gods assisting hand converted bitter waters into sweet by throwing in a tree cut down on purpose thence supplying all the peoples raging thirst who murmured loudly that they could not drink for the waters of marah were bitter  the stages of the caravan thence proceeding onwards of their journey they encamp on many of those very places where so many ages since the discontented israelites then wandering in the wilderness by gods direction pitched their tents and lay a while in expectation of the orders moses was to give them whither next to bend their progress  abrahams mountain within near threescore miles of mecca stands a village called babble scarce three furlongs distant from the mountain of that name on whose high summit abraham built the altar upon which he had designed to sacrifice his only son his muchloved isaac in obedience to the will of that great god whose least command he knew it sin to think of disregarding  isaacs altar there is upon the top of this famed mountain a low kind of turkish mosque or chapel built obscurely of an antique model in the midst whereof they show a small square heap of stones joined fast together with a lasting mortar not much less than three foot high six long and four in breadth which they have dignified with a strange reputation and are sure to show all pilgrims who come thither by the name of isaacs altar  the story why improbable it is i must confess a little inconsistent with my notion of the rules of reason to imagine abraham as we read the story should have taken pains to build so strong and durable a monument whereon to sacrifice his son upon so short a warning and it therefore must require a romish faith to look upon this altar as a relic of antiquity  the ceremonies of the pilgrims on this hill the mosque however which is built upon this hill is constantly inhabited by some old scheich or turkish preacher who is bound by the conditions upon which he claims a salary belonging to the benefice to stand upon the hill and make a declanition or a kind of lecture to the pilgrims who assemble round him those who happen to get nearest telling those at greater distance what they learn from the persuasive oratory of their preachers doctrine  the subject of a sermon there preached the common subjects which are chose on this occasion for employment of the doctors lungs and faculties are such as an endeavor to ingraft a pious notion in the peoples breast of that important duty they are now performing the necessity there is of a repentance after it and the innumerable blessings they may certainly expect from gods indulgence if they never deviate from the principles of zealous mussulmen and truebelievers of the laws of mahomet  the turkish way of quitting sin they rest a day upon the old mans sermon to digest the entertainment he has gravely given them and then are led by the emirhadgey on foot without observing rank all one by one to the abovenamd mosque upon the mountain rabiie which they enter at one door and go out of by another opposite thereto first passing by the grave old scheich aforesaid who is placed upon a step near two foot high directly in the middle of the mosque and touching every man as he goes swiftly by with a short stick repeats these words may sin here leave thee  a strange notion now you must understand the holy wishes of this favorite of mahomet are so successful that they never fail to crown the person blessed with an entire deliverance from all the vices he was ever subject to so that freed happily from such a weighty burden they run nimbly down the hill upon the other side and never stop till they have crossed a little stream of bitter water gliding by the bottom and by dipping in their hands and sprinkling all their faces with some drops thereof from that time forward they become newmen as pure and free from all iniquity as infant innocence and consequently qualified to see the city they must next proceed to  a stranger punishment but you must take notice that the punishment of looking back before they cross this purifying stream is full as exemplary to these cautious pilgrims as it was of old to lots too curious wife for though their metamorphosis appears not so amazingly conspicuous yet they will tell you that it is fully as severe for in the very moment any man among them turns his head before it is permitted him the heavy load of his own sins which he had just before made shift to leave behind him does not only overtake him in an instant but returns enriched with interest upon interest by the black addition of two other peoples  their ceremonies at first sight of mecca careful therefore to prevent so burdensome a mischief on they march with joyful hearts to the remainder of their journey and about the middle of the third days progress gain a prospect of the mosque at mecca when they all alight as if half mad with noisy ecstasies and prostrating themselves upon the ground thrice kiss the glowing surface of the sand they travel on and thrice proclaim with universal clamor allahillahilallab muhamed resul allah god is god the only god and mahomet of that sole god the only prophet  how they encamp at mecca arrived at mecca they encamp upon the plains without the city as by far too numerous to find conveniences within the walls for a commodious entertainment of themselves and camels but i should have told you that they often turn aside and pass through giddah the porttown to mecca to pay reverence to the grave where eve was buried the tomb of eve for the arabs there pretend to show all travelers her sepulcher and would persuade us to believe our father adam had a very formidable consort if we are allowed to guess her strength by the proportion which they give her for from the stone now standing at the head to that which stands at the broad bottom of the grave the distance is full five and twenty yards of english measure sure a man if any now is blessed with such a wife would scarce lament her want of stature  description of mecca mecca is about three miles in compass rich and stately in a great degree and her inhabitants possessors of a rolling plenty still continue to increase their affluence by annual profits rising from the concourse of such mighty numbers drawn by zeal to travel thither  but as i only mention it because the birthplace of that vile impostor whose successful impositions drew such numbers to profess his doctrine i will here enlarge no further than is requisite to give a just description of the holy house of god as they presume to call it which is looked upon so sacred by the turks that in whatever part of the wide universe they are why the turks in praying turn their faces to the east they never pray but with their faces to the east in honor to this house wherein they say that mahomet was born and in respect to which they yearly undertake so dangerous a pilgrimage  the house of god as they call it this house which they distinguish by the name of kiabee betulla stands directly in the middle of the city not surpassing thirteen foot in breadth in length eighteen or thereabouts and near ten yards in height flatroofd and quite surrounded by a stately court walled in and ornamented by three several rows of marble pillars close within the wall supporting arches of a graceful fabric upon either square divided into four apartments kept by priests of the four most noted sects among the turks who pray continually with an incessant fervor for the boundless propagation of their own religion and the downfall of christianity  two hoops of gold to strengthen as it were the ancient building which i think consists of square rough stones though it is almost impossible to see them being covered on the inside and the out by such inestimable heaps of riches the house is circled round by two prodigious hoops of beaten gold at least appearing so to be and of that valuable metal are the drains and spouts which carry off the water falling on the place in rainy weather  a silver door and strange old fashioned entrance the only entrance contrary to any buildings now in fashion or indeed remembrance is by two large folding silver doors to which you mount upon a ladder five foot high for so much higher than the ground about it reaches the foundation of this odd and antique piece of building  stately hangings this door is placed almost as far as the left corner of the house and being entered presently admits you to the only chamber it consists of richly hung with an embroidered damask red and green the last the prophets favorite color and supported by four pillars the diameter of each above two foot entirely of a piece their form eight square and made of a black kind of wood perfuming all the chamber with the finest scent imaginable which the turks assured us were not so by nature but became thus odoriferous the very moment their prophet blessed that place in his nativity  a fine goodnaturd moving stone without the house they show a dusky colored stone near two foot square to which they kneel and pay their adoration with a thousand kisses and indeed the reputation which this stone has got deserves their complaisance for the civility it once was master of that was very civil to father abraham for you must know this house was built by abrahams own hands who knew by holy inspiration what an honor it was destined to in after ages and unwilling therefore to abuse the walls when he had raised them pretty high by making holes to fix a scaffold in he modestly resolved to stand upon this stone which then lay there by chance and build as high as he could reach by its assistance which it seems was so extremely taken with the patriarchs goodnature that it gradually rose and lifted him about from place to place till he had made an end of all the building  the ceremonies here performed hither then the pilgrims come as many at a time as the emirhadgey thinks fit to send together least they should affront the holy place by overcrowding its approaches the only ceremonies here performed are falling prostrate on the earth and blessing god who has permitted them to see a sight so sacred then repeating certain prayers they pass in order through the pillars of the four apartments of the sects abovenamed and are blessed and kissed by the respective priests of each opinion after which they walk out backwards till they pass the utmost limits of this venerable fabric  hangings out in pieces to make relics nothing rests deserving our remark but that a black silk canopy which covers all the roof of this fine house is changed for one renewed each year at the expense of the grand signior and by him sent thither with the caravan of pilgrims while the old one by the priests is cut in many thousand pieces and distributed among the superstitious people by the way of sale with a pretense that those who bear that holy relic still about them shall be ever free from sudden death and unexpected dangers of what kind soever  medina telnabi hence such people as are led by zeal to think their duty summons them to see their prophets tomb accompany the caravan which goes from mecca to damascus and arrive in eight or ten days time at medina telnabi much about the magnitude of mecca  the tombs of mahomet osmin and hali here in an obscure and narrow corner of a stately mosque which stands directly in the middle of the town are seen the sepulchers of the impostor mahomet and his two famous followers osmin and haly  description of the tombs the tombs are low and narrow of a lozenge cut and framed of marble of a very black or dusky color void of any kind of ornament or writing whatsoever and enclosed within three round and high built marble turrets through whose sides are cut small narrow windows into which the pilgrims look and see the tombs of their respected prophets that of mahomets the middlemost of all the three  the towers enclosing them these turrets are adorned with little galleries of gold and silver which together with the inward and external sides of all the towers are richly ornamented with innumerable quantities of precious stones of an inestimable value great half moons of gold and diamonds chains of pearl and crowns of jewels glorious ornaments every here and there appearing writ in golden letters the repeated names of god and mahomet between the different kinds of treasure which for many ages have been sent as offerings from the superstitious princes who profess mahometanism  the departure of the pilgrims here the pilgrims gain a second blessing and return as soon as they have seen the tombs to reach the caravan which waits their coming back at mecca and advance toward egypt in the order they came thence with many drunk or mad with zealous folly bore their eyes or hold them over burning irons till they lose their sight as thinking it a sin beyond excuse to look on grovelling earthly vileness after they have once been blessed with so divine and longdesird a prospect  chap xlix of the arabians their government and way of living the descent of the arabs the arabs are descended as is commonly believed from ishmael dwelling now as anciently they did in tents and open places nothing differing from what they were when the inspired historians of the holy scriptures writ their character and handed down the nature of those barbarous people to the knowledge of posterity  the etymology of saracen they are distinguished likewise by the name of saracens from the arabian etymology of saarasaaken which in english signifies as much as an inhabitant of desert countries  description of the arabs they are generally men of middle stature swift and daring very lean and wonderfully bony tawny to a strange degree by the perpetual influence of an unshadowd sun which burns em in the deserts they are shrill of voice beyond most women and inclined by nature to the cruel practices of an unlimited barbarity  their pride their pride exceeds most other nations for they scorn dependence and reject all notions of a lawful government they boast antiquity and not unjustly glorying in that they have in the continued course of such a mighty number of successive ages kept themselves unmixed with other nations and obtained an undisputed claim to not alone the ancientest but purest titles of nobility now extant in the universe by an obstinate contempt of all mechanical employments and depending solely on their arms and courage for the means of their subsistence  their way of living hence they ravage all they meet with live in plunder and infest the deserts with a lawless multitude of great and little parties robbing and destroying all they conquer if they presume to make resistance after which they suddenly retire behind such endless tracts of unknown sand that none can follow them with force sufficient to repel their numbers  why it is impossible to conquer them it is esteemed impossible to conquer thoroughly these ungovernable people for they ride on horses of peculiar skill in tracing out the passages of the unstable deserts and can live on very small and poor provisions and by frequenting constantly those barren places know the ground so very well that no great number can attempt pursuing them but they must perish by the want of food and water ever they can with reason hope to find the private lurking corners of their nimble enemies who never fail to watch the moment of some favorable opportunity to fall upon em under covert of the night with bloody execution  their arms they little understand and less esteem the use of firearms all their weapons are a kind of spears not much unlike an officers halfpike in england headed with a cap of steel sharppointed and of admirable temper which they poize with an extended arm and either hurl at distance or can use in close fight with an enemy as they may see occasion  their strange dexterity secondly they are the surest archers in the world and generally arm themselves with a capacious quiver of steelheaded arrows some of which are always poisoned these they shoot with such a strange dexterity on horseback or on foot that like the ancient parthians famed in history they kill more enemies in their retreat from a lost battle than they slaughtered all the time before while face to face they stood the shock of open war and fought for victory  their roving life they live as i have said before in tents and pitch their camps from time to time where any little face of pasture for their horses or the prospect of the most advantages from robbing caravans invite their stay removing frequently from one place to another carrying with them all the cities they pretend to dwell in and the families which they are masters of  their form of government they are divided into tribes or companies and pay a kind of reverence to certain princes as they call em who by long descent of noble blood beyond the rest are honored by the tribes and constantly preside in all their councils guiding as they please though not assuming a commanding power the business of the people who respect em greatly though no otherwise distinguished from the common people than by wearing turbants of a different form but equal bigness  their habits and diet etc their habits differ nothing from the vulgar turks their diet is not much unlike the tartars and their exercises few because they live in a perpetual motion their religion is mahometanism and they look upon it as no little honor to their nation that the prophet was their countryman  their way of disposing of the goods they plunder when they have plundered a considerable booty they deliver it to certain of their people living peaceably on every border of the deserts who are suffered to converse and trade with all the governments about em rather out of fear than friendship  these find present means to sell the plunder of one nation to the natives of another and delivering the money to the party whence they had the goods receive a certain fixed reward proportionable to the value of the prize while all the rest is equally divided among those who shared the danger with this money they will often buy fine jewels or whatever else their inclinations lead em to  jewels for the women since i have mentioned jewels twill be necessary to inform the reader of the uses they design em to which is to ornament the persons of their women for they have as many wives as they think fit and either carry them about as they remove themselves or leave them in their expeditions in the towns or camps they have upon the most delightful habitable and not quite infertil borders of arabia  the arabian women dreadful creatures i think i need not tell the english ladies that the sun is no great friend to beauty and the poor arabian females find it to their sorrows for but that their husbands prove them women and not only so but fruitful women too i should not only quite mistake their sex by missing in their souls and persons all those soft engaging excellencies which combine to crown the graces of my countrywomen but really misinterpret their humanity by judging them some meanerpart of the creation methinks the painters who to cover the disgraces which the christian armies frequently received by being beaten in the holywar by those mens ancestors took care to represent a saracen upon their signposts like a monstrous giant so so to give a terrible idea of those people had done better far to paint the figure of a saracens wife for all the world must have believed that where the women were such frightful creatures all the men must have been worse than devils  another kind of arabs some people notwithstanding bear the name of arabs and are yet of principles directly different from these such for example as inhabit many places in arabia felix and some other countries where they live in peace and honesty subservient to the laws of civil government but those i speak of are the arabs commonly distinguished by the name of wild or independent and are every way the men i have described abhorred but dreaded by mankind in general yet above the anger of surrounding enemies  chap l probable conjectures concerning the ten tribes of israel which were carried away captive by shalmanezer king of assyria   kings chap    i would not have my reader led to a mistake of what i mean or by the title of this chapter be induced to think i flatter my belief with an opinion that i can inform the world more largely than all other writers of the present state of the ten captived tribes of broken israel  the aim of this chapter my only aim in touching on this subject is to prove that those who guess the race of turks to be descended from the jews of the ten tribes abovenamd may at least defend their notion by a very probable and natural chain of arguments if not incontrovertible and certain demonstration  many various opinions many notwithstanding and extremely various are the odd opinions commonly received not only in the europaean world but even in those eastern parts which by their old vicinity of situation to that bondagd people may be thought to have retained an eager curiosity to know if possible the present fortunes of a formidable nation which in ancient times they not alone esteemed but held uninterrupted correspondence with  among the several judgments or conjectures made upon this famous head it may not possibly be thought unwelcome should i entertain the reader with a few of the most celebrated notions prevalent in the opinions of the knowing universe  the first notion one commonly received opinion is that these ten tribes of captived jews went quite through tartary to greenland so to america by passing by the straight of darien where they fixed themselves in the dominions of peru and all those parts distinguished by the name of nova hispania or the spanish west indies  its proofs to prove the probability of this assertion its defenders openly avouch that there are many ruins extant to this day whose own remains and the tradition of the country join to speak them formerly the work of jewish architects in many of these buildings they report to have discovered wellwrought nails of mighty size which kept the timber joined together this was judged remarkable because those buildings were erected long before the indian natives are supposed to have been made acquainted with the use of iron  again they judge it very probable because the spanish indians are not of so brown and beardless a complexion as the rest but much inclining to the airs and features of the ancient jews and thence believed to be decended from them  another reason they produce as a persuasive to their notion is that when the spaniards conquered mexico peru and all those parts of the west indies they perceived their customs as to women altars jubilees divorces and the knowledge they professed of the creation of the world and universal deluge with a thousand other of their practices and ceremonies so entirely molded to the imitation of the jewish customs that they could not help concluding that great numbers of the indians were themselves descended from those jews of the ten tribes aforesaid or at least had learnt from them the numerous ceremonies they so long continued to indulge the practice of  the second notion of the ten tribes of israel another notion not alone received among the jews but almost every nation in the east persuades them to believe that many of those tribes may now be found in certain inland parts of china and to prove the probability of this opinion they produce a thousand instances of roman missionary priests and many other travelers who have discovered mighty numbers of those people in the land abovenamed who retain the practice of the ancient jewish ceremonies but are altogether ignorant of either the arrival doctrine or portentous crucifixion of our blessed savior  the third notion it is no improbable conjecture that some tribes if not all inhabit in a country to the south of persia commonly distinguished by the name of tabor for the people there obey one great and arbitrary monarch and profess no other faith than that of judaism  its proofs the natives of this country are divided into tribes which still retain such names as are entirely consonant with those which anciently distinguished the lost tribes of israel and the name of tabor which as i have said before their province bears appears not widely different from habor whither salmanezer ordered them to be transported as we read in holy scripture in the second book of kings and the seventeenth chapter   kings chapter    v     then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years  in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes    the fourth notion those are not few who strenuously maintain that many parts of aethiopia are inhabited by the posterity of these ten jewish tribes particularly near the lake whence nilus is supposed to take his rise all the men of this persuasion would oblige us to believe the abyssens coptees and certain other ethiopian christians owe the practice of their circumcising children to some ancient imitation of the custom of the jews who found a refuge in their then more hospitable country  the fifth notion it is more talked of than believed that they may possibly inhabit those unknown and spacious territories on the other side of that prodigious river the sabbatical river which josephus mentions to be not far distant from the caspian sea and called sabbatical by reason of a wondrous secret in the nature of its stream which runs six days with such amazing breadth and rapid violence of an impetuous current that by driving down the very stones and sand over which it rolls it renders it impossible for mortal courage strength or artifice to compass means of passing it but on the sabbath day at which time all the waters fall miraculously for the space of four and twenty hours leaving dry and passable the sandy bottom  the sixth opinion mr william pen in the account he gives of pensilvania tells us he believes the natives of that place had no original but from the jewish tribes and arms the arguments he uses on this subject with the following observations  its reasons that god could point them out with ease a passage to america from the eastern parts of asia and that since they were ordained to be removed to an vntilld even vndiscoverd country it is highly probable that the west indies was the place since that was then the only unknown quarter of the habitable universe  and that they rather peopled pensilvania than the other parts of the west indies he imagines not unlikely since the natives of that country so resemble jews in features and deportment that they seem distinguishably marked by god as the posterity of that unhappy nation  jewish customs in pensilvania again their feasts fasts sacrifices and all other rights and ceremonies with the great affinity their language bears to hebrew and abundance more concurring circumstances in their ways of life agree so evidently with the jewish institutions government and customs that he judges it a very reasonable notion to conclude they are descended from the long lost race of the subverted israelites  the seventh opinion but having mentioned the foregoing notions now most common in the eastern world i will proceed to let you see how probable it is that all the turks are of the jewish race and that the ten abovenamed tribes at least the greatest remnant of them now reside in tartary and are the people so notorious for their inhumanity so formidable in their government unknown in their condition and so justly dreaded by the often invaded world who only know them by the name of tartars  the turks descended from the jews i showed the reader in my entrance on the book that anciently the turks were an huge body of vngovernable wandering scythians or tartars who forsook their country for some unknown cause and overrunning turcomania and a boundless tract of fertile land became a people formidably numerous and swelled in time to that surprising pitch of arbitrary sway they boast at present  it hence appears it is universally allowed as an undoubted certainty that it is from tartary the turks first took their origin it only then remains to prove that those we now call tartars may be rationally thought the true posterity of the ten tribes of israel which the conquering salmanecer carried with him captive as aforesaid which i shall endeavor to perform as briefly as is possible  the etymology of the word tartar and first the reader may observe that taruthar or tartar in the syrian language signifies the remnant or remainder of a people which though alone an argument of no small weight is strongly aided by the following particulars  a very probable argument media situated near the caspian sea is now possessed entirely by these tartars and as it appears by the abovenamd text of holy writ that the ten tribes of israel were transported to the cities of the medes so it is observable that those few cities which the tartars have are called by names agreeing nearly with the ancient towns of israel when she flourished  ancient jewish names still retained thus the capital of tartary is called samaryan which is very little different from samaria once the great metropolis of israels monarchs and it is observable that many pillars buildings and vast relics of antiquity are yet remaining in this town adorned in so demonstrative a manner that they plainly speak themselves to have been jewish monuments  a river called jordan they have another town called jericho a mount named sion and another mount distinguished by the name of tabor with a river yordan from the hebrew jordan and a thousand other names of places plainly prove a jewish etymology  the tartars divided into ten tribes they are divided into ten great tribes or parties bearing names not much unlike the ancient patriarchs from whom the israelites received their appellations all these tribes though wholly subject to one common government avoid confounding kindred by a marriage into one another families a nicety which never was observed but by the jews and now these tartars thence with probability suppod their offspring  the language of the tartars the language of the tartars is so very reconcilable to hebrew that the difference there is between them may be very well accounted for when we consider they were mixed so long with their rough conquerors the syrians ere they found a possibility to make a general revolt and the prodigious ignorance and strange barbarity a nation for so many ages void of arts and sciences or the improvements of humanity by trade or conversation with a more polite and knowing people must of course degenerate to  a tradition of the tartars another thing which serves to prove the just validity of this opinion is that all the tartars do not only circumcise and use the ancient jewish rights in almost every point of worship but traditionally boast themselves to be descended from those israelites who conquering their conquerors became possessed of all the territories by the caspian sea and hence it was that tamerlain or rather tamherlane the great who led the turkish bajazet about his city in an iron cage would often take occasion to be vaunting of his pedigree affirming he was lineally descended from the tribe of dan in an uninterrupted genealogy  the two inferences to be drawn from the foregoing arguments from the abovenamd observations it appears but rational to draw two inferences first that the great founders of the present turkish empire are descended from the tartars race and secondly that those distinguished now by the said name of tartars are the ten transplanted tribes of israel so justly punished by almighty god for their offensive obstinacy that from the most esteemed and glorious nation of the universe they are degenerated into the most despicable outcasts of unblessed humanity  chap li instructions to the traveller who would make a safe and profitable journey into the eastern countries the design of this chapter the generous reader will i doubt not put a right interpretation on my meaning in pretending to instruct the world when i my self as much as other people want instruction all i aim at by the subject i am now about to take upon me is to lay down rules which i have proved by often repeated though but young experience to be safe and necessary to the practice of that traveller who would to any purposespend his time in foreign countries  education of youth the glory of a nation the infinite advantages the honor glory riches and prosperity accruing to a nation by the careful training up the youth she shines with and the great necessity of sowing wisely all those seeds of liberal education which they hope to see securely flourish in a full maturity are so conspicuous to mankind and universally allowed of that i need enlarge no more on so incontrovertible an argument  the advantages of travel if then the care of youth be commonly allowed a duty weightily incumbent on a common wealth twill easily appear a certain truth both from the practice of the ancient and the modern times that sending them to travel into foreign parts has ever been esteemed and doubtless is the greatest blessing and most sure improvement we can lead their minds to since they learn thereby to study men instead of books and by a free and generous conversation with the open world not only shake off their domestic dregs of bashfulness and ignorance but wholesomely digesting the remembered dictates of their late minority become polite in the deportment of their persons and refined extremely in the notions of their judgment  the folly of neglecting it hence it follows that as it is undoubtedly the greatest policy as well as honor of a prudent people to encourage youth to early travel it is an unhappy flaw in any nations character to have it said they stand insensible of evident advantages and rather stifle than promote a practice so commendable  englishmen remiss in its encouragement i must confess i have with no small wonder taken notice that my countrymen of all the europaean nations are the most remiss in this affair we see them commonly but thinly sown in foreign courts camps schools or academies while numbers of the natives of all other christian countries flock continually to every land or city famous in the least beyond their neighbors  an observation on the northbritons i ought not to omit since i have here so fair an opportunity the doing justice to our latevnited gallant brothers of northbritain who are so effectually sensible of the advantages abovenamd that their gentlemen are commonly the best bred and most learned of christendom and do not only travel much but to much purpose also for we seldom see a celebrated court of europe but the civil sometimes sometimes military offices thereof are not alone possessed but ornamented greatly by the natives of that country  traveling now more in fashion however i may spare the pains of searching for the causes of so groundless a neglect since there appears a brisker turn than formerly to animate the genius of the english nation who within some few years past have seemed to seek more earnestly than heretofore the benefits of traveling  i will therefore only wish for the improvement of a custom so praiseworthy and proceed to give the hints i promised in relation to the methods they should use in traveling  at what age young men should travel i am not for the speedy sending youth abroad before their judgment is mature enough to give them a distinguishing idea of the use as well as prospect of the things they meet with eighteen years of age is more too early than too late for a young man to think of leaving england this i know by personal experience having been beholding to my latter travels for a full digestion and improvement of the unripe observations vainly gathered in my former  an error common in the english practice it is a fault too common in our modern practice to send young men abroad to see the rarities of italy and other countries before they are at all acquainted with domestic curiosities and things as well deserving observation in the heart of our own kingdom as he possibly can meet with in the places he must travel through  its follies besides it is a kind of unaccountable simplicity to think a man is qualified for conversation in a foreign land before he understands or has the smallest notion of the government or any part of the whole constitution or condition of his native country for such an ignorance must necessarily render him unfit for an inquisitive or learned society in any place he comes to and consequently hinder him of all advantages he might have reaped from the improvements of his journey  another error another error and no small one is that most young men are sent abroad entirely ignorant of german dutch italian and too often french or any foreign languages this renders them deprived of even a possibility of living as they ought in friendship and acquaintance with their equals or superiors where they come for it is but seldom any tongue but french is thought worth bringing home or if some few have souls and memory enough to compass more by that time they have learned to speak them tolerably the short space allotted for their absence is expired and they must return to put an end to their vain journey just as they are grown capacitated to improve themselves by its advantages  a third error there are a kind of gentlemen called tutors generally sent abroad with a commission to direct and govern their young travelers these are sometimes frenchmen sometimes englishmen but always of an age by far superior and an humor often opposite to those they have the charge of  proper to be reformed this i think an error that should be reformed for many reasons if the tutor be a foreigner i need not nominate the many disadvantages the pupil must be subject to and if an englishman of such superior age as commonly they are i humbly ask my readers leave to say a word or two on that occasion  the reasons for reforming it young men are naturally prepossessed with a dislike or timorous apprehension of such men as are appointed for their governors they are their second schoolmasters and consequently looked upon as objects of their spleen they are imagined spies over all their actions and informers of their juvenile extravagancies their best advice is coldly listned to for want of an affection and their precepts robbed of proper force because not backed by open familiarity  more reasons again it is natural for young men to reflect what is this man who curbs our inclinations why a tutor that is one whose business is to call those pleasures faults which he has now perhaps outlived the taste of he forgets the inclinations of his youth and would oblige us to a life as melancholy as his own in spite of all the disproportion that appears betwixt our ages but were any of the arguments he used made strong by both the precept and example of some wise companion not much older than himself they would undoubtedly prevail on his belief because he cannot look upon them the effects of peevish age or want of relish but occasioned purely by a wise restraint of headstrong passions and a swing of vanity  as i have censured those three common errors in our practice just aforenamd so i will as briefly as is possible set down the rules by which we may with ease avoid their inconveniences  how the first error might be mended and first i would advise that children should be put to school so early that they may have gained a competent increase of understanding in a residence at either of the universities by that time they have reached the age of eighteen years at farthest  then it might be proper that in some relations care he might reside at london one whole winter there to learn the fashionable gayeties which recommend a gentleman for breeding and appearance  a necessary improvement in the summer following twoud be a great improvement to his knowledge if assisted by the recommendatory letters of his friends to their acquaintance in the country he should undertake a journey quite through england wales and part of if not all north britain  how to be  but he should not only travel through these countries but from place to place be recommended to the house and care of some considerable man of parts and fortune who should not alone contrive to entertain him hospitably but be sure to introduce him to the knowledge and acquaintance of the best and wisest part of all his neighborhood by whose assistance and society he might not only be diverted with a sight of every curiosity but taught at large the charters and antiquity of every corporation privileges laws and customs of each county honor and descent of every family and all things else that might be fansyd requisite to give him an entire idea of the nature and condition of the government he is subject to  by these means he is hardened for the accidental dangers and fatigues he probably may meet with in his longer journey and enabled when he is abroad to give a foreigner an answer to a question full as easily as ask one of him  a second error how curable secondly in order to prevent the inconveniences arising from a want of knowledge in the european languages i would advise all gentlemen who think of traveling to qualify themselves for true improvement by some few years previous interwoven application to the study of the french italian dutch and german languages which they may learn with ease at several times by several masters or by one while at their latin school or either university then having made themselves indifferent proficients they may in their six months continuance at london afterward improve them to a fuller height by keeping company as much as possible with foreign gentlemen who travel yearly into england and would be glad of their society  the advantages of language thus would they go abroad sufficiently enabled to converse familiarly in foreign countries as they did at home and thence avoiding that too common shyness used to strangers they would soon gain friends and pleased with their acquaintance swell their knowledge to as high a pitch abroad as they had done at home by former application  an observation concerning tutors thirdly not to rob the gentlemen who in the character of tutors take upon them the no little charge of educating youth of those accomplished merits some of them are masters of i would offer to the serious consideration of my countrymen whether twoud not be a method more conducive to the good improvement of a young mans time to send abroad as his companion some young gentleman of unquestionable conduct not much older than himself but one who has by public business or his former travels rendered his experience riper than his years might speak it  how justified here persuasion and example would undoubtedly be far more efficacious than the precepts of authority the arguments which might be used to win him from a folly would appear no otherwise than friendly wishes for his welfare the familiar conversation they would have together must afford a thousand pretty opportunities to censure the miscarriages he may have made with a brisk air of unsuspected gayety  the only bar no great one in short the only bar to the advantages which must accrue from such a practice is the mighty difficulty that must certainly attend the choice of such a man as may in every point appear well qualified for the discharge of such a trust as must be given him and this how difficult soever it may seem will prove an easier task upon examination than most men imagine it and doubtless would be easier yet if once the introduction of so good a custom gave encouragement for men of worth to qualify themselves for that employment  which parts are best to travel first to when thus prepared for foreign travel the young gentleman would do a prudent action to consider what part of the universe he may with most improvement bend his journey to and certainly in my opinion twoud be best to visit first the east or southeast world for there he will not only view a scene of nature wholly contrary to his own country in religion humor government and every means and form of living which he cannot well be said to meet in europe but will learn to contemplate by frequent views of the prodigious changes time has made in towns and kingdoms on the miserable instability of worldly grandeur which together with the vnpolite and rustic treatment he must doubtless meet with from the proud inhabitants of those selfloving countries will depress or curb at least the headstrong sallies of impetuous youth and native arrogance of temper so that afterward returning by the way of italy and france and other the politest european nations he may stand secure against the strong temptations of those fashionable vanities which mix themselves unluckily with the respective excellencies every court is judged most famous for  a great neglect reproved again i look upon it as a mighty error in the british travelers so strangely to neglect the knowledge of marine affairs unless their education or pursuit of their preferment calls them to their practice nothing certainly can add a brighter ornament to any englishmans capacity than to be fully versed at least made tolerably knowing in the mysteries of navigation and the many useful sciences and profitable observations which a few short voyages will gild his understanding with considerable notions of  traveling by sea recommended i would therefore willingly advise all gentlemen who travel to embark on board some trading vessel if in time of peace bound up the straits from port to port on either side or if the speed one vessel makes may call him from a place before he has had time to make his observations he will constantly be sure to meet some ship or other bound directly to the port he has a mind to be transported to no matter whether she be english or of any other christian nation for the more variety he meets with in his travels so much more extensive will become his experience  the course he should steer by these means he may at his own leisure see the kingdoms of spain portugal and sicily the seaport towns of fez morocco tripoly algiers and other parts of barbary the numerous islands of the grecian archipelago with the rich emporiums of the turkish empire smyrna and constantinople  a further journey hence he may proceed by land and sea as he imagines most convenient and diverting on to egypt and the holy land and thence from place to place with yearly caravans or monthly ones till he has satisfied his utmost curiosity with a distinct and serious view of all the several branches of that mighty monarchy  the tour continued and ended two several ways this done he may return from any seaport town of turkey by the way of italy for ships are constantly bound thence to venice or leghorn but as some inconveniences such as performing quarantana and the like attend that voyage twoud be more improving and delightful to a genius tempered with the smallest curiosity to travel over land through turkey into italy by the road of philippopolis and so to venice or into germany by passing through romania bulgaria valachia transylvania and hungary to the city of vienna either of which roads admitting you to a considerable part of christendom lies easy and convenient to point you out a tour through all the noted courts of europe after which you will return to england like an indian vessel whose inestimable freight makes full amends for the fatigues and dangers of a tedious absence  now that all these schemes of travel may be undertaken and performed with as much safety and advantage as is possible i beg the readers patience while i give a word or two of necessary caution which will bring me on to a conclusion of the chapter  another great neglect there is not a neglect more common nor of a more fatal consequence now suffered than the sending gentlemen abroad without a further charge of letters than such only as are necessary to procure supplies of money when their exigencies may require it  the use of recommendatory letters he ought to carry recommendatory letters for each noted place he thinks of going to nor are those letters worthy of that name which commonly are sent by merchants to their correspondents in a foreign part wherein the gentleman who bears them is in fashionable words of course so coldly recommended that a formal visit or a drunken entertainment is the most he meets with from the persons he is addressed to  the care to be used in that point all gentlemen who send their sons or friends abroad should be extremely nice in this particular for it is according to the interests or inclinations of the people to whom travelers are recommended that their journey turns to good or ill account however great may be their quality or long their absence  the inconveniences of going abroad without them if they are not recommended to some gentlemen of interest in the countries they pass through they can do no more in any town they come to than walk up and down the streets see now and then a monastery or perhaps peep through the grates of some close nunnery stare aukwardly upon the outsides of great buildings and return to england after two or three years absence just as wise in foreign matters as when they departed from it  a fault peculiar to englishmen abroad and here i cannot help complaining of a fault peculiar to the english gentlemen abroad and called by foreigners an vnbred pride and haughtiness of temper though it is rather owing to their want of recommendatory letters well directed it is a kind of separation or distinction which they make between themselves and the inhabitants of any town they chance to stay at earnestly desiring english company and seeming as it were averse to any other which entirely robs them of the smallest possibility of making an improvement by their travels or expenses  the best recommendatory letters the only way is to make interest with the foreign ministers ambassadors or envoys who reside at london and have doubtless not alone a vast acquaintance but considerable power with the best and most capacitated gentlemen of their own country and the tenor of their letters should require their favor friendship and good offices in every kind to the young traveller who carries them but more especially solicit their assistance and directions in the observations most deserving a remark and their advice what towns or places in the country may be worth regard with the additional civility of letters of recommendation which may urge their friends in any parts to do as they have done by the departing traveller  another necessary caution another kind of letters they should never go without are those directed to our own ambassadors or other public ministers residing in the courts of foreign princes and a due respect should constantly be paid them on your first arrival these advices well observed may i have reason to believe at least i wish they might conduce a little to my countrymens advantage who design to travel but as i have thoughts of publishing hereafter by its self a regular treatise on this subject i will now conclude with an assurance to my reader that experience has convinced me of the truth of what i write or i had scarce presumed to recommend my sentiments on this occasion  chap lii the conclusion and now i have as well as i am able played the part of a sincere relater of the observations made in foreign countries and commit my book to the ill nature of the critics with a scorn of all their little malice and a hearty wish that such as read with a desire to be diverted or informed may find therein as full a satisfaction as i should receive in hearing that they did so  the malice of the times the fashionable envy of these peevish times permits no author to be overproud of his best labors and were i less modest than i think my self which would i am sure be very far from any thing like vanity the age i live in would no doubt find means to mortify all selfesteem and were a book to be exposed to public censure as deserving praise as those of horace or the roman ovid the ill nature of critics softmouthd critics would be nibling at the bait and run the hazard of breaking out their teeth far rather than not strive to make some ill impression on it which if after all they fail to do they will drivel out their rage and spit upon it harmlesly in mere vexation  were there a modern ovid now alive accomplished like the ancient he would be looked upon a very monster of vainglory should he crown his labors with a selfwreathd gaerland and conclude his works as magisterially as once the former did in these highsounding verses ovid met lib ult jamque opus exegi quod nec jovis ira nec ignis nec poterit ferrum neque edax abolere vetustas and now an end to that vast work is given which neither fire nor the ill will of heaven nor the keen rage which does the sword employ nor times devouring rust shall ever destroy   the authors resignation since therefore truth not merit can successfully lay claim to just applause in this ungrateful age i who can only boast the former virtue will proceed more humbly and submit my labors to the sentence of the world with all the resignation of a man who having nobler ends in writing than to flatter faction or expect reward has no occasion to be much solicitous for the success of his endeavors  a word or two concerning the probable downfall of the turks i will only add a word or two concerning a conspicuous probability of the approaching downfall of the turkish empire which has grown by gradual acquisitions to a most amazing bulk and constitution but at present seems so weakened by the natural corruption and infirmities of age that terrible convulsions shake its frame as if twere hastening onwards toward a sudden period  expected from the muscovites i have elsewhere in this book occasionally taken notice of a prophecy in vogue among the turks that they shall be destroyed by a longwhitehaird northern nation of the christian world and that they look upon the muscovites to be the nation hinted in the prophecy on which account they seem extremely apprehensive of the motions of that people and their fright is aggravated greatly by the means the muscovites have lately found of sending ships of war through the black sea to constantinople and the universal disposition of the greeks to look upon that nation as their longdecreed deliverers  the policy of the czar in his war with sweden if heaven has ordained it to be so it is probable it may be suddenly effected for the warlike disposition of the present czar beyond his ancestors and the degeneracy of the modern from the ancient turks are weighty circumstances the victorious king of sweden has been nothing worse than a severe schoolmaster to the muscovites who owe an admirable discipline to the war they are now engaged in and reserve those troops made soldiers by a year or twos fatigue in inland garrisons to exercise their fellows and improve themselves while raw and newraised men are sent each year to face their enemies till they become good warriors and give way to more fresh comers  the reasons guessed in my opinion these proceedings wear the air of some welllaid design and the fatigue the present monarch of the muscovite dominions has been at in tedious travels the uncredited improvement he has made throughout his country chiefly in marine affairs the great encouragement he gives all foreign officers and arts he uses to allure them to his service all these seem to speak a further end than the repulsing a weak swedish enemy  the possibility of his conquering the turks it is my belief he will fall upon the turks as soon as the maturity of his designs affords him opportunity nor do i question but  by gods assistance with the great advantages he will have over them he may entirely overthrow their government and in their ruin gloriously revenge the bloody falls of those brave christian princes who have sunk from age to age beneath the weight of their oppressive usurpation but the nature of my book and little space i have to spare forbid me to enlarge on this particular which if i have foreseen with judgment heaven direct to triumph in prosperity for the great good of universal christendom  finis
