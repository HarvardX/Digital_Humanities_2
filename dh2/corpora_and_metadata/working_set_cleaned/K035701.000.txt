an enquiry into the causes of the decay of the dissenting interest  in a letter to a dissenting minister  justum and tenacem propositi virum non civium ardor prava jubentium non vultus instantis tyranni mente quatit solidd  hor nullum numen abest si sit prudentia  juv london printed for j roberts at the oxfordarms in warwick lane    0 price   d  a letter to a dissenting minister reverend sir i cannot but think the conversation we lately had with some friends about the dissenting interest might be very useful if made more public because though every one is sensible it gradually declines yet no one has endeavored to recover it though a great part of that company thought it not difficult to effect i believe this is owing to our disagreement as to the causes of its decay and unless the causes are found out a remedy cannot possibly be applied but it must continue consuming till it is quite worn out and spent you may remember there were many reasons hereof assigned at that time some of which appear to have but very little if any pretense to it such as the lenity of the government the want of a persecution to keep us together the loss of a puritanical spirit etc as to the first i cannot think it to be any cause for men are rather apt perversely to abuse the lenity of the government and to go in direct opposition to it and those who can suffer persecution for the truth would certainly act consistently with it at other times but if it be indeed the reason then the interest is not worth supporting because twould be founded upon mere obstinacy and proceed from a spirit of contradiction the last cannot be the cause inasmuch as the true puritanical spirit is not lost but rather carried farther and improved the spirit of the good old puritans was nothing else but a spirit of liberty and considering what they suffered in the defense of it they cannot but be thought as much superior to the patrons of civil liberty as civil liberty is inferior to religious indeed some of them had a few oddities mixed with this generous sentiment which it must be acknowledged were ridiculous enough and these have been improved by witty and sarcastical men to the prejudice of their sentiments but their successors have by degrees thrown them off and still continue to do so till it is to be hoped they will in time entirely vanish that so their true spirit abstracted therefrom may appear in its own colors bright and lively and be valued as the alone principle not only of dissenting but even of truth and religion themselves so that i think the grand causes of the present decay of the dissenting interest are ignorance of their own principles and ill conduct and management of their own interests  the first of these must be one cause for when they are rightly understood they are unanswerable they are only those of the reformation carried farther than in the church of england and it is surprising how any who pretend to be reformed can entertain that enmity to them which has always been more or less strong in those who call themselves tories but especially i am surpised at those who have wrote in other cases upon the same principles how then comes it to pass we should be branded as upstarts for our principles are not new but eternally true and sacred or that any who have ever heard of them should be ashamed of or renounce them so that i am persuaded those who leave us either have never thoroughly learnt them or else their circumstances are so unhappy that either from the perverseness of those they have to do with or else from their own private affairs they cannot act consistently with them  therefore for the benefit of those who have been bred in ignorance or instructed in false principles i think sir twould be very proper to acquaint the world what our true sentiments are and to disclaim those which are prejudicial to truth and introductive of bigotry and enthusiasm for such are not only false but vicious and yet how many dissenters are there who have run into them and thereby driven others from us who see their absurdity if they do not examine whether we have any thing more solid and convincing to say for ourselves i never yet met with any who could withstand the force of them when they were rightly explained and even those who are led to approve the ceremonies of the establishment as proper enough in a political view yet can never vindicate them when objected against upon the foot of liberty  the fundamental principle of the dissenters is as i apprehend a liberty for every man to form his own sentiments and to pursue them by all lawful and regular methods to disclaim the impositions of men and to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience it supposes that god has given to all men capacities of understanding their obligations to him and therefore as every man is accountable to god for his actions he is under the strictest obligations to act according to his own knowledge and whenever he does not he is guilty of a voluntary violation of truth it supposes the scriptures to be a sufficient rule of the conduct of men as well in religious as in secular affairs and that no one has a right to enjoin things as necessary to church communion which are not enjoined in the scriptures and that the arguments from antiquity and the practice of the primitive church are not a sacred and infallible rule for our practice because then they would not have been left to the discretion even of the ancients themselves but been mentioned by the apostles who only were inspired and however we may follow any of their customs as fit and proper enough yet we are not to pay them any particular reverence or to acknowledge a divine right in them that as the circumstances of churches or private societies vary so their method of worship and communion must likewise vary and however it may be proper for them to agree upon certain customs and ceremonies amongst themselves yet they must not be considered as binding the conscience and therefore it is proper sometimes to alter them lest custom should seem to bear the stamp of authority it supposes that the church of christ is not national but private and since neither our savior nor his apostles have laid down any rules for the government of the churches no particular rules were designed for all churches in every particular place but were left to the discretion of every one according as they appeared best suited to answer the purposes of religious worship therein this is the reason why we differ amongst ourselves though that has been objected against us because we have all an equal right to judge for ourselves and one church has the same liberty of making discretionary rules as another this seems absolutely inconsistent with any national establishment and imposition and the same reasons that induce us to dissent in england would lead us to the same in rome or at scotland  this is the general opinion of the dissenters steadfast and unmovable in all places and at all times i mean of those who understand themselves it must be allowed there are many who dissent from the establishment not upon this principle but because they think their own method of worship to be the only scriptural method and plead as strictly and with as much bigotry for it as the highest in the church of england do for the divine right of episcopacy but these i shall reject afterward and show not only their tendency to destroy the dissenting interest but the necessity of our dissenting as entirely from them as from the establishment i am now sir only speaking of those who are in the same generous free sentiments with yourself and who have long renounced all bigotry and enthusiasm  and if those which i have mentioned be our genuine opinions let us consider how necessarily they oblige us to decline the communion of the establishment both as to the clergy and the laity for there are great though not equal hardships that are imposed upon each  as to the clergy their hardship consists not only in submitting to all the forms and ceremonies which the laity must likewise submit to and which it is impossible they can always approve of but they are likewise obliged to subscribe in the most solemn manner that they assent to the truth of every tittle contained in the book of common prayer and the homilies and that they consent to the use of them upon all the times therein mentioned as likewise to the truth of thirty nine articles drawn up in the time of queen elizabeth for the avoiding diversities of opinions and for the establishing consent touching true religion i will not now dispute the truth of any of these articles but only say in the general that there are many of the best and wisest of the church of england that cannot believe some of them to be true in any sense whatever and there are others the whole current of whose opinions run contrary to them it is well known the generality of the divines of the church are in the opinions commonly called arminian and that these articles are compiled in a calvinistical strain and are not true in any arminian sense whatever and therefore we find that some who at their first promotion could subscribe to them as literally true have yet afterward upon a change of sentiment declined preferment rather than make a declaration so contrary to their consciences for you know they are obliged to subscribe to them upon every new preferment  now what an infinite hardship is this and what a shrewd temptation either to perjure themselves or leave the church and turn dissenters and which of the two is more preferable let even the most virulent advocates for the establishment determine  there are but two arguments for this subscription or rather excuses for it for most of the arguments for impositions are only excuses for them and they are either that they may be subscribed in any scriptural sense or else they now mean just nothing at all and are only preserved as an old ceremony in the church to prevent innovations this you know sir has often been said and bishop burnet has endeavored in his preface to the articles to show that though they must be assented to yet they may be taken in any sense the subscriber can put upon them to make them literally true and quotes a royal declaration in king james is time that no man thereafter shall put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the articles but shall take them in the literal and grammatical sense and thence infers that persons on both sides of a question may subscribe them and there are many of the bishops who at ordinations will not hear the senses they are taken in but only require the candidates to satisfy themselves these are the shifts that are made to vindicate a thing of the worst consequences imaginable moreover as to the use of some of the ceremonies which are not only unscriptural but absurd and which they have consented to the use of if the dignitary cannot comply with them himself it is some of them think only to keep a curate in such low circumstances that he must be forced to it thus how many of the superior clergy never read the common prayer and especially the creed of athanasius now this being the case what abundant reason have all your brethren for their dissenting and how great an instance of virtue is it to move in a lower sphere of life and submit to many inconveniences that are put upon them for the sake of their consciences and a regard to truth for it must be acknowledged that many of them if they could comply with the impositions of the church would be entitled by their learning and piety to considerable preferments and such considerable preferments have sometimes been laid as baits to draw them into it  but let us see how unreasonable this subscription is in either of the two views that have been mentioned and then how right it is to dissent and how much more inconvenient it would be to the conscience to comply with them than it is to their worldly circumstances to avoid them you know sir there are many who think the very word conscience implies something superstitious and enthusiastical but since we pretend to dissent only upon a rational account we must let these gentlemen know that we mean by conscience nothing else but reason honor integrity etc and that it is the rule whereby we judge of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of our actions and the principle that tells us whether we do right or wrong  as to the first that they may be subscribed to in any scriptural sense this cannot answer their end which is to prevent diversities of opinions because then it is no more than an assent to the truth of such particular passages of scripture and how absurd is it to give an explanation of scripture for so twas originally intended which must afterward be explained by the scripture this is to explain or prove a thing by itself which is both needless and tedious because an assent to the one is an assent to the other but supposing some of them would admit of no scriptural sense at all as if i was a clergyman and called upon to subscribe would be the case with me then i must either in a manner perjure myself or else be debarred of that service to mens best interests which i might think myself capable of i do not say there cannot possibly be any scriptural sense put on the articles upon any scheme of christians but then this must effectually exclude innumerable of the wisest and most learned of the clergy for when they are subscribed in a scriptural sense it must mean not according to the letter but the interpretation of scripture and let any but the most rigid calvinists thus subscribe them if they can but if by subscribing them in a scriptural sense be meant bringing them to suit with any words of scripture then what is it we may not subscribe to that god is corporeal because we read of his eyes hands etc or to the doctrine of transubstantiation for our savior has literally said this is my body i could by this rule receive any preferments in the church of rome if the condition was that i would subscribe to this doctrine thoi meant according to the protestant interpretation of that passage this is my body that is this is the resemblance of my body but what would our bishops say if a presbyterian was to do this at rome it is plain this was not the view of the compilers and i believe no one ever thought it was all then that can be said for it is that it is the view of the present government who now impose them but where has the government made this declaration the requirement of this subscription is to be considered as an act of parliament which is in full force till it is abrogated or explained but neither of these have been done the private declarations in conversation of any who are concerned in the government cannot alter the design of them any more than the dislike of any one member of parliament to an old statute can repeal it without a public assent of the whole legislature so that the way of subscribing them in any private or particular sense will not do but they are to be considered in the original sense of the compilers or else they now mean just nothing but are only an old ceremony preserved in the church to prevent innovations  but is this honest or is it not a very near approach to perjury do the ceremonies and solemnity of the subscription signify nothing are they a mere farce can they satisfy themselves with so solemn a mockery both of god and man certainly they have little reason to expect to receive the holy ghost after they have thus publicly lyd to him i know not how it is possible a man can do this with an upright mind either with regard to the thing itself or to the very evil consequences of it upon all truth and common morality the thing itself cannot be vindicated from a crime almost as bad as perjury and the consequence is to set an example of it to the laity with what face can a man dissuade them from trifling with serious things when he has done it so egregiously himself what is become of justice truth and fidelity if this be allowed what is it a man may not say or swear to for valuable considerations where is that strict adherence to truth which is not only inculcated in the christian revelation but is a principle of nature why might not the primitive christians have sacrificed to idols denied their master and so avoided persecution since they meant nothing more by it than an outward ceremony which in the sight of god meant nothing at all how is it possible a man can ever suffer for truth and be a martyr in its cause  but such sir are you and your brethren since you are often ridiculed and contemned sometimes abandoned to misery and want for not doing that which in civil cases the pillory would punish what an infinite pleasure is the satisfaction of your own minds beyond the thousands which a contrary practice might procure  upon the whole this subscription is absurd because it absolutely prevents all searches and enquiries after truth and only tends to shackle the mind or to betray it into vice it does not keep any out of the church but men of honesty and integrity for those either of no principles or of very unstable ones will not scruple it and then it does not avoid diversities of opinions but encourages the very worst of all opinions that a man may subscribe any thing for a living why then is it not entirely laid aside since answers no one valuable purpose but it may have the worst consequences imaginable bishop burnet has declared this subscription cannot lawfully be made as to articles of peace and indeed how can an honest man be at peace while the world is in an error that he can correct if he can he may subscribe to mahometanism in turkey that is since it is the established religion there he will not dispute against it and so it is impossible a false establishment can ever be laid aside and truth introduced  if these be the consequences of subscription in all views why does not the government either take it away or else publicly explain what is now meant by it that so there may be no temptation to that which honest minds ought not to do and generous ones cannot can men consent to the use of the common prayer who think some things in it to be so absurd that it is an affront to the divine being to offer it to him how many are there who think athanasiuss creed to be the most inconsistent jargon that ever was invented and yet it is read at certain seasons of the year in the most solemn manner as the catholic faith which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved i know there are many shifts made use of to excuse this as that those who do not believe it themselves repeat it not as their own faith but only as the faith of athanasius and the church of england but how then are the people of england taught why to believe that a great part of the clergy will be damned since there are a great part of them that do not believe it and thus a man who either resolves to search into religion for himself which every good christian and honest man ought to do must either abide out of the church or else play the hypocrite in it for if he teaches the people his own opinions in opposition to those of the church he has manifestly subscribed to what he did not believe if he does not he is instrumental in keeping them in ignorance but i shall say no more on this head because i know sir you have read and justly approved a pamphlet entitled the difficulties and discouragements which attend the study of the scriptures in the way of private judgment represented in a letter to a young clergyman said to be written by a gentleman who is since advanced to a bishopric this i wish the people would universally read because it has a strength and conviction of argument that no considerations whatsoever should overcome and it is to be hoped this reverend prelate will now do his endeavor to take these discouragements away which the title page says was his design in writing it  these sir you know are the hardships that lie upon the clergy and keep you and your brethren out of the church yet i think are not peculiar to the clergy but lie pretty heavy upon the laity too for it seems to be principally out of regard to them that these impositions are preserved because they cannot bear any alterations in that which they have been accustomed to think sacred i have met with many of the lower sort who esteem the common prayer to be of equal authority with the scriptures themselves and this renders it very improper to bind them up together as is too common and i think no small affront to the holy bible now persons of better sense must be exposed to these things for the sake of vulgar prejudices thus who could be grave to hear mr addison or mr pope chaunting out the psalms of sternhold and hopkins when dr watts which have all the charms of poetry in them cannot be sung in a church without public authority  it must be confessed there are many excellent things in the common prayer some of the ceremonies are very grave and decent and many of the prayers are incomparably the best that are extant and as good as could be devised but are there not others that are very exceptionable and cannot well be joined with why may not these be laid aside or what injury would it be if every clergyman had a liberty of reading them or leaving them out according as he and his congregation shall approve or dislike them if they are only human composures why should such regard be paid to them than which no stronger can be paid to those that are divine and every one must as universally agree to them i think this is a very great hardship both upon clergy and laity and effectually deprives both of that liberty of private judgment which they have an indisputable right to it is wonderful they do not exert themselves and stand up for their rights and privileges and that englishmen who cannot bear the thought of civil slavery can yet be zealous for ecclesiastical dissenters think it an inconsistency to be englishmen and not to be in possession of the liberty of their consciences  the laity should consider that if they were universally against impositions it would not be in the power of the clergy to lay them upon them and therefore they are in a great measure accessory even to those which are put upon the freer clergy themselves and however they may think it excusable to comply with the authority of the civil magistrate for that is all that can be said for them yet i thought it had been long incontestable that the civil magistrate has no power in matters of a religious nature for if he has any at all he has the same in turkey at rome in scotland and all other parts of the world and the same reasons of order decency etc will be as strong there as here why then should they give up a right to the magistrate which he can have no reasonable claim to the whole right he has at all is derived only from the consent of the people but the people have always in free countries reserved some previledges as sacred to themselves which they ought not nor cannot part with such are those of judging of the conduct of the magistrate of writing and speaking freely on all subjects and consequently the liberty of the press and whenever the government has endeavored to deprive them of these they have immediately grown jealous of slavery and some way or other prevented it and all those who have not stood up in their defense have been thought enemies to the constitution but certainly the liberty of judging for themselves in matters of religion is infinitely preferable to these and what they ought never to resign upon any views whatsoever and if every church was to use a private method of worship of their own and christianity only in general was to be the established religion in these kingdoms what would be the prejudice men would search into those matters for themselves and heats of party which have had the most mischievous consequences of any thing would be absolutely impossible because then none of them could be uppermost and it is likely no other zeal but that for brotherly love could prevail amongst us men could not have less religion for it is not true religion that is forced but every ones when it is his own would be most likely to be genuine these are the desirable consequences of private judgment and these are the principles of the dissenters  i believe sir we are all agreed that the civil magistrate has a right to annex what preferments and rewards he pleases to learning and merit and that the bishops as they are creatures of the civil power are to be honored as nobility and whoever will not give their lordships that respect which is due to their quality over and above their personal merit is whimsical and unmannerly but when they pretend to convey spiritual gifts and that no one can be a minister of christ who is not regularly ordained by them when they pretend to be the lineal successors of the apostles and have a divine authority for governing the churches they are so far from deserving honor that they should be despised this i should not have mentioned but thought it an exploded opinion if mr betty had not in a sermon to a full and reverend assembly at oxford and dedicated to his lordship of that diocese again revived it but as i believe the laity are not so very priestridden as to become proselytes to him i shall only say that the civil magistrate upon whom he and all in the establishment depend is in my opinion too indulgent in not calling him to account for his insolence in setting himself and his brother representatives of god so much superior to him as to be superior to angels and archangels themselves these opinions are very prejudicial to society and i think the most justly punishable of any  such authority as this you sir and your brethren do not pretend to claim and for that reason are to be honored since you have every whit as much right to it and i believe have received the spirit of god though not the holy ghost from the hands of a diocesan bishop if learning virtue and piety are meritorious how many dissenting ministers have merit and why do not the laity rather espouse your cause than the cause of such vain and pert pretenders for clergymen of every denomination are only valuable for their personal not for their reflected merit whether from their predecessors or from the government however if the laity are willing to be imposed upon there is no help for it they must be indulged i know there are some of them who think it is no imposition since they conform out of their own choice and may by the toleration go to separate congregations if they please but they are not free in either case the only difference is this in one they give up their liberty in the other it is taken away from them  but besides this general consideration of imposition i think they may make several particular objections to the ceremonies of the church and see the hardships that lie upon them the general rule in the scripture for religious worship is that all things should be done decently and in order but what an indecent noise is made by the responses the most confused and harsh one can hear what superstition in bowing to the altar and the cross in baptism but above all what tender parent can be willing to give up his own natural right over his child and have it dedicated in baptism by others this seems one of the most absurd ceremonies of the whole nay by the   th canon it is expressly ordained that no parent shall be urged to be present nor be admitted to answer as godfather for his own child the reverend mr harrison who has lately got an unmixed light into those things which he and all his former brethren had been before in obscure darkness about labors to vindicate this ceremony especially against the objection of its abuse though he has forgot to justify his subscription which is the main objection to his proceeding of all but surely he ought to think that parents the nearest relation of all and who have the most tender affection for their own offspring would if they are serious in the matter be very glad to offer them up to god themselves and are most nearly engaged to provide for them this objection was strong at the first establishment of it but more especially is it so now when the pernicious consequences of it have been so much felt how few are there that perform the promise they make or who is there that does not turn it into jest this single imposition would keep me from their communion since i could not in conscience ask a minister who has subscribed to the canons to administer the ordinance without it for the   th says a minister who omits to use the form of common prayer or any of the orders or ceremonies prescribed in the communion book let him be suspended and so i must be either a stranger at my childs baptism or else tempt the minister to break the solemn promise he has made parents who are unnatural enough to approve of this are incapable of being reasoned out of it and as to the rest let their affections to their children speak i shall mention but one notorious imposition more for i would not appear tedious or disputatious and that is kneeling at the communion i do not object to the posture itself there are many who think it the most reverend of any and they ought to use it but there are others who scruple it and therefore ought to be excused but if the most did agree in it why should it be made necessary to communion so that whosoever will not comply with it must be excluded would the decency solemnity or validity of the ordinance be less if some kneeled others were prostrate and others stood certainly not for there would be a greater appearance of true devotion and less of coldness and formality  so that all these restraints in the church are very great hardships upon the laity and i wonder they so universally comply with them but more especially at those who were called unto liberty amongst the dissenters but yet have forsaken it and voluntarily put on the fetters of the church if they have known these to be the principles of the dissenters i know not what to say but that either they are in love with bondage or else they cannot act consistently with those principles and they may as well be imposed upon in the church as out of it indeed i cannot say but they had especially the clergy who are in the way of getting more by it  and here i wish sir i could rather expostulate with them that they are mistaken than join with them in the complaint these principles are so exceeding good that none but those who have too extravagant an opinion of their own power and who delight to exercise it can oppose them as soon as they are mentioned and i have seen persons always educated dissenters who yet through some dislike or other have been going off to the church surpised to hear there were principles so strong to detain them and there are many who have no objection to the ceremonies in themselves that yet when they consider them as impositions cannot but object to them but are forced to comply with them because they think there is something equivalent among the dissenters  too many of the younger people know no other reasons for their separation than because it is a sin for the minister to wear a surplice or bow toward the altar or for themselves to bow at the name of jesus read their prayers etc but when they come to consider these things and find no immorality in them that they are established ceremonies and many of them grave solemn and cheerful they fancy it is only a whim to stand out for things of lesser importance and so resign their liberty at once and ten to one become zealous for their chains but this is thinking by halves and indeed if they think no farther they may be as easy in the church as anywhere i personally know many who have been thus drawn into it and have nothing to say in answer to the principles i have mentioned but that they do not see they are practiced among us indeed it must be acknowledged there is generally so much bigotry and managed in so disagreeable a way that i do not wonder at the decay of our interest when men are as warm for disputable opinions of their own as for the ceremonies of worship it is as well to comply with the last as with the first and of all tories dissenting tories are the most inconsistent but when men will practice as freely as they think it is then only they are truly unanswerable  the different denominations of presbyterians independents and baptists arise from different notions of the government of the church and its communion but heats and contentions about them seem happily to be laid aside and they agree in a friendly manner amongst each other though all think their particular one to be the scriptural method let them enjoy their sentiment with freedom as long as they do not quarrel about it or avoid one another upon its account for a friendly dissension here is as necessary as from the church i must own i think none of them to be the only scriptural method because there is no method at all laid down in the scriptures but is left to the discretion of them all but it is plain every one ought to follow what he thinks to be the scriptural method as long as he does not impose it as such upon the rest if they would but enjoy their other sentiments in as friendly a manner we might have a good prospect but till then i am quite out of hopes for their different characteristicks are now from their different notions in metaphysical disputes and calvinism arminianism baxterianism or arianism are to each other a mutual term of reproach insomuch that even the lower and most ignorant sort of people have often fallen out about these things though they know no more of them than the lady who would not suffer her daughter to marry an arminian merely because he was so and how can this be otherwise when ministers are perpetually writing and preaching against each other each party as warm as if the whole salvation of mankind depended upon their faith in these dubious matters the unhappy difference at saltershall injured the dissenting interest more than all their enemies together many who acted consistently with their principles were thereby driven to the greatest inconveniences and their opponents spirited up their congregations to use them ill and sometimes even to a necessity of leaving them for ever but where was the liberty for every man to be fully persuaded in his own mind when he was obliged not to consult his own sentiments but the humor of his people how many were forced to quit the ministry entirely because they could not conform to the established impositions either of the church of england or those which the dissenters themselves introduced in their stead when they ought rather to have been valued as men of honesty and principle for what could be a greater demonstration of it than to sacrifice their own interests to what they thought the public good  sir i do not mention this to revive the unhappy difference no twould grieve me to be the instrument of any new mischief i only mention it to show that such disputes tend to weaken the common interest and occasion its destruction how often have the people reproached you that the ministers cannot agree among themselves if they mean in sentiment it is impossible if they mean in brotherly love the reproach is too just and you do not follow your principles for my own part i value moderate men of each side the question those who subscribed in the fear of god and in brotherly love testified their zeal for what they thought the christian faith and those who did not subscribe with the same temper testified their zeal for what they thought to be christian liberty and the principles of the dissenters the design of each was good as long as they stopped there but it became evil when they tended to inflame their own passions and their peoples and denounced too hard and severe censures upon each other as long as these parties are kept up and mutual liberty is oppressed your interest can never revive but when you give the liberty that is due to each other it is very possible it may but bigotry will ever be the ruin of every cause  i know sir you understand me too well when i speak of bigotry to think i mean an attachment to ones own principles it is impossible for any one to be without and a man ought to act consistently with them or else he resigns his judgment and has no settled rule of action by bigotry i only mean so violent an interest in particular sentiments as to impose them upon others and occasion censure if they do not receive them or else such an obstinacy in present sentiments as will silence all others that are different from them here it ought to be considered that when this is the case the civil magistrate has an equal right to restrain you all as you have to restrain one another from whence it is plain that nothing but the liberty i have been speaking of can be the fundamental principle of the dissenters and the support of their interest  they mistake our principles who think we pretend to be in every tittle perfect or better than the church and shun us because they do not find our actions agreeable to this opinion whoever imagine this of themselves are exceedingly mistaken and intolerably vain nor are the whole body of dissenters to be reproached because there are such amongst them i know there are some who mistake themselves to be the only gospel churches and would join with no other upon any terms but their spiritual pride is as odious to the more generous of us as it is to the church of england certainly sir those in the establishment would think it very unjust in us to reflect all the superstition of archbishop laud or of dr sacheverel upon their communion yet it is as unfair in them to think us all as enthusiastical as the most rigid antinomians but tho they have an equal right with the rest to enjoy their opinions we differ as much from them as from the church  if the whole present generation of the laity were to know this i doubt not but they would continue with us since if they do not find all the instances of liberty they desire twould be no difficult matter to raise congregations where they might fix them and then they would likewise preserve the younger ministers too who are forced to go into the church since they cannot meet with encouragement in their sentiments at present  it has often been wondered at and therefore made an objection to the free principles i have advanced that those who have conformed from us to the church have generally been of these sentiments and yet have resigned them notwithstanding i must confess it is a very great unhappiness that they have been forced to do so and i believe it has always arose from their not being able to live by them therefore why do not we consider this and endeavor to prevent it it is a very great weakening of our interest that the best are obliged in justice to themselves to their families and to society which they ought not to encumber to quit us and seek provision elsewhere and that those are principally maintained whose births and hopes are low and consequently can practice the low arts of wheedling the people into a choice of them indeed i wonder the people themselves are not above this and why they will not be well instructed by those who have the courage to teach them even disagreeable truths rather than flattered into what may possibly be false and if it be true is but of the least importance in religion if flattering and indulging the people be the only way to succeed with us the bishops and secular powers may as well be flattered since they are much better able to pay for it and whoever cannot go into the church because he cannot submit to things contrary to justice generosity and freedom ought not to submit to them amongst us so that i cannot but admire and value the virtue of those younger gentlemen who notwithstanding all these difficulties remain with us since their want of success is only owing to their want of this mean and grovelling art i wish those gentlemen who have been strong and powerful advocates for liberty would rather have sought some civil than ecclesiastical preferments from the government since they have now given up the cause which does it a greater prejudice than never to have engaged in it i doubt not but as they are many of them persons of virtue and piety as well as of learning and good sense they have taken care some way or other to satisfy themselves in what they have done i wish i could guess at the principle and make an excuse more honorable for them and more creditable to us than necessity but as i think the subscription will not bear it unless they are in calvinistical sentiments i know not what to say farther i shall forbear to judge them however and think the best and most worthily of them that i am able  i know sir the blame of this has often been laid upon you and your brethren that you do not provide for them and settle them according to their merit but i think nothing can be more unjust and more contrary to your principles for as you pretend to no authority over the people you have not the disposal of their congregations nor any right to be their dictators indeed the people may consult you as friends and persons intimately acquainted with each others characters but they have the choice in themselves and are not to be overruled and twould be better they would generally consult the reputation of the interest more than their own particular fancy it is an ill principle not to receive instruction unless it be given in a particular manner and a great many of those things that please the people have very often a bad tendency in general it is good to please ten persons but not to drive as many away from us truth and good sense will generally be for edification but the being pleased which they generally insist so much upon seldom arises from any thing but some oddness that hits their peculiar humor and is not from any view to edification at all therefore too mean to be worthy any ones study the people do not usually know wherein oratory strength of speech the art of persuasion etc consist and therefore it is vanity in such to pretend to be judges of them i wish i could deny that amongst us they generally fall into the falsest and lowest taste imaginable in these things i think twould be an instance of their modesty to resign up their pleasures to the general notions and judgment for then there could be no general objections against them thus a man would mortify his inclinations to sensual pleasure for the good of society whoever consults the writings or prejudices against us will find nothing objected of any value but against the aukwardness and unpoliteness of our preachers what was dr souths wit levelled against but those things that were really foolish and ridiculous in themselves and so people of wit and politeness grew ashamed of them and chose a more graceful way of religion therefore i admire the art of our opponents rather to banter and ridicule than argue with us but when we take away this objection and polish ourselves let another dr south endeavor to ridicule us anew so that herein i think the people should rather consult our general credit than their own humors and if they would encourage our younger ministers who study good sense and politeness and endeavor to recommend the interest to the esteem of the rest of mankind i make no doubt but twould still revive and flourish more than ever but if they will continue selfishly to indulge themselves they have an indisputable right to ruin and destroy it  i make no doubt sir of your general disposition whenever the people think fit to consult you in their choice to promote the interest of those whom you think most likely to do us a credit upon the whole the credit of the interest can only arise from the learning and piety of those engaged in it the latter without the former is amiable in private life but no complete recommendation of a minister and the first alone though it may enliven his public performances is not sufficient for his whole relation they must both join to make him perfect and here i cannot but look about me with pleasure since we have still some remaining of this character whose public labors and private lives and conversation are both useful and entertaining the church of england may know this and grow jealous unless she hopes from the perverseness of our people to draw them over to her side and indeed if some proper methods are not taken to prevent it i will not promise for them for they were not born to starve and it is a sin to do it if there is a justifiable prevention  there are many who confidently assert that these gentlemens learning and politeness will be our ruin but what can be more absurd and perverse for nothing can recover those who have lest us for want of these but the study of them there are many gentlemen who can give no other reason for leaving us but that they are ashamed of our interest but that can be no longer a reason when we have the very qualities they seek in the church there is no other advantage in principle or practice she could possibly have over us but then she can have none i believe there are many of the laity who are not so much against this as it is imagined they have lately done some very considerable things to encourage learning and good sense else whence the crowded auditory to a certain lecture than which a greater or finer amongst us was never established and i believe whenever the preacher sinks in the goodness of his sermons he will sink in the esteem and encouragement of the hearers but as i believe he is incapable of it so i hope it will be an encouragement to follow his example of love to truth and original christianity which he has defended in the politest and finest manner of any writer this age has produced there are many others that would shine out if they had the same advantages from the world but as they may hope it will in time be just to them as it has been to him i hope they will support their courage and struggle till they at last recover the interest from its present low condition  since therefore it is possible a free and generous way of thinking and speaking may please among us suppose these gentlemen were no longer in fear of being under disagreeable censures and harsh imputations but had as unbounded a liberty of speaking their sentiments in public as of forming them in private i apprehend they would have no longer inclinations toward the church where after having well got through the difficulty of entrance they frequently take more liberty than either their general rules or our bye laws will allow supposing likewise the gross of the people instead of assuming the characters of judges and censors of sermons would put on the modest and humble disposition of learners which is not at all inconsistent with their judging for themselves and receive the truth without being jealous of heresy in their younger preachers they would no longer terrify and frighten them from us nor give them an opportunity of complaining that they do not act consistently with their principles for i know not whence it comes to pass but if they happen to think out of the common road and speak elegantly and politely it is immediately thought they are inclined to the church because they are like it and being consequently shunned and avoided are unavoidably forced into it but must we keep aloof from every thing like the church because some things in it are wrong fas est and ab host doceri we should follow what is really good and learn it though it were from our greatest enemies certainly if our younger people are generally inclining to the church the more we are like it the more they will value us and be likely to stay with us and it is wicked to dislike any thing merely because it resembles another if they go on in this unreasonable prejudice we shall in time lose both ministers and people it ought to be considered that as the taste of mankind differs so the method of applying to it must differ and therefore what was fashionable to our forefathers is now as disagreeable to us as their dress which no one is so foolishly singular as to continue but yet whoever will compare the pert oratory of a young oxonian and the solid as well as polite sermons of one of our younger divines will discern but very little resemblance so consequently there is as little danger  thus sir have i given you my sentiments of the subject we happened upon in conversation and i have pursued them in the method that appears to me most likely to serve the interest of truth and religion i have addressed them in a letter to you because i have long known your candor and goodness and i believe you cannot be conscious of having contributed to the decay since without flattery you would be a credit to any cause whatever since that time i have thought of some regulations which i believe would forward the desired effect to preserve and revive the interest but i submit them to your judgment and the judgment of your brethren they relate to the management of our public assemblies and to the persons educated for the ministry  i think there are two faults in your manner of public worship that your prayers are too short and your sermons too long the one has too little of reverence toward god and the other is too tedious to ourselves it appears to me that the principal design of public assemblies is to worship god in society which tends most of any thing to maintain a sense of religion in the world and one of the greatest parts of it should consist in adoration of him and celebrating his perfections this infinitely becomes us as we are dependent creatures and stand at an infinite distance from god our maker it is both a solemn and pleasant employment it tends to enoble our natures preserve us from vice and beget in us all those affections of love fear and joy that result from our relation to the most amiable powerful and indulgent being nothing creates a greater pleasure to me than rational worship as on the one hand i abominate all foppishness and buffoonery in religion so on the other i hate an affected gravity that has nothing in it manly and cheerful a mixture of reverence and cheerfulness is the true spirit of devotion there is too little of the one in some places and too little of the other among us to this of longer prayers it may be objected that they may be difficult to the suppliant and tedious for the people but by longer prayers i only mean longer in proportion to the sermon i think to worship god for twenty minutes and to dictate to men for sixty is not so equal as one could wish if it be difficult for the minister it is but for him to compose his prayers before when his mind may be in a better temper and disposition and he may have leisure to review whether what he says be proper and worthy of the divine being or not i know not why the people should object to this any more than to the use of notes in your sermons for at first the one was as much a novelty as the other may be now or why you should study more accuracy in the last than in the first it would prevent a great deal of tautology incorrectness and improprieties and too often things absolutely unfit to be uttered which i think are very indecent toward our maker as to this methods being tedious to the hearers i would not have them so long as that comes to and if there be any danger of it i cannot but recommend the practice of the church of diversifying the worship but this should be at the discretion of the minister the singing of psalms when you happen to have a good clerk would relieve the mind and the whole of this would prevent the objections against extempore prayers which have often been too unluckily made  as to your sermons excuse me sir i think they too might be regulated they might be shorter and more intelligible i know there are many of our ministers who pride themselves in being plain and to the capacity of the people but i have been often present where through the preachers distinctions hard words jewish or scholastical expressions i have been absolutely at a loss for his meaning if he meant any thing and came away as ignorant as i went there and how often have we been insulted by the churchparty for what they style the cant of preaching i think too if they were delivred in a more easy and natural manner they would hear better and be more instructive i hope no one will think i intend to affront him by a particular application i only say it in the general with a regard to our own credit and the public good  from this it will appear how necessary it is to take great care of persons to be educated for the ministry that they should be creditable and promising chosen either out of the families of gentlemen or else upon the account of a very extraordinary genius the first because such are commonly best acquainted with the world and know how to behave themselves and the last may possibly be advanced by their own merit and abilities without those advantages and as to the fund if it was only applied to the education of those whose parents are decayed or have spent their fortunes in the interest it would be much better than to encourage the vanity of low and mechanical persons who imagine a gravity and seriousness in their children and then throw them to be a dishonor and burden upon us is it lawful to spoil a mechanic who might earn his bread and maintain his family and take him to misguide the people for they are too often ignorant and vain bring a family into the world to live meanly and at last be left in distress your consciences as well as policy should forbid this and here by the way i think it would be well instead of encouraging such by the fund to apply it in larger quantities to men of real merit and furnish them not barely with bread for their bodies but books to enterain and improve their minds if a few very small villages had no meeting twould be of less importance than to have large country towns surrounded with torygentlemen ill furnished and disgraced poverty and want are none of the least objections to us in the eye of the world  but to return to students if after they were thus selected they were perfectly taught latin and greek and not suffered to go to the academy till thoroughly acquainted with them if the time usually wasted in old systems of logic and metaphysics was spent in studying and understanding the classicks the belle letres oratory and particularly the art of speaking naturally justly and genteelly it would quite destroy all those unnatural tones and gestures which are the grand causes of our reproach and contempt it may seem odd and whimsical to propose a dancing master for one tutor at an academy but if something equivalent to it was contrived to give them a gracefulness and gentility of address and prune off all clumsiness and aukwardness that is disagreeable to people of fashion and which gives learning the air of pedantry it would do them a most eminent service for nothing carries any man so easily and happily through life as a good address this may look improper to the general smallness of your salaries but twould be none if gentlemen were not ashamed to breed up their children to the ministry and those who have no great fortune of their own had the art of appearing handsome with a little which is natural to some and might easily be acquired by others the same effect would be answered if the congregations were fewer and of consequence the salaries larger i am not for mixing bigoted and generous people in a congregation for that lays the minister under too great restraints to please both parties but in country places prudent management in elections would prevent the fatal and destructive breaches that end in the ruin of both sides  thus sir have i taken a liberty which i hope you will excuse and which i would not have assumed the vanity of for any other cause but that of liberty the true foundation of the dissenting interest liberty which i verily believe to be the cause of god and the happiness of mankind  i am reverend sir your most obedient servant  finis
