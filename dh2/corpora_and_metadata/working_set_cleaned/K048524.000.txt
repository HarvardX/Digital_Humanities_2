the learned dr garth f r s by w cockburn m d by my solution of the problem for determining the due doses of purging and vomiting medicines phil transact no  0  in all their cases it is manifest in general postul that these medicines operate either upon the account of their being mixed with the blood schol or by their stimulating the stomach and guts   that this their operation is more or less according to the quantity and thickness of blood he cor   a greater quantity and the thickest blood require the greatest doses and   prop   that when the quantities of blood are the same the doses of purging and vomiting medicines are in a duplicate proportion of the bloods thickness as also that in every case these doses must be in a proportion compounded of the quantity of blood and those squares of its thickness prop     now since the operations of purgative and vomitive medicines depend so much on the quantity and viscidity of the blood why the doses of these medicines so hard to be found which have not been duly considered before it is no wonder that the practice of physic in these evacuations has been so uncertain and that the most expert physicians from their most accurate observations could never determine the true doses of medicines which alter so much according to the various subjects they work upon they not being acquainted with the true method of determining either the quantity of the blood or the degrees of its thickness  because experience is equally the foundation and touchstone of all reasoning in physic we will here submit our solution to common observations and try whether every thing proposed in it does not exactly answer matters of fact and the visible operations of nature  first then the different effects of these medicines upon the account of their  it plainly follows that these medicines always purge best and most constantly in a liquid form because they are more easily conveyed into the blood and can stimulate more parts and that upon the account of this their fluidity whatever may be the way that purges and vomits work or whatsoever their nature may be this explains very easily a very common observation hitherto very difficult to physicians about the different operation of the same medicine in different forms why viz the infusion of a due quantity of a purging medicine produces its effects sooner and more constantly than a like quantity of the same medicine in a powder though still more constantly in a powder than a bolus though still sooner and more constantly in a dry bolus than if it be given in pills made into that form with gums that do not purge and this difference in purging shall even be notable according to the dissolubility of the gums  from whence it follows that the evacuation made by such medicines is in proportion to the quantity of those medicines that happens to be dissolved and not to the quantity administered  secondly their effects different because of the different thickness of blood that purging by draughts is the most excellent form and will always have the most constant effect  the next consideration is that a certain quantity of any purging medicine affects us after a different manner according to the different quantity and constitution of the blood or its thickness and it was shown in the solution that if its thickness were the same the dose should always be as its quantity but the blood differing likewise in thickness the doses of purging and vomiting medicines must be augmented on account of its thickness this is perfectly well confirmed by daily experience where we find that people sick with a manifest thickness of blood as in dropsies the jaundice etc take far greater doses than they did at any other time when they were not sick or in that manner  by a further disquisition into this matter we find that the doses must not only be greater where the thickness of blood is greater but that they must be increased in a duplicate proportion of their viscidity this is evident by the tables in cassia viz            gr and therefore alternando           gr therefore the doses are as the squares of the constitutions so likewise           gr and alternando           gr h e the doses are as the squares of the constitutions  the same is true in any other constitution besides the mean for example in the lowest and highest         gr     so that by this means we are not only led directly to a right use of these medicines and are able to find the true cause why the ordinary doses produce so very different effects in different constitutions but likewise a problem the quantity of blood in any person being given together with the ordinary and extraordinary effect of a dose of a purging medicine the change of that persons constitution and the nature of that change may be determined  it cannot but be a great satisfaction to the mind to find a doctrine founded on a few simple experiences leading us into the cause of many more that are very complext this doctrine true because conform to nature difficult and obscure which is sufficient to prove its conformity to nature but my present endeavor being to rectify the common practice of these medicines by this doctrine i shall frame by this method tables of the purging and vomiting medicines in present use better adapted to experience than are hitherto to be found  the method of framing such tables how they are made is by setting off the practicable constitutions in the different ages that i have observed to take notable quantities of purging and vomiting medicines so that by comparing these constitutions with the ages we have the different doses in all those cases which is all that is required for a better practice though a more proper occasion may produce a more nice and exact division of constitutions very much to the advantage of the practice of physic in all diseases  the ages wherein these different doses are taken i find to be four when a man is about    or  0 years of age and weighs about    stone he then takes the common dose one of nine years takes three quarters of that one of six the half and one of three years a quarter moreover  p    biblioth anatom p      t   it having already been shown that the notable healthy constitutions are but three as also the notable pulses of each of these let then these constitutions be as       that of the most fluid blood as the first number and so on in that case the dose of any person will be found by multiplying the common dose for his age into the square of his constitution and dividing by the square of the middle constitution for instance if j cassioe is the common dose or the dose of the middle constitution iij j and gr    is the dose of the first constitution and xiv gr    that of the grossest or last constitution and so proportionably for every medicine in all the ages as appears by the tables  this method seems to answer so exactly only exception that there is not any thing necessary besides except a person is more loose or costive than ordinary which may be known from the patient or otherways it is to be reputed the same as if he had taken an equivalent quantity of a medicine proper to produce these effects any physician who has considered this case in some people after fluxing will allow the justness of this exception  as vomiting medicines have the same common doses with those that purge the doses of vomiting medicines they admit also of the like divided doses which therefore may be found by the same tables only as people that are more costive than ordinary require a proportionable greater dose of a purging medicine so they require their dose of a vomiting medicine to be considerably less as is very very well known in hot countries  but it must be observed that in the tables note  age stands instead of quantity of blood because they increase pretty equally and it makes the practice more easy to such as are not accustomed to weights and numbers  the more skilful are desired to observe that the mean ages  multiplied into the mean constitutions give doses more nicely  the tables some instances showing the defects of the present practice and how mended by the foregoing tables the doses of the foregoing tables arising from calculation agree perfectly well with the common observation of the best authors though their observation is very general and ill made if we except the very first steps for instance authors of all countries english dutch authors copy but do not observe german italian and french reckon the doses after the same manner whereas if they had been observed they must have been different as are the constitutions of men in the different countries  ii the defect of their observation is manifest by the disproportioned doses of some medicines their high doses being sometimes double and sometimes triple and more of their low doses which is not conform to nature for let the low dose be what it will the high dose of one medicine must always bear the same proportion to the high dose of another as did their low doses viz even in manna they reckon it from j commonly to iij and iv if it is said that the first dose is the lowest dose that is taken by a man of a due age it is neither true in fact nor conform to their own way of reckoning for instance rhubarb is said to be taken from j to ij no body will say that this is the lowest dose taken by a man of a due age as formerly because it is not in fact true nor that the high natural dose is ss for as i said before if j of manna and j of rhubarb are the respective low doses then iv and ij cannot be the respective high doses as to what concerns some extraordinary doses given by themselves and far exceeding the ordinary dose is easily accounted for by the solution there are many examples of this nature turbith viz is commonly reckoned among them from j to ij yet marggravius and good authors have given it to iv so colocynthis from gr vi to gr xij and fulgin fernel duncan say they have given it to ss  iii they have only given the doses for men at full age authors have been far from being exact for they have only dosd these medicines for people of full age but have left the doses of the different ages in silence nor have they told us at what time a man takes his highest dose or how that alters in the growth and decline of age which is still a very great difficulty for the most experienced physicians to manage  iv their way of determining doses false their general method is founded in a mistake their lowest dose being really the common dose taken by the generality of men which produces a multitude of errors in the practice this is manifest in their dosing every medicine  v this shown particularly the mentioned case is more manifest by these tables and it is two to one but that a physician over purges or under purges any person in health and if more cases in sickness are supposed the odds will increase proportionably experience confirms this exactly for if the middle dose is given to one of the lowest constitution and the middle dose is to purge   or   times in that case the person of the lowest constitution is purged near twice as much as he ought to be and if given to one of the highest constitution he is purged but half of what he should be but if the dose of the highest constitution is given to one of the middle constitution he is purged twice as much as he ought to be and if given to one of the lowest he is purged four times as much or about thirty times as we find true by daily experience but if the quantity of blood the age or sickness contribute to the error it may prove fatal if this consideration were illustrated by a proper number of examples we should find some hundreds of otherways unavoidable mistakes now prevented by the practice of these tables  lastly we may easily account by these tables these tables show how the doses of children may over purge people of full age for the doses of children over purging some people of good health and of due age a phaenomenen so surprising that the smallness of the dose is commonly thought a good excuse for the mistake  finis
