writings upwards of twentyfive hundred letters apart from his journals and memoranda i have increased the number of letters to more than three thousand and draw more freely on the diaries farm journals and plans of compaigns and of army organization the difficulty lay principally in making a proper selection from the wealth of material found one that would preserve a proper balance between the public and the private acts of the man so displaying his character more fully than has been done if i have partially succeeded in this attempt i am content the result can be entirely satisfactory least of all to myself who in daily study for more than four years have been brought to realize the mans true greatness and his relation to the history of his times i frankly confess to a certain feeling of disappointment as his reserve has left so many of the important events of his career unexplained but i am in part consoled by a knowledge that in this new collection of his writings a patient study will obtain much that is of value again i thank the many kind friends who have given me freely of their stores mr crosby of boston sent copies of all the important collection of letters from washington to general lincoln and placed them at my disposal mr f b mcguire of washington supplied me with the washingtonmadison vi correspondence since unfortunately scattered dr john s h fogg of boston dr thomas addis emmett of new york and the late mr cassius f lee jr of alexandria have never refused access to their stores while mr william f havemeyer of new york has done a patriotic duty in bringing together a splendid collection of washingtoniana to which i was able to refer whenever i desired mrs burton harrison gave me copies of the washingtonfairfax letters and heavy drafts have been made upon the historical societies i am happy to record the publicspirited conduct of these societies—with but two exceptions the long island historical society of brooklyn and the new york historical society proved themselves to be historical societies only in name one debt i can never sufficiently acknowledge there was one who first offered his counsel and aid and whose kindly encouragement intelligent criticism and hearty sympathy in the undertaking made smooth many rough places and without whose cooperation the work could not have been brought to a successful issue under my editorship to my father gordon lester ford who did not live to see the last volumes i owe the debt of gratitude and in affectionate remembrance of which i record his name in this connection my brother paul leicester ford has been as untiring in his assistance as he has proved learned in american history worthington chauncey ford washington d c    august      vii   the writings of george washington      george washington    may      federal city james anderson to james anderson federal city    may      your letter of the   th inst has been received but not with the surprise it would otherwise have occasioned had i not been prepared in some measure for the notice it gave by the intimation contained in a former letter not now by me and the date forgotten of your intention to withdraw from my employment at the end of the year i shall repeat now what i said upon that occasion—viz—that i had no intention then nor have i any desire now to part with you as a manager but having made this declaration i shall add what i believe i then did that i have no wish to retain any person in my service who is discontented with my conduct or who has any prospect more congenial with their inclinations or their interest in the service of another—and this i must presume to be the case with you for it can hardly be supposed that the reasons you have assigned for leaving mine are all that have urged you to the measure strange and singular indeed would it be if the proprietor of an estate than whom no one can be so good a judge of the resources   as himself should have nothing to say in or controul over his own expenditures should not be at liberty to square his œconomy thereto nor should without hurting the feelings of a manager point to such alterations admitting they were not the best but such as he might incline to adopt or at least propose especially too when it has been requested by that manager over and over again to do so it is a matter of regret and if these things should operate equally on others it might be a means of preventing my ever having another manager—for i have no hesitation in declaring that i shall never relinquish the right of judging in my own concerns though i may be pleased always to hear opinions to any man living while i have health and strength to look into my own business—especially as my sole inducement to give standing wages was to prevent those complaints which might arise from a difference of opinion and interference if a share of the crops was to constitute the reward for service having said this much upon general principles i am a little curious i must confess to know in what instances your plans have been thwarted—that they have been altered by yourself cannot be denied i am equally desirous of knowing what improvements have been obstructed or defeated by my withholding the means of carrying them into effect it will not be denied that you have planned your own crops except perhaps those at dogue run and that you have directed the carpenters ditchers millers and coopers in their work if i have interfered in either   it has been no further that i can recollect than by expressing an opinion that shifting them from one work to another before anything was completed is a waste of time and a backwarding of labor have you ever been denied money when it was asked for and have i not on a variety of occasions given it as my decided opinion that to improve my farms by lessening the quantity of tillage by dressing the smaller quantity more highly by hedging and keeping them clean by ditching and meadowing would be more agreeable to me than immediate profit and that for want of a regular rotation system adapted to the nature of the soil and to circumstances my land hitherto has been sorely pressed and must ultimately be ruined if it is not adopted if all these things have happened where have i been deficient or in what have you just cause to complain if i cannot remark upon my own business passing every day under my own eyes without hurting your feelings i must discontinue my rides or become a cypher on my own estate and you will i am persuaded do me the justice to say that i have never undertaken any new thing or made any material change or indeed any change at all in the old without consulting with you thereupon and you must further acknowledge that i have never been tenacious of any matters i have suggested when you have offered reasons against the adoption of them if your feelings have been hurt by my remarks on the bad clover seed that was purchased i cannot help that my views and plan have been much more hurt   by it for it is a fact known to yourself that field no   at d r would not have been sown with oats but for the sake of the clover with a view to carrying on my rotation system at that farm and that i required only three or four days to have ascertained by actual experiment whether it was good or not in a case where facts could be resorted to there was no occasion to exercise judgment but as it is not my wish to hurt the feelings of any one where it can be avoided—or to do injustice in any respect whatsoever the foregoing is to be considered in no other light than as a reply to your letter and as a development of the principles on which i have acted and shall continue to act i shall proceed then to suggest now what i intended to mention to you some little time hence and which was the ground on which i proposed the plan of building a house at the mill two things have appeared very clear to me for some time past one that your attention is too much divided and called to so many different objects that notwithstanding your zeal and industry with which i always have been and still am perfectly satisfied some of them must suffer—the other that my mill and distillery under the uncertainty of cropping of late years would with good management and close attention to them be found my best and most certain support under this conviction under a belief that to carry on the millering and distillery business to the extent of which they are susceptible would of themselves   be sufficient to occupy the time and attention of any one person and under a persuation that if you were relieved wholly or in part from all the other duties and perplexities of your present employments still retaining the salary and emoluments you now have that you would render these two branches more productive than the whole now is to me these considerations then had determined me to propose to you to confine your attention to these objects and to the fishery if not altogether at least in a great degree to enable you to do which with the greatest convenience was one of my motives for proposing to build a convenient house at the mill in this case you would be relieved from the responsibility of other matters and in a great measure from the trouble which is now attached to them altho i should still expect and stipulate to receive all the aid that could be derived from your knowledge and advice in the management of my farms especially at the three nearest to the mill and that you would ride round them with me whenever required so to do and do business for me in alexandria when called upon for that purpose i am induced in some degree to make this proposition from another consideration namely a belief that one of the overseers which i now have altho he may obey orders will never carry on business to advantage if controuled by any one except the owner of the farm if by him if you are inclined to accede to this proposition i will give the three concerns above mentioned up entirely to your management the ensuing year under regulations   to be agreed upon and will furnish you with means to carry on the business to its utmost extent and shall as mentioned before only require your advice and assistance occasionally in conducting the other parts of my concerns by a plan of this sort you will be relieved from the most troublesome part of your present occupations—from all the responsibility annexed to them and from those remarks which seem to be the source of your present uneasiness and complaints so soon as you shall have given this proposition due consideration i shall expect to be informed of the result as decision and timely measures must be taken on my part to arrange matters for the new order if you are determined to quit the employ i wish you well and am your friend c george washington    may      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton mount vernon    may      my dear sir yesterday brought me your letter of the   th instant you may be assured that my mind is deeply impressed with the present situation of our public affairs and not a little agitated by the outrageous conduct of france towards the united states and at the inimitable conduct of its partisans who aid and abet their measures you may believe further from assurances equally sincere that if there was anything in my power which could be done with consistency   to avert or lessen the danger of the crisis it should be rendered with hand and heart the expedient however which has been suggested by you would not in my opinion answer the end which is proposed—the object of such a tour could not be vailed by the extensive cover to be given to it because it would not apply to the state of my health which never was better and as the measure would be susceptible of two interpretations the enemies to it always more active and industrious than friends woud endeavor as much as in them lay to turn it to their own advantage by malicious insinuations unless they should discover that the current against themselves was setting too strong and of too serious a nature for them to stem in which case the journey would be unnecessary and in either case the reception might not be such as you have supposed but my dear sir dark as matters appear at present and expedient as it is to be prepared at all points for the worst that can happen and no one is more disposed to this measure than i am i cannot make up my mind yet for the expectation of open war or in other words for a formidable invasion by france i cannot believe although i think them capable of any thing bad that they will attempt to do more than they have done or that when they perceive the spirit and policy of this country rising into resistance and that they have falsely calculated upon support from a large part of the people thereof to promote their views and influence in it that they will desist even from those practices unless unexpected events   in europe and their possession of louisiana and the floridas should induce them to continue the measure and i believe further that although the leaders of their party in this country will not change their sentiments that they will be obliged nevertheless to change their plan or the mode of carrying it on from the effervescence which is appearing in all quarters and from the desertion of their followers which must frown them into silence at least for a while if i did not view things in this light my mind would be infinitely more disquieted than it is for if a crisis should arrive when a sense of duty or a call from my country should become so imperious as to leave me no choice i should prepare for the relinquishment and go with as much reluctance from my present peaceful abode as i should do to the tomb of my ancestors to say at this time determinately what i should do under such circumstances might be improper having once before departed from a similar resolution but i may declare to you that as there is no conviction in my breast that i could serve my country with more efficiency in the command of the armies it might levy than many others an expression of its wish that i should do so must somehow or another be unequivocally known to satisfy my mind that notwithstanding the respect in which i may be held on account of former services that a preference might not be given to a man more in his prime and it might well be supposed too that i should like previously to know who would be my coadjutors and   whether you would be disposed to take an active part if arms are to be resorted to  before this letter can get to your hands you will have seen the resolutions and proposed address from citizens of charleston in south carolina their proceedings will i am persuaded give the tone to other parts of that state two or three very good addresses have already appeared from north carolina one with the signature of a late governor thereof spaight all the most popular and hardy yeomanry of this state have come and are coming forward with strong addresses to the executive and assurances of support the address from norfolk i do not mean the impertinent one from magniens grenadier company is a good one the middle counties of this state with two or three exceptions have hitherto been silent they want leaders but i shall be much mistaken if a large majority of them do not forsake if they have heretofore been with those who have pretended to speak their sentiments as to the resolutions which were entered into at fredericksburg it is only necessary to point to the manager of them and add that the meeting was partial   0 from georgia no development of the public sentiment has yet appeared but i learn from an intelligent gentleman just returned from where he has been some time for the benefit of his health travelling going and returning slowly and making considerable halts that the people of that state as also those of south and north carolina seem to be actuated by one spirit and that a very friendly one to the general government i have likewise heard that the present governor of the first georgia professes to be strongly attached to it these disclosures with what may yet be expected will i conceive give a different impression of the sentiments of our people to the directory of france than what they have been taught to believe while it must serve to abash the partisans of it for their wicked and presumptive information your free communications on these political topics is so far from needing an apology that i shall be much gratified and thankful to you for the continuation of them and i would wish you to believe that with great truth and sincerity i am always your affectionate friend c    george washington    june      mount vernon jeremy belknap to jeremy belknap mount vernon    june      reverend sir your favor of the   th ultimo accompanying the discourse delivered on the day recommended by the president of the united states to be observed for a fast was received in the usual course of the mail from boston and the copies therewith sent were forwarded agreeably to your desire my best wishes attend the prosecution of your american biography and not recollecting whether the request was made before i desire i may be considered as a subscriber to the first volume to the proposal which came under cover to me i have fixed my name and will lodge the paper in the hands of a gentleman in alexandria for the convenience of those who may incline to become subscribers thereto and thereafter to return it to you my information relative to the family of calvert is more limited than the one detailed by you i know little more of it than what is recited in the history of virginia but i will send a transcript of so much of your letter as relates to this subject to a wellinformed gentleman of my acquaintance in maryland judge chase and give you the result  i know of no other histories of virginia than those mentioned in your letter but i recollect well to have heard the late richard bland of prince george county say before the revolution that he was either    possessed of or was collecting materials and hoped to furnish a more correct history of it than any that was then extant he was very competent to the undertaking being a man of erudition and intelligence long a member of the councils of this state and afterwards a member of the first congresses that were held in philadelphia i cannot add however that he was the author of the manuscript transmitted to you by carter b harrison colonel bland the person of whom i am speaking has been dead more than twenty years  bishop madison with whom you seem to be in the habit of corresponding is as likely to give information on the point sought after by you as any one person i am acquainted with to the descendant of a gentleman the honorable richard corbin many years deceased who it is said possessed some valuable notes relative to ancient transactions and the actors of those times in this state i will write and if any thing worthy of notice is obtained you shall be furnished therewith if i can render you any service in procuring materials for your valuable biography i shall feel pleasure in doing it i hope both life and health will be dispensed to you by him in whose hands all things are until this and many others of your good works are completed for the discourse which you were so obliging as to send me and for the favorable sentiments with which it was accompanied i pray you to accept the best thanks of sir c    george washington    june      mount vernon john adams to john adams president of the united states mount vernon    june      dear sir i have heard with much pleasure that you contemplate a visit to the city designated for the permanent seat of government of the united states in the course of the summer or early in autumn it is unnecessary i hope for me in that event to express the satisfaction it would give mrs washington and me to see mrs adams yourself and company in the shade of our vine and figtree but i shall request that while you remain in these parts you will make mount vernon your headquarters it is but about seventeen miles by land and less by water from the federal city and only half that distance from alexandria which is on the direct route between them i pray you to believe that no one has read the various approbatory addresses which have been presented to you with more heartfelt satisfaction than i have done nor are there any who more sincerely wish that your administration of the government may be easy happy and honorable to yourself and prosperous for the country present if you please the best respects of mrs washington miss custis and myself to mrs adams and miss smith accept them yourself and be assured of the high esteem and regard with which i have the honor to be dear sir c    george washington    june      mount vernon james lloyd to james lloyd mount vernon    june      dear sir your favor of the   th ulto has been duly received and i feel much obliged by your polite attentions to me i rejoice to hear of general marshalls arrival and wish sincerely he had been accompanied by his colleagues for i believe no country will afford them better protection than their own the stay of one of them has a mysterious appearance after having jointly declared that no one of them is authorized to take upon himself a negotiation evidently entrusted by the letter of the powers and instructions to the whole and that too after the invidious distinction was made by the minister of foreign relations which ought in my opinion to have filled him with resentment instead of complaisance i wonder the french government has not more pride than to expose to the world such flimsy performances as the ministers of it exhibit by way of complaint and argument but it is still more to be wondered at that these charges which have been refuted over and over again should find men     george washington mount vernon    june      james lloyd to james lloyd mount vernon    june      sir accept my thanks for your favor of the   st inst and its inclosure when the whole correspondence between our envoys and the french minister of    foreign relations and his agents is brought into one view and laid before the public it will be extremely interesting and must i conceive carry conviction to every mind that is open to it of what the french now are and have been aiming at from the beginning of their revolution—or from an early period of it at least and will at the same time show them in what manner they have been imposed upon by those whose objects were not to be promoted by truth or a clear understanding of matters genl marshall is so capable of making accurate observations that i am persuade his information may be relied on with certainty with great esteem c george washington   july      mount vernon john adams to john adams president of the united states mount vernon   july      dear sir not being in the habit since my return to private life of sending regularly to the postoffice nine miles from hence every postday it often happens that letters addressed to me lye longer there on that account than they otherwise would do i have delayed no time unnecessarily since i had the honor of receiving your very obliging favor of the   d ultimo to thank you for the polite and flattering sentiments you have been pleased to express relatively to me and to assure you that as far as it is in my power to support your administration    and to render it easy happy and honorable you may command me without reserve  at the epoch of my retirement an invasion of these states by any european power or even the probability of such an event happening in my days was so far from being contemplated by me that i had no conception that that or any other occurrence would arise in so short a period which could turn my eyes from the shades of mount vernon but this seems to be the age of wonders and reserved for intoxicated and lawless france for purposes of providence far beyond the reach of human ken to slaughter its own citizens and to disturb the repose of all the world besides from a view of the past from the prospect present—and of that which seems to be expected it is not easy for me to decide satisfactorily on the part it might best become me to act in case of actual invasion by a formidable force i certainly should not intrench myself under the cover of age and retirement if my services should be required by my country    to assist in repelling it and if there be good cause which must be better known to the government than to private citizens to expect such an event delay in preparing for it might be dangerous improper and not to be justified by prudence the uncertainty however of the latter in my mind creates my embarrassment for i cannot fairly bring it to believe disregardful as the french are of treaties and of the laws of nations and capable as i conceive them to be of any species of despotism and injustice that they will attempt to invade this country after such a uniform and unequivocal expression of the sense of the people in all parts to oppose them with their lives and fortunes that they have been led to believe by their agents and partisans amongst us that we are a divided people that the latter are opposed to their own government and that a show of a small force would occasion a revolt i have no doubt and how far these men grown desperate will further attempt to deceive and may succeed in keeping up the deception is problematical without this the folly of the directory in such an attempt would i conceive be more conspicuous if possible than their wickedness having with candor made this disclosure of the state of my mind it remains only that i should add that to those who know me best it is best known that if imperious circumstances should induce me to renounce the smooth paths of retirement for the thorny ways of public life at a period too when repose is most congenial to nature and a calm indispensable    to contemplation that it would be productive of sensations which can be more easily conceived than expressed the difficulty in which you expect to be involved in the choice of general officers when you come to form the army is certainly a serious one and in a government like ours where there are so many considerations to be attended to and to combine it will be found not a little perplexing but as the mode of carrying on the war against the foe that threatens must differ widely from that practised in the contest for independence it will not be an easy matter i conceive to find among the old set of generals men of sufficient activity energy and health and of sound politics to train troops to the quick step long marches and severe conflicts they may have to encounter and therefore that recourse must be had for the greater part at least to the wellknown most experienced best proved and intelligent officers of the late army without respect to grade i speak with diffidence however on this head having no list by me from which my memory could be refreshed there is one thing though on which i can give a decided opinion and as it is of the utmost importance to the public to the army and to the officer commanding it be him whom he will i will take the liberty of suggesting it now it is that the greatest circumspection be used in appointing the general staff if this corps is not composed of respectable characters knowledge of the duties of    their respective departments able active and firm and of incorruptible integrity and prudence and withal such as the commanderinchief can place entire confidence in his plans and movements if not defeated altogether may be so embarrassed and retarded as to amount nearly to the same thing and this almost with impunity on their part    the opening given me in your letter is such as hath prompted me to express these sentiments with freedom and persuading myself that you will ascribe them to pure motives although they may differ from your own ideas i have no doubt of their being well received with the greatest respect and consideration i have the honor to be dear sir c  george washington   july      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon   july      dear sir the sentiments which i mean to express to you in this letter on the subject of yours shall be frank undisguised and explicit for i see as you do that  0 clouds are gathering and that a storm may ensue and i find too from a variety of hints that my quiet under these circumstances does not promise to be of long continuance it cannot be necessary for me to promise to you or to others who know my sentiments as well that to quit the tranquil walks of retirement and enter the boundless field of responsibility and trouble would be productive of sensations which a better pen than i possess would find it difficult to describe nevertheless the principle by which my conduct has been actuated through life would not suffer me in any great emergency to withhold any services i could render required by my country especially in a case where its dearest rights are assailed by lawless ambition and intoxicated power contrary to every principle of justice and in violation of solemn compact and laws which govern all civilized nations and this too with the obvious intent to sow thick the seeds of disunion for the purpose of subjugating the government and destroying our independence and happiness under circumstances like these accompanied by an actual invasion of our territorial rights it would be difficult at any time for me to remain an idle spectator under the plea of age or retirement with sorrow it is true i should quit the shades of my peaceful abode and the ease and happiness i now enjoy to encounter anew the turmoils of war to which possibly my strength and powers might be found incompetent these however should not be stumblingblocks    in my own way but there are other things highly important for me to ascertain and settle before i could give a decided answer to your question first the propriety in the opinion of the public so far as that opinion has been expressed in conversation of my appearing again on a public theatre after declaring the sentiments i did in my valedictory address of september      second a conviction in my own breast from the best information that can be obtained that it is the wish of my country that the military force of it should be committed to my charge and third that the army now to be formed should be so appointed as to afford a wellgrounded hope of its doing honor to the country and credit to him who commands it in the field on each of these heads you must allow me to make observations with respect to the first it will readily be admitted under the circumstances i at present am that nothing short of an imperious call would or ought to draw me from retirement and unless this was apparent the advantages if any are expected from the measure would not only be weakened but might be defeated altogether for the opposers of government with a view to lessen its influence would denounce it at once a restless act evincive of my discontent in retirement and that my love for it was all a sham knowing the purity of my own intentions such observations would make no impression on my personal feelings but the necessity thereof in    the eyes of the public ought to be unequivocal for it would be uncandid in me not to confess that although i highly approve of all the defensive and precautionary measures that have been adopted and wish they had been more energetic yet that i cannot believe since the people of this country on whose defection the calculation was made have come forward with such strong and unequivocal assurances to defend at all hazards their government and independence maugre the attempts to divert them from it that the directory of france intoxicated and abandoned as it is will have the folly to invade our territorial rights otherwise than by predatory attempts on the seaboard unless their agents and partisans among us in defiance of the evidence of their senses should still have the wickedness and address to make that government believe that nothing but a force to give countenance to its friends is wanting to effectuate all they wish this sir is my opinion with respect to a formidable invasion perhaps with the information and lights in possession of the executive i might think differently on the second head i shall be more concise because as my whole life has been dedicated to the service of my country in one shape or another for the poor remains of it it is not an object to contend for ease and quiet when all that is valuable in it is at stake further than to be satisfied that the sacrifice i should make of these is acceptable and desired by my country as neither ambition interest nor personal gratification of any sort could induce me to    quit the walks of private life to be disappointed in the only object i should have in view would be mortifying beyond my powers of utterance and what this public opinion and wish is on this occasion i know not for i have studiously avoided touching on the subject lest some inference contrary to my meaning should be drawn from it i express these ideas not from affectation for i despise everything that carries the appearance of it but from the belief that as it is the fashion of the present day set or adopted by the french with whom we are to contend and with great and astonishing success too to appoint generals of juvenile years to lead their armies it might not be improbable that similar ideas and wishes might pervade the minds of our citizens and when to this a fear might be added that age may have wrought too powerfully on my body and mind to make it advisable to commit so important a trust to my direction on the third head you must permit me to dwell a little more at large if an army was in existence and an officer were invited to take command of it his course would be plain for he would have nothing more to do than to examine the constitution of it and to inquire into the composition to enable him to decide but we have one to form and much indeed depends upon the formation if a judicious choice is not made of the principal officers and above all of the general staff in the first instance it never can be rectified thereafter the character then of the army would be lost in the superstructure the    reputation of the commanderinchief would sink with it and the country be involved in inextricable expense it is impossible i know for the executive to be intimately acquainted with the qualifications of the battalion officers and perhaps from the manner in which the volunteer corps may offer themselves little will be left to his choice the presumption however is that as these corps will be composed of respectable citizens the officers will be good and worthy of as much confidence as can be placed in untried men the great desiderata lyes in the appointment of the general officers of the line and of the staff particularly the latter and the first consists in a great measure in determining whether they shall be taken from the old set of generals or formed anew from the most experienced intelligent and best proved officers of the late american army without regard to grade from the want of the list which i left in the presidential office by which my memory could be refreshed as to names it would be hazardous and might be improper to give a decided opinion on this head but i have no great scruple in saying that i incline strongly to the latter mode for if this country is seriously invaded our system of warfare must be the very reverse of the last to remark to a military man how allimportant the general staff of an army is to its wellbeing and how essential consequently to the commanderinchief seems to be unnecessary and yet a good choice is of    such immense consequence that i must be allowed to explain myself the inspectorgeneral quartermastergeneral adjutantgeneral and officer commanding the corps of artillerists and engineers ought to be men of the most respectable character and of firstrate abilities because from the nature of their respective offices and from their being always about the commanderinchief who is obliged to entrust many things to them confidentially scarcely any movement can take place without their knowledge it follows then that besides possessing the qualifications just mentioned they ought to have those of integrity and prudence in an eminent degree that entire confidence might be reposed in them without these and their being on good terms with the commanding general his measures if not designedly thwarted may be so embarrassed as to make them move heavily on if the inspectorgeneral is not an officer of great respectability of character firm and strict in discharging the duties of the trust reposed in him or if he is too pliant in his disposition he will most assuredly be imposed upon and the efficient strength and condition of the army will not be known to the commanderinchief of course he may form his plans upon erroneous calculations and commit fatal mistakes if the quartermastergeneral is not a man of great resource and activity and worthy of the highest confidence he would be unfit for the military station he is to occupy for as it is not possible at all times to    mask real designs and movements under false appearances the better and safer way is to place full confidence in him under the seal of responsibility then knowing the plan he participates in the concealment on which and the celerity of a movement success oftentimes entirely depends in addition to these requisites in a quartermastergeneral œconomy in providing for the wants of an army proper arrangements in the distribution of the supplies and a careful eye to the use of them is of great importance and call for a circumspect choice the adjutantgen ought also to be a man of established character of great activity and experience in the details of an army and of proved integrity or no alertness can be expected in the execution of the several duties consigned to him on the one hand and every thing to be feared from treachery or neglect in his office on the other by which the enemy might be as well informed of our strength as their own though last mentioned it is not least important that so essential and scientific a part of the army as the corps of artillerists and engineers should have an able and respectable officer at their head without which it would soon sink into ignorance and disrepute humanity and feeling for the sick and wounded of an army call loudly for skill attention and œconomy in the director of the hospitals and without the last qualification profusion and misapplication of its stores will inevitably take place able wellinformed active and spirited general    officers are no doubt of high importance to the honor reputation and success of any army but i have confined my observations in a more particular manner to those of the general staff who may be considered as so many parts of the commanderinchief viewing them then in this light it will readily be seen how essential it is that they should be agreeable to him such characters are within my view if they would accept i have run into great prolixity in order to give you a comprehensive view of my ideas on the subject of your letter and the principles by which i am governed without these explanations the answer might have been conveyed in a few words as follows when i retired to the walks of private life i had no idea that any event would occur which could induce me to leave them that the pain i should feel if it be my fate to do so cannot easily be expressed yet if this country should be actually invaded or such manifestation of a design to do it as cannot be mistaken i should be ready to render every service in my power to repel it— provided my declining years are not considered as an objection to the trust but on the contrary and in support of the partiality which may actuate the president in my favor it shall appear unequivocally to you and to those with whom you act being at the centre of information from all parts of the union and where a commander for the troops to be raised must often have been the subject of conversation that the public wish was directed to me notwithstanding    my avowed declaration when i retired from office to remain a private citizen— and provided also that i can have such characters associated with me as will render the turmoils of war and the burthen of the command as light as the nature of it will admit for it is well known that the vicissitudes of war are not within the reach of human controul and the chances of adding to are not greater than the hazard of taking from that reputation which the partiality of the world has been pleased to confer for past services and that not prompted as i have observed in a former part of this letter by motives of ambition or interest to embark again on a theatre so arduous and responsible i might in the course of events be left with the single consolation of knowing myself though possibly deprived even of the credit of that by the malevolence of others that a sense of duty was the only motive which had induced me to run the risk and to make the sacrifice of my ease and quiet at the same time in a very handsome polite and flattering letter with which i have lately been honored by the president he has hinted in very delicate terms not to be misunderstood a wish that the command of the military force of this country might be in me i did not conceive myself at liberty however to go into such details and explanations with him as from the habits of intimacy i have always been in with you i thought myself authorized to talk with you who may be assured of the sincere esteem and affectionate regards of dear sir c    george washington   july      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon   july      my dear sir i am perfectly satisfied that the duties of your office were not diminished by the business thrown upon it in the course of the present session of congress and far was it from my wish to add to the trouble of them i expected no more than a simple acknowledgment of my letters and with respect to the proposed arsenal at the confluence of the potomac and shanondoah that you would have said it had or had not been forgotten according to the fact i am well satisfied with your reply to my last better perhaps than you will be with the trouble of reading the lengthy scrawl herewith enclosed to which it has given rise and which if you please as from yourself may be shewn to the president to whom i have expressed tantamount sentiments in more concise terms if you are at liberty and deem it expedient communicate the responses which shall be made to it to me the presidents letter to me though not so expressed in terms is nevertheless strongly indicative of a wish that i should take charge of the military force of this country and if i take his meaning right to aid also in the selection of the general officers the appointment of these is important but of those of the general staff allimportant insomuch that if i am looked to as the commanderinchief i must be allowed to chuse such as will be agreeable  0 to me to say more at present would be unnecessary first because an army may not be wanted and  dly because i might not be indulged in this choice if it was you will readily perceive that a main difficulty with me in this business proceeds from the different epochs at which the army may be formed and at which it would be proper for me to take the command of it in case the preliminaries mentioned in my other letter are solved to my satisfaction the president knowing that  0000 men cannot be raised by the blowing of a trump might deem it expedient from such appearances or information as would justify him under the act to prepare for the worst i on the other hand have no disposition and think it would be bad policy to come forward before the emergency becomes evident farther than that it might be known that i will step forward when it does appear so unequivocally and if the matters for which i have stipulated as previously necessary are ascertained and accommodated i shall have no objection to the annunciation if good would result from it of this determination but what is to be done in the interval i see but two ways to overcome the difficulty if it is an object to accommodate my wishes first to delay the appointment of the general staff to the latter epoch if no inconvenience would result from it or if this cannot be then to advise with me on the appointment of them i mention this matter now and in this manner because i have some reason to believe that there are very fit men that    would be coadjutors with me whose services could not otherwise be commanded although i have made my stand at the general staff i conceive that much will depend upon active and spirited officers for the divisions  brigades of the army and under the rose i shall candidly declare that i do not from my present recollection of them conceive that a desirable set could be formed from the old generals some on account of their age or infirmities some from never having never displayed any talents for enterprise and others from their general opposition to the government or predilection to french measures be their present conduct what it may for those who will come up with a flowing tide will descend with the ebb and there can be no dependence upon them in moments of difficulty if circumstances would allow a choice of fieldofficers the service would be much benefited by it with my two letters i must have tired you sufficiently and therefore i shall only add what you knew before and that is that i am your affectionate c p s i have already been applied to by one gentleman to recommend him for director of the hospital which i have refused as well on general ground as because if i should ever have occasion for a physician or surgeon i should prefer my old surgeon dr craik who from  0 years experience is better qualified than a dozen of them together    george washington  0 july      mount vernon john sinclair to sir john sinclair mount vernon  0 july      sir    the manner in which the early wheat respecting which you enquire came into this country is not ascertained the history of it so far as it has come to my knowledge i will relate a farmer walking in a field of wheat when it was in bloom discovered a plant or two that was perfectly ripe and carefully separating it from the rest sowed it at the usual time the following autumn from this small beginning about   years ago this state and those adjoining are well in seed the grain is white full and heavy weighing generally two or three pounds more in the bushel of winchester measure it makes excellent flour and in tight loamy land inclining to sand it is said to be more productive of grain and less of straw than wheat in common it is a tender plant and apt to receive damage both in the field and garners it will not from report bear transportation of a vessel load sent to philadelphia for seed hardly any of it vegitated and some farmers go so far as to declare that they are obliged to spread what is intended for seed thin on their barn floors and turn it frequently to prevent the injury above mentioned from my own experience i can add but little for as my land is heavy stiff and slow not much of it has been sown but from the growth of the present year i send you a sack that by experiment you may ascertain the utility of cultivating it in england it is fit to harvest three weeks sooner than the lamas to    give it the best chance to escape injury on shipboard i have requested the owner of the vessel a mr wm wilson of alexandria to give it in particular charge to the master desiring him to keep the sack in his cabin or steerage the egyptian wheat a head or two of which you had the goodness to send me about two years ago has not answered with me the first year it shot out lateral branches from the heads pretty generally but this year the heads had hardly any and in neither year did the grain fill well and appears to have sustained more injury from the severity of our last winter than the wheat in common although that was great in the extreme in the middle and upper parts of this and the states bordering thereon occasioned by the long winter and severe frosts with very little snow nearer the sea board contrary to what is usual they have had more snow and of course the crops of winter grain are better but on the whole they are remarkably short with very great esteem c george washington    july      mount vernon timothy pickering to timothy pickering secretary of state mount vernon    july      dear sir as i never get letters by the mail until the morning after they arrive in alexandria and frequently not for several days as i am not regular in sending thither your favor of the  th instant did not reach my hands until yesterday    of the abilities and fitness of the gentleman you have named for a high command in the provisional army i think as you do and that his services ought to be secured at almost any price  what the difficulties are that present themselves to the mind of the president in opposition to this measure i am entirely ignorant but in confidence and with the frankness with which you have disclosed your own sentiments on this occasion i will unfold mine under the view i have taken of the prospect before us and shall do it concisely if the french should be so mad as openly and formidably to invade these united states in expectation of subjugating the government laying them under contribution or in hopes of dissolving the union i conceive there can hardly be two opinions respecting their plan and that their operations will commence in the southern quarter   because it is the weakest   because they will expect from the tenor of the debates in congress to find more friends there   because there can be no doubt of their arming our own negroes against us and   because they will be more contiguous to their islands and to louisiana if they should be possessed thereof which they will be if they can if these premises are just the inference i am going to draw from placing colo hamilton over general pinckney is natural and obvious the latter is an officer of high military reputation fond of the profession spirited active and judicious and much advanced    in the estimation of the public by his late conduct as minister and envoy at paris  with these pretensions and being senior to colo hamilton he would not i am morally certain accept a junr appointment disgust would follow and its influence would spread where most to be deprecated as his connexions are numerous powerful and more influential than any others in the three southern states under this view of the subject i think it would be impolitic and might be dangerous to sow the seeds of discontent at so important a crisis to this may be added that impediments to the return of general pinckney and causes unforeseen might place colo hamilton in the situation you wish to see him inspectorgeneral with a command in ye line would i hope and trust satisfy him you will readily perceive that the difficulty in my mind arises from thorough conviction that if an invasion is attempted it will commence south of maryland and from the importance of so influential a character as pinckney if among us being heartily engaged in repelling it but not having the laws at hand to refer to or knowing precisely what general officers are authorized by them i am speaking much at random and request for that reason that nothing which i have here said may be considered as definite what arrangements the secretary of war is empowered by the president to make with me i know not in the letter of the former to me he has not touched upon them he is not yet arrived but the    bearer of this to the postoffice in alexanda carrys up my carriage in order to accommodate him down this being the afternoon on which the mailstage is expected at that place i regret however that he should have left philadelphia before a letter which i had written to him could have reached that place this letter went from here on friday last before i knew or had the most distant suspicion of the presidents intention of nominating me without previous notice to the trust he has but was written in consequence of a wish expressed in a letter from the secretary to me that the crisis might overcome my reluctance to appear again on ye public theatre upon this occasion i thought it expedient before matters proceeded further to be candid and explicit and accordingly wrote him my sentiments in detail the substance of which was that if an actual invasion by a formidable force or such demonstrations of the intention as could not be mistaken i conceive it to be a duty wch i owed to my country and to my own reputation to step forward with my best endeavors to repel it however painful the measure might be to a person at my time of life and under the circumstances i am that for the satisfaction of my own mind i should like to know from the best evidence the case was susceptible of that my services as commanderinchief would be preferred to those of a man of more juvenile years and more in the prime and vigor of life and that as neither ambition interest nor personal gratification of any sort could induce me to engage again in the turmoils    and hazards of war as i had every thing to risk and hardly any thing to gain the vicissitudes of war being in the hands of the supreme director where no control is and as the army was about to be formed and every thing in a manner depending upon the arrangement and organization it could not be expected that i would take the command of it without previously knowing who my coadjutors were to be and having the assistance of those in whom i could place confidence i mentioned no names for at that time i knew nothing of my own appointment and thought the matter too much in embryo to go further and to allow him if a fit occasion occurred to let these as my sentiments be known to the president i shall conclude with great esteem and regard dear sir c george washington    july      mount vernon john adams to john adams president of the united states mount vernon    july      dear sir i had the honor on the evening of the   th instant to receive from the hands of the secretary of war your favor of the  th announcing that you had with the advice and consent of the senate appointed me lieutenantgeneral and commanderinchief of all the armies raised or to be raised for the service of the united states i cannot express how greatly affected i am at this new proof of public confidence and the highly flattering manner in which you have been pleased to make    the communication at the same time i must not conceal from you my earnest wish that the choice had fallen on a man less declined in years and better qualified to encounter the usual vicissitudes of war you know sir what calculations i had made relative to the probable course of events on my retiring from office and the determination i had consoled myself with of closing the remnant of my days in my present peaceful abode you will therefore be at no loss to conceive and appreciate the sensations i must have experienced to bring my mind to any conclusion that would pledge me at so late a period of life to leave scenes i sincerely love to enter upon the boundless field of public action incessant trouble and high responsibility it was not possible for me to remain ignorant of or indifferent to recent transactions the conduct of the directory of france towards our country their insidious hostility to its government their various practices to withdraw the affections of the people from it the evident tendency of their arts and those of their agents to countenance and invigorate opposition their disregard of solemn treaties and the laws of nations their war upon our defenceless commerce their treatment of our minister of peace and their demands amounting to tribute could not fail to excite in me corresponding sentiments with those my countrymen have so generally expressed in their affectionate addresses to you believe me sir no one can more cordially approve of the wise and prudent measures of your administration they ought to    inspire universal confidence and will no doubt combined with the state of things call from congress such laws and means as will enable you to meet the full force and extent of the crisis satisfied therefore that you have sincerely wished and endeavored to avert war and exhausted to the last drop the cup of reconciliation we can with pure hearts appeal to heaven for the justice of our cause and may confidently trust the final result to that kind providence who has heretofore and so often signally favored the people of these united states thinking in this manner and feeling how incumbent it is upon every person of every description to contribute at all times to his countrys welfare and especially in a moment like the present when every thing we hold dear is so seriously threatened i have finally determined to accept the commission of commanderinchief of the armies of the united states with the reserve only that i shall not be called into the field until the army is in a situation to require my presence or it becomes indispensable by the urgency of circumstances in making this reservation i beg it to be understood that i do not mean to withhold any assistance to arrange and organize the army which you may think i can afford i take the liberty also to mention that i must decline having my acceptance considered as drawing after it any immediate charge upon the public and that i cannot receive any emoluments annexed to the appointment before entering into a situation to incur expense  0 the secretary of war being anxious to return to the seat of government i have detained him no longer than was necessary to a full communication upon the several points he had in charge with very great respect and consideration i had the honor to be c george washington    july      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton private and confidential mount vernon    july      my dear sir your letter of the  th instant was presented to me by the secretary of war on the   th i have consented to embark once more on a boundless field of responsibility and trouble with two reservations first that the principal officers in the line and of the staff shall be such as i can place confidence in and that i shall not be called into the field until the army is in a situation to require my presence or it becomes indispensable by the urgency of circumstances contributing in the mean while every thing in my power to its efficient organization but nothing to the public expense until i am in a situation to incur expense myself it will be needless after giving you this information and having indelibly engraved on my mind the assurance contained in your letter of the  d of june to add that i rely upon you as a coadjutor and assistant in the turmoils i have consented to encounter i have communicated very fully with the secretary    of war on the several matters contained in the powers vested in him by the president who as far as it appears by them is well disposed to accommodate but i must confess that besides nominating me to the command of the armies without any previous consultation or notice the whole of that business seems to me to stand upon such ground as may render the secretarys journey and our consultation of no avail congress it is said would rise this week what then has been done or can the president do with respect to appointments under that bill if it has been enacted be his inclinations what they may unless a law could and has passed enabling him in the recess of the senate to make appointments conformable thereto the nominations must have been made and the business done here with the secretary is rendered nugatory by the pending bill if it passes to a law two majorgenerals and an inspectorgenl with the rank of majrgeneral and three brigadiers are to be appointed presuming on its passing i have given the following as my sentiments respecting the following characters fit and proper to be employed in which the secretary concurs alexr hamilton of new york inspector  cha c pinckney  majr genl henry knox or if either of the last mend refuses  henry lee of virginia  henry lee if not majrgenl  brigadiers john brooks massachusetts  wm s smith n york or  john e howard maryld  edward hand penns or  adjtgenl jonathan dayton jr n jer or  willm s smith to be  edwd carrington qrmrgenl  james craik direcr of hospls  and i have enumerated the most prominent characters that have occurred to my mind from whom to select fieldofficers for the regiments of infantry and that of cavalry which are proposed to be raised and now my dear sir with that candor which you always have and i trust ever will experience from me i shall express to you a difficulty which has arisen in my mind relative to seniority between you and genl pinckney for with respect to my friend general knox whom i love and esteem i have ranked him below you both that you may know from whence this difficulty proceeds it is proper i should observe and give it as my decided opinion that if the french should be so mad as to invade this country in expectation of making a serious impression that their operations will commence in the states south of maryland     if these premises are just the inference is obvious that the services and influence of general pinckney in the southern states would be of the highest and most interesting importance will he serve then under one whom he will consider a junr officer and what would be the consequence if he should refuse and his numerous and powerful connexions and acquaintances in those parts get disgusted you have no doubt heard that his military reputation stands high in the    southern states that he is viewed as a brave intelligent and enterprising officer and if report be true that no officer in the late american army made tactics and the art of war so much his study to this account of him may be added that his character has received much celebrity by his conduct as minister and envoy at paris under this view of the subject my wish to put you first and my fear of losing him are not a little embarrassing but why for after all it rests with the president to use his pleasure i shall only add therefore that as the welfare of the country is the object i persuade myself we all have in view i shall sanguinely hope that smaller matters will yield to measures which have a tendency to promote it i wish devoutly that either of you or any other fit character had been nominated in my place for no one can make a greater sacrifice at least of inclination than will your ever affectionate c george washington    july      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon    july      my dear sir little did i imagine when i retired from the theatre of public life that it was probable or even possible that any event would arise in my day that could induce me to entertain for a moment an idea of relinquishing the tranquil walks and refreshing shades with which i am surrounded but it is in vain i perceive to look for ease and happiness in a world of troubles    the call of my country and the urgency of my friends to comply with it have produced a letter from me to the president of the united states which probably will be given to the public but if it should not the principal feature thereof is that with the reservation of not being called into the field until the army is in a situation to require my presence or it becomes indispensable by the urgency of circumstances that i will accept the commission with which the secretary of war came charged desiring however that it might be understood that my coadjutors in the first grades and principal staff of the army must be men in whom i could place entire confidence for that it was not to be expected at my time of life that i would forsake the ease and comforts which are essential in old age encounter the toils and vicissitudes of war with all its concomitants and jeopardize the reputation which the partiality of the world has been pleased to bestow on me when the hazard of diminishing is at least equal to the prospect of increasing it without securing such assistance as would enable me to go with confidence into such a field of responsibility after this exordium it is almost unnecessary to add that i have placed you among those characters on whom i wish to lean for support but my dear sir as you always have found and trust ever will find candor a prominent trait of my character i must add that causes which would exceed the limits of an ordinary letter to explain are in the way of such an arrangement as might render your situation    perfectly agreeable but i fondly hope that the difficulty will not be insurmountable in your decision for the present and augmented force three majorgenerals and four brigadiers are allowed by the act establishing the latter and in a consultation with the secretary of war the characters proposed for the former are colo hamilton gen chas cotesworth pinckney and yourself the first of these in the public estimation as declared to me is designated to be second in command with some fears i confess of the consequences although i must acknowledge at the same time that i know not where a more competent choice could be made general pinckneys character as an active spirited and intelligent officer you are acquainted with and know that it stands very high in the southern states it being understood there that he made tactics as much if not more his study than any officer in the american army during the last war his character in other respects in that quarter before his late embassy was also high and throughout the union it has acquired celebrity by his conduct as minister and envoy his connexions are numerous and their influence extensive but most of all with me when to these considerations i add as my decided opinion for reasons unnecessary to enumerate that if the french intend an invasion of this country in force their operations will commence south of maryland and probably of virginia you will see at once the importance of embarking this gentleman and all his connexions heartily in the active scenes that would follow instead of damping    their ardor and thereby giving more activity to the leaven that is working in others where unanimity of sentiment would be most desirable viewing things in this light i would fain hope as we are forming an army anew which army if needful at all is to fight for every thing which ought to be dear and sacred to freemen that former rank will be forgot and among the fit and chosen characters the only contention will be who shall be foremost in zeal at this crisis to serve his country in whatever situation circumstances may place him most of those who are best qualified to oppose the enemy will have sacrifices of ease interest or inclination to make but what are these when put in competition with the loss of our independence or the subjugation of our government both of which are evidently struck at by an intoxicated ambitious and domineering foe the arrangement made with the secretary of war is on a separate sheet of paper and meant for your perusal alone until the decision of the president relative to it is announced with that esteem and regard which you know i feel for you i remain your sincere friend and affectionate servant p s from the best recollection i have of them the secretary of war is furnished with a list of field and other officers of the late army of most celebrity from whence to draw the fieldofficers for the corps to be raised if you wd afford your aid also it would be obliging    george washington    july      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon    july      dear sir your favor of the   th was brought by the post of yesterday the nominations according to your list will be agreeable to me although i retain the opinion that colo smith is better calculated for a command in the line than for adjutantgeneral but what have you done respecting the quartermastergeneral i hope and trust it is not intended to overlook the character i recommended in pointed terms than whom i will confidently add one more adequate is not to be found in the u states let the operations of the army be in what quarter it will nor so fit if they be in the states south of maryland as he knows and is known by every one in those regions being the deputy quartermaster general under general greene in all his active movements and as much esteemed as he is extensively known in a word if this appointment does not take place after my explanations which i was careful to have well understood respecting this officer and after it was given specially in charge to you to consult me thereon i shall feel very much hurt on the general ground i took and more so by confiding with certainty that that officer for the reasons i assigned would be made agreeable to me i wrote to colo carrington  received the answer herewith enclosed which may be returned after the proper use is made of it     i desire it may be understood that my predilection for this gentleman proceeds from no other cause than a full conviction of his fitness to fill the office to which he was assigned in my mind for having been separated from the main army he is infinitely better known to me by character than from personal acquaintance which in fact is slight and by the steady  firm support he has given to the government ever since such a character his military knowledge intelligence and experience in the duties of quartermaster would render him an acquisition to any army and the only fear i had was that he would decline accepting it the present qr master wilkins i think his name is may be adequate to the civil duties of that office  while the present troops are doing garrison duty in the western country little more is necessary but bring him to an assembled  moving army in the field where encampments  a thousand military duties would be thrown upon him and he would be found altogether incompetent from an entire unacquaintedness with the scenes by what circuitous route did you come at severe  in the wilderness he may be an estimable character for ought i know but from the impression i have of him he is better qualified to cut off indians than    to discipline an army and lead a brigade to the mouths of cannon but as i may have mistaken his character i shall halt here with my strictures on it also enclosed you will receive a letter from john tayloe esqr to me whom you must know by character being the brother of mrs lloyd  soninlaw of mr ogle of annapolis he is among the most wealthy  respectable men in this state active zealous  attentive to whatever he undertakes on the western expedition against the insurgents he commanded a troop of horse and i believe but am not sure was aid to the commanderinchief what he looks to now beyond the expression of his letter i know not with respect to the more definite part of it i have one answer and that has been  will be given to every application unless some very particular case should come forward namely that until i take the field or am in a situation to require aids i shall hold myself perfectly disengaged and free as in the choice of my established ones there are many considerations besides the mere indulgence of my wishes to be combined in addition to this i have informed mr tayloe that i would transmit his letter to you to be laid before the president not doubting it would give him as it had done me pleasure to find gentlemen in his situation and of independent fortune stepping forward at such a crisis with a tender of their services i presume he would prefer an appointment in the cavalry and i have no doubt that he could raise a very  0 fine troop but whether he would be satisfied with that or whether more could be offered with due attention to the old cavalry officers of known and acknowledged celebrity i am not prepared to decide possibly such an appointment with the privilege of chusing his own lieutenant  cornet might induce his acceptance and here i will take the liberty of giving it as my opinion once for all that when the president has fixed upon officers of established character to command companies gentlemen who prise their own honour and the reputation of their companies it would be good policy to let them chuse or at least to recommend their own subalterns it would facilitate recruiting contribute much to the harmony of the company and if the captain himself is properly chosen it may be relied on that he will be cautious not to hazard his own and the reputation of his company with bad officers if known or even suspected to be unfit for his purpose i do not recollect enough of the present officers in the cavalry or of those who have been disbanded to say with decision which of them is best entitled to the command of that corps but i have no hesitation in declaring it as my opinion that major tallmadge formerly of sheldons horse would not disgrace it  is to be preferred to his former colonel in furnishing the list i gave you when here from whom fieldofficers might be selected for the corps to be raised i omitted not seeing his name enrolled major ragsdale of the artillery his character in that corps i am told stood high how it    has happened that he is yet in the background whether from choice or because he has been overlooked i am unable to say he is of this state as tallmadge is of new york a lieut marsteller at present of the troop of horse in alexandria has been recommended to me as a man wishing and deserving of an appointment in the army about to be raised a doctr peyton son of a very worthy man and brother to two of the best officers in lees corps of horse during the revolution war has also applied for a birth in the medical line i have answered that appointments are not with me that recommendations accompanying my letters to them should go to the president direct or through the secretary of war possibly you may see these they must speak for themselves the first is well spoken of as an officer and gentleman he was in the horse in the western expedition and by accident received a wound the other dr peyton is but lately returned after an absence of five years in europe i believe in the study of physick i have also been told that the captain young of the alexandria troop is desirous of employment but as his application has not been direct i but barely mention the fact doctr craik did say something too respecting his son who was in my family going into the army but as nothing definite passed i shall say nothing more on the subject his soninlaw west major in one of the uniform corps is desirous in case the provisional army is raised of obtaining an appointment therein and    now having laid before you every thing that has occurd to me—i shall add no more at present than that i am p s i dont know whether mr edwd rutledge would come forward or not but i know of none except genl knox who would comd the corps of artillery more respectably george washington    july      mount vernon james anderson to james anderson mount vernon    july      esteemed sir your favor of the  th february came safe and would have received an earlier acknowledgment if any thing had sooner occurred worthy of communication i hope you have not only got relieved of the fever from which you were then recovering but of the languor with which it had affected you and that you are now engaged in the literary pursuits of which you gave the outlines and which with your pen and under your arrangement of the subjects must be curious entertaining and instructive thus persuaded if you propose to conduct the work on the plan of subscription it would give me pleasure to be enrolled in the list of subscribers     i little imagined when i took my last leave of the walks of public life that any event could bring me again on a public theatre but the unjust conduct of france towards these united states has been and continues to be such that it must be opposed by a firm and manly resistance or we shall not only hazard the subjugation of our government but the independence of our nation also both being evidently struck at by a lawless domineering power which respects no rights and is restrained by no treaties when it is found inconvenient to observe them while we are thus situated sustaining daily injuries even indignities with a patient forbearance from a sincere desire to live in peace and harmony with all the world the french directory mistaking the american character and supposing that the people of this country were divided and would give countenance to their nefarious measures have proceeded to exact loans or in other words contributions and to threaten us in case of noncompliance with their wild unfounded and inconsistent complaints that we should share the fate of venice and other italian states this has roused the people from their slumbers and filled them with indignation from one extremity    to the other of the union and i trust if they should attempt to carry their threats into effect and invade our territorial as they have done our commercial rights they will meet a spirit that will give them more trouble than they are aware of in the citizens of these states when every thing sacred and dear to freemen is thus threatened i could not consistently with the principles which have actuated me through life remain an idle spectator and refuse to obey the call of my country to lead its armies for defence and therefore have pledged myself to come forward whensoever the exigency shall require it with what sensations at my time of life now turned of sixtysix without ambition or interest to stimulate me thereto i shall relinquish the peaceful walk to which i had retired and in the shades of which i had fondly hoped to spend the remnant of a life worn down with cares in contemplation of the past and in scenes present and to come of rural enjoyment let others and especially those who are best acquainted with the construction of my mind decide while i believing that man was not designed by the allwise creator to live for himself alone prepare for the worst that can happen the gardener whom you were so obliging as to send me continues to conduct himself extremely well he is industrious sober and orderly and understands his business in short i never had a hired servant that pleased me better and what adds to my satisfaction is that he is himself contented having    declared that he never was happier in his life my best wishes will always attend you and with very great esteem and regard i am sir c george washington    july      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry private mount vernon    july      dear sir the greyheads of alexandria pretty numerous it seems and composed of all the respectable old people of the place having formed themselves into a company  for the defence of the town  its vicinity are in want of colors and it being intimated that the presentation of them by mrs washington would be flattering to them i take the liberty of requesting the favor of you to have made and sent to me as soon as it is convenient such as will be appropriate to the occasion handsome but not more expensive than becomes republicans not bachite republicans is reqd if you think a motto would be proper the choice of one chaste  unassuming—is left to your own judgment send the cost  the money shall be remitted by yours always george washington    july      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon    july      dear sir your letter of the   th instant came to alexandria yesterday evening and was put into my hands this morn for the rules and regulations accompanying it i thank you and will read them attentively if i am    allowed time but this is questionable as i am assailed from all quarters and by all descriptions of people for commissions introductions and recommendations c to all of which common civility makes some sort of reply necessary while among them there are a few to whom more particular answers must be given this leads me to ask whether a secretary previous to the contingencies on which my taking the field is placed will be allowed the pay i mean without which the moments employed in my usual and necessary avocations and which at all leisure hours i have been devoting to the arrangement and overhaul of my voluminous public papers civil and military that they may go into secure deposits and hereafter into hands that may be able to separate the grain from the chaff i say without this aid my time and in truth i had from a variety of causes which it is needless to enumerate little enough before will be entirely taken up by personal visits and written applications for office and such other matters as are incidental to my late appointment the motives to this question are explained the necessity i conceive is apparent but as i have placed my own services pay and emoluments upon contingencies which may happen sooner or later or never you are to decide and accordingly advise whether or not a secretary can be appointed previously to this event with the pay and forage allowance annexed to the office or not     you will not have transmitted you the half perhaps not a tenth part of the applications which are made to me it may be taken for granted therefore that all who appear to you under my auspices are such as i am either personally acquainted with their families or am satisfied with the recommendations they bring your answers to mr caton and judge chase were judicious and proper of the propriety of remaining perfectly free from all engagements respecting my aids i am more and more convinced as the applications encrease and the little knowledge displayed of the qualifications which the aids of the commanderinchief ought to possess is discovered by the applicants the variegated and important duties of the aids of a commanderinchief or the commander of a separate army require experienced officers men of judgment and men of business with ready pens to execute them properly and with dispatch a great deal more is required of them than attending him at a parade or delivering verbal orders here and there or copying a written one they ought if i may be allowed to use the expression to possess the soul of the general and from a single idea given to them to convey his meaning in the clearest and fullest manner this young men unacquainted with the service and diffident would not do be their abilities what they may one or two of the latter as extra might be received but the choice must depend on circumstances    why do you not say something about the quartermastergeneral and adjutantgeneral i am thrown entirely into the field of conjecture to account for the cause of silence on these interesting points nor am i relieved in either by the gazettes except by a blind account in baches that col smith as brigadier did not obtain will col hamilton accept have you heard from the other general officers my paper is done  i am always yours george washington   august      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon   august      my dear sir your letter of the   th ultimo has filled my mind with disquietude and perplexity in the extreme but i will say nothing in reply intentionally that shall give you a moments pain indeed from the tenor of your letter it would seem as if nothing i could say now would be of any avail after the open candid and i think friendly communications in my letter of the   th of july assigning reasons for what had been done which could not i conceive be construed into a supposed inferiority on your part by me but as there are some things in your letter which appear to have originated in a misconception of circumstances justice to myself makes it necessary to explain when i observe then that the first knowledge i had of my own appointment nay the first intimation that such a measure was in contemplation was contained    in a newspaper as a complete act of the president and senate accompanied with a few lines from the secretary of war of equal date july  th informing me that he should be the bearer of my commission and the presidents instructions to make some but does not say what arrangements—when with this information i was left from the receipt thereof until the arrival of the secretary on the night of the   th with sensations occasioned thereby easier to conceive than describe—and when upon his arrival i was presented with a pending bill for augmenting the army of the united states and informed at the same time that congress would as it actually did adjourn the monday following    what was to be done my earnest desire often repeated was that congress could be prevailed on circumstanced as things were to vest a power in the president to make appointments in the recess of the senate rather than precipitate the organization of an army that time might be allowed for a deliberate and harmonious consultation in the arrangement of the general officers at least and i offered to attend in philadelphia myself and send for colo hamilton and you to meet me there for this very desirable purpose i even hastened precipitately mr mchenrys return in hopes he might be back in time to accomplish this object guarding however against the failure under this statement which you will find correct how was it possible for me who have never in the remotest degree directly or indirectly interfered in  0 any matter of government since i left the chair of it to have consulted you previously to the nomination of the general officers and if giving in your name without in the manner it was handed to the president which seemed to be the result of necessity proceeding from causes which have been communicated is considered as a wound to your feelings might i not complain upon ground equally strong and hurtful to mine brought as i was without the least intimation before the public after it had been officially announced to the world and i hope believed that my soul panted for rest and that the first wish of my heart was to spend the remnant of a life worn down with care in ease and contemplation but left as i was by this act without an alternative or with a very disagreeable one i passed it over in silence from a conviction that if affairs are in the alarming state they are represented to be that i was not to complain or stand upon punctilios so soon as my nomination as commanderinchief was given in by the president to which according to mr mchenrys account he was induced without consulting me by the urgency of his friends i was inundated with letters describing the crisis and the expediency of my accepting the command through the same channel and from information i had no cause to distrust no doubt remained on my mind that colo hamilton was designated second in command and first if i should decline an acceptance by the federal characters of congress whence alone anything like a public sentiment relative thereto    could be deduced on this authority the paragraph which you quoted from my letter was founded i pretend to no other knowledge of the business the moment i had resolved to accept the command with the reservations mentioned in my letter to the president now before the public my first care was to look for coadjutors with whom i could be happy and in whom i could place entire confidence a second thought was not necessary for this in the majrgenerals for the augmented army but to arrange them with an attention to the various views the subject presented was not easy in a free and candid strain i frankly declared to you in my last the principle and the only principle which operated in the arrangement of genl pinckney but as i was more concise on this head as it related to colo hamilton i will ask your patience while i detail the reasons which prevailed in his case   having already informed you of the evidence as given to me of the public wish that he should be second in command if i accepted and first if i did not it is unnecessary to repeat it   considering the military establishment of this country was about to take a new form and to commence as it were de novo without any particular regard to an army which had been disbanded near fourteen years i conceived that the president in the choice of officers and arrangement of them would pay as much attention to circumstances as to former rank not supposing then that the latter would be viewed in so serious a    light as appears by your letter i shall readily acknowledge that i had recourse to no old resolves of congress nor did i recollect any that would apply to the case   i might in some measure have been led into this belief from what happened in consequence of the insurrection in      then you will recollect genl lee who had never been more than a colo in the army of the u s was put over the heads of mifflin irvine morgan and bland all of whom had been general officers in the said service not because he was governor of virginia for the moment he crossed the potomac which he was obliged to do to get at the insurgents his office and power as governor ceased   the same communication of the wishes that colo hamilton might be second in command conveyed intimation also that from his situation and prospects having a large family and no certain dependence but his profession which was lucrative something as nearly adequate as the case would admit ought to be offered to induce his acceptance and the  nd rank was proposed   though his services during the war were not rendered in the grade of a general officer yet his opportunities and experience could not be short of those that did—and   adding these to the important trusts reposed in him in various civil walks of life he will be found i trust upon as high ground as most men in the u states i do not know that these explanations will afford you any satisfaction or produce any change in your determination but it was just to myself to make them    if there has been any management in the business it has been concealed from me i have had no agency therein nor have i conceived a thought on the subject that has not been disclosed to you with the utmost sincerity and frankness of heart and notwithstanding the insinuations wch are implied in your letter of the vicissitudes of friendship and the inconstancy of mine i will pronounce with decision that it ever has been still is and notwithstanding the unkindness of the charge ever will be for aught i know to the contrary warm and sincere i earnestly wished on account of that friendship as well as on the score of military talents to have had the assistance of you and colonel hamilton in the arduous contest with which we are threatened i wish it still and devoutly as well on public as on private accounts for dissensions of this sort will have an unhappy effect among the friends of government while it will be sweet consolation to the french partisans and food for their pride     lengthy as this letter is i must ask leave to make an observation on the following passage in yours which i hope inadvertently escaped you speaking of genl officers you say if so new england which must furnish the majority of the army if one shall be raised will be without a major general or have the junr one—whether they will possess such a sense of inferiority as to bear such a state of things    patiently—whether their zeal  confidence will thereby be excited time will discover i hope in god that at no time much less the present when everything sacred  dear is threatened that local distinctions  little jealousies will be done away if the arrangement who comd affect new england massachusetts  of three major generals  three brigadiers for the augmented army would have two of each and from new jersey  p— —ward there are four out of six what distribution more equal could be made with the strictest eye to locality or geographical refinement may it not be asked what advantage would a state or states derive from the senior more than the junr major general equal privileges being attached to all on the same establishment except that the senior in the usual routine has the best chance of being commander in chief i will now close my letter spun to an infinitely greater length than i expected when i began with a solemn declaration that if such powers as i suggested in the early part of this letter had as i think they ought under the circumstances of the case been given to the president and the consequent meeting had taken place in philadelphia i should have been perfectly satisfied with any arrangement that would have produced harmony and content for nothing could be farther from my wish than to see you in a degraded point of view how the commissions are dated i know not i am as i ever have been my dear sir your sincere friend and affectionate servant    george washington   august      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton mount vernon   august      my dear sir by the same post which brought me your favor began in philadelphia and ended in new york the  st instant i received a letter from general knox dated the   th ulto in answer to one i had written him on the   th of that month—in confidence and as a proof of my frankness and friendship i send both of them to you together with my reply of this date—which after reading be so good as to return to me— giving you the perusal of this correspondence supercedes the necessity of my going into further details on the subject of relative rank—except if the commissions are yet to issue and it be practicable at this time and consistent also i should not be indisposed so far as my agency in the business extends if that would satisfy general knox to make him the senior of general pinckney—but as the president is absent—and it might have been the understanding of the senate that the latter should be first—the propriety of the change unless it could be effected with the consent of gen pinckney might at least be questioned—though upon more mature reflection i do not see upon what principle he could object—i have a high opinion of general pinckneys qualifications as an officer and his integrity as a man but under the impression i am that the southern hemisphere will be the grand theatre of action i shall honestly confess that my primary object in gratifying him is that he may come forward with all his force— your opinion respecting the unfitness of a certain    gentleman  for the office he holds accords with mine and it is to be regretted sorely at this time that these opinions are so well founded—i early discovered after he entered upon the duties of his office that his talents were unequal to great exertions or deep resources—in truth they were not expected—for the fact is it was a hobsons choice—but such is the case and what is to be done i am held in the most profound ignorance of every step that has been taken since he left this place—and but for other letters which i have been obliged to have ready for this days post i should have written very seriously to him on several matters highly interesting to me if i am to be called to the field and that which you have mentioned among the rest—i am not at this moment made acquainted with a single step that is taken to appoint an officer or recruit a man or where the rendezvouses are—numberless applications have been made to me to be recommended for commissions and such as appeared to have merit i forwarded but know nothing of the result— let me hope that you will be able to devote a good deal of your time to the business of recruiting good men and the choice of good officers it is all important i will endeavor to impress him with propriety of requiring your assistance in these matters and of the necessity of making you the full allowance of pay c for these services—by bringing you thus in contact a thousand other matters will fall in of course—delicacy—if matters became serious must    yield to expediency—the stake we play for is too great to be trifled with mr harper has been presented to my consideration before as an aidde camp but as i shall have no use for my military family until matters are more matured i am unwilling to be embarrassed by engagements my aids as you well know must be men of business and ought to be officers of experience—many very many young gentlemen of the first families in the country have offered their services—and all have received one answer to the above effect indeed in the choice of my aids a variety of considerations must combine—political—geographical c as well as experience what is become of walker colo heth has offered and stands well in my estimation without a promise—no foreigner will be admitted as a member of my family while i retain my present ideas—nor do i think they ought to be in any situation where they can come at secrets—and betray a trust— write me as often as you can conveniently—and believe me to be what i really am your sincere  affecte friend george washington  0 august      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private and confidential mount vernon  0 august      my dear sir you will consider this letter as private and confidential dictated by friendship and flowing from the best intentions if then anything should be found therein    which may have too much the appearance of plain dealing look to the motives and manner of the communication and my apology will be sought for in your candor from the moment i accepted my appointment as commanderinchief of the armies of the united states i considered myself as nearly allied to the secretary of war and entitled to particular attentions from him notwithstanding i drew no pay nor was acting in the field it could not have been supposed had it not otherwise been expressed that i would be called to the army in the moment of danger as ignorant of its formation its munitions and every thing relating thereto as if i had just dropped from the clouds my solicitude often and strongly expressed relatively to the formation of the army could not but have impressed you with my ideas of its importance but if stronger evidence was necessary the offer i made to go at this hot season and in other respects inconvenient to philadelphia would be conclusive but what fruit has it produced to this moment i am ignorant of every step that has been taken in the appointment of the battalion officers for recruiting the men fixing the places of rendezvous c with respect to the quarter mastergeneral finding no mention made of one in the list of appointments nor any thing said of him in your letter of the   th of july announcing them i waited some time to see if any explanation of this matter would be given but finding    none i wrote to you on the   d of that month to be informed of the cause and not until the first of this was i answered and with respect to the adjutantgeneral i am to this moment unadvised of the result of colo smiths nomination i have heard indeed that colo north was appointed and that it had been announced in the newspapers but this i have not seen altho i have examined them with an eye to it as accurately as my hurried situation would allow having staked my life my reputation my fortune my ease tranquillity and happiness in support of the government and independence of our country it is not a little interesting and important for me to be advised of the measures which you are pursuing to organize and provide for the augmented force for as that act is absolute no delay can be admitted and it is much to be desired that it may take the field with éclat which will not be effected without great exertion and as it will not be supposed that the president welldisposed sensible and zealous as he is can have many relative ideas in arrangements of this sort more responsibility will attach to you and as the multiplicity of matters and burthens will be great let me entreat you to call on the inspector allowing him full pay and emoluments for assistance the business of recruiting in the result belongs to his department then why not let it commence and be prosecuted agreeably to your general instructions to him under his auspices it is much easier at all times to prevent an evil  0 than to rectify mistakes it is infinitely better to have a few good men than many indifferent ones officers whose recruiting emoluments depend upon numbers will not be very scrupulous in their choice without the fullest conviction that the inspection of the men will be as rigid as the instructions that are given you would besides find him in your hurried situation extremely useful in a variety of occurrences which cannot always be foreseen or provided against i would have suggested a similar measure with respect to general knox as it related more particularly to arms and the ordnance department but under the rose for the present he seems to be so much dissatisfied with the arrangement of the relative rank of the general officers that i have no expectation of his serving let me conclude by requesting to be informed in what state the formation of the augmented corps is whether the applications for commissions are numerous and the characters good what arrangements are made for recruiting where the general rendezvous are to be who are appointed to superintend them what is the present state of your military supplies what the means and what the measures for augmenting them with much truth and sincerity i remain your affectionate     george washington mount vernon  0 august      william vans murray to william vans murray mount vernon  0 august      dear sir i doubt not but you have already set me down as an unprofitable correspondent and with too much truth perhaps—but not with as much culpability on my part as appearances may indicate— i have written you several letters and having put one or two for mr dandridge under your covers without receiving any acknowledgment of them the presumption is that they have fallen into other hands nothing however was contained in either of them that could entitle them to the honor of a place in the bureaus of france to which several of my private letters it seems have found a passage—and but for the impropriety of such conduct and the deprivation and invasion of anothers right all might go as i write or say nothing i wish to conceal from that nation my politicks being straight and my views undisguised towards it and all others in examining my file of unanswered letters i find two of yours dated the  th of octr and  st of novr among them in acknowledging the rect of which permit me to thank you for the interesting communications which are detailed therein and to express a wish that in your moment of leisure you would favor me with a continuation of matters so satisfactory to be informed of i should have wrote oftener to you if in retirement i had found matter sufficient for amusement—but revolving days producing similar scenes of domestic     rural occurrences—none interesting except to those who were engaged in them knowing that all things of public concern together with the gazettes of different complexions were regularly transmitted to you from the proper department and knowing also that you had friends near the fountain of intelligence who were in the habit of corresponding with you i conceived that the details of the latter kind from one might be less correct and at best but secondhand information  therefore avoid giving you the trouble to receive it but new and unexpected scenes opening upon us and all the plans of my retirement likely to be marred by the domineering spirit and boundless ambition of a nation whose turpitude have set all obligations divine  human at naught may in time to come enable me to communicate some things more interesting than are to be found in the circle of my present perambulations in doing which i shall always feel pleasure little did i think when my valadictory address was presented to the people of the united states that any event would occur in my day that could draw me from the peaceful walks and tranquil shades of mount vernon where i had fondly hoped to spend the remnant of a life worn down with public cares in ruminating the variegated scenes through which i have passed and in the contemplation of others which are yet in embrio i will hope however that when the despots of france find how much they have mistaken the    american character and how much they have been deceived by their partizans among us that their senses will return to them and an appeal to arms for the purpose of repeling an invasion at least will be rendered unnecessary to be prepared for them however is the most certain and perhaps the least expensive mode of averting the evil—neither they nor their abetors here expected i believe that such a spirit would be roused as the occasion has manifested among all classes of citizens except the leaders of opposition—upon their obtaining correct statements of the treatment they have recd from their good and magnanimous allies the difficulty under which they will find themselves lie in treading back their steps—but envoy logan may be sent to keep them out of it —or which is to the full as likely to direct them into another course to obtain the same end present me if you please to mrs murray in which mrs washington and miss custis unite as they do to yourself and in remembrance to mr dandridge and be assured of the sincere regard  esteem of dear sir c george washington    august      mount vernon jonathan boucher to jonathan boucher mount vernon    august      reverend sir i know not how it is happened but the fact is that your favor of the  th of november last year is but just received and at a time when both public and    private business pressed so hard upon me as to afford no leisure to give the view of the causes and consequences of the american revolution written by you and which you had been pleased to send me a perusal for the honor of its dedication and for the friendly and favorable sentiments which are therein expressed i pray you to accept my acknowledgments and thanks not having read the book it follows of course that i can express no opinion with respect to its political contents but i can venture to assert beforehand and with confidence that there is no man in either country more zealously devoted to peace and a good understanding between the two nations than i am nor one who is more disposed to bury in oblivion all animosities which have subsisted between them and the individuals of each peace with all the world is my sincere wish i am sure it is our true policy and am persuaded it is the ardent desire of the government but there is a nation whose intermeddling and restless disposition and attempts to divide distract and influence the measures of other countries will not suffer us i fear to enjoy this blessing long unless we will yield to them our rights and submit to greater injuries and insults than we have already sustained to avoid the calamities resulting from war what will be the consequences of our arming for selfdefence that providence which permits these doings in the disturbers of mankind and which rules and governs all things alone can tell to its allpowerful    decrees we must submit whilst we hope that the justice of our cause if war must ensue will entitle us to its protection with very great esteem i am c george washington    august      mount vernon bushrod washington to bushrod washington mount vernon    august      my dear bushrod at the time your letter of the  0th instant with others was brought to this place i was not in a situation to acknowledge the receipt of it and no post has happened since by which i could do it—that of to morrow of which i shall avail myself will be the first which offers on the   th at night i was seized with a fever of which i took little notice until the   st when i was obliged to call for the aid of medicine and with difficulty a remission thereof was so far effected as to dose me all night on thursday with bark—which having stoped it and weakness only remaining will soon wear off as my appetite is returning i learnt with much pleasure from the postscript to your letter of general marshalls intention to make me a visit  i wish it of all things and it is from the ardent desire i have to see him that i have not delayed a moment to express it lest if he should have intended it on his way to frederic and hear of my indisposition he might change his route i can add with sincerity and truth that if you can    make it comport with your business i should be exceedingly happy to see you along with him the crisis is important the temper of the people in this state in many at least in some places is so violent and outrageous that i wish to converse with general marshall and yourself on the elections which must soon come the fictitious letter of john langhorne may be had at any time i do not send it now because if you come up it will do then and we will let general marshall into the whole business and advise with him thereon good or evil must flow from mr nicholass attempt according to his establishment of facts present my best wishes to general marshall my love in which your aunt unite to nancy and believe me to be always your affectionate uncle george washington   september      mount vernon mcdowell to — mcdowell  mount vernon   september      sir your favor of the   th ultimo with the accounts came duly to hand and i thank you for the trouble you have had in paying and taking receipts therefor the small balance of £     ½ may if you please be given to mr custis    it was my intention to have written fully to you by the return of this young gentleman to college but the debilitated state into which i have been thrown by a fever with which i was seized on the   th and could procure no remission of until the   th past renders writing equally irksome and improper were the case otherwise i should i confess be at a loss to point out any precise course of study for mr custis my views with respect to him have already been made known to you and therefore it is not necessary to repeat them on this occasion it is not merely the best course for him to pursue that requires a consideration but such an one as he can be induced to pursue and will contribute to his improvement and the object in view in directing the first of these objects a gentleman of your literary discernment and knowledge of the world would be at no loss without any suggestions of mine if there was as good a disposition to receive as there are talents to acquire knowledge but as there seems to be in this youth an unconquerable indolence of temper and a dereliction in fact to all study it must rest with you to lead him in the best manner and by the easiest modes you can devise to the study of    such useful acquirements as may be serviceable to himself and eventually beneficial to his country french from having become in a manner the universal language i wish him to be master of but i do not find from inquiry that he has made much progress in the study yet some of the branches of mathematics particularly surveying he ought possessor as he is of large landed property to be well acquainted with as he may have frequent occasion for the exercise of that study i have already exceeded the limit i had prescribed to myself when i began this letter but i will trespass yet a little more while i earnestly entreat that you will examine him as often as you can make it convenient yourself and admonish him seriously of his omissions and defects and prevent as much as it can be done without too rigid a restraint a devotion of his time to visitations of the families in annapolis which when carried to excess or beyond a certain point can not but tend to divert his mind from study and lead his thoughts to very different objects above all let me request if you should perceive any appearance of his attaching himself by visit or otherwise to any young lady of that place that you would admonish him against any such step on account of his youth and incapability of appreciating all the requisites for a connection which in the common course of things can terminate with the death of one of the parties only and if done without effect to advise me thereof if in his reading he was to make commonplace notes as is usual copy them fair    and show them to you two good purposes would be answered by it you would see with what judgment they were done and it might tend much to improve his handwriting which requires nothing but care and attention to render it good at present all of his writing that i have seen is a hurried scrawl as if to get to the end speedily was the sole object of writing with sincere esteem and regard i am sir your obedient p s knowledge of bookkeeping is essential to all who are under the necessity of keeping accounts  george washington   september

states and two large bundles of letters—from these i presume—came at the same time  in good order my last to you was dated the  0th of august two days previous to which i had been seized with a fever which i endeavored to shake off by pursuing my usual rides  occupations but it continued to  0 encrease upon me when on the   st at night doctr craik was called in who it seems chose to have assistance and on the   th procured such a remission as to admit bark since which i have been in a convalescent state but too much debilitated to be permitted to attend much to business which i mention with no other view than to apprise you of my inability to enter so actively upon the duties you have suggested as you probably have counted upon i shall however do all that the situation of my health and circumstances will enable me to answer your expectations if i should be finally charged in the manner you have suggested to the president the wide expance you must permit me however to add which forms the southern district will render it very difficult to obtain correct information of characters will require more time than is supposed and will after all be liable to much imposition as confidence must be placed in others who may be actuated more by local considerations than the general weal it is much to be wished that gen pinckney was arrived  and if the arrival should be north of this that he might call here with your ideas that i might with him arrange matters finally relatively to the states of south carolina  georgia and provisionally as they respect north carolina and tennessee kentucky from its local situation is not only remote from but in a manner is unconnected with any other state and as you have taken no notice of the    northwestern territory the presumption is that you contemplated neither officers nor men from that region upon the principle that the three great districts of the united states give each four of the augmented regiments i suppose it is meant that the several states composing these districts should furnish a quota proportioned to its population and on this principle without regarding fractions i shall proceed when ultimately instructed unless you direct otherwise but for want of a general list of the revolutionary officers to remind one of the captains  subalterns who have distinguished themselves in the late war many of the most deserving and meritorious may be overlooked for i have heard already of several coming under this description who have declared their willingness to serve but wait to be called upon adding that as their names  they presume characters are registered in the war office they may be called if it shall be adjudged that their services are needful to be preferred upon this ground if you suppose it probable that the selection of regimental officers for the southern district will be entrusted to me to bring forward i should be glad to be furnished with a general list of them for the one you left with me you will recollect comprehended the fieldofficers only and of those only such as continued to the end of the war you have said in your letter of the   th ulto that the officers for the cavalry are to be selected by the lieutenantgeneral of the army but do not signify    whether they are to be taken from the southern district wholly or from the union at large on this head i shall require explicit directions i have no doubt that a body of fine cavalry might be raised in the southern district if the price of the horses is not too limited and that they would stand the southern operations better than the northern horses and i believe a handsome corps of officers might also be had but it remains with you to direct where both or either are to be taken from talmadge according to your account in a former letter although i could perceive no reason for it unless the promotion of genl dayton has raised his expectations looks higher than the command of such a corps when i am furnished by the superintendent with a return of the military stores now on hand and in train to be procured i shall agreeably to your desire offer such observations thereon as may occur in the mean time i have no hesitation in declaring that your magazines cannot be too well furnished with all necessary articles of foreign dependence the procuring of which if the country should be invaded will not only be rendered precarious but they must come much higher those of our own growth or manufacture we have more at hand and above all things direct the keepers of your powder magazines to be attentive to the powder turning it often and proving it frequently otherwise there may appear to be a store while there is none in fact that is none fit for use    i have not been in a situation to examine the printed rules  regulations respecting the recruiting service transmitted in your last i hope they are rigid and pointed to good men for it is much better to have a few good soldiers than a multitude of vagrants and indifferent ones who besides other imperfections may desert their colours in critical moments if any change should take place in settling the relative rank of the majrgenerals i shall hope  expect to be informed of it with much truth i am dear sir george washington    september      mount vernon alexander spotswood to alexander spotswood mount vernon    september      dear sir your letter of the   th came to my hands yesterday two causes indeed three prevented my answering the first after your return to new port sooner namely—debilitated health occasioned by the fever wch deprived me of  0 lbs of the weight i had when you and i were at troy mill scales and rendered writing irksome the expectation of hearing from you again relative to the carpenter and farmer to whom you informed me you had written and the daily expectation of hearing from rawlins who had been informed if he could forward satisfactory recommendations of his qualifications to make a good overseer that he would be employed by me in that character these reasons must apologize for your not hearing from me sooner    by the same mail that brought me your letter of the   th rawlins sent me satisfactory testimonials of his fitness for my purpose—of course i stand engaged to him but i have yet one place certain perhaps two requiring overseers but not at the advanced wages your overseer asks vizt £ 0 c—these are my home house which requires an active stirring and spirited man but not an illtempered or severe one the other in which i have been in some doubt is what i call doguerun farm where the octagon barn and treading floor is—i could not well afford more than £ 0 and the usual allowance of provisions for the latter  £   is the most i ever gave for the former and seldom more than thirty pounds a single man wd suit the home house best—would be cheaper to me—and he himself would live much better in as much as he would eat of the provisions that went from my table with the housekeeper and other hired people about it—on the other hand a married man would be preferred for doguerun the reason why i doubted about employing an overseer at the latter farm is—that as union  doguerun farms are under one overseer this year  the latter conducted in a great measure by the foreman—i had some thoughts of entrusting it solely to him next year under the direction of the steward but when i perceive but too clearly that negroes are growing more and more insolent and difficult to govern i am more inclined to incur the expense of an overseer than to hazard the management and peace of the place to a negro—provided i can get a good    overseer on moderate terms—and why any of them should think of an increase of wages when the produce by which they are to be paid is reduced to half price and taxes to their employer which they will not feel are becoming very high—is to me inconceivable—for these causes i am lowering the wages of my farms i mention these things to possess you of my ideas relative to these matters but will add notwithstanding that i will keep one of the two places before mentioned open until you hear from richard rhodes  learn his terms if he will come to me at all—i think he would have a better opportunity of displaying his knowledge  skill as a farmer at doguerun which is really a good farm than at the mansion house where there is nothing done by the hands that are kept there but jobbing and running from one thing and from one place to another and for overlooking this farm i would stretch the wages to £   tho i should hope to get him for £ 0 and if he declines coming altogether or asks higher wages i will in that case offer the same pay for the same place to your overseer—but if rhodes accepts and your overseer will come to the mansion house for £ 0 which is ten pounds higher than i had intended i will allow him that sum which i am persuaded would be better and more profitable to him if a single man as i understood from you he was than £ 0 at a separate farm where he would have to find himself many small though expensive articles from which he would be exempt by eating at my second table with the house keeper—    so much for your overseer and rhodes i must add however that both must decide immediately—yea or nay—of which you will be so good as to inform me without delay as others are offering said to be good which i may also miss the season getting late for valuable overseers to be disengaged from the character you have received of brookes the carpenter i have no hesitation in requesting that he may be engaged immediately and i did not care how soon he would come up—for as he is spoken of as a complete joiner i have work enough for him in that way before the time of the present overlooker of my carpenters expires which will be about the first of novr—i go in this case upon the supposition that brookes is a single man—if on the contrary he is a married one his wife cannot be brought here altho he might come himself immediately until my other carpenter moves his family away  the house in which they live is given up—if he is single he would not live in that but in one of the houses in my yard—and eat as before mentioned with the house keeper  others you will oblige me very much by having all these matters adjusted as soon as possible  by informing me of the result that i may be placed upon a certainty  conduct myself accordingly—as it will not be in my power to hold those who offer here in suspense more than a few days longer— you forgot to leave me the names  grades of those officers whose celebrity were known in the revolutionary war  by expecting it i did not    charge my memory with them  have forgot the names of those you did mention i have had no return of my fever and am recovering my flesh fast nearly a pound  a half a day at which rate if i should hold it for a twelve month i shall be an overmatch for majr willis we were very glad to hear that you got safe home in the extreme hot weather you traveled from hence mrs washington nelly  washington custis are all well and unite in best regards and wishes for your self mrs spotswood  the family with dear sir c p s to insure this letter getting to you without any delay at the postoffice i have requested mr parks to send it to you by express george washington    september      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private and confidential mount vernon    september      my dear sir your letter of the  th instant from trenton is before me and no plan is yet decided on that i can discover for recruiting the augmented force or even for appointing the officers therefor it is for the executive to account for this delay sufficient it is for me to regret and i do regret it sorely because that spirit and enthusiasm which were inspired by the dispatches from our envoys that resentment which was roused by the treatment of our commissioners by the directory and the demands    which were made on them as a preliminary to negotiation by the latter are evaporating fast and recruiting service which might have been successful of the best men a month ago may be found very difficult a month hence of the worst kind the law passed before the middle of july and was positive and the middle of september has produced no fruit from it this to me is inconceivable i must once more too my dear mchenry request that your correspondence with me may be more full and communicative you have a great deal of business i shall acknowledge but i scruple not to add at the same time that much of the important and interesting part of it will be to be transacted with the commanderinchief of the armies of the u states to whom there ought to be no concealment or want of information short letters therefore taking no notice of suggestions or queries are unsatisfactory and distressing considering the light in which i think my sacrifices have placed me i should expect more attention from the secretary of war but from mr mchenry as a friend and coadjutor i certainly shall look for it compare then my letter to you of the  d instant which i wrote in much pain from the debilitated state into which the fever had thrown me with your acknowledgment thereof dated the  th and judge yourself whether i could derive any satisfaction therefrom on the score of business nor to this moment although you know my solicitude respecting the general staff of the army and my asking the question in one of my letters in direct    terms what truth there was in the report of colo norths nomination to the office of adjutantgeneral has there been the least notice taken of it i will defer saying any thing on the presidents new arrangement of the three majorgenerals until you shall have communicated the result of colonel hamiltons answer to me  but in the name of the army what could have induced the nomination of walter anthony walton white to the rank of brigadier after the state of new jersey had been complimented with one brigadier and other states of more importance had received none i formerly asked the same question with respect to sevier to which no reply was made whites name was placed in the list of field officers for new jersey merely as one that might be considered in that grade when the general organization came on but i had no idea when you left this place that general officers would be appointed at the time they were for the provisional army and taking it for granted that it was a work for after consideration  0 i bestowed no thought thereon of all the characters in the revolutionary army i believe one more obnoxious to the officers who composed it could not have been hit upon for a genl officer than white especially among those to the southward where he was best known  celebrated for nothing but frivolity—dress—empty show  something worse—in short for being a notorious l—r this appointment will i am told exclude many valuable officers who will not serve as his juniors as to sevier the only exploit i ever heard of his performance was the murder of indians what measures if any are pursuing to provide small arms i know not nor of what sort or length they are intended to be my opinion is that both musket  bayonet ought to be full as long as those with whom we expect to contend to give confidence to the soldiery and it is a matter deserving consideration whether the latter ought not to resemble the dagger more than those wch have been in common use with us if these if the new invented artillery of g britain at the cannonworks in scotland if the horseartillery in short if any other articles of foreign manufacture are needed not a moment is to be lost in the importation besides their coming much higher after hostilities shall have commenced the obtaining of them at all will be attended with hazard and delay i have written you a free and friendly letter it is intended and i hope will be received in that light from my dear sir your sincere friend c    george washington    september      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private and confidential mount vernon    september      dear sir your confidential letter dated trenton the  0th instant with its enclosures has been duly received the latter are returned the contents of them have filled my mind with much disquietude and embarrassment but it is impossible for me to make any move in consequence at this time from the want of official grounds without betraying your confidential communication i can perceive pretty clearly however that the matter is or very soon will be brought to the alternative of submitting to the presidents forgetfulness of what i considered a compact or condition of acceptance of the appointment with which he was pleased to honor me or to return him my commission and as that compact was ultimately and at the time declared to him through you in your letter written from this place and the strong part of it inserted after it was first drawn at my request to avoid misconception i conceive i have a right and accordingly do ask to be furnished with a copy of it you will recollect too that my acceptance being conditional i requested you to take the commission back that it might be restored or annulled according to the presidents determination to accept or reject the terms on which i had offered to serve and that but for your assuring me it would make no difference    whether i retained or returned it and conceiving the latter might be considered an evidence of distrust it would have been done subsequent events evince that it would have been a measure of utility for though the case in principle is the same yet such a memento of the fact could not so easily have been forgotten or got over after the declaration in the presidents letter to you of august   th which is also accompanied with other sentiments of an alarming nature and his avowed readiness to take the responsibility of the measure upon himself it is not probable that there will be any departure from the resolution he has adopted but i should be glad notwithstanding to know the result of the representation made by the secretaries as soon as it comes to hand and if there is no impropriety in the request to be gratified with a sight of the memorial also i am c p s if you see no impropriety in the measure and do not object to it it would be satisfactory to me to receive a copy of the powers or instructions from the president under which you acted when here george washington    september      mount vernon john adams to john adams president of the united states mount vernon    september      sir with all the respect which is due to your public station and with the regard i entertain for your private character the following representation is presented to your consideration if in the course of    it any expression should escape me which may appear to be incompatible with either let the purity of my intentions the candor of my declarations and a due respect for my own character be received as an apology the subject on which i am about to address you is not less delicate in its nature than it is interesting to my feelings it is the change which you have directed to be made in the relative rank of the majorgenerals which i had the honor of presenting to you by the secretary of war the appointment of an adjutantgeneral after the first nomination was rejected and the prepared state you are in to appoint a third if the second should decline without the least intimation of the matter to me it would have been unavailing after the nomination and appointment of me to the chief command of the armies of the united states without any previous consultation of my sentiments to observe to you the delicate situation in which i was placed by that act it was still less expedient to have dwelt more than i did on my sorrow at being drawn from my retirement where i had fondly hoped to have spent the few remaining years which might be dispensed to me if not in profound tranquillity at least without public responsibility but if you had been pleased previously to the nomination to have inquired into the train of my thoughts upon the occasion i would have told you with the frankness and candor which i hope will ever mark my character on what terms i would have consented to the    nomination and you would then have been able to decide whether they were admissible or not this opportunity was not afforded before i was brought to public view to declare them afterwards was all i could do and this i did in explicit language to the secretary of war when he honored me with your letter of the  th of july showed me his powers and presented the commission they were that the general officers and general staff of the army should not be appointed without my concurrence i extended my stipulations no further but offered to give every information and render every service in my power in selecting good officers for the regiments it would be tedious to go into all the details which led to this determination but before i conclude my letter i shall take the liberty of troubling you with some of them previously to the doing of which however let me declare and i do declare in the most unequivocal manner that i had nothing in view in making this stipulation than to insure the most eligible characters for these highly responsible offices conceiving that my opportunities both in the civil and military administration of the affairs of this country had enabled me to form as correct an opinion of them as any other could do neither the secretary of war nor myself entertained any doubt from your letters to me and instructions to him that this was the meaning and object of his mission unwilling however to let a matter of such serious importance to myself remain    upon uncertain ground i requested that gentleman to declare this in his official letter to you supposing as was the case that the one i should have the honor of writing to you might be laid before the public and that to encumber it with stipulations of that sort would be improper nay more as the acceptance was conditional and you might or might not be disposed to accede to the terms i requested him to take the commission back to be annulled or restored according to your conception of the propriety or impropriety of them his remark upon this occasion was that it was unnecessary inasmuch as if you did not incline to accept my services upon the condition they were offered you would be under the necessity of declaring it whilst on the other hand silence must be construed into acquiescence this consideration and believing that the latter mode would be most respectful as the other might imply distrust of your intentions arrested that measure this sir is a true candid and impartial statement of facts it was the ground on which i accepted and retained the commission and was the authority on which i proceeded to the arrangement that was presented to you by the secretary of war having no idea that the general officers for the provisional army would be nominated at the time they were i had not even contemplated characters for those appointments i will now respectfully ask in what manner these stipulations on my part have been complied with in the arrangement made by me with the secretary    of war the three majorgenerals stood hamilton pinckney knox and in this order i expected their commissions would be dated this i conceive must have been the understanding of the senate and certainly was the expectation of all those with whom i have conversed but you have been pleased to order the last to be first and the first to be last of four brigadiers for the provisional army one whom i never heard of as a military character has been nominated and appointed and another is so well known to all those who served with him in the revolution as for the appointment to have given the greatest disgust and will be the means of preventing many valuable officers of that army from coming forward one adjutantgeneral has been and another is ready to be appointed in case of the nonacceptance of mr north not only without any consultation with me but without the least intimation of the intention although in the letter i had the honor to write you on the  th of july in acknowledgment of your favor of the   d of june preceding and still more strongly in one of the same date to the secretary of war which while here his clerk was i know directed to lay before you i endeavored to show you in a strong point of view how important it was that this officer besides his other qualifications should be agreeable to the commanderinchief and possess his entire confidence to increase the powers of the commanderinchief or to lessen those of the president of the united states i pray you to be persuaded was most foreign    from my heart to secure able coadjutors in the arduous task i was about to enter upon was my sole aim this the public good demanded and this must have been equally the wish of us both but to accomplish it required an intimate knowledge of the component parts of the characters among us in the higher grades of the late army and i hope without incurring the charge of presumption i may add that the opportunities i have had to judge of these are second to none it was too interesting to me who had staked every thing which was dear and valuable upon the issue to trust more to chance than could be avoided it could not be supposed that i was insensible to the risk i was about to run knowing that the chances of losing were at least equal to those of increasing the reputation which the partiality of the world had been pleased to bestow on me no one then acquainted with these circumstances the sacrifices i was about to make and the impartiality of my conduct in the various walks of life could suppose that i had any other object in view than to obtain the best aids the country afforded and my judgment could dictate if an army had been in actual existence and you had been pleased to offer the command of it to me my course would have been plain i should have examined the constitution of it looked into the organization and inquired into the character of its officers c as the army was to be raised and the officers to be appointed could it be expected as i was no candidate for the office that i should be    less cautious or less attentive to secure these advantages it was not difficult for me to perceive that if we entered into a serious contest with france the character of the war would differ materially from the last we were engaged in in the latter time caution and worrying the enemy until we could be better provided with arms and other means and had better disciplined troops to carry it on was the plan for us but if we should be engaged with the former they ought to be attacked at every step and if possible not suffered to make an establishment in the country acquiring thereby strength from the disaffected and the slaves whom i have no doubt they will arm and for that purpose will commence their operations south of the potomac taking all these circumstances into view you will not be surprised at my solicitude to intrench myself as i did nor is it to be supposed that i made the arrangement of the three majorgenerals without an eye to possible consequences i wished for time it is true to have effected it hoping that an amicable adjustment might have taken place and offered at a very short summons inconvenient as it would have been to proceed to philadelphia for that purpose but as no subsequent notice was taken thereof i presumed there were operative reasons against the measure and did not repeat it it is proper too i should add that from the information which i received from various quarters and through different channels i had no doubt in my    mind that the current sentiment among the members of congress and particularly among those from new england was in favor of colonel hamiltons being second in command and this impression has been since confirmed in the most unequivocal manner by some respectable members of that body whom i have myself seen and conversed with on the subject but if no regard was intended to be had to the order of my arrangement why was it not altered before it was submitted to the senate this would have placed matters upon simple ground it would then have been understood as it is at present namely that the gentlemen would rank in the order they are named but the change will contravene this and excite much conversation and unpleasant consequences i cannot lay my hand readily upon the resolves of the old congress relative to the settlement of rank between officers of the same grade who had been in service and were disbanded while a part of the army remained in existence but if i have a tolerable recollection of the matter they are totally irrelevant to the present case those resolves passed if i am not mistaken at a time when the proportion of officers to men was so unequal as to require a reduction of the former and when the army was about to undergo a reduction in part and the officers might be called upon again but will a case of this sort apply to the officers of an army which has ceased to exist more than fourteen years i give it frankly as my opinion if i have not entirely forgotten the principle on which the resolves took place that they will not  00 and i as frankly declare that the only motive i had for examining a list of the officers of that army was to be reminded of names if the rule contended for were to obtain what would be the consequences and where would the evil end in all probability resort would be had to the fieldofficers of the revolutionary army to fill similar grades in the augmented and provisional corps which are to be raised what then is to be done with general dayton who never ranked higher than captain in it the principle will apply with equal force in that case as in the case of hamilton and knox the injury if it is one of putting a junr over the head of a senr officer of the last war is not ameliorated by the nomination or appointments of them on different days it is the act itself not the manner of doing it that affects i have dwelt longer on this point than perhaps was necessary in order to show that in my opinion former rank in the revolutionary army ought to have no influence in the present case farther than may be derived from superior experience brilliant exploits or general celebrity of character and that as the armies about to be raised are commencing de novo the president has the right to make officers of citizens or soldiers at his pleasure and to arrange them in any manner he shall deem most conducive to the public weal it is an invidious task at all times to draw comparisons and i shall avoid it as much as possible but i have no hesitation in declaring that if the  0  public is to be deprived of the services of colo hamilton in the military line that the post he was destined to fill will not be easily supplied and that this is the sentiment of the public i think i can venture to pronounce although colonel hamilton has never acted in the character of a general officer yet his opportunities as the principal and most confidential aid of the commanderinchief afforded him the means of viewing every thing on a larger scale than those whose attentions were confined to divisions or brigades who knew nothing of the correspondences of the commanderinchief or of the various orders to or transactions with the general staff of the army these advantages and his having served with usefulness in the old congress in the general convention and having filled one of the most important departments of government with acknowledged abilities and integrity have placed him on high ground and made him a conspicuous character in the united states and even in europe to these as a matter of no small consideration may be added that as a lucrative practice in the line of his profession is his most certain dependence the inducement to relinquish it must in some degree be commensurate by some he is considered as an ambitious man and therefore a dangerous one that he is ambitious i shall readily grant but it is of that laudable kind which prompts a man to excel in whatever he takes in hand he is enterprising quick in his perceptions and his judgment intuitively great  0  qualities essential to a military character and therefore i repeat that his loss will be irreparable with respect to general knox i can say with truth there is no man in the united states with whom i have been in habits of greater intimacy no one whom i have loved more sincerely nor any for whom i have had a greater friendship but esteem love and friendship can have no influence on my mind when i conceive that the subjugation of our government and independence are the objects aimed at by the enemies of our peace and when possibly our all is at stake in the first moments of leisure after the secretary of war left this place i wrote a friendly letter to general knox stating my firm belief that if the french should invade this country with a view to the conquest or the division of it their operations would commence at the southward and endeavored to show him in that case how allimportant it was to engage general pinckney his numerous family friends and influential acquaintance heartily in the cause sending him at the same time a copy of the arrangement which i supposed to be final and in a subsequent letter i gave him my opinion fully with respect to the relative situation of himself and colonel hamilton not expecting i confess the difficulties which have occurred i will say but little relative to the appointment of the brigadiers before alluded to but i must not conceal that after what has passed and my understanding of the compact that my feelings were not  0  a little wounded by the appointment of any much more such characters without my knowledge in giving these details i have far exceeded the limits of a letter but i hope to be excused for the prolixity of it my object has been to give you a clear and distinct view of my understanding of the terms on which i received the commission with which you were pleased to honor me lengthy as this letter is there is another subject not less interesting to the commanderinchief of the armies be he whom he may than it is important to the united states which i beg leave to bring respectfully to your view we are now near the end of september and not a man recruited nor a battalion officer appointed that has come to my knowledge the consequence is that the spirit and enthusiasm which prevailed a month or two ago and would have produced the best men in a short time are evaporating fast and a month or two hence may induce but few and those perhaps of the worst sort to enlist instead therefore of having the augmented force in a state of preparation and under a course of discipline it is now to be raised and possibly may not be in existence when the enemy is in the field we shall have to meet veteran troops inured to conquest with militia or raw recruits the consequence is not difficult to conceive or foretell i have addressed you sir with openness and candor and i hope with respect requesting to be informed whether your determination to reverse the order of the three majorgenerals is final and whether  0  you mean to appoint another adjutantgeneral without my concurrence with the greatest respect and consideration i have the honor to be sir c  george washington  0 september      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon  0 september      dear sir i have lately received information which in my opinion merits attention it is that the brawlers against governmental measures in some of the most discontented parts of this state have all of a sudden become silent and it is added are very desirous of obtaining commissions in the army about to be raised this information did not fail to leave an impression upon my mind at the time i received it but it has acquired strength from a publication i have lately seen in one of the maryland gazettes between the author of which and my informant there could have been no interchange of sentiments to the same effect the motives ascribed to them are that in such a situation they would endeavor to divide and contaminate the army by artful and seditious discourses and perhaps at a critical moment bring on confusion what weight to give to these conjectures you can judge as well as i but as there will be characters enough of an opposite description who are ready to receive appointments circumspection is necessary for my opinion is of the first  0  that you could as soon scrub the blackamore white as to change the principle of a profest democrat and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the government of this country finding the resentment of the people at the conduct of france too strong to be resisted they have in appearance adopted their sentiments and pretend that notwithstanding the misconduct of government have brought it upon us yet if an invasion should take place it will be found that they will be among the first to defend it this is their story at all elections and election meetings and told in many instances with effect whether there be little much or nothing in the information i shall not take upon me to decide but it appeared to me to be of sufficient moment to apprize you thereof with esteem  regard i am george washington  0 october      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry mount vernon  0 october      private and quite confidential my dear sir you will be at no loss to perceive from my private letter to you of the   th ulto extracts from which you sent to the president of the united states and from my representation to him dated the   th following the rough draught of which was enclosed in my last what my determination is if he perseveres in his resolution to change the order of the major generals  0  and to disregard the conditions on which i accepted the commission of lieut genl of the armies c— let me then request you with the frankness and candor of a friend to give me your opinion fully and freely of the measure—to ask if you think i could with propriety and a due respect for my own character retain the commission under such violations of the terms on which i accepted it—and what you conceive will be the consequences of my resignation thereof if col pickering and the gentlemen who act with you are intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of the case it would be satisfactory to me to know their opinions also with respect to my eventual resignation but not as a matter required by me but as questions propounded by yourself entirely and absolutely be so good as to let me know the ground on which you and colo pickering are certain the president is mistaken in his conjectures that the new england states would be disgusted if hamilton preceeds knox in rank and add if you please whether pickerings predelection in favor of the former proceeds from pure conviction of the utility of the measure or from some personal dislike to the latter i have some suspicion that he is not a friend to knox but cannot suppose that this would have any influence in the case i should like to have seen a copy of mr wolcotts letter to the president but as it was not sent i presume  0  there was some reason for withholding and do not repeat the request  i wish to hear from you on the subject of this letter as soon as possible—burn it as soon as it is perused as i will do your answer that neither the one nor the other may appear hereafter with much truth i am george washington    october      mount vernon timothy pickering to timothy pickering secretary of state mount vernon    october      dear sir the information contained in your letter of the  d instant was highly grateful to me such communications are not only satisfactory to me but are really useful for while i hold myself in readiness to obey the call of my country it is expedient that i should have more authentic information than news paper inconsistencies of the approaching or receding storm that i may regulate my private concerns accordingly so far then as you can give this with propriety would be received with thankfulness and if under the seal of confidence will be locked up in my own breast it is pleasing to hear that we had so few ships in france when the directory thereof were pleased to  0  lay an embargo thereon i wish on many accounts that general pinckney was safely landed in his own country as i heard mr gerry is come after his terrible fright i hope so soon as he is relieved from the panic with which he was struck and which must have continued whilst he remained on the watery element he will come forward in stronger language than his last letter to mr talleyrand contains and with such explanations as his own character requires and his country has a right to demand we have nothing new in this quarter an excessive drought which still prevails has been hurtful to our crops and presses sorely upon the winter grain and grass seeds which have been sown this autumn maryland instead of acquiring strength in her federal representation by the last election has lost ground what will be the result of the elections in this state in march next is more i believe than any one can foretell at present no stone is left unturned that can affect the federal interest by the democrats i am dear sir c george washington    october      mount vernon timothy pickering to timothy pickering secretary of state mount vernon    october      dear sir the contents of your letter of the   th instant which i received last night gave me much pleasure and it has been increased since by the annunciation in the gazettes of general pinckneys safe arrival  0  at new york i hope he will not play the second part of the difficulty created by general knox the extracts of letters from our consuls and other characters in france to you are satisfactory and useful to me my opinion always has been however necessary to be in a state of preparation that no formidable invasion is to be apprehended from france while great britain and that country are at war not from any favorable disposition the latter has towards us but from actual inability to transport troops and the munitions of war while their ports are blockaded that they would willingly and perhaps necessarily employ their forces in such an enterprise in case of peace i have little doubt unless adverse fortune in their foreign relations—a revolution at home—or a wonderful change of sentiment in the governing powers of their country should take place if any thing in the conduct of their agents could excite astonishment it would be talleyrands effrontery duplicity and supposed diplomatic skill in his management of matters with mr gerry but as his object to those who are not determined to be blind may be read as they run it is unnecessary to comment upon it and with respect to mr gerry i observed in my last that his own character and public satisfaction require better evidence than his letter to the minister of foreign relations to prove the propriety of his conduct during his envoyship i fear from the paragraph which you have extracted from a paris paper of the   d of august   0 relative to madame de lafayette that the general and his son are on their passage to this country i had a letter from him dated late in may wherein he says that her health was too much impaired to attempt a sea voyage at that time and therefore that she and the female part of his family would go to france while he and son would visit the united states whither he expected to arrive in the month of september on public and his own private account i hope that would not happen while matters were in the train they are at present but as one part of the information appears to have been accomplished the other may be expected i have read your letter of the   th ult to p johnston on the subject of the prince edward address and with pleasure it ought to flash conviction of the impropriety of that address on all minds that are open to it—but it is not easier to change the principles of the leaders of such measures than it would be to wash a blackamoor white truth and information is not their object to blind and irritate the people against government to effect a change in it is their sole aim with much truth and sincere regard i am sir c george washington    october      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon    october      my dear sir several causes have occurred to retard the acknowledgment of the receipt of your favor of the   th of august at the time it came to hand i     was much engaged in matters that could not be well postponed and before i got through them i was seized with a fever which was unremittingly severe for several days and left me in so debilitated a state as to render writing and business generally when it could be avoided not only irksome but improper and was forbidden by my physicians during this state of convalescence letters which required prompt attention were pouring in upon me—this state of things—not knowing what the presidents final decision would be and not perceiving that i could say more to you on the subject of relative rank than i had done in former letters unless to dilate on the several points which had before been touched and this appeared to me unnecessary as your own ideas would anticipate all i could say i delayed from day to day to do what i am now in the act of doing that is writing to you i can again my dear sir with much truth and sincerity repeat to you the declaration made on a former occasion namely that if an amicable arrangement of precedence could have been settled between generals hamilton pinckney and yourself previous to the nomination it wd have been perfectly satisfactory to me but driven as i was to make it myself at the time and in the manner it was transmitted i was governed by the best views and best evidence i could obtain of the public sentiment relative thereto the senate acted upon it under an impression that it was to remain so and in that light the matter is understood by the public and it would be uncandid     not to add that i have found no cause since to believe i mistook that sentiment let me add further that as an army was to be raised de novo fourteen years after the revolutionary troops had ceased to exist i do not see that any resolution of the ancient congress can apply at this day to the officers of that army if it does and the matter is viewed by others as it is by you will any fieldofficer of that army serve under general dayton would it not deprive the president of the advantage of selection and arrangement and what difficulties and perplexities would not follow if this idea and conduct should prevail generally accompanied with the opinion which you seem to have imbibed of incidental rank few knowing and deserving officers of this description would feel very easy under such a decision or be content with a feather if they conceived that rank meant nothing when inserted in their commissions on what ground did the baron de steuben command a separate corps in the state of virginia in the year      and colo hamilton a select one at the siege of york if incidental rank does not give command according to circumstances and the discretion of the commanding general but i am running into details which i did not intend it would if you could reconcile it to your own feelings give me sincere pleasure to see you in the augmented corps a majorgenl we shall have either no war or a severe contest with france in either case if you will allow me to express my opinion this is the most eligible time for     you to come forward in the first case to assist with your counsel and aid in making judicious provisions and arrangements to avert it in the other case to share in the glory of defending your country and by making all secondary considerations yield to that great and primary object display a mind superior to embarrassing punctilios at so critical a moment as the present after having expressed these sentiments with the frankness of undisguised friendship it is hardly necessary to add that if you should finally decline the appointment of majrgeneral there is none to whom i would give a more decided preference as an aiddecamp the offer of which is highly flattering honorable and grateful to my feelings and for which i entertain a high sense but my dear genl knox and here again i speak to you in the language of candor and friendship examine well your mind on this subject do not unite yourself to the suit of a man whom you may consider as the primary cause of what you call a degradation with unpleasant sensations this while it was gnawing upon you would if i should come to the knowledge of it make me unhappy as my first wish would be that my military family and the whole army should consider themselves as a band of brothers willing and ready to die for each other i shall add no more than assurances of the sincere friendship and affection with which i am dear sir c      george washington    october      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry private and confidential mount vernon    october      my dear sir enclosed is a copy of the presidents letter to me which i request may be with this letter burnt as soon as they are read  no more said respecting the contents than might be proper for him to hear repeated again otherwise a knowledge that the contents of my letters to and from him are in possession of others may induce him to believe in good earnest that intrigues are carrying on in which i am an actor—than which nothing is more foreign from my heart i return the press copies which were enclosed to me but in future whenever you require my opinion on any points let them be stated in your letter or on a paper to remain in my possession without wch my acts  proceedings will appear incomplete  mysterious do you mean to furnish me with a copy of the letter you wrote to the president from hence  of his instructions to you or not long long since i informed you that it would be extremely useful to     me if i was to have any hand in selecting the officers for the four regiments  cavalry proposed to be raised in the southern division of the union to be furnished with a list of the captains  subalterns therein who served in the revolutionary army but none has been sent this with the date of their commissions might be the means of coming at many valuable officers and preventing many disputes hereafter has mr wolcott received any answer to his letter to the president and to what effect you know that i am always c p s it is some time since nelly custis enclosed you a post note furnished by me to discharge your advance for the colours—has it ever been received george washington   st octr      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon   st octr      dear sir your letter of the   th instant came by the last mail  the enclosures are well calculated to effect their objects but the explicit declaration contained in the one to general knox added to his knowledge     of my sentiments on the subject of relative rank leaves little hope in my mind that he will obey your summons and render his aid in the manner required of him i hope no difficulty will occur with general pinckney and if he cannot be prevailed on to remain at the seat of government until the  0th of november the ulterior day allowed for the assembling of the majorgenerals that you will avail yourself of all his information relatively to the characters best qualified to officer the corps allotted to the states of south carolina  georgia and as far as his knowledge extends to those of no carolina and tennessee also i have said in the beginning of this letter that the enclosures were well calculated to effect their objects but i must except that part of them which relates to the officering of the new corps in the southern and western states as greatly inferior to the one i suggested in my last letter to you dated the   th instant first because it involves more delay and      dly because the chance of obtaining good officers is not equal if the president of the united states or the secretary of war had a personal and intimate knowledge of the characters of the applicants the mode suggested by me would be indelicate  improper but at such a distance  in cases where information must govern from whom as i observed in my former letter can it be so much relied on as from those whose interest honor and reputation are pledged for its accuracy the applications are made chiefly through members of congress these oftentimes to get rid of them oftener still perhaps for local  electioneering purposes and to please  gratify their party more than from any real merit in the applicant are handed in backed by a solicitude for success in order to strengthen their interest possibly no injustice might be done if i were to proceed a step further and give it as an opinion that most of the candidates brought forward by the opposition members possess sentiments similar to their own and might poison the army by disseminating them if they were appointed if however the plan suggested by you is to be adopted indeed in any case you will no doubt see the propriety of obtaining all the information you can from majrgeneral pinckney and if he accepts his appointment and cannot be prevailed on to remain with you until the other majrgenerals assemble of requesting him to call on brigrgeneral davie on his route to charleston and after a full      free conversation with him on fit characters to officer the quota of troops from the states of no carolina and tennessee if he can aid in it to inform you of the result without delay  i hardly think it will be in my power to attend at trenton or philadelphia at the time alloted to the majrgenerals  st because i am yet in a convalescent state although perfectly recovered of the fever so far at least as to avoid exposure and consequent colds  dly my secretary mr lear has had a severe fever and is now very low and several others of my family are much indisposed and  dly and principally because i see no definite ground to proceed upon if i should go from anything that has hitherto appeared nor is it probable you will have received the presidents instructions and genr knoxs answer in time to serve me with a notice of the results by the  0th of november i mean for me to get there on or about that day if general pinckney could be prevailed on to remain with you  there was a moral certainty of     meeting generals hamilton and knox i would maugre the inconveniences and hazard i might run attempt to join them for the valuable purpose of projecting a plan in concert with you and them which might be ineffectually accomplished at a partial meeting i shall therefore stand prepared as well as the situation of things will admit and wait your full communications on these several points and govern myself accordingly george washington    october      mount vernon g w snyder to g w snyder  mount vernon    october      reverend sir i have your favor of the   th instant before me and my only motive to trouble you with the receipt of this letter is to explain and correct a mistake which i perceive the hurry in which i am obliged often to write letters have led you into it was not my intention to doubt that the doctrines of the illuminati and principles of jacobinism had not spread in the united states on the contrary no one is more fully satisfied of this fact than i am the idea that i meant to convey was that i did not believe that the lodges of freemasons in this country had as societies endeavored to propagate the diabolical tenets of the former or pernicious principles of the latter if they are susceptible of separation that individuals of them may have   0 done it or that the founder or instrument employed to found the democratic societies in the united states may have had these objects and actually had a separation of the people from their government in view is too evident to be questioned my occupations are such that little leisure is allowed me to read newspapers or books of any kind the reading of letters and preparing answers absorb much of my time with respect i remain sir c george washington    october      mount vernon timothy pickering to timothy pickering secretary of war mount vernon    october      dear sir i have been duly favored with your letters of the   th   0th instant and received great satisfaction from the communications in both that general pinckney not only accepts his appointment in the army of the united states but accompanies the acceptance with declarations so open and candid as those made to general hamilton affords me sincere pleasure it augers well of the aid that may be expected from his services i should suppose that a correspondence between the department of state and the governors of individual states would be attended with salutary consequences—whilst no evil that i can perceive would flow from it by such communications as would be proper to make to them the well disposed part would be possessed of useful information and those of a contrary description would in many cases be bereft     of a plea which they often make—the want of it—to enable you to do this and to execute with ease the other important duties of your office you ought certainly to be allowed all the aid that is necessary if mr gerry has it in his power to dispel the cloud that hovers over him i wish on account of this country—for his own sake—and as the only attonement he can make to his colleagues for his separate transactions and secret conduct with the french minister that he would come forward with an open and manly representation of all the circumstances that occurred and governed in that business—though nothing can excuse his secret negociations—a measure of this sort is the only one i can see that can irradicate unfavorable suspicions—i fear however that vanity which may have led him into the mistake—and consciousness of being duped by the diplomatic skill of our good and magnanimous allies are too powerful for a weak mind to overcome with very great esteem and regard i am c george washington    november      philadelphia alexander spotswood to alexander spotswood philadelphia    november      dear sir your letter of the   th enclosing a publication under the signature of gracchus on the alien and sedition laws found me at this place deeply engaged in business you ask my opinion of these laws professing to place confidence in my judgment for the compliment     of which i thank you but to give opinions unsupported by reasons might appear dogmatical especially as you have declared that gracchus has produced thorough conviction in your mind of the unconstitutionality and inexpediency of the acts above mentioned to go into an explanation on these points i have neither leisure nor inclination because it would occupy more time than i have to spare but i will take the liberty of advising such as are not thoroughly convinced and whose minds are yet open to conviction to read the pieces and hear the arguments which have been adduced in favor of as well as those against the constitutionality and expediency of those laws before they decide and consider to what lengths a certain description of men in our country have already driven and seem resolved further to drive matters and then ask themselves if it is not time and expedient to resort to protecting laws against aliens for citizens you certainly know are not affected by that law who acknowledge no allegiance to this country and in many instances are sent among us as there is the best circumstantial evidence to prove for the express purpose of poisoning the minds of our people and to sow dissensions among them in order to alienate their affections from the government of their choice thereby endeavoring to dissolve the union and of course the fair and happy prospects which were unfolding to our view from the revolution but as i have observed before i have no time to enter the field of politics and therefore shall only     add my best respects to the good family at new port and the assurances of being dear sir your very humble servant george washington    december      mount vernon general lafayette to general lafayette mount vernon    december      my dear sir       to give you a complete view of the politics and situation of things in this country would far exceed the limits of a letter and to trace effects to their causes would be a work of time but the sum of them may be given in a few words and amounts to this that a party exists in the united states formed by a combination of causes which oppose the government in all its measures and are determined as all their conduct evinces by clogging its wheels indirectly to change the nature of it and to subvert the constitution to effect this no means which have a tendency to accomplish their purposes are left unessayed the friends of government who are anxious to maintain its neutrality and to preserve the country in peace and adopt measures to secure these are charged by them as being monarchists aristocrats and infractors of the constitution which according to their interpretation of it would be a mere cipher while they arrogated to themselves until the eyes of the people began to discover how outrageously they had been treated in their commercial concerns by the directory of france and that that was a ground on which they could no longer tread the sole merit     of being the friends of france when in fact they had no more regard for that nation than for the grand turk further than their own views were promoted by it denouncing those who differed in opinion whose principles are purely american and whose sole view was to observe a strict neutrality with acting under british influence and being directed by her counsels now with being her pensioners this is but a short sketch of what requires much time to illustrate and is given with no other view than to show you what would be your situation here at this crisis under such circumstances as it unfolds you have expressed a wish worthy of the benevolence of your heart that i would exert all my endeavors to avert the calamitous effects of a rupture between our countries believe me my dear friend that no man can deprecate an event of this sort with more horror than i should and that no one during the whole of my administration labored more incessantly and with more sincerity and zeal than i did to avoid this and to render every justice nay favor to france consistent with the neutrality which had been proclaimed sanctioned by congress approved by the state legislatures and the people at large in their town and country meetings but neutrality was not the point at which france was aiming for whilst it was crying peace peace and pretending that they did not wish us to be embroiled in their quarrel with great britain they were pursuing measures in this country so repugnant to its sovereignty and so incompatible with every principle of neutrality as must     inevitably have produced a war with the latter and when they found that the government here was resolved to adhere steadily to its plan of neutrality their next step was to destroy the confidence of the people in and to separate them from it for which purpose their diplomatic agents were specially instructed and in the attempt were aided by inimical characters among ourselves not as i observed before because they loved france more than any other nation but because it was an instrument to facilitate the destruction of their own government hence proceeded those charges which i have already enumerated against the friends to peace and order no doubt remains on this side of the water that to the representations of and encouragement given by these people is to be ascribed in a great measure the infractions of our treaty with france her violation of the laws of nations disregard of justice and even of sound policy but herein they have not only deceived france but were deceived themselves as the event has proved for no sooner did the yeomanry of this country come to a right understanding of the nature of the dispute than they rose as one man with a tender of their services their lives and their fortunes to support the government of their choice and to defend their country this has produced a declaration from them how sincere let others judge that if the french should attempt to invade this country they themselves would be amongst the foremost to repel the attack you add in another place that the executive     directory are disposed to accommodation of all differences if they are sincere in this declaration let them evidence it by actions for words unaccompanied therewith will not be much regarded now i would pledge myself that the government and people of the united states will meet them heart and hand at fair negotiation having no wish more ardent than to live in peace with all the world provided they are suffered to remain undisturbed in their just rights of this their patience forbearance and repeated solicitations under accumulated injuries and insults are incontestable proofs but it is not to be inferred from hence that they suffer any nation under the sun while they retain a proper sense of virtue and independence to trample upon their rights with impunity or to direct or influence the internal concerns of their country it has been the policy of france and that of the opposition party among ourselves to inculcate a belief that all those who have exerted themselves to keep this country in peace did it from an overweening attachment to great britain but it is a solemn truth and you may count upon it that it is void of foundation and propagated for no other purpose than to excite popular clamor against those whose aim was peace and whom they wished out of the way that there are many among us who wish to see this country embroiled on the side of great britain and others who are anxious that we should take part with france against her admits of no doubt but it is a fact on which you may entirely and absolutely     rely that the governing powers of the country and a large part of the people are truly americans in principle attached to the interest of it and unwilling under any circumstances whatsoever to participate in the politics or contests of europe much less since they have found that france having forsaken the ground she first took is interfering in the internal concerns of all nations neutral as well as belligerent and setting the world in an uproar after my valedictory address to the people of the united states you would no doubt be somewhat surprised to hear that i had again consented to gird on the sword but having struggled eight or nine years against the invasion of our rights by one power and to establish our independence of it i could not remain an unconcerned spectator of the attempt of another power to accomplish the same object though in a different way with less pretensions indeed without any at all on the politics of europe i shall express no opinion nor make any inquiry who is right or who is wrong i wish well to all nations and to all men my politics are plain and simple i think every nation has a right to establish that form of government under which it conceives it shall live most happy provided it infracts no right or is not dangerous to others and that no governments ought to interfere with the internal concerns of another except for the security of what is due to themselves i sincerely hope that madame de lafayette will accomplish all her wishes in france and return safe     to you with renovated health i congratulate you on the marriage of your eldest daughter and beg to be presented to them both and to virginia in the most respectful and affectionate terms to george i have written in all these things mrs washington as the rest of the family would do if they were at home most cordially joins me as she does in wishing you and them every felicity which this life can afford as some consolation for your long cruel and painful confinement and sufferings i shall now only add what you knew well before that with the most sincere friendship and affectionate regard i am always yours c p s your old aid de camp—and my worthy nephew george a washington died about five years ago of a pulmonary complaint he left   fine children a daughter  two sons the eldest of the boys was called after you the letters herewith enclosed and directed one to yourself another to george and the third to mr frestel have been some time in my possession and detained to be delivered to you here upon the same principle that prevented me from writing to you at an earlier period george washington    december      mount vernon william vans murray to william vans murray  mount vernon    december      dear sir having some cause to believe the vessel was captured in which went the original of the enclosed copy i forward a duplicate     i returned a few days ago from philadelphia whither i had been for the purpose of making some military arrangements with the secretary of war respecting the force which is about to be raised it was there i received a letter from mr dandridge announcing his intention of returning to america partly on account of his health expressing in lively and grateful terms his sense of your attentions and kind treatment and adding that as experience had more and more convinced him that a sedentary life was incompatible both with his health and turn of mind a sentiment he had often expressed whilst he lived with me he wished for an appointment in the army we were about to raise the application arriving opportunely he stands arranged as captain of a company of infantry in one of the regiments which will be raised in virginia and it is necessary he should enter upon the duties thereof as soon as it can be made convenient mr envoy logan who arrived at philadelphia about the time i did brings very flattering accounts of the disposition of the french directory towards this country he has dined with one supped with another and in short has been as familiar with all that were in place as the hand is with its gloves and he is not a little employed in propagating this doctrine in all parts of the united states by means of the presses who are at the command of that party he says the inclinations of france to be upon good terms with the united states is now so strong that it must be our own mismanagement and disinclination   0 to peace if matters with that country are not accommodated upon terms honorable and advantageous to this      both houses of congress were formed before i left philadelphia but had not been long enough in session for an opinion of the result to be prognosticated     their answer to the speech woud it seems have passed unanimously could mr varnum of massachusetts have retained his spleen—how far this measure is indicative of a tranquil  energetic session remains to be decided by more unequivocal evidence the alien and sedition laws are now the disiderata of the opposition—but any thing else would have done—and something there will always be for them to torture and to disturb the public mind with their unfounded and ill favored forebodings the family join me in presenting mrs murray and yourself with the compliments of the season and in wishing you many happy returns of them with very sincere esteem i am c george washington  0 december      mount vernon david stuart to david stuart mount vernon  0 december      dear sir company ever since my return home has prevented my mentioning a matter before which will be the subject of this letter now     when the applications for military appointments came to be examined at philadelphia it was pleasing to find among them so many gentlemen of family fortune and high expectations soliciting commissions  not in the high grades— this and a thorough conviction that it was a vain attempt to keep washington custis to any literary pursuits either in a public seminary or at home under the direction of any one gave me the first idea of bringing him forward as a cornet of horse—to this measure too i was induced by the conviction paramount in my breast—that if real danger threatened the country no young man ought to be an idle spectator of its defence and that if a state of preparation would avert the evil of an invasion he would be entitled to the merit of proffered service without encountering the dangers of war—and besides that it might divert his attention from a matrimonial pursuit for a while at least to which his constitution seems to be too prone but though actuated by these ideas i intended to proceed no farther in the business than to provide a vacancy in one of the troops of light dragoons and to consult mrs stuart and his grandmother as to their inclinations respecting his filling it before any intimation of it should be given to him—but mr lear hearing the matter talked of and not knowing that this was the ground on which i meant to place the appointment if the arrangement met the presidents approbation wrote to washington on the subject in order to know if it would be agreeable to him or no to receive it     under these circumstances and his appearing highly delighted concealment i mean an attempt at it—would have proved nugatory—he stands arranged therefore a cornet in the troop to be commanded by lawrence lewis who i intended as his mentor lawrence washington junr of chotanck is the lieutenant of the troop but all this it will be remembered is to be approved first by the president and consented to by the senate to make it a valid act and therefore the less it is publicly talked of the better mrs washington does not seem to have the least objection to his acceptance of the commission but it rests with mrs stuart to express her sentiments thereon and soon as i requested the secretary of war to forward the commissions for this troop of light dragoons under cover to me the only hesitation i had to induce the caution before mentioned arose from his being an only son—indeed the only male of his great great grandfathers family—but the same providence that wd watch over and protect him in domestic walks can extend the same protection to him in a camp or the field of battle if he should ever be in one with compliments to the family and with the greatest esteem and regard i am c george washington    december      mount vernon bushrod washington to bushrod washington mount vernon    december      my dear sir it gave me pleasure to hear from judge cushing that you had returned from your southern circuit in good health i presume you will soon have to     undertake another journey when i shall hope to see you  i was not unmindful of your application in behalf of captain blackburn but when the list of applicants came to be unfolded it was found that there were so many requests of a similar nature from officers of the existing corps that it was impossible to comply with them and difficult to discriminate for which reasons it was deemed best to reject them in toto especially as in the raising of new corps it rarely happens that officers are drawn from the old and nothing but length of service or very distinguished merit or powerful interest or influence gives birth to the measure by this conveyance i have sent to general marshall judge addisons charge to the grand juries of the county courts of the fifth circuit of the state of pennsylvania and requested after he had read it to give it to you or dispose of it in any other manner he might think proper this charge is on the liberty of speech and of the press and is a justification of the sedition and alien laws but i do not believe that any thing contained in it in evanss pamphlet  or in any other writing will produce the least change in the conduct of the leaders of opposition to the measures of the general government they have points to carry from which     no reasoning no inconsistency of conduct no absurdity can divert them if however such writings should produce conviction in the mind of those who have hitherto placed faith in their assertions it will be a fortunate event for this country has any thing been done and what with my correspondent mr langhorne i have heard since my return from philadelphia that there has been some stirring matter but of the result i am ignorant the family here present the compliments of the season to you and mrs washington i remain your sincere friend c      george washington    january      mount vernon patrick henry to patrick henry confidential mount vernon    january      dear sir at the threshold of this letter i ought to make an apology for its contents but if you will give me credit for my motives i will contend for no more however erroneous my sentiments may appear to you it would be a waste of time to attempt to bring to the view of a person of your observation and discernment the endeavors of a certain party among us to disquiet the public mind among us with unfounded alarms to arraign every act of the administration to set the people at variance with their government and to embarrass all its measures equally useless would it be to predict what must be the inevitable consequences of such policy if it cannot be arrested     unfortunately and extremely do i regret it the state of virginia has taken the lead in this opposition i have said the state because the conduct of its legislature in the eyes of the world will authorize the expression because it is an incontrovertible fact that the principal leaders of the opposition dwell in it and because no doubt is entertained i believe that with the help of the chiefs in other states all the plans are arranged and systematically pursued by their followers in other parts of the union though in no state except kentucky that i have heard of has legislative countenance been obtained beyond virginia  it has been said that the great mass of the citizens of this state are wellaffected notwithstanding to the general government and the union and i am willing to believe it nay do believe it but how is this to be reconciled with their suffrages at the elections of representatives both to congress and their state legislature who are men opposed to the first and by the tendency of their measures would destroy the latter some among us have endeavored to account for this inconsistency and though convinced themselves of its truth they are unable to convince others who are unacquainted with the internal policy of the state one of the reasons assigned is that the most respectable and best qualified characters amongst us will not come forward easy and happy in their circumstances at home and believing themselves secure     in their liberties and property will not forsake their occupations and engage in the turmoil of public business or expose themselves to the calumnies of their opponents whose weapons are detraction but at such a crisis as this when every thing dear and valuable to us is assailed when this party hangs upon the wheels of government as a dead weight opposing every measure that is calculated for defence and selfpreservation abetting the nefarious views of another nation upon our rights preferring as long as they durst contend openly against the spirit and resentment of the people the interest of france to the welfare of their own country justifying the first at the expense of the latter when every act of their own government is tortured by constructions they will not bear into attempts to trample and infringe upon the constitution with a view to introduce monarchy when the most unceasing and the purest exertions which were making to maintain a neutrality proclaimed by the executive approved unequivocally by congress by the state legislatures nay by the people themselves in various meetings and to preserve the country in peace are charged as a measure calculated to favor great britain at the expense of france and all those who had any agency in it are accused of being under the influence of the former and her pensioners when measures are systematically and pertinaciously pursued which must eventually dissolve the union or produce coercion i say when these things are become so obvious ought characters who are best able to rescue their country from the     pending evil to remain at home rather ought they not to come forward and by their talents and influence stand in the breach which such conduct has made on the peace and happiness of this country and oppose the widening of it vain will it be to look for peace and happiness or for the security of liberty or property if civil discord should ensue and what else can result from the policy of those among us who by all the measures in their power are driving matters to extremity if they cannot be counteracted effectually the views of men can only be known or guessed at by their words or actions can those of the leaders of opposition be mistaken then if judged by this rule that they are followed by numbers who are unacquainted with their designs and suspect as little the tendency of their principles i am fully persuaded but if their conduct is viewed with indifference if there is activity and misrepresentation on one side and supineness on the other their numbers accumulated by intriguing and discontented foreigners under proscription who were at war with their own governments and the greater part of them with all governments they will increase and nothing short of omniscience can foretell the consequences i come now my good sir to the object of my letter which is to express a hope and an earnest wish that you will come forward at the ensuing elections if not for congress which you may think would take you too long from home as a candidate for representative in the general assembly of this commonwealth   0 there are i have no doubt very many sensible men who oppose themselves to the torrent that carries away others who had rather swim with than stem it without an able pilot to conduct them but these are neither old in legislation nor well known in the community your weight of character and influence in the house of representatives would be a bulwark against such dangerous sentiments as are delivered there at present it would be a rallyingpoint for the timid and an attraction of the wavering in a word i conceive it of immense importance at this crisis that you should be there and i would fain hope that all minor considerations will be made to yield to the measure if i have erroneously supposed that your sentiments on these subjects are in unison with mine or if i have assumed a liberty which the occasion does not warrant i must conclude as i began with praying that my motives may be received as an apology and that my fear that the tranquillity of the union and of this state in particular is hastening to an awful crisis has extorted them from me with great and very sincere regard and respect i am dear sir your most obedient c  george washington  0th jany      mount vernon bryan fairfax to bryan lord fairfax mount vernon  0th jany      dear sir       when i presented my valedictory address to the people of the united states in september      i little thought that any event would occur in my day     that could again withdraw me from the retirement after which i had been so long panting—but we know little of ourselves and still less of the ways of providence—the injurious treatment this country had received from france in an open violation of the treaty between the two countries and the laws of nations—the insults  indignities with which all our overtures for an amicable adjustment of the disputes were treated—the increasing depredations on our commerce accompanied with outrage  threats if we did not comply with their demands leaving no hope of obtaining restitution for the past or preserving the little that remained or the country from invasion but by the adoption of vigorous measures for self defence having come fully to the view of the people their resentments have been roused and with one voice as it were have made a tender of their lives and fortunes to repel any attempts which may be made on the constitution or government of their country—in consequence of which and to be prepared for the dernier ressort if unhappily we shall be driven to it—troops are to be raised and the united states placed in a posture of defence—under these circumstances and it appearing to be the wish of my countrymen and the request of the governing powers that i should take charge of their armies i am embarked so far in the business as will appear by my letter to the president of the   th of july last—which as it has run through all the newspapers here and published in many of the foreign gazettes you probably may have seen and though still at home     where indeed i hope to remain under a persuasion that the french will discover the injustice and absurdity of their conduct—i hold myself in readiness to gird on the sword if the immergency shall require it notwithstanding the spirit of the people is so animated that party among us who have been uniform in their opposition to all the measures of government in short to every act either of executive or legislative authority which seemed to be calculated to defeat french usurpations and to lessen the influence of that nation in our country hang upon  clog its wheels as much as in them lye—and with a rancor  virulence which is scarcely to be conceived—torturing every act by unnatural construction into a design to violate the constitution—introduce monarchy— to establish an aristocracy—and what is more to be regretted the same spirit seems to have laid hold of the major part of the legislature of this state while all the other states in the union kentucky the child of virginia excepted are coming forward with the most unequivocal evidences of their approbation of the measures which have been adopted by both for self preservation— in what such a spirit and such proceedings will issue is beyond the reach of short sighted men to predict with any degree of certainty—i hope well—because i have always believed and trusted that that providence which has carried us through a long and painful war with one of the most powerful nations in europe will not suffer the discontented among ourselves to produce more than a temporary     interruption to the permanent peace and happiness of this rising empire—that they have been the cause of our present disquietudes and the means of stimulating by misrepresenting the sentiments of the mass of citizens of this country the directory of france to their unwarrantable acts—not from more real affection to the nation than others possess but to facilitate the design of subverting their own government—i have no more doubt than that i am now in the act of writing you this letter— it was at the request of the secretary of war my journey to philadelphia was undertaken to assist in the formation of the augmented force and to effect some other military arrangements and although your letter from york of the  th of september came to hand before i set out  was taken with me to be acknowledged from thence yet my time  attention was so much occupied with the business that carried me there that i never found leisure to do it— lady huntingdon as you may have been told was a correspondent of mine—and did me the honor to claim me as a relation but in what degree or by what connexion it came to pass she did not inform me nor did i ever trouble her ladyship with an enquiry—the favorable sentiments which others you say have been pleased to express respecting me cannot but be pleasing to a mind who always walked on a straight line  endeavored as far as human frailties  perhaps strong passions would enable him to discharge the relative duties to his maker  fellowmen without seeking any indirect or left handed attempts to acquire popularity—     our crops of wheat  indian corn last year except in places were extremely short—the drought of the autumn exceeded anything that has been recollected in so much that the mills were scarcely able to work before new years day—and the fly has again begun its ravages on the wheat in the counties above us—this calamity with the severity of the drought on the fall seeding has given a discouraging aspect to the ensuing crop of wintr grain— we have the pleasure frequently of seeing or hearing from mrs fairfax—and on wednesday last mrs washington  myself took a family dinner at mount eagle—and left all the family in good health  spirits in the afternoon—miss custis was at that time with her mother at hope park or she would have accompanied us on that visit—she is now returned  unites with mrs washington  myself in offering best wishes for your health  safe return—and with very great  sincere esteem  respect i remain dear sir your most obedient c p s finding that i could not comprise what i had to say in one sheet of paper i have rambled on until i have almost filled a second  george washington  0 january      mount vernon james washington to james washington mount vernon  0 january      sir through the goodness of mr adams the american minister at berlin i am indebted for the safe conveyance of your letter dated the   th of octr in     that city and through the same medium i have the honor to present this acknowledgment of it there can be but little doubt sir of our descending from the same stock as the branches of it proceeded from the same country at what time your ancestors left england is not mentioned mine came to america nearly one hundred and fifty years ago  the regular course of application for military appointments is to the president of the united states through the secretary of war but it would be deceptious not to apprize you beforehand that it does not accord with the policy of this government to bestow offices civil or military upon foreigners to the exclusion of our own citizens first because there is an animated zeal in the latter to serve their country and secondly because the former seldom content with the rank they sustain in the service of their own country look for higher appointments in this which when bestowed unless there is obvious cause to justify the measure is pregnant with discontent and therefore it is not often practised except in those branches of the military science which relate to engineering and gunnery for in those our military establishment is defective and men of known and acknowledged abilities with ample testimonials thereof would be certainly encouraged deeming it better to give this candid detail than to raise hopes that might prove fallacious is the best apology i can offer for my plain dealing     at the same time be pleased to accept the assurances of my being sir your most obedient c george washington    january      mount vernon david stuart to david stuart mount vernon    january      dear sir washington leaves this day on a visit to hope park which will afford you an opportunity to examine the progress he has made in the studies he was directed to pursue i can and i believe i do keep him in his room a certain portion of the twentyfour hours but it will be impossible for me to make him attend to his books if inclination on his part is wanting nor while i am out if he chooses to be so is it in my power to prevent it i will not say this is the case nor will i run the hazard of doing him injustice by saying he does not apply as he ought to what has been prescribed but no risk will be run and candor requires i should declare it as my opinion that he will not derive much benefit in any course which can be marked out for him at this place without an able preceptor always with him what is best to be done with him i know not my opinion always has been that the university in massachusetts would have been the most eligible seminary to have sent him to first because it is on a larger scale than any other and secondly because i believe that the habits of youth there whether from the discipline of the school or the greater attention of the     people generally to morals and a more regular course of life are less prone to dissipation and excess than they are at the colleges south of it it may be asked if this was my opinion why did i not send him there the answer is as short as to me it was weighty being the only male of his line and knowing although it would have been submitted to that it would have proved a heartrending stroke to have him at that distance i was disposed to try a nearer seminary of good repute which from some cause or combination of causes has not after the experiment of a year been found to answer the end that was contemplated whether to send him there now or indeed to any other public school is indeed problematical and to misspend his time at this place would be disgraceful to himself and to me if i were to propose to him to go to the university at cambridge in massachusetts he might as has been usual for him on like occasions say he would go wherever i chose to send him but if he should go contrary to his inclination and without a disposition to apply himself properly an expense without any benefit would result from the measure knowing how much i have been disappointed and my time disturbed by his conduct he would not i am sure make a candid disclosure of his sentiments to me on this or any other plan i might propose for the completion of his education for which reason i would pray that you or perhaps mrs stuart could succeed better than any one would draw from him a frank and explicit disclosure of what his own wishes and     views are for if they are absolutely fixed an attempt to counteract them by absolute control would be as idle as the endeavor to stop a rivulet that is constantly running its progress while mound upon mound is erected may be arrested but this must have an end and everything will be swept away by the torrent the more i think of his entering william and mary unless he could be placed in the bishops  family the more i am convinced of its inutility on many accounts which had better be the subject of oral communication than by letter i shall wish to hear from you on the subject of this letter i believe washington means well but has not resolution to act well our kind regards to mrs stuart and family and i am my dear sir c george washington    january      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private mount vernon    january      my dear sir the enclosed letter for mr mcalpin my tayler in philadelphia left open for your perusal may be delivered or not as you shall judge best and if the former takes place to be accompanied with your sentiments on the doubtful parts of it it is predicated first on the supposition that the uniform for the different grades of officers is conclusively     fixed  to be established as a standing regulation and secondly on the presumption that no attempts will be made this session of congress to repeal the law for augmenting the army of the united states or to reduce it below its present establishment if the former is liable to no change and there is no indication of an attempt to effect the latter i would go to the expense of providing a uniform previously to the spur of the occasion in conformity with the regulations ordered by the war department agreeably to the presidents command on the other hand if either of the above things is likely to happen i shall suspend doing it on reconsidering the uniform for the commanderinchief it has become a matter of doubt with me although as it respects myself personally i was against all embroidery whether embroidery on the cape cuffs and pockets of the coat and none on the buff waistcoat would not have a disjointed and awkward appearance it is neither required nor forbidden which then in your judgment or that of connoisseurs if you should confer with any on the subject would be most agreeable in itself and accordant to what is expected to you i submit the matter as i also do whether the coat shall have slash cuffs with blue flaps passing through them and slash pockets or both shall be in the usual manner these apparently are trifling matters to trouble you with but as it is the commencement of a new scene it is desirable that the thing should take a right direction i have therefore upon the whole and since i   0 began this letter determined to direct mr mcalpin to apply to and follow your directions in making the uniform i should not prefer a heavy embroidery or one containing much work a light and neat one would in my opinion be more elegant and more desirable as well for the coat as the waistcoat if the latter is to receive any if there are workers in this way in philadelphia and the french are most likely to understand it they will no doubt have a variety of patterns to choose from and i pray you to examine them the eagle too having become part of the american cockade have any of them been brought into use yet my idea of the size is that it ought not to be larger than would cover a quarter of a dollar at most and should be represented for the officers as clothed with feathers this any ingenious silversmith can execute and if four were sent to me i would thank you and would remit the cost as soon as known to me i must further beg that proper stars for the epaulets the latter i possess may be sent to me with the other articles that i may be equipped in dress at least and if there are any handsome cockades but not whimsically foolish in wear or any one who can make them i should be glad if they were sent with the eagles fixed thereon ready to be placed in the hats does the presidt and yourself wear them excuse this scrawl and trouble as i wish to set out right and be assured of the sincere esteem  regard of dear sir your affectionate     george washington  0 february      mount vernon timothy pickering to timothy pickering mount vernon  0 february      dear sir your two letters of the   th of the last and  d of the present month have been duly received for which and their enclosures i thank you i am not surprised that some members of the house of representatives should disrelish your report it contains remarks and speaks truths which they are desirous should be unknown to the people i wish the parts which were left out had been retained the crisis in my opinion calls loudly for plain dealing that the citizens at large may be well informed and decide with respect to public measures upon a thorough knowledge of facts concealment is a species of misinformation and misrepresentation and false alarms found the ground work of opposition—the plan of which is to keep the people as much as possible in ignorance and terror for it is believed by themselves that a perfect understanding of our real situation in regard to our foreign relations would be a death blow to their consequence and struggles and for that reason have always something on foot to disquiet the public mind      i am sorry to see mr gerry is pursuing a mischievous path that he was led astray by his own vanity and selfimportance and was the dupe of diplomatic skill i never had a doubt but these doubts were accompanied by faint hopes faint indeed they were that he possessed candor fortitude and manliness enough to have come forward with an open declaration that he had been practised upon and was deceived but mr gerrys mind is not enlarged enough for such conduct as this especially assailed as i presume it was on his arrival by those whose labors are unceasing to inculcate their doctrines of hostility against the proceedings of their own government the session of congress is fast drawing to a close what traits it will leave behind of strong and energetic measures remain to be seen—such i hope as will show that we are ready at all times to negotiate upon fair and honorable terms but never to be bullied into them with very great esteem c george washington    february      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton major general private mount vernon    february      my dear sir your private letter of the   th instant came duly to hand and safe and i wish you at all times and upon all occasions to communicate interesting occurrences with your opinions thereon in the manner you have designated with the utmost unreservedness to me     if the augmented force was not intended as an in terrorem measure the delay in recruiting it is unaccountable and baffles all conjecture on reasonable grounds the zeal and enthusiasm which were excited by the publication of the despatches from our commissioners at paris which gave birth to the law authorizing the raising of twelve regiments etc are evaporated it is now no more and if this dull season when men are idle from want of employment and from that cause might be induced to enlist is suffered to pass away also we shall by and by when the business of agriculture and other avocations call for the labor of them set out as a forlorn hope to execute this business  had the formation of the army followed closely the passage of this act and recruiting orders had tread on the heels of that the men who might have been raised at that time would for their numbers have been equal to any in the world inasmuch as the most reputable yeomanry of the country were ready to have     stepped forward with alacity now the measure is not only viewed with indifference but deemed unnecessary by that class of people whose attentions being turned to other matters the officers who in august and september could with ease have enlisted whole companies of them will find it difficult to recruit any and if this idle and frolicksome season is spent in inactivity none but the riffraff of the country and the scapegallowses of the large cities will be to be had far removed from the scene i might ascribe these delays to wrong causes and therefore will hazard no opinion respecting them but i have no hesitation in pronouncing that unless a material change takes place our military theatre affords but a gloomy prospect to those who are to perform the principal parts in the drama sincerely and affectionately i am yours c george washington   march      mount vernon timothy pickering to timothy pickering secretary of state confidential mount vernon   march      dear sir the unexpectedness of the event communicated in your letter of the   st ultimo did as you may suppose surprise me not a little but far very far indeed was this surprise short of what i experienced the next day when by a very intelligent gentm immediately from philadelphia i was informed that there had been no direct overture from the government of france to that of the united states for a negotiation on the contrary     that m talleyrand was playing the same loose and roundabout game he had attempted the year before with our envoys and which as in that case might mean any thing or nothing as would subserve his purposes best had we approached the antechamber of this gentleman when he opened the door to us and there waited for a formal invitation into the interior the governments would have met upon equal ground and we might have advanced or receded according to circumstances with commitment in plainer words had we said to m talleyrand through the channel of his communication we still are as we always have been ready to settle by fair negotiation all differences between the two nations upon open just and honorable terms and it rests with the directory after the indignities with which our attempts to affect this have been treated if they are equally sincere to come forward in an unequivocal manner and prove it by their acts such conduct would have shewn a dignified willingness on our part to negotiate and would have tested their sincerity on the other under my present view of the subject this would have been the course i should have pursued keeping equally in view the horrors of war and the dignity of the government but not being acquainted with all the information and the motives which induced the measure i may have taken a wrong impression and therefore shall say nothing further on the subject at this time with sincere esteem and regard i am dear sir c     george washington   march      mount vernon john adams to john adams president of the united states mount vernon   march      dear sir i have been duly honored with your favor of the   th ultimo mentioning the nomination of mr murray to be minister plenipotentiary to the french republic  with the writer of the letter which i did myself the honor to inclose in my last to you i truly observed     that i had never held any correspondence and i only knew him in his public mission from this country to the barbary states the functions of which he discharged at that time with ability and propriety i have indeed lately heard of a letter that has been published which he wrote to mr baldwin filled with abuse of this government and its administration but i have never met with it in any of the papers wch i take as you have had more opportunities of knowing this mans character than have fallen to me i have no doubt but you have formed a just estimate of him and as i had no other desire than to be useful in transmitting any sentiments you might wish to convey i shall impressed with your observations take no notice of his letter i sincerely pray that in the discharge of these arduous and important duties committed to you your health may be unimpaired and that you may long live to enjoy these blessings which must flow to our country if we should be so happy as to pass this critical period in an honorable and dignified manner without being involved in the horrors and calamities of war mrs washington and mrs lewis late miss custis thank you for your kind remembrance of them and offer their best respects to you at the same time that they unite with me in every good wish for the perfect restoration of health to mrs adams with sentiments of very great respect i have the honor to be c     george washington   th march      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon   th march      my dear sir you will not only consider this letter as a private one but as a friendly one from g w to j m and if the sentiments which you will find in it are delivered with more freedom and candour than are agreeable say so not by implication only but in explicit language and i will promise to offend no more by such conduct but confine myself if occasion should require it to an official correspondence thus premising let me in the name and behalf of the officers who have been appointed and of the army intended to be raised ask what keeps back the commissions and arrests the recruiting service be assured that both among the friends of government excite astonishment and discontent blame is in every mind but it is not known where to fix it some attach it to the p some to the s of w and some fertile in invention seek for other causes many of the appointed officers have quitted their former occupations that they might be in perfect readiness to proceed in their military duties the moment they should receive their commissions and recruiting instructions others who were about to enter into business and plans of future life stand suspended many are highly disgusted some talk of giving up the idea of becoming officers unable to remain longer in the awkward situation they are involved in and all are complaining applications are made by numbers to me to know what the cause     of the delay is what they are to expect and what they ought to do what could i say am i not kept in as much ignorance as they are themselves am i advised of any new appointments any changes which have taken place any of the views or designs of government relatively to the army it is not unreasonable to suppose that if there be reasons of state operating the policy of these delays that i was entitled to sufficient confidence to be let into the secret or if they proceeded from uncontrolable causes i still more than the public ought not to have been left in the field of conjecture without a guide to direct me to a knowledge of them for i shall frankly declare that i do not nor ever shall consider myself in the light of a mercenary officer nothing short of a high sense of the amor patriæ could have placed me in my present situation and though i stand bound and will obey the call of my country whenever it is made agreeably to my letter of acceptance none will regret the event with more poignancy none will forsake the walks of retirement with more heartfelt sorrow none can leave them with more real inconvenience to their private concerns than i shall do a sixteen years absence from home with short intervals only could not fail to derange them considerably  to require all the time i can spare from the usual avocations of life to bring them into tune again but this is not all nor the worst for being the executor the administrator  trustee for other estates my greatest anxiety is to leave all these concerns in such a   0 clear and distinct form that no reproach may attach itself to me when i shall have taken my departure for the land of spirits i have been thus full as it regards myself in order to shew you that information in all matters of a military nature are necessary for my government thereby having a prospective view of things i may prepare accordingly and not though detached from the army until the exigencies of our affairs may require my presence with it appear like a person just dropped from the clouds when i take the command ignorant of preceding occurrences nor will it without doing great violence to the concerns of others equally with my own be in my power to take up my bed  walk at any unexpected requirement nor without great exertions which it may not be in my power to make on a sudden call unless previously hastened which would be unnecessary and unless i could discern beforehand the utility of the measure by the gradual unfolding of the prospect before us i shall now with your permission make a few observations as they respect the recruiting service had the organization of the augmented corps and consequent instructions for raising it tread as close on the passage of the law as the nature of the case would have permitted a finer army for the size of it with the discipline it might have received the world had never seen but the golden opportunity is passed  probably will never occur again the zeal enthusiasm and indeed resentment which warmed the breasts of the american youth and would have     induced the sons of the respectable yeomanry in all parts of the united states to enlist as noncommissioned officers  privates are now no more they are evaporated  a listlessness has supplied their place the next most favorable opportunity namely the idle  dreary scenes of winter which bring on dissipation  want from the cessation of labor has also passed away the enlivening prospect of spring the calls of the husbandman indeed of every avocation for laborers in the approaching busy season hath supplanted all thoughts of becoming soldiers and now many young gentlemen who had conditionally last summer  autumn engaged their companies will find it difficult to enlist a single man of those so engaged the latter pretending that having waited a considerable time to see if their services would be wanted in the field and no overtures for them made it became necessary for them to seek some other employment what is the natural consequence of all this why that we must take the rifraf of the populous cities convicts  foreigners or have officers without men but even this is not the worst of it the augmented corps if i have conceived the matter rightly must have been intended as a wellorganized and welldisciplined body of men for others in case of need to resort to and take example from will this be the case if the enemy shall invade this country far from it what better in the first instance are regiments so composed than militia and what prospect have those who command them of rendering service     to their country or doing honor to themselves in the field opposed to veteran troops practiced in tactics and unaccustomed to defeat these my dear mchenry are serious considerations to a man who has nothing to gain and is putting every thing to hazard when i began this letter i intended to stop here but as i may not again write to you with the freedom i now do i shall make a few remarks on some other transactions which have not struck me in the most favorable point of view  the two majorgenerals and myself were called to philadelphia in november last and there detained five weeks very inconveniently to all of us at an inclement season in wading through volumes of applications  recommendations for military appointments and i will venture to say that it was executed with as much assiduity and under as little influence of favor or prejudice as a work of that sort from the materials which were laid before us ever was accomplished and what has followed why any member of congress who had a friend to serve or a prejudice to endulge could set them at nought out of a number i will select one instance only in proof of this it is a striking one the case of gibbes i allude to he was personally known to you general hamilton  myself in his former services he served through the whole revolutionary war from the assembling of the first troops at cambridge to the closing of the military drama at the     conclusion of peace without reproach and in the last act of it if i mistake not was a major in the selected corps of light infantry he was strongly recommended by generals lincoln knox brooks  jackson all on the same theatre with himself and who ought to be perfectly acquainted with his respectability  pretensions yet the vote of a member of congress i presume was more respected  sufficient to set him aside— another thing i will remark on because if the practice is continued you will find that serious discontents  evils will result from it i find by the gazettes i have no other information of these matters that lieutt mercer of the light dragoons is promoted to the rank of captn in that corps in the arrangement of officers where every attention was paid that personal knowledge or information could reach to merit age respectability  standing in the community he was not even placed if my memory serves me high up among the lieutenants what then will those lieutenants who are his seniors in that arrangement greatly his seniors in age of at least as much respectability better known and of equal merit think of having him placed over them mercer compared to them is a boy and in such an army as it was our wish to form it will have an odd appearance to place a young man of  0 or    years of age over a lieutent of  0 in every other respect his equal i do not mean to derogate from the merits or deserts of this young gentleman on the contrary i wish to     see them properly rewarded although his whole family are bitter in their enmity to the general government nor would i be understood to mean that if a captain and so of any other grade declines his appointment that during the act of formation the vacancy is necessarily to be filled by the next in seniority necessarily so far from this i maintain that when a vacancy is occasioned by nonacceptance that it may without injustice be filled by a new character as in the first instance but it is my opinion at the same time that if you have recourse to promotion the arrangement which was made by the board of general officers in all its parts who had regard to all the combinations and qualifications that have been enumerated in settling the relative rank is the safest guide you could have resorted to it is not my intention to dispute the powers of the president to make this or any other promotion which his inclination or the solicitation of others may prompt him to but i will add without fear of contradiction by any one acquainted with the usages  prescriptive rights of armies that if he wishes to preserve the peace and harmony of ours rules must be observed and the feelings of the officers attended to in promotions these observations relatively to the promotion of lieutenant mercer are not the result of any discontent i have heard expressed on the occasion for except those who take the philadelphia gazette but a few of the officers may be acquainted therewith and of those few i have seen none since its annunciation to the     public it is on general grounds they are made  by judging of the feeling of others by what would be my own in a similar case for i do not think it will be a very reconcilable matter to gentlemen of more respectable ages better known in the walks of life and much more likely to recruit men to have a young man fresh from college placed over their heads as vacancies have happened in the cavalry by nonacceptances c and promotions have begun may i ask if there would be any impropriety in letting mr custis step from a cornetcy into the rank of lieutenant if i mistake not in the arrangement given in he stands the first for promotion that is he was made the senior cornet the majorgenerals were desirous of placing him as lieutenant in the first instance but his age considered i thought it more eligable that he should enter into the lowest grade of commissioned officers if ample fortune good education more than common abilities and good disposition free from vice of any kind give him a title in the   th year of his age his pretensions thereto though not to the injury of others are good but it is not my desire to ask this as a favor i never have and never shall solicit any thing for myself or connexions i mean nothing more than the statement of facts in order to bring his situation to view there is one matter more which i was in doubt whether to mention to you or not because it is of a more delicate nature than any i have touched upon but finally friendship have got the better of my scruples it respects yourself personally you will recollect     i dare say that more than once i expressed to you my opinion of the expediency of committing the details of the department to the exertion of others and to bestow your thoughts and attention on the more important duties of it which in the scenes we were contemplating were alone sufficient to occupy the time and all the consideration of the secretary i i went no further then nor should i have renewed the subject now had not the delay in issuing the commissions and commencing the recruiting service excited great reprobation and blame though as i have observed before no one knows where with precision to fix it generally however it is attributed to the want of system  exertion in the department of war to apprize you of this is my motive for this communication i prefaced the sentiments of this letter with a request that they might be considered as proceeding from a private man to his friend no one would be struck more forcibly than myself with the impropriety of such a letter from the commanderinchief of the army of the u states to the secretary of war if they are received in good part the end is obtained if otherwise my motives and the purity of my intentions are the best apology i can offer for the liberty i have taken in either case however be assured of this truth that with very great esteem and regard i remain my dear sir c      george washington    march      mount vernon charles c pinckney to charles c pinckney majorgeneral mount vernon    march      my dear sir your favor of the  th inst from charleston has been duly received and it gave us the pleasure of hearing that you mrs p and miss pinckney had arrived in good health at that place the first few days of january excepted you could not have been more favored in the weather than all the remainder of that month and until the middle of feby afforded although your report of the arrangement for south carolina and georgia your reconnoitre of the seaboard to st marys and visit of the posts on the indian frontier of the latter state will be made to the department of war i should be glad nevertheless to know the result of them for although i do not mean to act in the present state of our military concerns yet it is my wish to be regularly informed of the real situation of them that i may not have every thing to learn if the exigencies of our affairs should require my attendance in the field to have been informed of the arrangements made by you with general now governor davie would have been satisfactory also     i am disposed to believe from circumstances which had just got to my knowledge before i left the helm of government that the garrisons on the frontier of georgia required a strict inspection not only for the purpose of restoring due subordination but for the correction of other misdemeanors in the officers your determination therefore to look closely into these matters and to establish strict discipline is highly proper and will certainly be supported an army cannot be governed without and no mistake in him who commands it is greater or more fatal to its existence and the welfare of its country than lax discipline nor is it the right road to true and permanent popularity civility is due to but obedience is required from all its members these accompanied with strict justice and a proper attention to army rights and wants will secure love and respect while one indulgence begets an application for another and another until order is lost in disorder and contempt of him brings up the rear i shall be very glad to see brigadiergeneral washington on his route to princeton but he will find but little to do in the military line in this state to what cause to attribute the delay i know not but the fact is that not an officer that i have heard of has received his commission nor one who has had any orders to recruit the enthusiasm of last summer and autumn was suffered to evaporate for want of these the dreary months of winter which for want of employment of that class of men who usually become soldiers bring on idleness and dissipation is     now succeeded by the opening of spring when laborers are in demand by the husbandmen and other avocations and has passed away also in a word all is a mystery to me i have very little more knowledge of the captains in the virginia line as arranged by us at philadelphia than what was derived from the source of information then laid before us i have no hesitation however in mentioning the name of a gentleman conditionally to whom under my present view of them i should give a decided preference it is presley thornton son of one of the most respectable gentlemen now deceased of the same name in this state he is thirty or thereabouts amiable in his character he was a british officer during our revolution but would not fight against his country and therefore went to gibraltar and was in garrison there during its siege by the spaniards where it is said he distinguished himself by his gallant behavior the condition i alluded to and which i annex to this recommendation is that if i shd want him myself and circumstances in the combinations i should have to make in the choice of my own aidsdecamp should not be opposed to it that you may not take amiss my calling him into my military suite i have never given him the most distant hint of such an intention nor would i have him know that it ever was in contemplation especially as it is an event that may never happen indeed i mean to be under no engagement to any of my established aids until i am about to enter on my military duties   0 mrs washington is much obliged to mrs pinckney for the mellon seeds—as i am to you for your attention to the paines and with mrs lewis that now is c best wishes to you mrs pinckney  family  to enquiring frds i am always your sincere and affectionate c p s—mr lewis  nelly custis fulfilled their matrimonial engagement on the   nd of february in consequence the former havg relinquished the lapp of mars for the sports of venus has declined a military appointmt george washington   april      mount vernon james welch to james welch mount vernon   april      sir i have received your letters of the  0th of march from rockingham county and although i have no expectation of deriving any payment from your kentucky expedition yet i will inconvenient as it is to me wait a while longer to know the result of it desiring you to be persuaded in the mean time that you have not got a person now that will be trifled with in your dealings it would be uncandid mr welch not to inform you that i have heard too much of your character lately not to expect tale after tale and relation after relation of your numerous disappointments by way of excuses for the non compliance of your agreement with me—but this i can assure you will not answer your purposes     it is not difficult for a person who has no ground on which to expect a thousand cents to talk with facility and ease of his expectation of receiving ten times as many dollars—the relation of disappointments in which according to his account he conceives is quite sufficient to ward off the payment of his own solemn contracts and to satisfy his creditors i am not unacquainted sir with your repeated declarations of your having purchased my lands on the great kanahwa and endeavoring by that means and such like impositions and misrepresentations to abtain extensive credit where you were not known—letters to enquire into the truth of these things have been written to me on the subject be cautious therefore how you provoke explanations that must inevitably end in your disgrace and entire loss of character—a character is valuable to all men and not less so to a speculator i will before i conclude assure you in the most unequivocal terms of two things first that i am in extreme want of the money which you gave me a solemn promise i should receive the first of january last and secondly—that however you may have succeeded in imposing upon and deceiving others you shall not practice the like game with me with impunity to contract new debts is not the way to pay old ones—nor is it a proof that you have any disposition to do it when you are proposing to buy lands c c on credit or partial advances which can answer no other purpose than that of speculation—or if you     have them of withholding the means which ought to be applied in the discharge of engagements  debts proceeding therefrom which you are bound by every tie to do consider this letter well—and then write without any deception to sir george washington   d april      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private mount vernon   d april      my dear sir six days do i labor or in other words take exercise and devote my time to various occupations in husbandry and about my mansion on the seventh now called the first day for want of a place of worship within less than nine miles such letters as do not require immediate acknowledgment i give answers to mr lear being sick and absent but it hath so happened that on the two last sundays—call them the first or seventh day as you please i have been unable to perform the latter duty on account of visits from strangers with whom i could not use the freedom to leave alone or recommend to the care of each other for their amusement this short history of the manner in which i employ my time is given by way of an apology for suffering your letters of the  0th    st ulto to remain so long unanswered—acknowledged they were—and two points which related most immediately to yourself personally were dwelt upon in my last were it not     for this i should have appropriated sooner one of the six days i am now about to borrow for the following communications i have perused with attention your instructions to general hamilton and can readily conceive from the purport of them what the tenor of those are which you have issued to general pinckney these instructions appear to me to be well digested and are appropriate to the ends contemplated i once thought it being more regular that the old troops under the command of general wilkinson had better have remained subordinate to the orders of gen hamilton to whom through the department of war for the reasons alleged in the instructions all reports and returns ought to be made but on more mature consideration of the multiplied extensive and checkered position of those troops i am disposed to believe that your plan is preferable in my last i gave what i conceived to be the reason why you were uninformed of the intentions of so many of the appointed officers and took the liberty of suggesting a mode by which their acceptance or refusal might speedily be ascertained this suggestion and your circular which now appears in all the gazettes renders it unnecessary for me to say anything more on that head and if the obstacles which were opposed to the preparatory measures for recruiting were such as not to be overcome like many other things most desirable but unattainable we may regret the loss though we submit to the disappointment     until your circular appeared i do not believe that it was the expectation of the newly appointed officers who had not received their commissions that they were to draw pay from the date of their acceptances and to this uncertainty after having thrown themselves out of other business was their discontents to be ascribed your circular communication and a just arrangement of rank hereafter will no doubt put all matters to rights but if these officers are not speedily employed in the recruiting service a clamor will soon arise in another quarter for it will be asked why are they in actual pay  unemployed care will be taken i presume in settling relative rank not to be governed by the date of the acceptances for that would give to the officers of those states who are most contiguous to the seat of government advantages which would be as unjust as they are great  i do not recollect with precision the circumstances you allude to as having taken place in the year          under the auspices of one of your predecessors but however anxious officers are to be possessed of their commissions i have no hesitation in declaring it as my opinion that i see no cause they would have to complain of their being withheld for the reasons you have mentioned when the matter is explained to them  they are in receipt of emoluments with respect to connecticut and the states south of virginia i was at no loss to account for the delays which had taken place in them not only as it respected the recruiting service but as it related to the appointment of the officers also general hamilton having communicated to me his arrangement of the state of virginia into districts  subdivisions with the places of rendezvous in each i have suggested a few un important alterations in the subdistricts with which i am best acquainted in the revised printed instructions for recruiting which you have been pleased to send to me there are several blanks which i presume will be filled up before they are finally issued these are to be found in the  d  th    th articles the quotation of the answer given to your representation respecting the suspension of the arrangement and consequent delay in recruiting betrays a manifest want of knowledge of the subject there is a tide it is said in all things and there was a combination of circumstances at the passing of the act among which resentment was not the least which produced an uncommon enthusiasm  which until it began to slacken  ebb might have been improved     to great advantage but taking the matter up upon the principle of the answer could there have been a stronger reason assigned agt delay than the difficulty of obtaining men  if the enumerated obstacles were such as would retard the recruiting service it ought to have commenced with redoubled ardor the voice of the people as expressed by their representatives adjudged this force necessary the law was positive where then lay a power to dispense with or suspend it i will go no farther however on this point perhaps i have gone too far already but as you have not only authorized but requested that i would communicate my sentiments to you with freedom and candor i could not restrain this effusion while i acknowledge  have declared upon all proper occasions that you were not responsible for the delay in organizing the army as you have been informed in my last letter in the case of major gibbs i shall make but two short remarks  st that it was not from any predilection     for the man that he was brought forward by the board of gen officers and  d that i should have thought that the testimony of generals lincoln knox brooks jackson  others added to the weight of that board would be a counterpoise to the objectioners unless something injurious to his character was adduced but with respect to young mercers promotion i cannot but express my regrets notwithstanding the high opinion i have of his merit and the sincere regard i entertained for his deceased father this promotion you may rely on it is radically wrong  will be felt sorely  although no one is less disposed than i am to call in question the right of the president to make appointments with the participation of the senate yet i must be permitted to add that if there is not a good deal of circumspection observed in the exercise of it as it respects the regulation of the army he will find it much easier to plunge into than to extricate himself from embarassments occasioned by injudicious arrangements of this i can speak from the experience i have had in the arrangement of mr mercer at philadelphia his comparative pretensions were duly considered  a lieutenancy was considered a handsome appointment for him many applications for captaincies of dragoons from meritorious characters who had had commands in the horse on the western expedition in      could not from the smallness of that corps be accommodated  on that acct only were turned     over to the infantry among these a capt thos turner highly spoken of as a horse officer  a very respectable character is numbered how then must this gentleman how must captn randolph so highly recommended by genl morgan for past services how must others who served through a winters campaign on that occasion with éclat and how must the senior lieutenants of equal pretensions with those of mr mercer feel on the appointment of a student just from college in preference to them the question is easily answered but as there is no remedy for it now my only motive for dwelling on the case is to shew you how necessary precaution is in your military movements  to prove moreover that after five weeks diligent application of the three first officers of your army their work ought not to be battered down by sinester or local considerations unless impeachments or discoveries unknown while they were about it are of sufficient weight to affect this measure      having now gone through all the points of your last letter i have only to declare that the observations i have made on the several parts of them and the opinions delivered thereon proceed from the purest motives and from an earnest desire that the military system may be well composed may harmonize in all its parts may perfectly answer the end of its institution and that the president  secretary of war may find no difficulty but be quite easy and happy in their government of it as it respects myself i have no object separated from the general welfare to promote i have no predilections no prejudices to gratify no friends whose interests or views   0 i wish to advance at the expence of propriety and i may add in the sincerity of my heart there is no wish of it equal to that of there being no exigency in our affrs which may call me from retirement to take the direction of our forces with sincere esteem  regard i am my dear sir in the hands of an english gentleman lately at this place i have seen a map of the united states on a large scale edited by a arrowsmith london it is very necessary the commanderinchief should be possessed of such an one if the public will not furnish it in a travelling case i would wish to have one sent me at my own expense if to be procured in philadelphia george washington   may      mount vernon john marshall to john marshall mount vernon   may      dear sir with infinite pleasure i received the news of your election  for the honor of the district i wish the majority had been greater but let us be content and hope as the tide is turning the current will soon run strong in your favor i am sorry to find that the publication you allude to should have given you a moments disquietude i can assure you it made no impression on my mind of the tendency apprehended by you      the doubt you have expressed of mr hancocks election is as unexpected as it is painful in these parts we had set it down as certain and our calculations went to eleven instead of nine a few days now will give us the result of all the elections to congress and the legislature of the state and as you are at the fountain of information respecting the politics of the members give me i pray you the amount of the parties on each side if you have leisure and can ascertain it  with very sincere esteem and regard i am dear sir c     george washington    june      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton majorgeneral mount vernon    june      dear sir your favor of the  th instant with its enclosures has been duly received i am very glad to learn that the recruiting business so far as it has been put in operation succeeds agreeably to your wishes it has commenced in virginia and i am informed that in this vicinity i have no intelligence from the more distant parts of the state its progress is very flattering a supply of clothing would however promote this service even hereabouts and unless it is furnished soon i am apprehensive it will languish if not stop entirely i understand by a letter which i received a few days since from general pinckney that the selection of officers from n and s carolina and georgia has been transmitted to the war office i hope on every account there will be no delay in completing this arrangement the disposition which you have made of the artillery regiment is i have no doubt just and proper and calculated to promote the good of the service i thank you for the information from mr king i have long believed that france owes the facilities of her conquests more to the jealousy and want of cordial coöperation among the powers of europe whose interest it is to check her desolating ravages than to any exertions of her own great as they have been it appears from every account although there is none so full and distinct as i could wish that her     armies have not only been checked but obliged to retreat and her internal affairs do not seem to be in the best situation should these advantages be properly improved i think the happiest effects may result from them with very sincere regard i am dear sir c  george washington    june      mount vernon archibald blair to archibald blair  mount vernon    june      sir your favor of the   th inst enclosing the copy of a letter from our deceased friend patrick henry esqr  to you dated the  th of jany last came duly to hand for this instance of your polite attention to me i pray you to accept my thanks and an assurance that the letter shall find a distinguished place in my beaureau of public papers  at any time i should have recd the account of this gentlemans death with sorrow in the present crisis of our public affairs i have heard it with deep regret     but the ways of providence are inscrutable and not to be scanned by shortsighted man whose duty is submission without repining at its decrees i had often heard of the political sentimts expressed in mr henrys letter to you and as often a wish that they were promulgated through the medium of the gazettes the propriety or inexpediency of which measure none can decide more correctly than yourself but after what you have written to me i feel an incumbency to inform you that another copy of that letter has been either surreptitiously obtained or fabricated and more than probably is now in the press for i was informed on the day preceding my receipt of your letter that one was in the hands of a gentleman in this county fairfax and that he had been asked to and it was supposed would have it printed my breast never harbored a suspicion that mr henry was unfriendly to me although i had reason to believe that the same spirit which was at work to destroy all confidence in the public functionaries was not less busy in poisoning private fountains and sowing the seeds of distrust amg men of the same political sentiments mr henry had given me the most unequivocal proof whilst i had the honor to command the troops of the united states in their revolutionary struggle that he was not to be worked upon by intriguers and not conscious that i had furnished any cause for it i could not suppose that without a cause he had become my enemy since this proof contained in the letter to wch you allude     is deposited among my files for want of a proper receptacle for them which i mean to erect they are yet in packages when i shall be able to open them with convenience i will furnish you with a copy of what passed between mr henry and myself in consequence of the attempt which was made by a party in congress to supplant me in that command since you think they are not to be found among his papers and wish to be possessed of them your letter to me sir required no apology but has a just claim to the thanks and gratitude of one who has the honor to be your most obedient obliged humble servant george washington    june      mount vernon john trumbull to john trumbull mount vernon    june      dear sir your favor of the   th of september last with the small box containing four pair of prints came safe to hand but long after the date of the letter immediately upon the receipt of these having forgot the terms of the subscription and not knowing as you were absent to whom the money was to be paid i wrote to governor trumbull for information on this head without obtaining further satisfaction than that he thought it probable mr anthony of philadelphia was authorized by you to receive the amount in consequence i addressed this gentleman who being absent from that city—as is said by way of apology for the delay in answering my letter in a reasonable     time and shall immediately pay what is due from me thereon i give you the trouble of this detail because i should feel unpleasant myself if after your marked politeness and attentions to me in this as in every other transaction any tardiness should have appeared on my part in return for prints so valuable the two vols put into your hands by mr west for transmission to me are the production of a mr uvedale price on the picturesque accompanied by a very polite letter of which the enclosed is an acknowledgement to that gentleman recommended to your care with my best respects to mr west  i was on the point of closing this letter with my thanks for the favorable sentiments you have been pleased to express for me and adding mrs washingtons complimts and best wishes thereto when the mail from philadelphia brought me your interesting letter of the   th of march for the political information contained in it i feel grateful as i always shall for the free and unreserved communication of your sentiments upon subjects so important in their nature and tendency no wellinformed and unprejudiced man who has viewed with attention the conduct of the french government since the revolution in that country can mistake its     objects or the tendency of the ambitious plans it is pursuing yet strange as it may seem a party and a powerful one too among us affect to believe that the measures of it are dictated by a principal of selfpreservation that the outrages of which the directory are guilty proceeds from dire necessity that it wishes to be upon the most friendly and agreeable terms with the president of the united states that it will be the fault of the latter if this is not the case that the defensive measures which this country have adopted are not only unnecessary and expensive but have a tendency to produce the evil which to deprecate is mere pretence because war with france they say is the wish of this government that on the militia we should rest our security and that it is time enough to call upon these when the danger is imminent c c c with these and such like ideas attempted to be inculcated upon the public mind and prejudices not yet eradicated with all the arts of sophistry and no regard to truth or respect to characters public or private who happen to differ from themselves in politics i leave you to decide on the probability of carrying such extensive plans of defence as you have suggested in your last letter into operation and in the short period you suppose may be allowed to accomplish it in the public mind has changed and is yet changing every day with respect to french principles the people begin to see clearly that the words and actions of the governing powers of that nation cannot be reconciled     and that hitherto they have been misled by words in a word that while they were pursuing the shadow they lost the substance the late changes in the congressional representation sufficiently evince this opinion for of the two sent from the state of georgia one certain some say both are federal characters of six from south carolina five are decidedly so of ten from north carolina seven may be counted upon and of nineteen from this state virginia eight are certain a ninth doubtful and but for some egregious mismanagement eleven supporters of governmental measures would have been elected i mention these facts merely to shew that we are progressing to a better state of things not that we are quite right yet time i hope will shew us the necessity or at least the propriety of becoming so god grant it and soon it is unfortunate when men cannot or will not see danger at a distance or seeing it are undetermined in the means which are necessary to avert or keep it afar off i question whether the evil arising from the french getting possession of louisiana and the floridas would be generally seen until it is felt and yet no problem in euclid is more evident or susceptible of clearer demonstration not less difficult is it to make them believe that offensive operations oftentimes are the surest if not in some cases the only means of defence mrs washington is grateful for your kind remembrance of her and with mrs lewiss formerly your     old acquaintance nelly custis compliments and good wishes united i am with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and regard dear sir c george washington    july      mount vernon jonathan trumbull to governor jonathan trumbull mount vernon    july      my dear sir your favor of the   d ultimo got to my hands yesterday only it came safe and without any apparent marks or violence but whence the length of its passage i am unable to inform you to you and to your brother colonel john trumbull i feel much indebted for the full frank and interesting communication of the political sentiments contained in both your letters the project of the latter is vast—and under any circumstances would require very mature consideration but in its extent and an eye being had to the disorganizing party in the united states i am sure it would be impracticable in the present order of things not being able to convey my ideas to you on this subject in more concise terms than i have already done to your brother in answer to the letter he informs you he had written to me i shall take the liberty of giving you an extract thereof as follows— for the political information contained in it that is his letter i feel grateful as i always shall for the free unreserved communication of your sentiments upon subjects so important in their nature and tendency no wellinformed and unprejudiced man who   0 has viewed with attention the conduct of the french government since the revolution in that country can mistake its objects or the tendency of its ambitious projects it is pursuing yet strange as it may seem a party and a powerful one too among us affect to believe that the measures of it are dictated by a principle of selfpreservation that the outrages of which the directory are guilty proceed from dire necessity that it wishes to be upon the most friendly and amicable terms with the united states that it will be the fault of the latter if this is not the case that the defensive measures which this country has adopted are not only unnecessary but expensive but have a tendency to produce the evil which to deprecate is mere pretence in the government because war with france they say is its wish that on the militia we should rest our security and that it is time enough to call upon these when the danger is imminent and apparent with these and such like ideas attempted to be inculcated upon the public mind aided by prejudices not yet eradicated and with art and sophistry which regard neither truth nor decency attacking every character without respect to persons public or private who happen to differ from themselves in politics i leave you to decide on the probability of carrying such an extensive plan of defence as you have suggested in your last letter into operation and in the short period which you suppose may be allowed to accomplish it in i come now my dear sir to pay particular attention to that part of your letter which respects myself     i remember well the conversation which you allude to and have not forgot the answer i gave you in my judgment it applies with as much force now as then nay more because at that time the line between parties was not so clearly drawn and the views of the opposition so clearly developed as they are at present of course allowing your observation as it respects myself to be founded personal influence would be of no avail let that party set up a broomstick and call it a true son of liberty—a democrat—or give it any other epithet that will suit their purpose and it will command their votes in toto will not the federalists meet or rather defend their cause on the opposite ground surely they must or they will discover a want of policy indicative of weakness and pregnant of mischief which cannot be admitted wherein then would lie the difference between the present gentleman in office and myself it would be matter of sore regret to me if i could believe that a serious thought was turned towards me as his successor not only as it respects my ardent wishes to pass through the vale of life in retirement undisturbed in the remnant of the days i have to sojourn here unless called upon to defend my country which every citizen is bound to do but on public ground also for although i have abundant cause to be thankful for the good health with which i am blessed yet i am not insensible to my declination in other respects it would be criminal therefore in me although it would be the wish of my countrymen     and i could be elected to accept an office under this conviction which another would discharge with more ability and this too at a time when i am thoroughly convinced i should not draw a single vote from the antifederal side and of course should stand upon no other ground than any other federal character well supported and when i should become a mark for the shafts of envenomed malice and the basest calumny to fire at—when i should be charged not only with irresolution but with concealed ambition which waits only an occasion to blaze out—and in short with dotage and imbecility all this i grant ought to be like dust in the balance when put in competition with a great public good when the accomplishment of it is apparent but as no problem is better defined in my mind than that principle not men is now and will be the object of contention and that i could not obtain a solitary vote from that party that any other respectable federal character would receive the same suffrages that i should that at my time of life verging towards threescore and ten i should expose myself without rendering any essential service to my country or answering the end contemplated prudence on my part must arrest any attempt of the wellmeant but mistaken views of my friends to introduce me again into the chair of government lengthy as this letter is i cannot conclude it without expressing an earnest wish that some intimate and confidential friend of the presidents would give him to understand that his long absence from the seat     of government in the present critical conjuncture affords matter for severe animadversion by the friends of government who speak of it with much disapprobation while the other party chuckle at and set it down as a favorable omen for themselves it has been suggested to me to make this communication but i have declined it conceiving that it would be better received from a private character more in the habits of social intercourse and friendship with the most sincere friendship and affectionate regard c george washington    august      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry mount vernon    august      private my dear sir your private letters of the   th ulto and  th instant have been duly received mr bordley for presenting and you for forwarding his essays on husbandry are entitled to and accordingly receive my thanks for these instances of both your kindnesses confidential i think you wise men of the east have got yourselves in a hobble relatively to france great britain russia and the porte to which allow me the priviledge of adding our worthy demos all cannot be pleased whom will you offend here then is a severe trial for your diplomatic skill in which the     editor of the aurora says you are great adepts but to be serious i think the nomination  appointment of ambassadors to treat with france would in any event have been liable to unpleasant reflections after the declarations wch have been made and in the present state of matters in europe must be exceedingly embarrassing the president has a choice of difficulties before him in this business if he pursues the line he marked out all the consequences cannot be forseen if he relinquishes it it will be said to be of a piece with all the other acts of the administration—unmeaning if not wicked deceptious c c c and will arm the opposition with fresh weapons to commence new attacks upon the government be the turn given to it and reasons assigned what they may—i come now to the scene of bribery and pray my good sir what part of the  00000 have come to your share as you are high in office i hope you did not disgrace yourself in the acceptance of a paltry bribe—a  00000  perhaps—but here again i become serious there can be no medium between the reward and punishment of an editor who shall publish such things as duane has been doing for some time past on what ground then does he pretend to stand in his exhibition of the charges or the insinuations which he has handed to the public can hardihood itself be so great as to stigmatise characters in the public gazettes for the most heinous offences and when prosecuted pledge itself to support the alligation unless there was     something to build on i hope  expect that the prosecutors will probe this matter to the bottom it will have an unhappy effect on the public mind if it be not so but how stands the charge—in verity  truth with respect to the consul general stephens purchase of coffee and breach of trust or in other words taking advantage of his official knowledge to monopolise that article at a low price this thing made a good deal of noise among the friends as well as the enemies of government and if true proves him unworthy altogether of public confidence  denominates him a mercenary  one who would do anything for lucre is the president returned to the seat of government when will he return his absence i mention it from the best motives gives much discontent to the friends of government while its enemies chuckle at it  think it a favorable omen for them i am always your affecte george washington    august      mount vernon robert lewis to robert lewis mount vernon    august      dear sir your letter of the  th instant came duly to hand but being received with many other letters it was laid by and entirely forgotten until i came across it yesterday again mr arisss draught on mr james     russell for £   pounds shall be presented to him but if he is indisposed to pay it or wants time to do it he has a good pretext for delay as you have sent it without your endorsement although made payable to you of the facts related in the enclosed letter relative to the loss of his crop by the hessian fly i know nothing if it should appear to your credit that kercheval has used his true endeavor to raise the means to discharge his rent and is deprived thereof by an act of providence i am willing however illy i can afford to do it to make some reasonable abatement therefrom of which you from inquiry will be the best judge it is demonstratively clear that on this estate mount vernon i have more working negros by a full moiety than can be employed to any advantage in the farming system and i shall never turn planter thereon to sell the overplus i cannot because i am principled against this kind of traffic in the human species to hire them out is almost as bad because they could not be disposed of in families to any advantage and to disperse the families i have an aversion what then is to be done something must or i shall be ruined for all the money in addition to what i raise by crops and rents that have been received for lands sold within the last four years to the amount of fifty thousand dollars has scarcely been able to keep me afloat under these circumstances and a thorough conviction     that half the workers i keep on this estate would render me a greater nett profit than i now derive from the whole has made me resolve if it can be accomplished to settle plantations on some of my other lands but where without going to the western country i am unable as yet to decide as the best if not all the land i have on the east side of the alleganies are under leases or some kind of incumbrance or another but as you can give me the correct information relative to this matter i now early apply for it what then is the state of kerchevals lot  the other adjoining are they under leases if not is the land good and how many hands would it work to advantage have i any other good land in berkeley that could be obtained on reasonable terms is that small tract above the warm springs engaged for the ensuing year how much cleared land is there on it and what kind of buildings how many hands could be usefully employed thereon information on these points and any others relative thereto would be acceptable to me the drought has been so excessive on this estate that i have made no oats— if it continues a few days longer shall make no corn i have cut little or no grass and my meadows at this time are as bare as the pavements of consequence no second crop can be expected these things will compel me i expect to reduce the mouths that feed on the hay i have two or three young jacks besides young royal gift and several she asses that i would dispose     of would fauquier or where else be a good place to dispose of them i am glad to hear that your brother lawrence is so much amended as your letter indicates whether it be from sulphur application or other cause—but if doctr baysham under whose hands he was was unable to effect a radical cure i should not place much confidence in vosss spring as the disorder must be deep rooted your aunt unites with me in best wishes for mr lewis yourself  family and i am c george washington  0th august      mount vernon jonathan trumbull to governor jonathan trumbull mount vernon  0th august      my dear sir your favor of the  0th instant came duly to hand it gave me pleasure to find by the contents of it that your sentiments respecting the comprehensive project of colonel trumbull coincided with those i had expressed to him a very different state of politics must obtain in this country and more unanimity prevail in our public counsels than is the case at present ere such a measure could be undertaken with the least prospect of success by unanimity alone the plan could be accomplished—while then a party and a strong one too is hanging upon the wheels of government opposing measures calculated solely for internal defence and is endeavoring to defeat all the laws which have     been passed for this purpose by rendering them obnoxious to attempt anything beyond this would be to encounter certain disappointment and yet if the policy of this country or the necessity occasioned by the existing opposition to its measures should suffer the french to possess themselves of louisiana and the floridas either by exchange or otherwise i will venture to predict without the gift of second sight that there will be no peace in israel—or in other words that the restless ambitious and intriguing spirit of that people will keep the united states in a continual state of warfare with the numerous tribes of indians that inhabit our frontiers for doing which their diplomatic skill is well adapted with respect to the other subject of your letter i must again express a strong and ardent wish and desire that no eye no tongue no thought may be turned towards me for the purpose alluded to therein for besides the reasons which i urged against the measures in my last and which in my judgment and by my feelings are insurmountable you yourself have furnished a cogent one you have conceded what before was selfevident in my mind namely that not a single vote would thereby be drawn from the antifederal candidate you add however that it might be a means of uniting the federal votes here then my dear sir let me ask what satisfaction what consolation what safety should i find in support which depends upon caprice  00 if men not principles can influence the choice on the part of the federalists what but fluctuations are to be expected the favorite today may have the curtain dropped on him tomorrow while steadiness marks the conduct of the antis and whoever is not on their side must expect to be loaded with all the calumny that malice can invent in addition to which i should be charged with inconsistency concealed ambition dotage and a thousand more et ceteras it is too interesting not to be again repeated that if principles instead of men are not the steady pursuit of the federalists their cause will soon be at an end if these are pursued they will not divide at the next election of a president if they do divide on so important a point it would be dangerous to trust them on any other—and none except those who might be solicitous to fill the chair of government would do it in a word my dear sir i am too far advanced into the vale of life to bear such buffeting as i should meet with in such an event a mind that has been constantly on the stretch since the year      with but short intervals and little relaxation requires rest and composure and i believe that nothing short of a serious invasion of our country in which case i conceive it to be the duty of every citizen to step forward in its defence will ever draw me from my present retirement but let me be in that or in any other situation i shall always remain your sincere friend and affectionate humble servant c  0  george washington    september      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private mount vernon    september      dear sir i feel much obliged and accordingly thank you for your kind intention of ordering me two months pay and i shall not suffer false modesty to assert that my finances stand in no need of it because it is not the time nor the attention only which the public duties i am engaged in require but their bringing upon me applicants recommenders of applicants and seekers of information with their servants and horses none of whom perhaps are of my acquaintances to aid in the consumption of my forage and what to me is more valuable my time that i most regard for a man in the country nine miles from any house of entertainment is differently situated from one in a city where none of these inconveniences are felt yet even under these circumstances which may be little known to those who wd appreciate them and would be totally disregarded by such as are always on the lookout for something to cavil at i am resolved to draw nothing from the public but reimbursements of actual expenditures unless by being called into the field i shall be entitled to full pay and the emoluments of office without this it would be said by the latter description of people that i was enjoying retirement on very easy and lucrative terms whilst the former might remark that i had forgot the conditions on which i accepted my commission opposed to these  0  the loss of time and incidental expenses are not to be compared i thought this explanation of my motives for declining the acceptance of your offer was due to your kind attention in behalf of dear sir c george washington    september      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war mount vernon    september      sir your letter of the  d instant with the papers accompanying it did not get to my hands till the   th at the same time i received a long letter from general hamilton with voluminous references to which he requested my immediate attention and the communication of my sentiments thereon these circumstances will account for your not having received an answer before this time the rules which have been adopted by the president of the u s relative to rank in the army point out the mode which must determine the relative rank of those officers who have heretofore been in service the documents in the waroffice and the information obtained from the parties would enable you to fix the rank of those officers at least as well as i can do it but to manifest my readiness to comply so far as is in my power with any request from your department i have in the enclosed list noted numerically the names of the lieutenantcolonels and majors who have been in service as they should rank agreeably to the documents from the waroffice which you  0  forwarded to me annexed to their names and in conformity with the regulations established by the president relative to rank by these rules resignation precludes all claim to rank and places the party on a footing with those officers who have never before been in service but where a resignation took place from any cause not affecting the character of the officer as it is presumed is the case with all who are now appointed under this circumstance it does not in my opinion deprive the party of that consideration which his having been in service would give provided he stands on equal ground in other respects with those who have never served as the relative rank of officers who have not been in service is to be determined by the commanderinchief i shall make the arrangement in the best manner i can with respect to the officers in your list who are of this description but in order to do this with propriety and satisfaction a personal knowledge of the several officers or full information of their respective qualifications talents and merits is necessary the former i do not possess the latter i have respecting most of those who have not been in service so far as could be ascertained from the documents laid before the general officers in november last from the waroffice but to proceed on this ground alone and without any document relative to the characters of the officers from connecticut north and south carolina and georgia who you will recollect were selected without any agency of mine  0  and fix the rank definitively would be very repugnant to my ideas of propriety and justice in a word it would be little better than to decide their relative rank by lot i have tried and tried again to make an arrangement of the majors who have been in service and i enclose a list of the result but it is so unsatisfactory to myself that i request no weight may be given to it farther than it accords with better information and circumstances in your letter you have requested that the relative rank of the fieldofficers of the cavalry as well as of the twelve regiments of infantry should be fixed but you have not furnished the names of those officers and there is one major wanting according to your list to complete the number for the twelve regiments of infantry i feel much obliged by your intention of remitting me two months pay but excepting in cases which may involve me in pecuniary expenses i must beg leave on the principle i set out with to decline the acceptance of it the letters written to you by the lieutcolonels and majors in answer to your queries are herewith returned with due consideration i have the honor to be c george washington    september      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton majorgeneral mount vernon    september      dear sir mrs washingtons indisposition being confined for  0 days and other circumstances would not allow me to give your letter of the  th instant and the reports  0  and journals which accompanied it an earlier consideration having done this however with as much thought as i have been able to bestow under the circumstances mentioned i see no cause with the limited force which has been enumerated and which i presume is all that can be calculated upon to differ from you in the disposition of it although at the same time i shall make some observations thereupon for consideration it may be remembered that at the time the secretary of war laid before the general officers in philadelphia the letters of general wilkinson respecting the propriety in his judgment of placing a considerable force at the natchez i gave it my decided disapprobation inasmuch as it would excite in the spaniards distrust and jealousy of our pacific disposition would cause an augmentation of force on their part and so on with both if our government would go into the measure until the thing which was intended to be avoided would more than probable be produced i e hostility whereas by keeping that force in the upper country besides its looking to all points and exciting no alarm in any might if occasion should require it either for defence or offence descend the stream like lightning with all its munitions and equipments which could be accumulated with ease and without noise at the upper posts and make the surprise more complete although i have said in effect that the corps de reserve or army of observation should take post at the place you have mentioned namely in the vicinity  0  of the rapids of the ohio louisville yet i can see but two reasons which entitle it to be preferred to the present post above i e fort washington in a geographical point of view and these are that there is no water above the former that can float large vessels at all seasons and that by being so much lower down the passage of the ohio would be facilitated if an expedition should descend the mississippi in other respects the latter in my opinion has the advantage  st because it is a post already established and would incur no additional expense  ndly because it is more contiguous to fort wayne detroit michilimackinac and all the indians on the lakes from whom in that quarter we have most danger to apprehend  rdly because communications with it for the most part by water are already established and  thly in case of insurrections above or below it is equally as well if not better situated were it not that the mouth of the wabash empties itself into the ohio so low down and yet above its confluence with the cumberland and tennessee i should be inclined to give a position near the mouth of the wabash the preference of either the rapids or fort washington because it would command a great water inlet towards the lakes but whether the position for the corps de reserve be chosen at the rapids of the ohio above or below it had better i conceive be on the north side of the ohio then within the state of kentucky thereby impeding more the intercourse between the army and the citizens and guarding against the  0  evils which result from that mixture and too much familiarity i am so far from agreeing with general wilkinson that fort wayne ought to be abolished that if i mistake not the place central between the heads of the miamis of lake erie and the ohio the st joseph and the wabash affording good water transportation with small portages in every direction i should pronounce it were it not for the expense of subsisting troops there the most eligible position for the army of observation of any in that country it would be an effectual security against all the indians who could annoy us in that region it would cover our barrier posts on the line between the british and us and troops from thence might descend rapidly into the mississippi by the wabash general wilkinson in speaking of posts along our southern frontier is general and you only notice fort stoddert but on an inspection of the maps a place presents itself to my view as very eligible to occupy provided the creek indians would consent to it i mean the appalachicola at its confluence with flint river where the line of demarkation strikes it but in my opinion if we had or could obtain an engineer of real skill and attached to the true policy and interest of the united states he ought to devote his whole time to the investigation of our interior country and mark and erect its proper defences for these hitherto have been more the work of chance and local consideration than national design  0  if the harbor of presque isle is good i should think a small garrison ought to be retained there it certainly is the best on the american side of lake erie and one there is important but i see very little use of a sergeant and eight privates at fort knox it is either unnecessary or too small and sergeants at a distance rarely conduct well when they have not the eye of an officer to inspect their conduct there are several references in general wilkinsons report which were not sent no   appears to have been essential they are all returned by his statement of the mutilated condition of the troops and present disposition of them there must have been most horrible mismanagement somewhere a corrective is indeed highly necessary the practice of furloughing officers and then renewing the furloughs from time to time is extremely injurious to the service and ought to be discontinued on ordinary occasions and that of frittering the army into small garrisons is if possible worse it will never be respectable while these evils exist and until it can be more concentrated and the garrisons frequently relieved by detachments from the main body discipline will always be lax and impositions on the public will prevail if the british are resolved to keep up armed vessels on the lakes i presume it will be expedient for us to do the same but in time of peace a better way in my opinion is for neither to have any in case of a rupture or the appearance of one with that  0  nation there can be no doubt of our arming on those waters much more expeditiously than they would be able to do i have now gone over the material points in your letter and general wilkinsons report but as i mentioned before it has been done under circumstances unfavorable to minute investigation or mature deliberation and my sentiments where differing from you are given more for consideration than decision should any thing of importance on this subject not noticed here occur to me i shall not fail to communicate it to you for the measures now taken with respect to guarding our frontiers and interior country ought to be such as will be permanent and respectable with very great regard i am dear sir c george washington  0 september      mount vernon lawrence lewis to lawrence lewis mount vernon  0 september      dear sir from the moment mrs washington and myself adopted the two youngest children of the late mr custis it became my intention if they survived me and conducted themselves to my satisfaction to consider them in my will when i was about to make a distribution of my property this determination has undergone no diminution but is strengthened by the connection one of them has formed with my family the expense at which i live and the unproductiveness of my estate will not allow me to lessen my income while i remain in my present situation on   0 the contrary were it not for occasional supplies of money in payment for land sold within the past four or five years to the amount of upward of fifty thousand dollars i should not be able to support the former without involving myself in debt and difficulties but as it has been understood from expressions occasionally dropped from nelly custis now your wife that it is the wish of you both to settle in this neighborhood contiguous to her friends and as it would be inexpedient as well as expensive for you to make a purchase of land when a measure which is in contemplation would place you on more eligible ground i shall inform you that in the will which i have made which i have by me and have no disposition to alter that the part of my mount vernon tract which lies north of the public road leading from the gum spring to colchester containing about two thousand acres with the dogueriver farm mill and distillery i have left you grays heights is bequeathed to you and her jointly if you incline to build on it and few better sites for a house than grays hill and that range are to be found in this country or elsewhere you may also have what is properly doguerun farm the mill and distillery on a just and equitable rent as also the lands belonging thereto on a reasonable hire either next year or the year following—it being necessary in my opinion that a young man should have objects of employment idleness is disreputable under any circumstances productive of no good even when unaccompanied by vicious     habits and you might commence building as soon as you please during the progress of which mount vernon might be made your home you may conceive that building before you have an absolute title to the land is hazardous to obviate this i shall only remark that it is not likely any occurrence will happen or any change take place that would alter my present intention if the conduct of yourself and wife is such as to merit a continuance of it but be this as it may that you may proceed on sure ground with respect to the buildings i will agree—and this letter shall be an evidence of it—that if hereafter i should find cause to make any other disposition of the property here mentioned i will pay the actual cost of such buildings to you or yours although i have not the most distant idea that any event will happen that could effect a change in my present determination nor any suspicions that you or nelly could conduct yourselves in such a manner as to incur my serious displeasure yet at the same time that i am inclined to do justice to others it behooves me to take care of myself by keeping the staff in my own hands that you may have a more perfect idea of the landed property i have bequeathed to you and nelly in my will i transmit a plan of it every part of which is correctly laid down and accurately measured showing the number of fields lots meadows c with the contents and relative situation of each all of which except the mill and swamp which has never     been considered as a part of doguerun farm and is retained merely for the purpose of putting it into a better state of improvement you may have on the terms beforementioned with every kind wish for you and nelly in which your aunt who is still much indisposed unites i remain your affectionate uncle george washington    september      mount vernon burges ball to burges ball mount vernon    september      dear sir your letter of the   th inst has been received informing me of the death of my brother  the death of near relations always produces awful and affecting emotions under whatsoever circumstances it may happen that of my brother has been so long expected and his latter days so uncomfortable to himself that they must have prepared all around him for the stroke though painful in the effect i was the first and am now the last of my fathers children by the second marriage who remain when i shall be called upon to follow them is known only to the giver of life when the summons comes i shall endeavor to obey it with a good grace mrs washington has been and still is very much indisposed but unites with me in best wishes for you mrs ball and family with great esteem and regard i am c     george washington    october      mount vernon william vans murray to william vans murray mount vernon    october      dear sir within the space of a few days i have been favored with your letters of the   th of july and duplicate of one of the  th of april the original is missing and of those dated the  th and   th of august with their enclosures for the information in these and for your kindness in sending me a sketch of the waterthrowing mill i feel much obliged and thank you for the trouble you have been at in making the drawing of it being persuaded of its utility although advanced as i am and engaged in other pursuits i shall not be able to avail of the insight it conveys others however may and i shall take care to make it known on all proper occasions the affairs of europe have taken a most important and interesting turn what will be the final result of the uninterrupted successes of the combined army so far as the accounts which have been received in this country are brought down is not for a man at the distance of  000 miles from the great theatre of action to predict but he may wish and ardently wish from principles of humanity and for the benevolent purpose of putting a stop to the further effusion of human blood that the successful powers may know at what point to give cessation to the sword for the purpose of negotiation it is not uncommon however in prosperous gales to forget that adverse winds may blow such was the case with france such     may be the case of the coalesced powers against her a bystander sees more of the game generally than those who are playing it so neutral nations may be better enabled to draw a line between the contending parties than those who are actors in the war my own wish is to see every thing settled upon the best and surest foundation for the peace and happiness of mankind without regard to this that or the other nation a more destructive sword never was drawn at least in modern times than this war has produced it is time to sheathe it and give peace to mankind a severe electioneering contest has just closed in the state of pennsylvania adverse to the federal party by from majority in favour of chief inspector agt mr ross senator for the state much pains was taken both sides and considerable abuse of character which neither was exempt from  you are going to be employed in an important and delicate negotiation for the success of which in all its relations no one more ardently and sincerely wishes than i do your colleagues in this business will be able to give you such accurate details of the internal concerns of our country as not only to render any attempts of mine to do it nugatory but injudicious for which reason i shall refer you to them for the state of our political prospects i most devoutly wish that the cogent indeed unanswerable arguments you urged to dissuade our     friend from visiting the united states in the present crisis of our affairs may have prevailed  the measure would be injudicious in every point of view so says my judgment in which he can be placed embarrassing to himself embarrassing to his friends and possibly embarrassing to the government in the result his final decision however must have been made ere this i shall add no more on this head nor indeed for the reasons already assigned on any other subject mrs washington who has been much indisposed for some time past now better unites her best wishes with mine for mrs murray and yourself with sincere and affectionate regard i am dear sir c george washington   th novr      mount vernon james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war private mount vernon   th novr      my dear sir your confidential and interesting letter of the  0th instant came duly and safely to hand with the contents of which i have been stricken dumb and i believe it is better that i should remain mute than express any sentiment on the important matters which are related therein i have for some time past viewed the political concerns of the united states with an anxious and     painful eye they appear to me to be moving by hasty strides to some awful crisis but in what it will result that being who sees foresees and directs all things alone can tell the vessel is afloat or very nearly so and considering myself as a passenger only i shall trust to the mariners whose duty it is to watch to steer it into a safe port  the charge of british influence in the appointment of major pinckney to be minister at the court of london is a perfect enigma my curiosity leads me to inquire on what ground it is built and you     would oblige me by giving an explanation was it the measure or the man that gave rise to this insinuation the first it cannot be because an exchange of ministers had long been invited sought after and the tardiness of g britain in not meeting the advances of the u states in this respect was considered  complained of as an indignity could it be the man could he who had fought against that country and bled in defence of his own in the conflict a man of acknowledged abilities  irreproachable character be suspected of undue influence if neither i ask again on what is the accusation founded the whole is a mystery to me and merely to satisfy my curiosity i wish to have it unriddled  not from the present view which i have of the subject because i shall think myself bound to answer any interrogatories which may be dictated by insiduous impertinence  with the greatest esteem and regard i remain my dear sir your sincere friend and affectionate hble servant george washington  0th december      mount vernon james anderson to james anderson mount vernon  0th december      mr anderson from the various plans suggested by you at different times for cropping the farms which i propose to retain in my own hands—in the year   00—and with a reduced force of the laborers on them in     succeeding years together with the operations necessary to carry them into effect—and comparing these with the best reflections i am able to bestow on the subject considering moreover the exhausted state of my arable fields and how important it is to adopt some system by which the evil may be arrested and the fields in some measure restored by a rotation of crops which will not press hard upon while sufficient interval between them is allowed for improvement—i have digested the following instructions for my manager while it is necessary for me to employ one and for the government of my overseers and request that they may be most strictly and pointedly attended to and executed as far however as the measures therein required will admit a system closely pursued altho it may not in all its parts be the best that could be devised is attended with innumerable advantages—the conductor of the business in this case can never be under any dilemma in his proceedings—the overseers  even the negroes know what is to be done and what they are capable of doing in ordinary seasons in short every thing would move like clock work and the force to be employed may be in due proportion to the work which is to be performed  a reasonable and tolerably accurate estimate may be made of the produce—but when no plan is fixed—when directions flow from day to day—the business becomes a mere chaos frequently shifting—and sometimes at a stand—for want of directions what to do—or the manner of doing it—these occasion a     waste of time which is of more importance than is generally imagined nothing can so effectually obviate the evil as an established  regular course of proceeding made known to all who are actors in it that all may thereby be enabled to play their parts to advantage this would give ease to the principal conductor of the business—it would be more satisfactory to the persons who immediately overlook it—and would be less harrassing to those who labour—as well as more beneficial for those who employ them— under this view of the subject  of the change which is about to take place next year by having rented one of the farms—the mill—and distillery—and having it in contemplation to do the same with the fishery at the ferry the principal services which you can render me after these events take place is to explain to the overseers who will be furnished with duplicates the plan in all its parts which is detailed in the following sheets—hear their ideas with respect to the order in which the different sorts of work therein pointed out shall succeed each other for the purpose of carrying it into ye best advantage—correct any erroneous projects they may be disposed to adopt for the execution thereof and then see that they adhere strictly to whatsoever may be resolved on—and that they are except when otherwise permitted on their respective farms  with their people the work under such circumstances will go on smoothly—and that the stock may be well fed—littered—and   0 taken care of according to the directions which are given it will be necessary to inspect the conduct of the overseers in this particular and those also whose immediate business it is to attend upon them—with a watchful eye—otherwise and generally in severe weather when attention  care is most needed they will be most neglected— economy in all things is as commendable in the manager as it is beneficial and desirable by the employer—and on a farm it shews itself in nothing more evidently or more essentially than in not suffering the provender to be wasted but on the contrary that every atom of it be used to the best advantage—and likewise in not suffering the ploughs harrows and other implements of husbandry thereon and the gears belonging to them to be unnecessarily exposed trodden under foot carts running over them and abused in other respects more good is derived from looking into the minutiæ on a farm than strikes people at first view and by examining the farm yards fences  looking into fields—to see that nothing is within but what are allowed to be there produces more good—or at least avoids more evil oftentimes than riding from one working party or from one overseer to another generally accomplishes— i have mentioned these things not only because they have occurred to me and tho apparently trifles but because they prove far otherwise in the result and it is hoped and will be expected that more effectual measures will be pursued to make butter     another year for it is almost beyond belief that from  0  cows actually reported on a late enumeration of the cattle that i am obliged to buy butter for the use of my family to visit my lands in the western country at my expence so soon as the weather becomes temperate and settled in the spring—reporting the circumstances under which they are—and what they are capable of—will be expected it being of importance for me to receive a just  faithful acct respecting them after perusing the accompanying plans carefully furnish me with your opinion on the two following points— st what quantity of seeds  of what kinds i shall have occasion to buy and against what periods for seeding the grounds in the year   00 in the manner therein directed—and  d whether any  what number of hands can be withdrawn from the three farms i retain in that year in considering this last mentioned point hear the opinions of the overseer the accts for the present quarter must be made final—as an entire new scene will take place afterwards—in doing this advertise in the alexa paper for the claims of every kind and nature whatsoever against me to be brot in to you by ye  st of jan that i may wipe them off  begin on a fresh score—all balances in my favr must either be recd or reduced to specialties that there may be no disputes thereafter i am yr sincere friend—well wisher—and servant     river farm crops for and operations thereon for the year   00 field no   is now partly in wheat part thereof is to be sown with oats another part may be sown with pease broad cast—part is in meadow and will remain so the most broken washed and indifferent part is to remain uncultivated but to be harrowed and smoothed in the spring and the worst parts thereof if practicable to be covered with litter straw weeds or any kind of vegetable rubbish to prevent them from running into gullies no   one fourth is to be in corn and to be sown with wheat another fourth in buckwheat and pease half of it in the one and half of it in the other sown in april to be ploughed in as a green dressing and by actual experiment to ascertain which is best the whole of this fourth is to be sown with wheat also another fourth part is to be naked fallow for wheat and the other and last quarter to be appropriated for pumpkins cymlins turnips yateman pease in hills and such other things of this kind as may be required and to be sown likewise with rye after they are taken off for seed no   is now in wheat to be harvested in the year   00 the stubble of which immediately after harvest is to be ploughed in and sown thin with rye and such parts thereof as are low or produces a luxuriant growth of grain is to have grassseeds sprinkled over them the whole for sheep to run on in the day but housed at night during the winter and spring months if it should be found expedient part thereof in the spring might be reserved for the purpose of seed no   will be in corn and is to be sown in the autumn of that year with wheat to be harvested in   0 —and to be treated in all respects as has been directed for no   the preceding year it is to be manured as much as the means will permit with such aids as can be procured during the present winter and ensuing spring nos

spring branch is to be planted in potatoes no   that part thereof which is now in turnips is to be sown with oats and clover the other part being now in clover is to remain so until it comes into

rotation for these lots invariably is to be  st potatoes highly manured  d oats and clover sown therewith  d clover  th clover then to begin again with potatoes and proceed as before the present clover lots must be plastered all green sward rough ground or that wch is heavily covered with weeds bottlebrush grass and such things as by being turned in will ferment putrefy and ameliorate the soil should be ploughed in autumn and at such times in winter as it can be done while the ground is dry and in condition for it pasturegrounds the large lot adjoining the negro houses and orchd is to have oats sown on the potato and pumpkin ground with which and on the rye also in that lot and on the melon part orchard grassseeds are to be sown and thereafter to be kept as a standing calf pasture and for ewes which may require extra care at yeaning or after they have yeaned the other large lot northeast of the barn lane is to be appropriated always as a pasture for the milch cows and probably working oxen during the summer season the woodland and the old field commonly called johnstons are designed for common pasture and to be so applied always to which if it should be found inadequate to the stock of the farm field no   and the woodland therein may be added     meadows those already established and in train must continue and the next to be added to them is the arm of the creek which runs up to the springhouse and forks both prongs of which must be grubbed and wrought upon at every convenient moment when the weather will permit down to the line of the ditch which encloses the lots for clover c and as the fields come into cultivation or as labour can be spared from other work and circumstances will permit the heads of all the inlets in them must be reclaimed and laid to grass whether they be large or small forasmuch as nothing will run on or can trespass upon or injure the grass no fencing being reqd mud for compost the season is now too far advanced and too cold to be engaged in a work that will expose the hands to wet but it is of such essential importance that it should be set about seriously and with spirit next year for the summers sun and winters frost to prepare it for the corn and other crops of   0  that all the hands of the farm not indispensably engaged in the crops should so soon as cornplanting is completed in the spring be uninterruptedly employed in raising mud from the pocosons and from the bed of the creek into the scow and the carts so soon as the manure for the corn and potatoes in   00 is carried out is to be incessantly drawing it to compost heaps in the fields which are to be manured by it what number of hands can be set apart for this allimportant work remains to be considered and decided upon penning cattle and folding sheep on the fields intended for wheat from the first of may when the former should be turned out to pasture until the first of november when they ought to be housed must be practised invariably and to do it with regularity and propriety the pen for the first and the fold for the latter should be proportioned to the number of each kind of stock and both these to as much ground as they will manure sufficiently in the space of a week for wheat beyond which they are not to remain in a place except on the poorest spots and even these had better be aided by litter or something     else than to depart from an established rule of removing the pens on a certain day in every week for in this as in every thing else system is essential to carry on business well and with ease feeding the workhorses and mules are always to be in their stalls and well littered and cleaned when they are out of harness and they are to be plenteously fed with cut straw and as much chopped grain meal or bran with a little salt mixed therewith as will keep them always in good condition for work seeing also that they are watered as regularly as they are fed this is their winter feed for spring summer and autumn it is expected that soiling of them on green food first with rye then with lucerne and next with clover with very little grain will enable them to perform their work the oxen and other horned cattle are to be housed from the first of november until the first of may and to be fed as well as the means on the farm will admit the first oxen must always be kept in good condition housed in the stalls designed for them and the cows so many of them as can find places on the opposite side the rest with the other cattle must be in the newlyerected sheds and the whole carefully watered every day the ice in frozen weather being broken so as to admit them to clean water with respect to the sheep they must receive the best protection that can be given them this winter against the next i hope they will be better provided for and with regard to the hogs the plan must be to raise a given number of good ones instead of an indiscriminate number of indifferent ones half of which die or are stolen before the period arrives for putting them up as porkers to accomplish this a sufficient number of the best sows should be appropriate to the purpose and so many pigs raised from them as will insure the quantity of pork the farm ought to furnish whether it will be most advisable to restrain these hogs from running at large or not can be decided with more precision after the result of those now in close pens is better known the exact quantity of corn used by those which are now in pens should be ascertained and regularly reported in order to learn the result     stables and farm pens these ought to be kept well littered and the stalls clean as well for the comfort of the creatures that are contained in them as for the purpose of manure but as straw cannot be afforded for this purpose leaves and such spoiled straw or weeds as will not do for food must serve for the stables and the first that is leaves and cornstalks is all that can be applied to the pens to do this work effectually let the cornstalks be cut down by a few careful people with sharp hoes so low as never to be in the way of scythes at harvest and whenever the wheat will admit carts to run on it without injury let them be brought off and stacked near the farm pens in like manner let the people with their blankets go every evening or as often as occasion may require to the nearest wood and fill them with leaves for the purposes above mentioned bottoming the beds with cornstalks and covering them thick with leaves a measure of this sort will be if strictly attended to and punctually performed of great utility in every point of view it will save food make the cattle lay warm and comfortable and produce much manure the hogs also in pens must be well bedded in leaves fencing as stock of no kind according to this plan will be suffered to run on the arable field or clover lots except sheep in the day on the rye field as has been mentioned before partition fences between the fields until they can be raised of quicks may be dispend with but it is of great importance that all the exterior or outer fences should be substantially good and those also wch divide the common or woodland pasture from the fields and clover lots are to be very respectable to accomplish this desirable object in as short a time as possible and with the smallest expense of timber the postandrail fence which runs from the negro quarters or rather from the corner of the lot enclosing them up to the division between fields nos   and   may be placed on the bank which must be raised higher that runs from thence where it was burnt to the creek in like manner the fence from the gate which opens into no   quite down to the river along the cedar hedgerow as also     those rails which are between no   and   and between no   and   may all be taken away and applied to the outer fences and the fences of the lanes from the barn into the woodland pasture and from the former the barn into no   for the fences of all these lanes must be good as the stock must have a free and uninterrupted passage along them at all times from the barnyard to the woodland pasture one of the gates near the fodder house may be moved up to the range of the lane by the gate near that which leads into field no   and the other may be placed at the other end of the lane by the negroe quarters—and so long as mr masons old field remains uninclosed the other gate in the field no   wd stand better in the fence which runs from the division between fields no   and   to the creek than where it now is all the feng from the lastmentioned place between me and mr mason until it joins mr lears farm and thence with the line between him and me until it comes to the river will require to be substantially good at its termination on the river dependence must be placed in a water fence for if made of common rails they would be carried off by boatmen for firewood the fences separating fields no   and no   from the

are thought to be ineligible until the ground is much improved in rows   feet by   or   feet by  ½ the wide part open to the south these fields are to be manured as highly as the means will admit and the corn planted every year in the middle of the rows of the preceding year by doing which and mixing the manure and earth by the plough and other workings the whole in time will be enriched the washed and gullied parts of this field should be levelled and as much improved as possible or left uncultivated although it is more broken than some of the other fields it has its advantages  st it has several inlets extending into it with easy assents therefrom  d it is convenient to the mud in the bed of the     creek whensoever by means of the scow resort is had thereto and good landingplaces and thirdly it is as near to the barn as any other when a bridge and causeway is made over the spring branch to these may be added that it is more remote from squirrels than any other no   and   or such part thereof as is not so much washed and gullied as to render ploughing ineligible are to be fallowed for wheat one of which if both cannot is to have the stubble ploughed in and sown with rye and the low and strong parts to have timothy or orchard grass seeds perhaps both in different places sprinkled over them for the purpose of raising seed on the rye pasture the sheep are to be fed in winter and spring and treated in all respects as directed in the case of no   in   00 in the years   0    0  and so on the corn ground remaining the same two fields in following numbers will be fallowed for wheat and treated in all respects as mentioned above and if pumpkins cymlins turnips pease and such like growths are found beneficial to the land or useful and profitable for stock ground may readily be found for them these are the great outlines of a plan and the operations of it for the next year and for years to come for river farm the necessary arrangements and all the preparatory measures for carrying it into effect ought to be adopted without delay and invariably pursued smaller matters may and undoubtedly will occur occasionally but none it is presumed that can militate against it materially to carry it into effect advantageously it becomes the indispensable duty of him who is employed to overlook and conduct the operations to take a prospective and comprehensive view of the whole business which is laid before him that the several parts thereof may be so ordered and arranged as that one sort of work may follow another sort in proper succession and without loss of labour or of time for nothing is a greater waste of the latter and consequently of the former time producing labour and labour money than shifting from one thing to another before it is finished as if chance or the impulse of the moment not judgmt and foresight directed the measure it will be acknowledged that weather and other circumstances     may at times interrupt a regular course of proceedings but if a plan is well digested beforehand they cannot interfere long with a man who is acquainted with the nature of the business and the crops he is to attend to every attentive and discerning person who has the whole business of the year laid before him and is acquainted with the nature of the work can be at no loss to lay it out to advantage he will know that there are many things wch can be accomplished in winter as well as in summer—others that spring summer and autumn are fit for in a word to use the wise mans saying that there is a time and a season for all things and that unless they are embraced nothing will thrive or go on smoothly there are many sorts of indoors work which can be executed in hail rain or snow as well as in sunshine and if they are set about in fair weather unless there be a necessity for it there will be nothing to do in foul weather the people therefore must be idle the man of prudence and foresight will always keep these things in view and order his work accordingly so as to suffer no waste of time or idleness the same observations apply with equal force to frozen ground and grounds too wet to work in or if worked will be injured thereby these observations might be spun to a greater length but they are sufficient to produce reflection and reflection with industry and proper attention will produce the end that is to be wished there is one thing however i cannot forbear to add and in strong terms it is that whenever i order a thing to be done it must be done or a reason given at the time or as soon as the impracticability is discovered why it cannot be done which will produce a countermand or change but it is not for the person receiving the order to suspend or dispense with its execution and after it has been supposed to have gone into effect for me to be told that nothing has been done in it that it will be done or that it could not be done either of these is unpleasant and disagreeable to me having been accustomed all my life to more regularity and punctuality and know that nothing but system and method is required to accomplish all reasonable requests mount vernon december  0th        0 union farm crops for and operations thereon in   00 field no   is now sown with wheat to be harvested in   00—the stubble of which is to be immediately ploughed in and rye sowed thereon for a sheep pasture grassseeds must be sown therewith on such parts as will yield grass for seed to supply my own wants and the market so far as it can be spared this field after the rye has been eaten off by the sheep is to be reined from stock of all kinds and nothing suffered to run thereon until it comes in course to be cultivated in the regular routine of crops no   will be in corn and although but an indifferent field washed in some places gullied in others and rich in none is all things considered best to be appropriated constantly for this crop  st and primarily because it is most contiguous to the barn and the corn therein more easily secured and attended to  ndly because it is as handy to the mud from the pocoson and the bed of the creek as any other to mix in a compost and more convenient to the manure from the farmyard and stables  dly because it is entirely out of the reach of squirrels and  thly because it is hoped and expected from the manner of treating it that it will be so much amended as to become more and more productive every year and the impoverished places if not restored to some degree of fertility prevented from getting worse and becoming such eyesores as they now are the corn will be planted in rows   feet by   or   by  ½ the wide part open to the south and must be as highly manured in the hill as the means on the farm respect being had to other species of crops will admit the rows of the succeeding year will be in the middle of the last and alternately shifted by which and the workings the field will yearly receive the whole will be enriched and it is hoped restored no   as no   is to be appropriated as a standing field for corn and of course cannot be sown with wheat in the autumn of   00 this field that is no   ought if it be practicable to be fallowed and sown with that article otherwise the farm will produce no wheat the following year and the stock must suffer for     want of the straw and is to be treated in every respect as has been directed for no   that is the stubble to be ploughed in immediately after harvest and rye sowed thereon with grassseeds where the soil is strong enough to rear them for the purpose of producing seed again no   the part thereof which lyes no et of the meadow commonly called manleys field is to remain well enclosed and no stock suffered to run thereon until it comes in rotation to be fallowed for wheat in   0  the other part of the same no   is to be equally well enclosed and reined up from stock and except the part along muddyhole branch that is to be added to no   in order to supply the deficiency occasioned by taking clover lot no   from it is to be planted with peach trees at   ½ asunder except so much of it as lays flat by the gate on the mill road which if properly prepared it is supposed would bring grass and on that account is to be planted at double that distance viz at    feet apart what is here meant by enclosing this part of no   well is that the outer fence shall be secure for it will remain as now undivided from no   otherwise than by the branch no   is also to be kept from stock and when it comes in course to be fallowed for wheat is to have the addition above mentioned along the branch added thereto and sown in this article no   will receive such an addition to its size from no   as will make it exclusive of the lot for clover lucerne c of equal size thereto part of this field is now sown with and will be in wheat in   00 part will be in oats particularly where the pease grew and all that part of it and no   also which lyes low from the meadow fence by the overseers house quite up to the head springs of the branch reclaimed in the spring is to be planted with rareripe corn and in the fall to be treated in every respect as the great meadow at this farm but at an earlier period has been this year for although i am not sanguine enough to expect that it will make good mowing meadow i shall be much disappointed if it does not produce grass yielding a good deal of seed which until the fields come into cultivation in regular rotation and afterwards if it answer expectation will be an annual     profit without any other labour than gathering of it the other part of no   which will be taken from no   laying south of this low ground between it and no   might if it does not involve too much ploughing be put in corn also but this is a measure which will require consideration and probably must depend upon circumstances the poor and washed parts of no   must remain uncultivated but ought if it be practicable to be levelled harrowed and trash of some kind to be thrown thereon as will keep them from growing worse no   some part of this field may be sown with buckwheat in no great quantity and a part may be planted with the yateman pease in hills both for a crop some of the other kind of pease may be sown broadcast and mowed at a proper season for the stock the rest of the ground by laying uncultivated and nothing running thereon will be increasing in strength while idle clover lots no   next the overseers house same side of the lane excepting the ground now in and designed for lucerne south of the slash by the barn and two acres where the turnips grew or at the other end for experiments is to be in oats and to be sown with clover seed no   opposite thereto and at present part of no   is to be well manured and planted with potatoes whether in hills or drills may be considered no   may receive pumpkins cymlins turnips and melons there being no sown grass remaining on it and the manure for and shade occasioned by these vines together with the working the lot will get will be of service instead of a detriment to the potato crop wch will follow no   is to remain in clover until by rotation it comes into potatoes again the rotation for these lots are uniformly to be  st potatoes highly manured  d oats and clover sown therewith  d clover  th clover then to begin again with potatoes and proceed as before     the present clover lots must be plastered all green sward rough ground or that which is heavily covered with weeds bottlebrush grass and such things as by being turned in will ferment putrefy and ameliorate the soil should be ploughed in autumn and at such time in winter as can be done while the ground is dry and in condition for working pastureground as stock of all sorts except sheep upon the rye are to be excluded from the arable fields and clover lots resort must be had to the woodland and unreclaimed swamps therein for pasture for them the lane up to the barn will serve for calves and this will be provided by a fence extending from the so west corner of muddyhole field no   to the so et corner of doguerun field no   leaving all south of it for this farm as the north part will be for muddyhole farm and as it will be for the mutual benefit of both farms the fence must be erected at the joint expense of both fencing the one just mentioned must be completed in the course of the winter and every possible exertion to strengthen and render substantially good the whole of the exterior or outer fence of the farm to do which and to avoid all unnecessary consumption of timber the partition fence between the fields no   and no   as it now stands quite up to the woods and thence to the fence leading from the ferry to the mill road from the mansionhouse may be taken away and applied to that fence and to the trunnelfence on the mill road where they unite until it comes to the meadow fence at the bridge leaving the fields no   and no   and the woodland adjoining under one enclosure in like manner the fences dividing no   from   and no   from   may be used for a fence around the creek until it unites with that opposite to the mill house without which neither of those fields will be secure as hogs have been taught or of themselves have learnt to cross the creek in pursuit of food and for strengthening effectually the fence from the plank bridge by the barn lane to the branch opposite to the mill house new rails must     be got in the nearest wood between the mill road and the road leading to the gum spring the west fence of no   must next year or as soon as it can be accomplished be removed across the branch and placed in a line with the new ditch fence of the lower meadow until it comes in range with the south line of the said field and until a fence is run from the end thereof to the nearest part of the outer fence opposite to the mill and a second gate established thereat or that that intercourse between the barn and the mill is effectually barred which would be the cheapest and by odds the most convenient mode there would be no security for any crop growing in fields nos     and   as the leaving the gate by the mill run open only five minutes might deluge the whole with the hogs at that place and they might be in there a night or two perhaps more before they were discovered and do irreparable damage indeed the latter mode has so much the advantage of the former especially as my intercourse with the mill will in a great measure cease that i see no cause to hestitate a moment in adopting it and to prevent opening the fence where the gate now is a deep ditch and high bank would be necessary from a distance below to the foot of the hill above if not quite up to the meadow one among other advantages resulting from this measure would be that the west and even south fence of no   might if occasion required it be applied instead of new rails in making the fence from the meadow towards the mill and around the creek more substantial for it must be repeated again that as there will be few or no inner fences the outer ones must be unassailable to the most vicious stock the fences that are already around the meadows may remain but there is no occasion for their being formidable to guard them against hogs if any should by chance get through the outer fence is all that would be necessary meadows the large meadow below the barn lane and half of that above the lane have had every thing done for them that is requisite except manuring when necessary and the means are to be had the remaining part of the lastmentioned meadow above must     receive a complete summer fallow to cleanse it of rubbish of all sorts and be sown in proper season with timothy with a protecting crop of rye for soiling the working mules etc in the spring although i may find myself mistaken i am inclined to put the other prong of this swamp running through no   and heading in no   into meadow and i have for this reason directed already the mode to be pursued for accomplishing it next to this let as much of the inlet in no   as can be laid dry enough for corn be planted therewith in order to eradicate the wild growth when this is effected lay it to grass as the fields come round the unreclaimed inlets may be prepared for grass if circumstances and the force of the farm will admit of it of these there is one besides a swamp in no   which is susceptible of being converted into good grass ground and the flat and low ground in west no   it is presumed wd bring grass also whether the part proposed to be added to field no   had better be retained for arable uses or laid to meadow can be determined better after it is cleared and cleansed of the wild growth than now but the inlets at the ferry between the dwelling and fish houses might by a small change of the fence from the gate of no   be thrown into that field and brought into excellent meadow at very little expense whensoever time and labor can be afforded for this purpose to dwell on the advantages of meadow would be a mere waste of time as the produce is always in demand in the market and for my purposes and obtained at no other expense than that of cutting the grass and making it into hay crops c for   0  no   being the field appropriated for corn will be planted with this article accordingly as already directed for   00 the poor and washed parts continuing to receive all the aids that can be given to them no   supposing it to have been fallowed and sown the year before will this year produce a crop of wheat the stubble of which immediately after harvest is to be turned in sown with rye for the benefit of sheep in the day during winter and spring but to be housed at night all the low and rich spots capable of producing grass must be sown with timothy or orchardgrass seeds     for the purpose of supplying seeds again and a part of the field may be reserved for a rye crop or the sheep taken off early enough for the whole to yield enough of this grain to pay for the harvesting of it no   and   that part of no   which lays next to the mill is as has been directed already to be planted with peach trees the other part called manleys field with all that can be added to it not exceeding  0 acres of woodland adjoining no   and the upper meadow below the plank bridge is to be fallowed for wheat as no   also is to be with the addition at the west end taken from no   and both of them if it can be accomplished but one certainly must have the stubble when the wheat comes off sowed with rye for the sheep and with grassseeds upon low and rich places for the purpose of raising seed and to be treated in all other respects as has been directed for number   the reason for preferring an addition to no   from the woods east of the meadow although the land is of inferior quality is because it requires no additional fencing for the same fence that encloses nos   and   encompasses this also because it will be more convenient for supplying the mansion with firewood and because it will give a better form and appearance to the farm than breaking into the woodland on the north side of the mill road crops for   0    0  and so on the corn ground remaining the same always two fields in following numbers will every year be fallowed for wheat and treated in all respects as hath been mentioned before and if pumpkins cymlins turnips and such like growths are found beneficial to the land or useful and profitable for stock places enough may be found to raise them in all unnecessary wood is to be cut down and removed from

years will afford much mowing or grazing according as the seasons happen to be besides being a restorative to the soil but then the produce of the salable crops is small unless increased by the

ultimo enclosing a copy of what you had written to the secretary of war on the subject of a military academy the establishment of an institution of this kind upon a respectable and extensive basis has ever been considered by me as an object of primary importance to this country and while i was in the chair of government i omitted no proper opportunity of recommending it in my public speeches and other ways to the attention of the legislature but i never undertook to go into a detail of the organization of such an academy leaving this task to others whose pursuits in the paths of science and attention to the arrangements of such institutions had better qualified them for the execution of it for the same reason i must now decline making any observations on the details of your plan and as it has already been submitted to the secretary of war through whom it would naturally be laid before congress it might be too late for alterations if any should be suggested i sincerely hope that the subject will meet with due attention and that the reasons for its establishment which you have so clearly pointed out in your letter to the secretary will prevail upon the legislature to place it upon a permanent and respectable footing with very great esteem  regard i am c     extract from a diary december       th rainy morning with the wind at north mercury at    afternoon clear and pleasant

mount vernon saturday december   th      this day being marked by an event which will be memorable in the history of america and perhaps of the world i shall give a particular statement of it to which i was an eye witness on thursday dec    the general rode out to his farms about ten oclock and did not return home till past   oclk soon after he went out the weather became very bad rain hail and snow falling alternately with a cold wind—when he came in i carried some letters to him to frank intending to send them to the post office in the evening—he franked the letters but said the weather was too bad to send a servant up to the office that evening—i observed to him that i was afraid he had got wet he said no his great coat had kept him dry but his neck appeared to be wet and the snow was hanging on his hair—he came to dinner which had been waiting for him without changing his dress in the evening he appeared as well as usual     a heavy fall of snow took place on friday which prevented the general from riding out as usual—he had taken cold undoubtedly from being so much exposed the day before and complained of having a sore throat—he however went out in the afternoon into the ground between the house and the river to mark some trees which were to be cut down in the improvement of that spot he had a hoarseness which increased in the evening but he made light of it as he would never take anything to carry off a cold always observing let it go as it came—in the evening the papers having come from the post office he sat in the room parlour with mrs washington and myself reading them till about nine oclock when mrs washington went up into mrs lewiss room who was confined and left the general and myself reading the papers he was very cheerful and when he met with anything which he thought diverting or interesting he would read it aloud as well as his hoarseness would permit—he desired me to read to him the debates of the virginia assembly on the election of a senator and governor which i did—and on hearing mr madisons observations respecting mr monroe he appeared much affected and spoke with some degree of asperity on the subject which i endeavored to moderate as i always did on such occasions on his retiring to bed he appeared to be in perfect health excepting the cold before mentioned which he considered as trifling and had been remarkably cheerful all the evening  about between   or   oclk on saturday morning he awoke mrs washington  told her he was very unwell and had had an ague she observed that he could scarcely speak and breathed with difficulty—and would have got up to call a servant but he would not permit her lest she should take cold—as soon as the day appeared the woman caroline went into the room to make a fire—and mrs washington sent her immediately to call me  he desired that mr rawlins one of the overseers who was used to bleeding the people might be sent for to bleed him before the     doctor could arrive—and the woman caroline came to my room requesting i might go to the general who was very ill—i got up put on my clothes as quick as possible and went to his chamber—mrs washington was then up and related to me his being taken ill about   or   oclk as before stated—i found him breathing with difficulty—and hardly able to utter a word intelligibly—i went out instantly—and wrote a line to dr craik which i sent off by my servant ordering him to go with all the swiftness his horse could carry him—and immediately returned to the generals chamber where i found him in the same situation i had left him a mixture of molasses vinegar  butter was prepared to try its effect in the throat but he could not swallow a drop whenever he attempted it he appeared to be distressed convulsed and almost suffocated—mr rawlins came in soon after sun rise—and prepared to bleed him when the arm was ready—the general observing that rawlins appeared to be agitated said as well as he could speak dont be afraid and after the incision was made he observed the orifice is not large enough however the blood ran pretty freely—mrs washington not knowing whether bleeding was proper or not in the generals situation begd that much might not be taken from him lest it should be injurious and desired me to stop it but when i was about to untie the string the general put up his hand to prevent it and as soon as he could speak he said more more—mrs w being still very uneasy lest too much blood should be taken it was stopd after about half a pint was taken from him—finding that no relief was obtained from bleeding and that nothing would go down the throat i proposed bathing the throat externally with salvolitillata which was done and in the operation which was with the hand and in the gentlest manner he observed t is very sore a piece of flannel dipped in sal volatile was then put round his neck his feet were also soaked bathed in warm water—this however gave no relief—in the meantime before dr craik arrived mrs washington requested me to send for doct brown of port tobacco  whom dr craik had recommended to be called if any case should ever occur that was seriously     alarming i despatched a messenger cyrus to dr brown immediately about between eight and nine oclk—doctor craik came in soon after and after examining the general he put a blister of cantharides on the throat  took some more blood from him and had some vinegar  hot water put into a teapot for the general to draw in the steam from the nozel—which he did as well as he was able—he also ordered sage tea and vinegar to be mixed for a gargle—this the general used as often as desired but when he held back his head to let it run down it put him into great distress and almost produced suffocation when the mixture came out of his mouth some phlegm followed it and he would attempt to cough which the doctor encouraged him to do as much as he could but without effect he could only make the attempt—about eleven oclock dr dick  was sent for dr craik requested that dr dick might be sent for as he feared dr brown would not come in time a messenger was accordingly despatched for him—dr craik bled the general again about this time—no effect however was produced by it and he continued in the same state unable to swallow anything—dr dick came in about   oclk and dr brown arrived soon after—upon dr dicks seeing the genl  consulting a few minutes with dr craik he was bled again the blood ran very slowly—appeared very thick and did not produce any symptoms of fainting—dr brown came into the chamber room soon after and upon feeling the generals pulse c the physicians went out together—dr craik soon after returned—the general could now swallow a little—about   oclk calomel  tartar em were administered but without any effect—about half past   oclock he desired me to ask mrs washington to come to his bedside—when he requested her to go down into his room  take from his desk two wills which she would find there and bring them to him which she did—upon looking at them he gave her one which he observed was useless as it was superceeded by the other and desired her to burn it which she did and then took the other  put it away into her closet—after this was done i returned again to his bed side and took his hand he said to me i find i am going my breath cannot     continue long i believed from the first attack it would be fatal do you arrange  record all my late military letters  papers—arrange my accounts  settle my books as you know more about them than any one else and let mr rawlins finish recording my other letters which he has begun—i told him this should be done he then asked if i recollected any thing which it was essential for him to do as he had but a very short time to continue with us i told him that i could recollect nothing but that i hoped he was not so near his end he observed smiling that he certainly was and that as it was the debt which we must all pay he looked to the event with perfect resignation in the course of the afternoon he appeared to be in great pain and distress from the difficulty of breathing and frequently changed his posture in the bed on these occasions i lay upon the bed and endeavored to raise him and turn him with as much ease as possible he appeared penetrated with gratitude for my attentions and often said i am afraid i shall fatigue you too much and upon my assuring him that i could feel nothing but a wish to give him ease he replied well it is a debt we must pay to each other and i hope when you want aid of this kind you will find it he asked when mr lewis   washington  would return they were then in new kent i told him i believed about the  0th of the month he made no reply to it—about five oclock dr craik came again into the room and upon going to the bedside the general said to him doctor i die hard but i am not afraid to go i believed from my first attack that i should not survive it my breath cannot last long the doctor pressed his hand but could not utter a word he retired from the bedside and sat by the fire absorbed in grief the physicians dr dick and dr brown again came in between      oclock and when they came to his bed side dr craik asked him if he could sit up in the bed he held out his hand to me  was raised up when he said to the physicians i feel myself going i thank you for your attention you had better not take any more trouble about me but let me go off quietly i cannot last long—they found out that all which had been done   0 was without effect he lay down again and all retired except dr craik he continued in the same position uneasy and restless but without complaining frequently asking what hour it was when i helped to move him at this time he did not speak but looked at me with strong expressions of gratitude the doctor pressed his hand but could not utter a word—he retired from the bedside—and sat by the fire absorbed in grief—about   oclk the physicians again came into the room and applied blisters and cataplasms of wheat bran to his legs and feet—but went out except dr craik without a ray of hope—i went out about this time and wrote a line to mr law and mr peter requesting them to come with their wives mrs washingtons granddaughters as soon as possible to mt vernon from this time he appeared to breathe with less difficulty than he had done but was very restless constantly changing his position to endeavor to get ease—i aided him all in my power and was gratified in believing he felt it for he would look upon me with his eyes speaking gratitude but unable to utter a word without great distress—about ten oclock he made several attempts to speak to me before he could effect it—at length he said i am just going have me decently buried and do not let my body be put into the vault in less than two three days after i am dead—i bowed assent for i could not speak—he then looked at me again and said do you understand me—i replied yes sir t is well said he—about ten minutes before he expired his breathing became much easier—he lay quietly—he withdrew his hand from mine  felt his own pulse—i spoke to dr craik who sat by the fire—he came to the bedside—the generals hand fell from his wrist—i took it in mine and laid it upon my breast—dr craik put his hand on his eyes and he expired without a struggle or a sigh—while we were fixed in silent grief—mrs washington who was sitting at the foot of the bed asked with a firm and collected voice is he gone—i could not speak but held up my hand as a signal that he was—t is well said she in a plain voice all is now over—i have no more trials to pass through—i shall soon follow him     occurrences not noted in the preceding pages the generals servant  christopher attended his bed side  in the room when he was sitting up through his whole illness—about   oclk in the morning the general expressed a wish to get up his clothes were put on and he was led to a chair by the fire he found no relief from that position—he lay down again about two hours afterwards—a glister was administered to him by dr craiks directions about one oclock but produced no effect—he was helped up again about   oclock—and after sitting about one half an hour he desired to be undressed and put in bed which was done—between the hours of   and nine oclk he several times asked what hour it was—during his whole illness he spoke but seldom  with great difficulty and distress and in so low  broken a voice as at times hardly to be understood—his patience fortitude  resignation never forsook him for a moment—in all his distress he uttered not a sigh nor a complaint always endeavoring from a sense of duty as it appeared to take what was offered him or to do what was desired by the physicians— at the time of his decease dr craik  myself were in the situation before mentioned—christopher was standing by the bedside—mrs washington was sitting near the foot of the bed—caroline molly and charlotte and some other of the servants were standing in the room near the door—mrs forbes the housekeeper was frequently in the room in the day  evening as soon as dr craik could speak after the distressing scene was closed he desired one of the servants to ask the gentlemen below to come up stairs—when they came around the bed i kissed the cold hand which i had till then held to my bosom laid it down went to the other end of the room to the fire and was for some time lost in profound grief until aroused by christopher desiring me to take care of the generals keys and things which he had taken out of his pockets and which mrs washington directed him to give to me—i wrapped them up in the     generals handkerchief and took them with me down stairs—about    oclk the corps was brought down and laid out in the large room— sunday december   th the foregoing statement so far as i can recollect is correct jas craik sunday—dec   —mrs washington sent for me in the morning and desired i would send up to alexa and have a coffin made which i did—doctor dick measured the body which was as follows— in length   ft  ½ inches exact across the shoulders   —   — across the elbows—  —   — after breakfast—i gave dr dick and dr brown forty dolls each which sum dr craik advised as very proper and they left us—i wrote letters to the following persons informing them of the melancholly event— mrs washington

mr  mrs law—dr craik tarried here all this day and night— in the evening i consulted with mr law mr peter  dr craik on fixing a day for depositing the body in the vault—i     wished the ceremony to be postponed till the last of the week to give time to some of the generals relations to be here but dr craik  dr thornton gave it decidedly as their opinion that considering the disorder of which the general died being of an inflammatory kind it would not be proper nor perhaps safe to keep the body so long and therefore wednesday was fixed upon for the funeral to allow a day thursday in case the weather should be unfavorable on wednesday— monday dec   —people were directed to open the family vault clean away the rubbish from about it  make everything decent around it—ordered a door to be made

james craik elisha c dick    december      alexandria particular account of the late illness and death of george washington alexandria    december      some time in the night of friday the  0th instant having been exposed to a rain on the preceding day general washington was attacked with an inflammatory affection of the upper part of of the windpipe called in technical language cynache trachealis the disease commenced with a violent ague accompanied with some pain in the upper and forepart of the throat a sense of stricture in the same part a cough and a difficult rather than painful deglutition which was soon succeeded by fever and a quick and laborious respiration the necessity of bloodletting suggesting itself to the general he procured a bleeder in the neighborhood who took from his arm in the night twelve or fourteen ounces of blood he could not by any means be prevailed on by the family to send for the attending physician till the following morning who arrived at mount vernon at about    oclock on saturday discovering the case to be highly alarming and foreseeing the fatal tendency of the disease two consulting physicians were immediately sent for who arrived one at half after three and the other at four oclock in the afternoon in the mean time were employed two pretty copious bleedings a blister was applied to the part affected two moderate doses of calomel were administered which operated on the     lower intestines but all without any perceptible advantage the respiration becoming still more difficult and distressing upon the arrival of the first of the consulting physicians it was agreed as there were yet no signs of accumulation in the bronchial vessels of the lungs to try the result of another bleeding when about thirtytwo ounces of blood were drawn without the smallest apparent alleviation of the disease vapours of vinegar and water were frequently inhaled ten grains of calomel were given succeeded by repeated doses of emetic tartar amounting in all to five or six grains with no other effect than a copious discharge from the bowels the powers of life seemed now manifestly yielding to the force of the disorder blisters were applied to the extremities together with a cataplasm of bran and vinegar to the throat speaking which was painful from the beginning now became almost impracticable respiration grew more and more contracted and imperfect till half after    on saturday night retaining the full possession of his intellect—when he expired without a struggle he was fully impressed at the beginning of his complaint as well as through every succeeding stage of it that its conclusion would be mortal submitting to the several exertions made for his recovery rather as a duty than from any expectation of their efficacy he considered the operations of death upon his system as coeval with the disease and several hours before his death after repeated efforts to be understood succeeded in expressing a desire that he might be permitted to die without further interruption  during the short period of his illness he economized his time in the arrangement of such few concerns as required his attention with the utmost serenity and anticipated his approaching dissolution with every demonstration of that equanimity     for which his whole life has been so uniformly and singularly conspicuous james craik

of which he made but little complaint on friday on saturday morning about   oclock he became ill doctor dick attended him in the morning and dr craick of alexandria and dr brown of port tobacco were soon after called in every medical assistance was offered but without the desired effect his last scene corresponded with the whole tenor of his life not a groan or a complaint escaped him in extreme distress with perfect resignation and a full possession of his reason he closed his well spent life i have the honor to be c tobias lear mr marshall with deep sorrow on his countenance and in a low pathetic tone of voice rose and addressed the house as follows the melancholy event which was yesterday announced with doubt has been rendered but too certain our washington is no more the hero the sage and the patriot of america—the man on whom in times of danger every eye was turned and all hopes were placed lives now only in his own great actions and in the hearts of an affectionate and afflicted people if sir it had even not been usual openly to testify respect for the memory of those whom heaven had selected as its instruments for dispensing good to men yet such has been the uncommon worth and such the extraordinary incidents which have marked the life of him whose loss we all deplore that the whole american nation impelled by the same feelings would call with one voice for a public manifestation of that sorrow which is so deep and so universal more than any other individual and as much as to one individual was possible has he contributed to found this our     widespreading empire and to give to the western world its independence and its freedom having effected the great object for which he was placed at the head of our armies we have seen him convert the sword into the ploughshare and voluntarily sink the soldier into the citizen when the debility of our federal system had become manifest and the bonds which connected the parts of this vast continent were dissolving we have seen him the chief of those patriots who formed for us a constitution which by preserving the union will i trust substantiate and perpetuate those blessings our revolution had promised to bestow in obedience to the general voice of his country calling on him to preside over a great people we have seen him once more quit the retirement he loved and in a season more stormy and tempestuous than war itself with calm and wise determination pursue the true interest of the nation and contribute more than any other could contribute to the establishment of that system of policy which will i trust yet preserve our peace our honor and our independence having been twice unanimously chosen the chief magistrate of a free people we see him at a time when his reelection with the universal suffrage could not have been doubted affording to the world a rare instance of moderation by withdrawing from his high station to the peaceful walks of private life however the public confidence may change and the public affection may fluctuate with respect to others yet with respect to him they have in war and in peace in public and in private life been as steady as his own firm mind and as constant as his own exalted virtues let us then mr speaker pay the last tribute of respect and affection to our departed friend let the grand council of the nation display those sentiments which the nation feels for this purpose i hold in my hand some resolutions which i will take the liberty to offer to the house resolved that this house will wait on the president of the united states

was received from the senate informing the house that they had agreed to the appointment of a joint committee to consider a suitable manner of paying honor to the memory of the man first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his country and that they had appointed seven members to join a committee of the house for that purpose senate december    agreeably to the first resolution the house waited on the president whom they addressed in the following words the senate of the united states respectfully take leave sir to express to you their deep regret for the loss their country sustains in the death of general george washington this event so distressing to all our fellow citizens must be peculiarly heavy to you who have long been associated with him in deeds of patriotism permit us sir to mingle our tears with yours on this occasion it is manly to weep to lose such a man at such a crisis is no common calamity to the world our country mourns her father the almighty disposer of human events has taken from us our greatest benefactor and ornament it becomes us to submit with reverence to him who maketh darkness his pavilion with patriotic pride we review the life of our washington and compare him with those of other countries who have been preeminent in fame ancient and modern names are diminished     before him greatness and guilt have too often been allied but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant the destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue it proved the intemperance of victory the scene is closed and we are no longer anxious lest misfortune should sully his glory he has travelled on to the end of his journey and carried with him an encreasing weight of honor he has deposited it safely where misfortune cannot tarnish it where malice cannot blast it favored of heaven he departed without exhibiting the weakness of humanity magnanimous in death the darkness of the grave could not obscure his brightness such was the man whom we deplore thanks to god his glory is consummated washington yet lives on earth in his spotless example—his spirit is in heaven let his countrymen consecrate the memory of the heroic general the patriotic statesman and the virtuous sage let them teach their children never to forget that the fruits of his labors and his example are their inheritance to which the president returned the following answer john adams george washington gentlemen of the senate i receive with the most respectful and affectionate sentiments in this impressive address the obliging expressions of your regret for the loss our country has sustained in the death of her most esteemed beloved and admired citizen in the multitude of my thoughts and recollections on this melancholy event you will permit me only to say that i have seen him in the days of adversity in some of the scenes of his deepest and most trying perplexities i have also attended him in his highest elevation and most prosperous felicity with uniform admiration of his wisdom moderation and constancy among all our original associates in that memorable league of the continent in      which first expressed the sovereign will of a free nation in america he was the only one remaining in the general government although with a constitution more enfeebled than his at an age when he thought it necessary to prepare for retirement i feel myself alone bereaved of my last brother yet i derive a strong consolation from the unanimous disposition     which appears in all ages and classes to mingle their sorrows with mine on this common calamity to the world the life of our washington cannot suffer by a comparison with those of other countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame the attributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to eclipse the majesty of those virtues which made him from being a modest citizen a more resplendent luminary misfortune had he lived could hereafter have sullied his glory only with those superficial minds who believing that characters and actions are marked by success alone rarely deserve to enjoy it malice could never blast his honor and envy made him a single exception to her universal rule for himself he had lived enough to life and to glory for his fellowcitizens if their prayers could have been answered he would have been immortal for me his departure is at a most unfortunate moment trusting however in the wise and righteous dominion of providence over the passions of men and the results of their councils and actions as well as over their lives and nothing remains for me but humble resignation his example is now complete and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates citizens and men not only in the present age but in future generations as long as our history shall be read if a trajan found a pliny a marcus aurelius can never want biographers eulogists or historians john adams in the house of representatives general marshall made a report from the joint committee appointed to consider a suitable mode of commemorating the death of general washington he reported the following resolutions resolved by the senate and the house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that a marble monument be erected by the united states at the capitol of the city of washington and that the family of general

recommendation contained in the third resolution these resolutions passed both houses unanimously martha washington dec         mount vernon john adams mrs washington to president adams mount vernon dec         sir while i feel with keenest anguish the late dispensation of divine providence i cannot be insensible to the mournful tributes of respect and veneration which are paid to the memory of my dear deceased husband and as his best services and most anxious wishes were always devoted to the welfare and happiness of his country to know that they were truly appreciated and gratefully remembered affords no inconsiderable consolation taught by the great example which i have so long had before me never to oppose my private wishes to the public will i must     consent to the request made by congress which you have had the goodness to transmit me and in doing this i need not say i cannot say what a sacrifice of individual feeling i make to a sense of public duty with grateful acknowledgment and unfeigned thanks for the personal respect and evidences of condolence expressed by congress and yourself i remain very respectfully sir your most obedient and humble servant martha washington martha washington january      00 mount vernon governor trumbull mrs washington to governor trumbull mount vernon january      00 dear sir when the mind is deeply affected by those irreparable losses which are incident to humanity the good christian will submit without repining to the dispensations of divine providence and look for consolation to that being who alone can pour balm into the bleeding heart and who has promised to be the widows god but in the severest trials we find some alleviation to our grief in the sympathy of sincere friends and i should not do justice to my sensibility was i not to acknowledge that your kind letter of condolence of the  0th of december was grateful to my feeling i well knew the affectionate regard which my dear deceased husband always entertained for you and therefore conceive how afflicting his death must have been to you the quotation which you have given of what was written to you on a former melancholy occasion is truly applicable to this the loss is ours the gain is his for myself i have only to bow with humble submission to the will of that god who giveth and who taketh away looking forward with faith and hope to the moment when i shall be again united with the partner of my life but while i continue on earth my prayers will be offered up for the welfare and happiness of my friends among whom you will always be numbered being dear sir your sincere and afflicted friend martha washington         the will of george washington    0     in the name of god amen i george washington of mount vernon a citizen of the united states and lately president of the same do make ordain and declare this instrument which is written with my own hand and every page thereof subscribed with my name to be my last will  testament revoking all others  —imprimus—all my debts of which there are but few and none of magnitude are to be punctually and speedily paid and the legacies hereinafter bequeathed are to be discharged as soon as circumstances will permit and in the manner directed item to my dearly beloved wife martha washington i give and bequeath the use profit and benefit     of my whole estate real and personal for the term of her natural life except such parts thereof as are specially disposed of hereafter—my improved lot in the town of alexandria situated on pitt and cameron streets i give to her  her heirs forever as i also do my    household and kitchen furniture of every sort and kind with the liquors and groceries which may be on hand at the time of my decease to be used and disposed of as she may think proper item—upon the decease of wife it is my will and desire that all the slaves which i hold in my own right shall receive their freedom—to emancipate them during her life would tho earnestly wished by me be attended with such insuperable difficulties on account of their intermixture by marriages with the dower negroes as to excite the most painful sensations—if not disagreeable consequences from the latter while both descriptions are in the occupancy of the same proprietor it not being in my power under the tenure by which the dower negroes are held to manumit them—and whereas among those who will receive freedom according to this devise there may be some who from old age or bodily infirmities  others who on account of their infancy that will be unable to support themselves it is my will and desire that all who come under the first and second description shall be comfortably clothed and fed by my heirs while they live and   that such of the latter description     as have no parents living or if living are unable or unwilling to provide for them shall be bound by the court until they shall arrive at the age of twenty five years and in cases where no record can be produced whereby their ages can be ascertained the judgment of the court upon its own view of the subject shall be adequate and final—the negroes thus bound are by their masters and mistresses to be taught to read and write and to be brought up to some useful occupation agreeably to the laws of the commonwealth of virginia providing for the support of orphans and other poor children—and i do hereby expressly forbid the sale or transportation out of the said commonwealth of any slave i may die possessed of under any pretence whatsoever—and i do moreover most positively and most solemnly enjoin it upon my executors hereafter named or the survivors of them to see that this clause respecting slaves and every part thereof be religiously fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place without evasion neglect or delay after the crops which may then be on the ground are harvested particularly as it respects   the aged and infirm seeing that a regular and permanent fund be established for their support so long as there are subjects requiring it not trusting to the uncertain provisions to be made by individuals—and to my mulatto man william calling himself william lee i give immediate freedom or if he should prefer it on account of the accidents which have befallen him and which have rendered him incapable of walking or of any active employment      to remain in the situation he now is it shall be optional in him to do so—in either case however i allow him an annuity of thirty dollars during his natural life which shall be independent of the victuals and cloaths he has been accustomed to receive if he chuses the last alternative but in full with his freedom if he prefers the first and this i give him as a testimony of my sense of his attachment to me and for his faithful services during the revolutionary war      item—to the trustees governors or by whatsoever other name they may be designated of the academy in the town of alexandria i give and bequeath in trust four thousand dollars or in other words twenty of the shares which i   hold in the bank of alexandria towards the support of a free school established at and annexed to the said academy for the purpose of educating such orphan children or the children of such other poor and indigent persons as are unable to accomplish it with their own means and who in the judgment of the trustees of the said seminary are best entitled to the benefit of this donation—the aforesaid twenty shares i give and bequeath in perpetuity—the dividends only of which are to be drawn for and applied by the said trustees for the time being for the uses above mentioned the stock to remain entire and untouched unless indications of a failure of the said bank should be so apparent or discontinuance thereof should render a removal of this fund necessary in either of these cases the amount of the stock here devised is to be vested in some other bank or public institution whereby the interest may with regularity and certainty be drawn and applied as above—and to prevent misconception my meaning is and is hereby declared to be that these twenty shares are in lieu of and not in addition to the thousand pounds given by a missive letter some years ago in consequence whereof an an nuity of fifty pounds has since been paid towards the support of this institution     item—whereas by a law of the commonwealth of virginia enacted in the year      the legislature thereof was pleased as an evidence of its approbation of the services i had rendered the public during the revolution—and partly i believe in consideration of my having suggested the vast advantages which the community would derive from the extension of its inland navigation under legislative patronage to present me with one hundred shares of one hundred dollars each in the incorporated company established for the purpose of extending the navigation of james river from tide water to the mountains and also with fifty shares of one hundred pounds sterling each in the corporation of another company likewise established for the similar purpose of opening the navigation of the river potomac from tide water to fort cumberland the acceptance of which although the offer was highly honorable and grateful to my feelings was refused as inconsistent with a principle which i had adop ted and had never departed from namely not to receive pecuniary compensation for any services i could render my country in its arduous struggle with great britain for its rights and because i had evaded similar propositions from other states in the union—adding to this refusal however an intimation that if it should be the pleasure of the legislature to permit me to appropriate the said shares to public uses i would receive them on those terms with due sensibility—and this it having consented to in flattering terms as will appear by a subsequent law and sundry resolutions     in the most ample and honorable manner i proceed after this recital for the more correct understanding of the case to declare— that as it has always been a source of serious regret with me to see the youth of these united states sent to foreign countries for the purpose of education often before their minds were formed or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own contracting too frequently not only habits of dissipation and extravagence but principles unfriendly to republican governmt and to the true and genuine liberties   of mankind which thereafter are rarely overcome—for these reasons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan devised on a liberal scale which would have a tendency to spread systamatic ideas through all parts of this rising empire thereby to do away local attachments and state prejudices as far as the nature of things would or indeed ought to admit from our national councils—looking anxiously forward to the accomplishment of so desirable an object as this is in my estimation my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to effect the measure than the establishment of a university in a central part of the united states to which the youth of fortune and talents from all parts thereof might be sent for the completion of their education in all the branches of polite literature in arts and sciences—in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good government and as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment by associating with each other and forming     friendships in juvenile years be enabled to free themselves in a proper degree from those local prejudices and habit ual jealousies which have just been mentioned and which when carried to excess are never failing sources of disquietude to the public mind and pregnant of mischievous consequences to this country—under these impressions so fully dilated— item—i give and bequeath in perpetuity the fifty shares which i hold in the potomac company under the aforesaid acts of the legislature of virginia towards the endowment of a university to be established within the limits of the district of columbia under the auspices of the general government if that government should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it—and until such seminary is established and the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support my further will and desire is that the profit accruing therefrom shall whenever the dividends are made be laid out in purchasing stock in the bank of columbia or some other bank at the discretion of my executors or by the treasurer of the united states for the time being under the direction of congress provided that honorable body should  0 patronize the measure and the dividends proceeding from the purchase of such stock is to be vested in more stock and so on until a sum adequate to the accomplishment of the object is obtained of which i have not the smallest doubt before many years pass away even if no aid or encouraged is given by legislative authority or from any other source      item—the hundred shares which i held in the james river company i have given and now confirm in perpetuity to and for the use and benefit of liberty hall academy in the county of rockbridge in the commonwealth of virga   item—i release exonerate and discharge the estate of my deceased brother samuel washington from the payment of the money which is due to me for the land i sold to philip pendleton lying in the county of berkley who assigned the same to him the said samuel who by agreement was to pay me therefor—and whereas by some contract the purport of which was never communicated to me between the said samuel and his son thornton washington the latter became possessed of the aforesaid land without    any conveyance having passed from me either to the said pendleton the said samuel or the said thornton and without any consideration having been made by which neglect neither the legal or equitable title has been alienated —it rests therefore   0 with me to declare my intentions concerning the premises—and these are to give and bequeath the said land to whomsoever the said thornton washington who is also dead devised the same or to his heirs forever if he died intestate—exonerating the estate of the said thornton equally with that of the said samuel from payment of the purchasemoney which with interest agreeably to the original contract with the said pendleton would amount to more than a thousand pounds—and whereas two other sons of my said deceased brother samuel—namely george steptoe washington and lawrence augustine washington were by the decease of those to whose care they were committed brought under my protection and in consequence have occasioned advances on my part for their education at college and other schools for their board cloathing and other incidental expenses to the amount of near    five thousand dollars over and above the sums furnished by their estate wch sum may be inconvenient for them or their fathers estate to refund—i do for these reasons acquit them and the said estate from the payment thereof—my intention being that all accounts between them and me and their fathers estate and me shall stand balanced     item—the balance due to me from the estate of bartholomew dandridge deceased  my wifes brother and which amounted on the first day of october      to four hundred and twentyfive pounds as will appear by an account rendered by his deceased son john dandridge who was the executor of his fathers will i release and acquit from the payment thereof—and the negros then thirty three in number formerly belonging to the said estate who were taken in execution—sold—and purchased in on my account in the year      and ever since have remained in the possession and to the use of mary widow of the said bartholomew dandridge with their increase it is my will and desire shall continue and be in her possession without paying hire or making    compensation for the same for the time past or to come during her natural life at the expiration of which i direct that all of them who are forty years old and upwards shall receive their freedom all under that age and above sixteen shall serve seven years and no longer and all under sixteen years shall serve until they are twentyfive years of age and then be free—and to avoid disputes respecting the ages of any of these negros they are to be taken to the court of the county in which they reside and the judgment thereof in this relation shall be final and a record thereof made which may be adduced as evidence at any time thereafter if disputes should arise concerning     the same—and i further direct that the heirs of the said bartholomew dandridge shall equally share the benefits arising from the services of the said negros according to the tenor of this devise upon the decease of their mother item—if charles carter who intermarried with my niece betty lewis is not sufficiently secured in the title to the lots he had of me in the town of fredericksburg  it is my will and desire that my executors shall make such conveyances    of them as the law requires to render it perfect  item—to my nephew wm augustine washington and his heirs if he should conceive them to be objects worth prosecuting and to his heirs a lot in the town of manchester opposite to richmond no    —drawn on my sole account and also the tenth of one or two hundred acre lots and two or three halfacre lots in the city and vicinity of richmond drawn in partnership with nine others all in the lottery of the deceased william bryd are given —as     is also a lot which i purchased of john hood conveyed by william willie and samuel gordon trustees of the said john hood numbered     in the town of edenburgh in the county of prince george state of virginia item—to my nephew bushrod washington i give and bequeath all the papers in my possession which relate to my civil and military administration of the affairs of this country—i leave to him also such of my private papers as are worth preserving—and at the decease of my wife and before if she is not inclined to retain them i give and bequeath my library of books and pamphlets of every kind    item—having sold lands which i possessed in the state of pennsylvania and part of a tract held in equal right with george clinton late governor of new york in the state of new york—my share of land and interest in the great dismal swamp and a tract of land which i owned in the county of gloucester—withholding the legal titles thereto until the consideration money should be paid—and having moreover leased and conditionally sold as will appear by the tenor of the said leases all my lands upon the great kanhawa and the tract upon difficult run in the county of loudon it is my will and     direction that whensoever the contracts are fully and respectively complied with according to the spirit true intent and meaning thereof on the part of the purchaser their heirs or assigns that then and in that case conveyances are to be made agreeably to the terms of the said contracts and the money arising therefrom when paid to be vested in bank stock the dividends whereof as of that also which is already vested therein is to inure to my said wife during her life but the stock itself is to remain     be subject to the general distribution hereafter directed item—to the earl of buchan i recommit the box made of the oak that sheltered the great sir william wallace after the battle of falkirk —presented to me by his lordship in terms too flattering for me to repeat—with a request to pass it on the event of my decease to the man in my country who should appear to merit it best upon the same conditions that have induced him to send it to me—whether easy or not to select the man who might comport with his lordships opinion in this respect     is not for me to say but conceiving that no disposition of this valuable curiosity can be more eligible than the recommitment of it to his own cabinet agreeably to the original design of the goldsmiths company of edinburgh who presented it to him and at his request consented that it should be transferred to me i do give and bequeath the same to his lordship and in case of his decease to his heir with my grateful thanks for the distinguished honor of presenting it to me and more especially for the favorable sentiments    with which he accompanied it— item—to my brother charles washington i give and bequeath the goldheaded cane left me by doctr franklin in his will—  i add nothing to it because of the ample provision i have made for his issue—to the acquaintances and friends of my juvenile years lawrence washington and robert washington of chotanck i give my other two goldheaded canes having my arms engraved on them and to each as they will be useful where they live i leave one of the spy glasses which constituted part of my equipage during the late war—to my compatriot     in arms and old and intimate friend doctr craik i give my bureau or as the cabinet makers called it tambour secretary and the circular chair an appendage of my study—to doctr david stuart  i give my large shaving and dressing table and my telescope —to the reverend now bryan lord fairfax i give a bible in three large folio volumes with notes presented to me by the right reverend thomas wilson bishop of sodor  man —to general de la fayette i give a pair of     finely wrought steel pistols taken from the enemy in the revolutionary war—to my sisters in law    hannah washington  and mildred washington —to my friends eleanor stuart  hannah washington of fairfield  and elizabeth washington of hayfield  i give each a mourning ring of the value of one hundred dollars—these bequests are not made for the intrinsic value of them but as mementos of my esteem and regard—to tobias lear  i give the use of the farm which he now holds in virtue of a lease from me to him and his deceased wife for and during their natural lives free from rent during his life at the expiration of which it is to be disposed as is hereafter directed—to sally b haynie a distant relation of mine i give and bequeath three hundred dollars —to sarah green daughter of the deceased thomas bishop and to ann walker daughter     of john alton  also deceased i give each one hundred dollars in consideration of the attachment of their fathers to me each of whom having lived nearly forty years in my family—to each of my nephews william augustine washington george lewis george steptoe washington bushrod washington and samuel washington i give one of the swords or cutteaux of which i may die pos  sessed and they are to chuse in the order they are named—these swords are accompanied with an injunction not to unsheath them for the purpose of shedding blood except it be for selfdefence or in defence of their country and its rights and in the latter case to keep them unsheathed and prefer falling with them in their hands to the relinquishment thereof      and now having gone through these specific devises with explanations for the more correct understanding of the meaning and design of them i proceed to the distribution of the more important parts of my estate in manner following first—to my nephew bushrod washington and his heirs partly in consideration of an intimation to his deceased father while we were bachelors and he had kindly undertaken to superintend my estate   0 during my military services in the former war between great britain and france that if i should fall therein mt vernon then less extensive in dominion than at present should become his property i give and bequeath all that part thereof which is comprehen 0ded within the following limits—viz—beginning at the ford of dogue run near my mill and extending along the road and bounded thereby as it now goes and ever has gone since my recollection of     it to the ford of little hunting creek at the gum spring until it comes to a knowl opposite to an old road which formerly passed through the lower field of muddyhole farm at which on the north side of the said road are three red or spanish oaks marked as a corner and a stone placed—thence by a line of trees to be marked rectangular to the black line or outer boundary of the tract between thomson mason and myself—thence with that line easterly now double ditching with a post and rail fence thereon to the run of little hunting creek thence with that run which is the boundary of the lands of the late humphrey peake and me to the tide water of the said creek thence by that water to potomac river thence with the river to the mouth of dogue creek and thence with the said dogue creek to the place of beginning at the aforesaid ford containing upwards of four thousand acres be the same more or less together with the mansion house    and all other buildings and improvemts thereon— secondly—in consideration of the consanguinity between them and my wife being as nearly related to her as to myself as on account of the affection i had for and the obligation i was under to their father when living who from his youth had attached himself to my person and followed my fortunes through the vicissitudes of the late revolution afterwards devoting his time to the superintendence of my private concerns for many years whilst my public employments rendered it impracticable for me to do it myself thereby affording me essential services and     always performing them in a manner the most filial and respectful for these reasons i say i give and bequeath to george fayette washington and lawrence augustine washington   their heirs my estate east of little hunting creek lying on the river potomac including the farm of   0 acres leased to tobias lear as noticed before and containing in the whole by deeds two thousand  twenty seven acres be it more or less which said estate it is my will and desire should be equitably and advantageously divided between them according to quantity quality  other circumstances when    the youngest shall have arrived at the age of twenty one years by three judicious and disinterested men one to be chosen by each of the brothers and the third by these two—in the mean time if the termination of my wifes interest therein should have ceased the profits arising therefrom are to be applied for their joint uses and benefit third—and whereas it has always been my intention since my expectation of having issue has ceased to consider the grand children of my wife in the same light as i do my own relations and to act a friendly part by them more especially by the two whom we have reared from their earliest infancy namely eleanor parke custis and george washington parke custis and whereas the former of these hath lately intermarried with lawrence lewis a son of my deceased     sister betty lewis by which union the inducement to provide for them both has been increased—wherefore i give and bequeath to the said lawrence lewis and eleanor parke lewis his wife and their heirs the residue of my mount vernon estate not already devised to my nephew bushrod washington comprehended within the fol  lowing description—viz—all the land north of the road leading from the ford of dogue run to the gum spring as described in the devise of the other part of the tract to bushrod washington until it comes to the stone and three red or spanish oaks on the knowl—thence with the rectangular line to the

far as is recollected with a reasonable estimate of its value is hereunto annexed—i desire may be sold by my executors at such times—in such manner and in such credits if an equal valid and satisfactory distribution of the specific property cannot be made without as in their judgment shall be most conducive to the interests of the parties concerned and the monies arising therefrom to be divided into twenty three equal parts and applied as follows—viz— to william augustine washington elizabeth spotswood jane thornton and the heirs of ann ashton  son and daughters of my deceased

to me should now    be deceased or should die before me that in either of these cases the heirs of such deceased persons shall notwithstanding derive all the benefit of the bequest in the same manner as if he or she was actually living at the time and by way of advice i recommend it to my executors not to be precipitate in disposing of the landed property herein directed to be sold if from temporary causes the sale thereof should be dull experience having fully evinced that the price of land especially above the falls of the rivers  on the western waters have been progressively rising and cannot be long checked in its increasing value—and i particularly recommend it to such of the legatees under this clause of my will as can make it convenient to take each a share of my stock in the potomac company in preference to the amount of what it might sell for being thoroughly convinced myself that no uses to which the money can be applied will be so productive as the tolls arising from this navigation when in full operation and this from the nature of things it must be ere long and more especially if that of the shenandoah is added thereto    the family vault at mount vernon requiring repairs and being improperly situated besides i desire     that a new one of brick and upon a larger scale may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the vineyard inclosure—on the ground which is marked out—in which my remains with those of my deceased relatives now in the old vault and such others of my family as may chuse to be entombed there may be deposited—and it is my express desire that my corpse may be interred in a private manner without parade or funeral oration  lastly—i constitute and appoint my dearly beloved wife martha washington my nephews william

executrix and executors of this will  testament—in the construction of which it will readily be perceived that no professional character has been consulted or has had any agency in the draught—and that although it has occupied    many of my leisure hours to digest  to through it into its present form it may notwithstanding appear crude and incorrect—but having endeavored to be plain and explicit in all the devises—even at the expense of prolixity perhaps of tautology i hope and trust that no disputes will arise concerning them but if contrary to expectation the case should be otherwise from the want of legal expression or the usual technical terms or because too much or too little has been     said on any of the devises to be consonant with law my will and direction expressly is that all disputes if unhappily any should arise shall be decided by three impartial and intelligent men known for their probity and good understanding two to be chosen by the disputants each having the choice of one and the third by those two—which three men thus chosen shall unfettered by law or legal constructions declare their sense of the testators intention and such decision is to all intents and purposes to be as binding on the parties as if it had been given in the supreme court of the united states    in witness of all and of each of the things herein contained i have set

last night—i was glad to learn by it that all are well—the acct given of the behaviour of the scotchmen at port tobacco  piscataway surprizd  vexed me—why did they imbark in the cause—what do they say for themselves—what does other say of them—are they admitted into company—or kicked out of it—what does their countrymen urge in justification of them—they are fertile in invention and will offer excuses where excuses can be made—i cannot say but i am curious to learn the reasons why men who had subscribed  bound themselves to each other  their country to stand forth in defence of it should lay down their arms the first moment they were called upon although i never hear of the mill under the direction of simpson without a degree of warmth  vexation at his extreame stupidity yet if you can spare money from other purposes i could wish to have it sent to him that it may if possible be set agoing before the works get ruined  spoilt  my whole money perhaps totally lost—if i am really to loose barrands debt to me it will be a pretty severe     stroke upon the back of adams  the expence i am let into by that confounded fellow simpson  necessarily so in seating my lands under the management of cleveland spinning should go forward with all possible dispatch as we shall have nothing else to depend upon if these disputes continue another year—i can hardly think that lord dunmore can act so low  unmannerly a part as to think of seizing mrs washington by way of revenge upon me howevr as i suppose she is before this time gone over to mr calverts  will soon after retng go down to

nevertheless exceedingly thankful to the gentlemen of alexandria for their friendly attention to this point  desire you will if there is any sort of reason to suspect a thing of this kind provide a kitchen for her in alexandria or some other place of safety elsewhere for her and my papers the people of this government have obtained a character which they by no means deserved—their officers generally speaking are the most indifferent kind of people i ever saw—i have already broke one colo and five captains for cowardice  for drawing more pay  provisions than they had men in their companies—there is two more colos now under arrest  to be tried for the same offences—in short they are by no means such troops in any respect as     you are led to believe of them from the accts which are published but i need not make myself enemies among them by this declaration although it is consistent with truth—i dare say the men would fight very well if properly officered although they are an exceeding dirty  nasty people—had they been properly conducted at bunkers hill on the   th of june or those that were there properly supported the regulars would have met with a shameful defeat and a much more considerable loss than they did which is now known to be exactly  0   killed  wounded—it was for their behaviour on that occasion that the above officers were broke for i never spared one that was accused of cowardice but brot em to immediate tryal  our lines of defence are now compleated as near so at least as can be—we now wish them to come out as soon as they please but they that is the enemy discover no inclination to quit their own works of defence  as it is almost impossible for us to get to them we do nothing but watch each others motions all day at the distance of about a mile every now and then picking off a stragler when we can catch them without their intrenchments in return they often attempt to cannonade our lines to no other purpose than the waste of a considerable of powder to themselves which we should be very glad to get what does doctr craik say to the behaviour of his countrymen  townspeople—remember me     kindly to him  tell him that i should be very glad to see him here if there was anything worth his acceptance but the massachusetts people suffer nothing to go by them that they can lay hands upon i wish the money could be had from hill

that i have got cleveland  the hired people with him to pay also—i would not have you buy a single bushel of wheat till you can see with some kind of certainty what market the flour is to go to— if you cannot find sufficient employment in repairing the mill works  other things of this kind for mr roberts and thomas alford they must be closely imployed in making cask or working at the carpenters or other business otherwise they must be discharged for it is not reasonable as all mill business will probably be at an end for a while that i am to pay them £ 00 a year to be idle—i should think roberts himself must see  be sensible of this reasonableness of this request as i believe few millers will find imploymt if our ports are shut up  the wheat kept in the straw or otherwise for greater security— i will write to mr milnor to forward you a good country boulting cloth for simpson which endeavour to have contrived to him by the first safe conveyance—i wish you would quicken lanphire

clean ground although you should be late in doing it  if for no other purpose than a tryal—it is a growing i find as well as a new practice that of overseers keeping horses  for what purpose unless it be to make fat horses at my expence i know not as it is no saving of my own horses—i do not like the custom  wish you would break it—but do as you will as i cannot pretend to interfere at this distance remember me kindly to all the neighbors who enquire after yr affecte friend  servt          the washington family          after a century of spasmodic research the history of the ancestry of washington cannot be written with accuracy or fulness the records available are few and disconnected and until the year      an important link in the chain was wanting the old pedigree had been discredited and a new could not be framed it was not even known in what part of england the needed evidence on which to base the new tree could be looked for and in this wide field investigators must grope their way it was idle to conjecture for one guess was as good as another trickery and forgery were brought into the question and the usual accompanying nonsense which have thrown so much discredit upon genealogical writing nothing short of heroic origin must satisfy these charlatans and so odin is made the ancestor of washington and rurik of hamilton and all between is composed of facts where they can be found of manufactured evidence where required and of stupid and clumsy compilation where the imagination failed the result comes into the market to gull the public and mystify the reader while clouding the subject for the student i propose in this place to summarize what has been obtained in the century of investigation eliminating as far as   0 possible conjecture or so distinguishing the assured from the doubtful that no error can arise in this there is little original investigation and the labors of others are freely drawn upon full credit being given to each individual worker in december      sir isaac heard then garter king of arms in london wrote to washington that he had investigated the english ancestry of the president and desired to complete his record with such particulars as could be furnished by the family in america to gratify this request washington addressed a number of his relations asking them to supply what information they could copies of wills inscriptions on tombstones and any documents that could throw light upon the matter  from such replies as he received washington drew up a paper naturally imperfect and confined to the immigrants into virginia and their descendants of the english ancestry the president could only give a hint i have often heard others of the family older than myself say that our ancestor who first settled in this country came from some one of the northern counties of england but whether from lancashire yorkshire or one still more northerly i do not precisely remember  from the material at hand sir isaac prepared a tentative genealogical table which was sent to mount vernon but sir isaac became unable to pursue the matter and it was left in this incomplete condition     it was ascertained however that two brothers were the first of the family to emigrate settling in virginia washington believed that they came over about      and started from the north of england sir isaac found recorded in the visitation of northamptonshire of      the names of john and lawrence washington described as sons of lawrence washington of sulgrave who had died in      the year and the identity of names led sir isaac to believe that these were the brothers who emigrated and he traced the descent of the president through this family of northamptonshire from one still more ancient in lancashire this pedigree did not completely satisfy sir isaac who regarded it as conjectural and left a note distinctly stating that he was by no means certain if the connection with the sulgrave family was or even could be substantiated when baker prepared his history of northamptonshire he adopted the results obtained by sir isaac but omitted to express any doubt of its finality he asserted that the emigrant john son of lawrence washington of sulgrave was of south cave co york and that his brother lawrence was a student at oxford in      afterwards emigrating to america this pedigree of bakers passing into other compilations as authoritative came to be received as definite and complete mr sparks when compiling the writings of washington had access to all the manuscripts of sir isaac heard and with the assistance of some county histories prepared a statement of the origin     and genealogy of the washington family this account was published in the appendix to his first volume and while adding little of value to what the garter king of arms had discovered became the basis of subsequent investigation while the extended circulation of the volumes stamped the pedigree as of high authority an important link was however wanting sir isaac heard thought the emigrants came from northamptonshire and traced their ancestors to lancashire mr sparks found a parish called washington in durham where persons of the name had resided towards the close of the twelfth century it was supposed that the holder of the manor william de hertburn or some descendant assumed the local name a william de wessyngton was recorded as a witness about the middle of the thirteenth century  before   00 the manor had passed out of the male line of the family such remote and disconnected facts were of little service in determining the ancestors of the president in a direct line and mr sparks making a long leap from these early records located these ancestors in whitfield and wharton in the county of lancaster  in    0 a contribution to the subject was made by the rector of brington in northamptonshire in a     story entitled the washingtons a tale of a country parish in the   th century based on authentic documents the documents were found in the parish register and among the manuscripts at althorpe the residence of the spencers the author of this story mr john nassau simpkinson brought to light some curious entries from the account books of the spencer family relating to the washingtons and attempted to identify the very house in little brington which was occupied by them—an attempt that subsequent investigation proved to have been without result mr simpkinson also made some corrections in bakers pedigree of which i shall make use later it cannot be said however that the washingtons gave any reason for rejecting the baker table so far as the immediate ancestors of the president were concerned in      mr isaac j greenwood suggested that heard and baker must be in error on a very important point as the john and lawrence washington whom they believed to have emigrated to virginia were too old at the date of the emigration to take so active a part to obviate this difficulty mr greenwood advanced the supposition that the emigrants might have been the sons of sir william washington of packington the eldest son of lawrence washington of sulgrave his doubts of the correctness of the heardbaker pedigree were fully verified in an essay in destructive criticism by colonel joseph lemuel chester published in the herald and genealogist london september      and reprinted     in the new england historical and genealogical register boston      in this essay it was established that john the son of lawrence washington of sulgrave was sir john washington of thrapston who was twice married and whose second wife dame dorothy survived him so it was not possible for this john washington to have left the country and married in virginia as it was known the emigrant john did and as the greenwood supposition thus made an essential colonel chester also showed that the children of the two john washingtons were of different names those of sir john being mordaunt john and philip while those of the emigrant were john lawrence and anne as a further point against the heard pedigree he made the objection that lawrence brother of sir john was a clergyman of the established church and on a forced construction of a sentence in john walkers work on the sufferings of the clergy in the rebellion  asserted that lawrence continued in the profession of a clergyman in england for some years after the date of the emigration while lawrence the emigrant described himself as a gentleman which he would hardly do was he in holy orders     with this overturning in one point of the accepted pedigree which naturally cast doubt upon the whole colonel chester rested his case and sought for the evidence which would enable him to prepare a correct one to take its place in march      he published a letter in the new york world holding out a promise of something definite but he died before this promise was fulfilled and his papers and notes on the washingtons passed into other hands and have not yet been published colonel chesters researches seemed to point to locating the immediate ancestors of washington in northants in        mr henry f waters then engaged in genealogical research in england took as a starting point the letters of administration which had been granted in england on the goods of lawrence washington of virginia as

last will and testament     this andrew knowling it was inferred married the widowed mother of william roades amphillis washington elizabeth fitzherbert and susanna billing and while the name of the husband of amphillis washington was not given it was conjectured to be lawrence as the executor and residuary legatee in the will was called lawrence the younger tring is a village of hertfordshire only a few miles from luton in the adjoining county of bedford and upon visiting that parish mr waters found some entries in the parish register which confirmed these conjectures the next clue found was a record in the probate court of canterbury showing that letters of administration had been issued on   february      to john washington the nr̃all and lawfull sone of amphillis washington late of tring in the county of hertford dec̃d to ads̃ter the goodes chẽlls and debtes of the said dec̃d admon act book p c c        mr waters based upon this document and the entries on the tring register that mr lawrence washington husband of amphillis and father of john and lawrence had predeceased his wife and that john washington to whom the letters of admon issued was the eldest son as we have seen lawrence was baptized in the summer of      and elizabeth in      john could not have been born later than      and must have been at least twentyone years of age at the grant of admon and twentythree in      the date of the emigration it was still in question if these washingtons of tring john and lawrence were the emigrants to virginia and no light was thrown upon this question by the wills of william roades or elizabeth fitzherbert as the prefix mr on the church register indicated that lawrence washington was either a clergyman or a person of some importance mr waters suspected that he might be the lawrence washington who was the rector of purleigh described by col chester he determined to examine carefully the papers connected with the probate of andrew knowlings will and found a bond of guardianship of john dagnall dated    january      0 as guardian and curator of the two daughters of john and susanna billing mr waters continues i then saw a little bit of paper doubled or folded upon itself    covered with writing seeing at a glance that it was evidently an official memorandum of the issuing of the letters of guardianship and of the oath taken by mr dagnall for the faithful performance of his trust i did not read it through but at once     set about copying it in full little realizing the start of surprise and gratification i should experience when i should come to the end of what proved to be the most valuable and important bit of genealogical evidence that i ever saw or ever expect to see in the course of my gleanings this little memorandum was

in  0 editor illegible character here we have proof of identification and of the most positive and conclusive character there cannot be the least doubt that this lawrence washington ma was the husband of amphillis and the father of her children he was there in the archdeacons court at whethampsted evidently to protect the interests of that wife and those children who under the will presented and allowed in court that day were to receive the bulk of mr knowlings personal estate while the second son lawrence as the acknowledged heir of his godfather and the executor of his will was to inherit the real estate of the deceased and all the residuum of the personal estate after the debts legacies and funeral expenses and other charges should have been settled and paid there can be but little doubt that this same lawrence washington m a who was acting as temporary surrogate in the archdeacons court on this occasion was a clergyman for that court was an ecclesiastical one and the office of surrogate in testamentary courts was usually if not invariably held by a clergyman the   0 father of these children then was a clergyman and a master of arts we have record of only one lawrence washington to whom that would apply namely the fifth  son of lawrence washington of sulgrave brother of sir william washington of packington and of sir john washington of thrapston he was a student lector and fellow of brasenose and in      proctor of the university of oxford and afterwards rector of purleigh the long search after the true line of ancestry of our washington begun in      was practically brought to a successful close when that little paper was discovered on monday the third of june       since the publication of mr waters memoir a number of other facts have been discovered that must contribute to a final determination of this vexed question and there are rumors of important documents in the hands of individual investigators as yet unpublished at the present writing the facts seem to be as follows—first there is no doubt that the emigrants john and lawrence of virginia were the legatees under andrew knowlings will and that their mother was named amphillis second there is no moral doubt that their father was mr lawrence washington of tring third no trace has been found of any lawrence washington ma in that generation except the rector of purleigh fourth the rector of purleigh in all probability after his ejectment therefrom became a preacher at little braxted in essex and was buried january         at maldon co essex only three miles from purleigh fifth although it is possible that lawrence washington ma was present at court in      in the     interest of the children of a namesake or cousin yet this is a more violent supposition than that he was acting for his own children in      lawrence washington was ejected from purleigh in      he was apparently a poor man or at best a preacher in a living so small that few would accept of it if he were the husband of amphillis there was every reason for him to attend the probate court to look after the bequest to his children in      rev lawrence washington died in january       mrs washington of tring died and in february her son john was appointed administrator these latter dates all agree with the husband of amphillis who was most probably alive in january      0 when andrew knowling made his will we lack positive evidence that rev lawrence washington of purleigh was the husband of amphillis washington of tring but so far nothing has appeared to make the identity improbable and the

to dispose of £ 00 per annum which he often declared he intended to confer on petitioners father and mother for their lives and to charge it with £ 000 for petitioners younger children but sir henry browne and lady eyres persons of strait fortunes have put themselves upon petitioners uncle he being aged blind and otherwise infirm they cohabit with him and upon pretence that he was indebted £ 000 have removed him to a cottage in hampshire where they have obscured him these two or three years have caused the £ 00 per annum to be sold away the timber to be felled  the coppice wood to be destroyed the fences to be laid waste and have received his rents sold his plate and great part of his household stuff having ineffectually sought to restrain this waste through the lord keeper and unwilling to incense his uncle by a suit sir john appeals to the king the referees in effect denied the petition and further found sir henry brown faultless in all those things wherewith he is charged

daughter of — roades of middle claydon buckinghamshire mr waters working upon the mention of william roades in the will of andrew knowling traced that family to middle claydon and connected them with the verneys in june      william roades held the position of bailiff at middle claydon and william or john roades was in the service of sir edmund verney—or both were in service  amphillis was believed to     have been a daughter of one of these servants the same evidence seems to show that it was a match which would not be likely to meet with the approval of the rest of the family allied as they were to the villiers sandys pargiter verney and other families then in good social standing and in connection with this it is worth noting that i have thus far seen no mention of mr lawrence washington in any of the wills of the family or their connections after this marriage which must have been soon after the resignation of the fellowship march       this connection with william roades is however more than doubtful in november      he was ejected from the living of purleigh by order of parliament as a malignant royalist the charges laid against him were given in the first century of scandalous malignant priests made and admitted into benefices by the prelates in whose hands the ordination of ministers and government of the church hath been published by john white and printed by george miller by order of parliament    november      the case of mr washington was ninth in the list the benefice of lawrence washington rector of purleigh in the county of essex is sequestered for that he is a common frequenter of alehouses not onlly himselfe sitting dayly tippling there but also incouraging others in that beastly vice and hath been oft drunk and hath said that the parliament have more papists belonging to them in their armies than the king had about him or in his army and that the parliaments armie did more hurt than the cavaliers and that they did none at all and hath published them to be traitours that lend to or assist the parliament so violent a partisan as the compiler of the first century can hardly be accepted without question even on a statement of fact the clergy of that day     had among their number some who were no ornaments to the order and drunkenness was by no means the least common of their failings mr waters found in john walkers sufferings of the clergy the following comment upon the case of lawrence washington am purleigh r one of the best livings in these parts to which he had been admitted in march      and was sequestered from in the year      which was not thought punishment enough for him and therefore he was also put into the century to be transmitted to posterity as far as that infamous pamphlet could contribute to it for a scandalous as well as a malignant minister upon these weighty considerations that he had said the parliament have more papists belonging to them in their armies than the king had about him or in his army and that the parliaments army did more hurt than the cavaliers and that they did none at all and had published them to the traytors that lent to or assisted the parliament it is not to be supposed that such a malignant could be less than a drunkard and accordingly he is charged with frequent commissions of that sin and not only so but with encouraging others in that beastly vice altho a gentleman a justice of the peace in this country who personally knew him assures me that he took him to be a worthy pious man that as often as he was in his company he always appeared a very modest sober person and that he was recommended as such by several gentlemen who were acquainted with him before he himself was adding withal that he was a loyal person and had one of the best benefices in these parts and this was the only cause of his expulsion as i verily believe after which he subjoyns that another ancient gentleman of his neighborhood agrees with him in this account mr washington was afterwards permitted to have and continue upon a living in these parts but it was such a poor and miserable one that it was always with difficulty that anyone was persuaded to accept of it     upon consulting the copy of the sufferings in the bodleian library mr waters found the original letter on which walker based his statement it was written by henry ayloffe of the same family as is mentioned on p     ante and was probably written in   0  in it he said i doe not remember that ever i knew or heard of mr washington after he had been sequestered but there was then one mr roberts a neighbor of mine who was owner and patron of a parish so small that nobody would accept of his church but with difficulty and mr roberts entertained mr washington where he was suffered quietly to preach i have heard him and tooke him to be a very worthy pious man i have been in his company there and he appeared a very modest sober person and i heard him recommended as such by several gentlemen who knew him before i did he was a loyal person and had one of the best benefices in these parts and this was the only cause of his expulsion as i verily believe a reference to the last nearly illegible paragraph by walker enabled mr waters to decipher the word braxted and braxted parva was such a living as walker says washington retired to it was held by thomas roberts and was presented by him in    0 to mr white in     to lawrence washington and after washingtons death to nehemiah rogers father of john rogers who had succeeded lawrence at purleigh it was in      that john rogers was

lawrence   john  robert  john  born        emigrated to america and is supposed to have gone first to barbadoes the reasons for this belief are summarized in the following paragraph now let me say why i think that the first emigrant might have visited barbados the reference to cosen john in theodore pargiters will suggests the formers being at barbados a reference to page    of the ancestry of washington by mr waters shows that whereas mrs washington the mother of the first emigrant was buried on the   th of january      it was not till the  th of february      that letters of administration     were issued to her son john if that son was not absent from england and in foreign parts why was there so long an interval as did elapse the pargiters were connected with barbados on the   st of may      the council of state granted a license to thomas pargiter to export to barbados fifty dozen of shoes and twelve nags see calendar of state papers colonial        0 p  0  in      thomas pargiter was a member of the assembly of barbados see calendar colonial      to      p     the fact that tom verney was longer in barbados than in virginia may be alleged with equal reason for a kinsmans going to barbados just as it has been urged as a link drawing the first emigrant to the old dominion that the neerdoweel tom had been an early settler in the latter country again in      old style among the settlers in barbados was captain gerard hawtayne of calthorpe in the county of oxford who was a son or grandson of margaret washington who is noted in the pedigree attached to the pamphlet of mr waters as having married gerard hawtayne of esington oxon it is clear from theodore pargiters words that john washington was beyond seas about      and equally clear that he was thought to be in barbados then there were the pargiter verney and hawtayne connections with barbados and why so long in obtaining letters of administration to his mothers will unless he were far over sea—in fact as dryden has it in  far barbados on the western main  it is not only possible but probable that the first washington emigrant went to barbadoes as the prospects of improving his condition were favorable in the early years of that island the settlement was a slow process prejudiced by the claims of the then lord chamberlain philip earl of pembroke and the earl of carlisle this matter being determined and great encouragement being had from the dutch     the colony increased in importance in      after it had been planted    years there were   000 effective men english inhabitants of

0000 the buildings in      were mean with things only for necessity but in      plate jewels and household stuff were estimated at £ 00000 their buildings very fair and beautiful and their houses like castles their sugar houses and negroes huts show themselves from the sea like so many small towns each defended by its castle in spite of this apparent prosperity the colony was being depopulated due to the monopoly of the land in a few hands and the factions among the planters and slave labor between      and        00 had gone to new england and  00 to trinidad and tobago between      and        00 to virginia and surinam while nearly  0000 had been sent on military expeditions and either settled in other parts or perished the tradition was as stated by washington that john emigrated in

to command the armies of your country and though all who are attached to you will from attachment as well as public considerations deplore an occasion which should once more tear you from that repose to which you have so good a right yet it is the opinion of all those with whom i converse that you will be compelled to make the sacrifice all your past labors may demand to give them efficacy this further this very great sacrifice—hamilton to washington    may        the present dangerous crisis of public affairs makes one anxious to know the sentiments of our citizens in different parts of this commonwealth and no one has a better opportunity to form an opinion of the central part thereof than yourself this will be my apology for giving you the trouble of a letter at this time several counties above the blue ridge have come forward with warm addresses and strong professions of support from norfolk two meetings one good the other bad have had their proceedings detailed in the gazettes meetings have taken place in a few of the middle counties with unpromising results and an invitation was given for one in daviss paper of the   th to be held in richmond but i have heard nothing more concerning it let not any inquiries or gratifications of mine interfere with your more important concerns the devotion of a moment or two of leisure will suffice for dear sir—washington to edward carrington  0 may        dr belknap died suddenly on the  0th of june only five days after the above letter was written   see the introduction to blands fragment on the pistole fee claimed by the governor of virginia      edited by me   incomplete   on the   th of may a law was passed by congress authorizing the president in the event of a declaration of war against the united states or of actual invasion of their territory by a foreign power or of imminent danger of such invasion discovered in his opinion to exist before the next session of congress to cause to be enlisted and to call into actual service a number of troops not exceeding ten thousand noncommissioned officers musicians and privates to be enlisted for a term not exceeding three years authority was also given to the president to organize the army with a suitable number of majorgenerals and other officers into corps of artillery cavalry and infantry and in short to make every arrangement for preparing the forces for actual service this was called a provisional army the measure was adopted in consequence of the threatening aspect of affairs between france and the united states the causes and particulars are briefly stated in marshalls life of washington vol v pp          in forming an army said the president in his letter to which the above is an answer whenever i must come to that extremity i am at an immense loss whether to call on all the old generals or to appoint a young set if the french come here we must learn to march with a quick step and to attack for in that way only they are said to be vulnerable i must tax you sometimes for advice we must have your name if you will in any case permit us to use it there will be more efficacy in it than in many an army before the above answer to the presidents letter was received by him that is on the  d of july he nominated to the senate george washington of mount vernon to be lieutenantgeneral and commanderinchief of all the armies raised and to be raised in the united states the nomination was unanimously confirmed by the senate the next day   alexander hamilton   he had not yet returned from his mission to france   a paragraph containing the reasons is omitted being precisely the same as in the letter to mr pickering dated july   th see p      on this point the secretary of war replied i enclose the act for augmenting the army of the united states you will see that it does not provide for a quartermastergeneral and that the provisional army law provides that the quartermastergeneral under it shall have the rank and pay of lieutenantcolonel only i thought it best therefore that no quartermastergeneral should be appointed till congress meet again when they may amend the act—august  st   john sevier governor of tennessee   from dr andersons letter i have been urged to engage once more in a literary enterprise and it begins to wear such a seducing aspect that i am not certain but i may be drawn into it agriculture is proposed to be one principal department of the work natural history another by which i mean a general view of the phenomena of nature the causes of these as far as they are known and their influence in this universe this is a noble and inexhaustible theme to engage a man advancing in years who wishes to free himself as much as he can from those little objects which form the perplexities of life the remaining part of the work will be appropriated to miscellaneous disquisitions on arts and literature it will be a monthly periodical i am particularly fond of that mode of publication because truth can thus be gradually impressed on the mind by little and little—london february  th this was probably the work entitled recreations in agriculture begun by dr anderson in april      and continued through six volumes   infantry   the secretary of war replied the president desires me to inform you that he considers you in the public service from the date of your appointment and entitled to all the emoluments of it that you are at liberty to receive all or any part at your discretion that you are fully authorized to appoint your aids and secretaries when you shall think fit that one secretary at least is indispensable immediately and that he ought to be allowed his pay and rations you will be pleased therefore to make any or all of these appointments when you may judge proper—trenton august   th   a paragraph is here omitted which is so much defaced in the manuscript as not to be intelligible it relates to what general knox had said respecting the unequal distribution of the general officers in different parts of the country   james mchenry   more delay and embarrassment than usual occurred at this time in transmitting letters between general washington and the members of the cabinet on account of the removal of the public offices to trenton caused by the breaking out of the yellow fever in philadelphia the president was likewise on a

custis was placed in the annapolis college washington wrote mr custis possesses competent talents to fit him for any studies but they are counteracted by an indolence of mind which renders it difficult to draw them into action doctor stuart having been an attentive observer of this i shall refer you to him for the development of the causes while justice from me requires i should add that i know of no vice to which his inertness can be attributed from drinking and gaming he is perfectly free and if he has a propensity to any other impropriety it is hidden from me he is generous and regardful of truth as his family fortune and talents if the latter can be improved give him just pretensions to become a useful member of society in the councils of his country his friends and none more than myself are extremely desirous that his education should be liberal polished and adapted to this end—washington to mcdowell   march        the enclosed was written at the time of its date and with mr custis i expected would have left this the next morning for st johns college but although he professed his readiness to do whatever was required of him his unwillingness to return was too apparent to afford any hope that good would result from it in the prosecution of his studies and therefore as i have now a gentleman living with me who has abilities adequate thereto will have sufficient leisure to attend to it and has promised to do so accordingly i thought best upon the whole to keep him here—washington to mcdowell    september        from france   in my opinion as the matter now stands general knox is legally entitled to rank next to general washington and no other arrangement will give satisfaction if general washington is of this opinion and will consent to it you may call him into actual service as soon as you please the consequence of this will be that pinckney must rank before hamilton    you may depend upon it the five new england states will not patiently submit to the humiliation that has been meditated for them—john adams to james mchenry    august      the president is determined to place hamilton last and knox first i have endeavored all in my power to preserve your arrangements but without effect you shall be informed in a short time of the course of this business i know not how it will be received and can only hope that he will not refuse to serve—mchenry to washington   september        the draft of this letter was sent to mchenry for his information   the letter written by mr wolcott to the president of the united states and the representation made by me to him so soon as i received official information of the change intended by him in the relative rank of the majorgenerals and of his departure in almost every other instance from what i considered a solemn compact and the only terms on which i would by an acceptance of the commission hazard every thing dear and valuable to me will soon bring matters to a close so far as it respects myself but until the final result of them is known the less there is said on the subject the better—washington to pickering  0 october        the last mail to alexandria brought me a letter from the president of the united states in which i am informed that he had signed and given the commissions to yourself generals pinckney and knox the same date in hopes that an amicable adjustment or acquiescence might take place among you but if these hopes should be disappointed and controversies should arise they will of course be submitted to me as commanderinchief and if after all any one should be so obstinate as to appeal to him from the judgment of the commanderinchief he was determined to confirm that judgment general knox is fully acquainted with my sentiments on this subject and i hope no fresh difficulties will arise with general pinckney let me entreat you therefore to give without delay your full mind to the secy of war—washington to hamilton    october        from this letter it appeared that a final determination had at length passed in regard to the relative rank of the majorgenerals and that the commissions had been made out according to the first plan the following is an extract war department october   th the president on the  0th of september enclosed to me commissions for the three majorgenerals of the army signed and dated on the same day when i considered the communications which may be expected from this department at the time of presenting his commission to each of the generals i found myself embarrassed respecting the course he meant i should pursue on the occasion it was my earnest wish to avoid the renewal of a subject that had already been attended with too many unpleasant circumstances by returning the question upon him for more precise instructions after considerable deliberation therefore and as the most respectful course to him i at last was induced to transmit the commissions to generals hamilton and knox and to inform them that i considered the order of nomination and approval by the senate as determining their relative rank i have also my dear sir written to generals hamilton and knox calling them into service and soliciting their presence as soon as possible and in all events by the  0th of november i suggested also to the president that it would be desirable i should be authorized to require your attendance and that his own presence would be important and give facility to all measures relative to this meeting   my opinion is that in making a selection of the fieldofficers an entire range of the state should be taken but in the company officers regard should be had to distribution as well for the purpose of facilitating the recruiting service as for other considerations and where officers of celebrity in the revolutionary army can be obtained who are yet in the prime of life habituated to no bad courses and welldisposed that a preference ought to be given to them next to these gentlemen of character liberal education and as far as the fact can be ascertained from inexperience men who will face danger in any shape in which it can appear for if we have a land war it will be sharp and severe i must beg leave to add that all violent opposers of the government and french partisans should be avoided or they will disseminate the poison of their principles in the army and split what ought to be a band of brothers into parties—washington to william r davie    october        a maryland clergyman who feared lest the masonic lodges in the united states might be infected with the views of the illuminati   minister resident from the united states in holland   the mission of dr logan under the auspices as it was supposed of mr jefferson was a fertile topic of conjecture and discussion in the party politics of the day while general washington was in philadelphia concerting with the majorgenerals and secretary of war the arrangements of the army dr logan called on him the following memorandum of the interview written down by general washington at the time is perhaps more curious as exhibiting a trait of his character than important for the historical matter it contains tuesday november   th     —mr lear my secretary being from our lodgings on business one of my servants came into the room where i was writing and informed me that a gentleman in the parlour below desired to see me no name was sent up in a few minutes i went down and found the rev dr blackwell and dr logan there i advanced towards and gave my hand to the former the latter did the same towards me i was backward in giving mine he possibly supposing from hence that i did not recollect him said his name was logan finally in a very cool manner and with an air of marked indifference i gave him my hand and asked dr blackwell to be seated the other took a seat at the same time i addressed all my conversation to dr blackwell the other all his to me to which i only gave negative or affirmative answers as laconically as i could except asking how mrs logan did he seemed disposed to be very polite and while dr blackwell and myself were conversing on the late calamitous fever offered me an asylum at his house if it should return or i thought myself in any danger in the city and two or three rooms by way of accommodation i thanked him slightly observing there would be no call for it about this time dr blackwell took his leave we all rose from our seats and i moved a few paces towards the door of the room expecting the other would follow and take his leave also instead of which he kept his ground and proceeded to inform me more particularly for he had mentioned it before that he had seen general lafayette at hamburg and his lady and daughter i think in france and related many things concerning them he said something also respecting an interview he had had with our minister mr murray in holland but as i remained standing and showed the utmost inattention to what he was saying i do not now recollect what the import of it was except that he hurried from thence to paris his object being he said to get there before the departure of our commissioners as he called them he observed that the situation of our affairs in this country and the train they were in with respect to france had induced him to make the voyage in hope or expectation or words to that effect of contributing to their amelioration this drew my attention more pointedly to what he was saying and induced me to remark that there was something very singular in this that he who could only be viewed as a private character unarmed with proper powers and presumptively unknown in france should suppose he could effect what three gentlemen of the first respectability in our country specially charged under the authority of the government were unable to do with this observation he seemed a little confounded but recovering said that not more than five persons had any knowledge of his going that he was furnished by mr jefferson and mr mckean with certificates of his citizenship and that m merlin president of the directory of france had discovered the greatest desire that france and america should be on the best terms i answered that he was more fortunate than our envoys for they could neither be received nor heard by m merlin or the directory that if the powers of france were serious in their professions there was a plain and effectual way by which that object could be accomplished namely to repeal all the obnoxious arrêts by which the commerce and rights of this country had been invaded put an end to further depredations on both and make restitution for the injuries we had received a conduct like this i said would speak more forcibly than words for the latter never made an impression on my mind when they were contradicted by actions he said that the directory was apprehensive that this country the government of it or our envoys i am not now sure which he meant or alluded to was not well disposed towards france i asked what better evidence could be given in refutation of this opinion than its longsuffering of the outrageous conduct of that nation towards the united states and despatching three gentlemen of unquestionable worth with ample powers to reconcile all differences even at the expense of great sacrifices on our part and asked him if the directory looked upon us as worms not even allowed to turn when trod upon for it was evident to all the world that we had borne and forborne beyond what even common respect for ourselves permitted he replied that they had taken off the embargo and were making restitution of property mentioning one instance i think with respect to the embargo i observed that taking it off or continuing it on was a matter of no great importance if as i had been informed our vessels in french ports were few he said that the attempt at a coalition of european powers against france would come to nothing that the directory were under no apprehensions on that ground and that great britain would have to contend alone insinuating as i conceived his object at the time to be that we should be involved in a dangerous situation if we persisted in our hostile appearances to this i finally replied that we were driven to those measures in selfdefence and i hoped the spirit of this country would never suffer itself to be injured with impunity by any nation under the sun to this he said he told citizen merlin that if the united states were invaded by france they would unite to a man to oppose the invaders talleyrand expressly disclaimed having received logan as a secret agent or the doctors having any political relations with the french government john adams also received a visit from this selfconstituted envoy for it does not appear that jefferson was active in the mission and has recorded the incident in his writings viii     ix     congress on  0 january      passed a law known as the logan act subjecting

following disposition with regard to the superintendence of our military forces and posts all those in the states south of maryland in tennessee and kentucky are placed under the direction of majorgeneral pinckney those everywhere else under my direction to which he has added the general care of the recruiting service the commencement of the business of recruiting however is still postponed for the reason as assigned by the secretary that a supply of clothing is not yet ready in conformity with your ideas i have directed general wilkinson to repair to the seat of government in order to a more full examination of the affairs of the western scene and to the concerting of ulterior arrangements on this and on every other subject of our military concerns i shall be happy to receive from time to time such suggestions and instructions as you may be pleased to communicate i shall regularly advise you of the progress of things and especially of every material occurrence   in his message of    june      president adams said i will never send another minister to france without assurances that he will be received respected and honored as the representative of a great free powerful and independent nation in a note to pichon the french agent in holland dated  th vendemiaire    september talleyrand echoed the last words of this sentence and held out the promise that a minister from the united states would be properly received in paris this note was given by pichon to murray who transmitted it to america without consulting any member of his cabinet or giving any intimation of his intention adams on february   th sent to the senate the name of william vans murray to be minister plenipotentiary to the french republic such a step was as unexpected to the federalists as it was to the republicans and called out severe criticism the president wrote pickering to washington was suffering the torments of the damned at the consequences of his nomination sedgwick characterized the measure in strong language had the foulest heart and the ablest head in the world have been permitted to select the most embarrassing and ruinous measures perhaps it would have been the one which has been adopted hamilton thought the step in all its circumstances would astonish if anything from that quarter could astonish and suggested a commission of three the nomination was referred to a committee who took the unusual step of calling upon the president but found him determined he said however that if the senate should negative the nomination of murray he would join with him two other individuals who were not to leave for france until direct assurances of a good reception had been received while the report of the committee advising the rejection of murray was being drawn a message came from adams nominating oliver ellsworth chief justice of the supreme court and patrick henry of virginia with murray under the condition just stated the senate confirmed the appointments but was unanimous only on murray henry declined to serve and his place was filled by william r davie of north carolina nominated   december        major caleb gibbs   to this letter the secretary of war answered in detail explaining all the principal points and enumerating the difficulties with which he had to contend some of which were formidable you will no doubt perceive he added in conclusion that the situation into which i have been thrown during the last year by others who prevented all those measures from being carried into effect which the public expected would necessarily take place in conformity to the laws could not fail to attach to me much censure and excite in the minds of persons who could not be informed of the facts that i wanted capacity for the proper conducting of my department what could i do in such a case i have submitted to a censure which those who know all ought to relieve me from on every fair occasion where it can be done with propriety—march   st   from an observation of yours in answer to my letter of the   d ulto i perceive my meaning with respect to relative rank has been misunderstood or if taken properly i must adhere to the opinion i gave of the injustice which would be inflicted upon the officers of states remote from the seat of government if those in the vicinity of it are to rank before them because they were on the spot to announce their acceptance of their appointments at an earlier day rank and pay are distinct things the officer who may have received the latter today sustains no injury from him who received it yesterday but if the commencement of rank in the same grades is to be regulated under the circumstances i have mentioned from the dates of their acceptances it will have injustice stamped on the face of it for in that case those who are most remote not by any act avoidable in themselves but from the nature of things become in almost every instance juniors when perhaps many of them in consideration of former services or other weighty pretensions might justly be entitled to seniority—washington to mchenry   may        among other obstacles that interposed to retard the recruiting service the secretary of war mentioned the ground taken by the president as affording less encouragement than he expected when i spoke of the time we had lost said he after all my proposals for augmenting the army had been rejected or procrastinated what was the reply of the president on the   th of october he observed as to the recruiting service i wonder whether there has been any enthusiasm which would induce men of common sense to enlist for five dollars a month who could have fifteen when they pleased by sea or for common work at land there has been no rational plan that i have seen as yet formed for the maintenance of the army one thing i know that regiments are costly articles everywhere and more so in this country than in any other under the sun if this nation sees a great army to maintain without an enemy to fight there may arise an enthusiasm that seems to be little foreseen —march   st   the secretary of war wrote afterwards that mr mercer did not accept the appointment but without stating on what grounds he declined   additional light is thrown upon some of the topics which are here discussed in a letter from general hamilton to the commanderinchief written a few days afterwards at length he says the recruiting for the additional regiments has begun in connecticut new york new jersey pennsylvania and delaware the enclosed return of clothing will sufficiently explain to you that it has commenced at least as soon as the preparations by the department of war would permit it might now also proceed in maryland and massachusetts and the next post will i trust enable me to add virginia but that i do not think it expedient to outgo our supply of clothing it will have the worst possible effect if the recruits are to wait a length of time for their clothing i anticipate your mortification at such a state of things various causes are supposed to contribute to it it is said that the president has heretofore not thought it of importance to accelerate the raising of the army and it is well understood that the secretary of the treasury is not convinced of its utility yet he affirms that for a long time past he has been ready and willing to give every aid depending on his department the secretary of war imputes the deficiency in the article of clothing to a failure of a contract which he had made and to the difficulty of suddenly finding a substitute by purchases in the market it is however obvious that the means which have been since pursued have not been the best calculated for despatch the materials procured at distant places have been brought to philadelphia to be made up they are stated to be adequate in quantity if the secretarys energies for execution were equal to his good dispositions the public service under his care would prosper as much as could be desired it is only to be regretted that good dispositions will not alone suffice and that in the nature of things there can be no reliance that the future progress will be more satisfactory than the past the officers for north carolina have been appointed no nomination has yet come forward from south carolina not a single fieldofficer has yet been appointed for the regiment to be raised in new hampshire vermont and rhode island it seems the members of congress dissuaded from the nomination of those who were proposed by the general officers and promised to recommend preferable characters but this promise has not been performed this want of organization is an obstacle to the progress of the affairs of this regiment it is understood that the president has resolved to appoint the officers to the provisional army and that the secretary has thought fit to charge the senators of each state with the designation of characters—new york may  d   as a delegate to congress   you may possibly have seen a paragraph in a late publication stating that several important offices in the gift of the executive and among others that of secretary of state had been attainable by me few of the unpleasant occurrences produced by my declaration as a candidate for congress and they have been very abundant have given me more real chagrin than this to make a parade of proffered offices is a vanity which i trust i do not possess but to boast of one never in my power would argue a littleness of mind at which i ought to blush i know not how the author may have acquired his information but i beg leave to assure you that he never received it directly nor indirectly from me i had no previous knowledge that such a publication was designed or i would certainly have suppressed so much of it as relates to this subject the writer was unquestionably actuated by a wish to serve me and by resentment at the various malignant calumnies which have been so profusely bestowed on me one of these was that i only wished a seat in congress for the purpose of obtaining some office which my devotion to the administration might procure to repel this was obviously the motive of the indiscreet publication i so much regret a wish to rescue myself in your opinion from the imputation of an idle vanity which forms if i know myself no part of my character will i trust apologize for the trouble this explanation may give you—marshall to washington  st may        the elections of generals lee and marshall are grateful to my feelings i wish however both of them had been elected by greater majorities but they are elected and that alone is pleasing as the tide is turned i hope it will come in with a full flow but this will not happen if there is any relaxation on the part of the federalists we are sure there will be none on the part of the republicans as they have very erroneously called themselves it is apprehended latterly that mr hancock will not carry his election and that in numbers we shall not exceed nine in point of abilities i think the superiority will be greatly on the side of federalism—washington to bushrod washington  th may

he is not understood to have consulted either of his ministers certainly not either the secretary of war or of finance all my calculations lead me to regret the measure i hope that it may not in its consequences involve the united states in a war on the side of france with her enemies my trust in providence which has so often interposed in our favor is my only consolation—hamilton to washington    october      the purport of your private letter of the   st with respect to a late decision has surprised me exceedingly i was surprised at the measure how much more so at the manner of it this business seems to have commenced in an evil hour and under unfavorable auspices and i wish mischief may not tread in all its steps and be the final result of the measure a wide door was open through which a retreat might have been made from the first faux pas the shutting of which to those who are not behind the curtain and are as little acquainted with the secrets of the cabinet as i am is from the present aspect of european affairs quite incomprehensible but i have the same reliance on providence which you express and trust that matters will end well however unfavorable they may appear at present—washington to hamilton    october      as men will view the same thing in different lights i would now fain hope that the president has caught the true one and that good will come from the mission which is about to depart these are my wishes and no one is more ardent in them but i see nothing in the present aspect of european affairs on which to build them nor any possible evil under the same circumstances which could result from delay but as the measure is resolved on i trust as you do that that providence which has directed all our steps hitherto will continue to direct them to the consummation of our prosperity and happiness—washington to pickering   november        see hamiltons pamphlet on john adams printed in his writings lodges edition vi  0    on the evening of this

supposed it to be but a violent inflammation of the membranes of the throat which it had almost closed and which if not immediately arrested would result in death you must remember he was averse to bleeding the general and i have often thought that if we had acted according to his suggestion when he said he needs all his strength—bleeding will diminish it and taken no more blood from him our

resolutions he said it had now become improper for him to offer them and wished me to take them as i had not written anything myself and was pleased with his resolutions which i entirely approved i told him i would offer them the next day when i should state to the house of representatives the confirmation of the melancholy intelligence received the preceding day i did so you will see the facts

and it was there that washingtons legacy was received in      out of respect to the benefactor the name was changed to washington academy and in   0  on the destruction of the old academy by fire a new one was located within the limits of lexington where it has since remained the prosperity of the academy was interrupted by the civil war and at the peace it was again organized under the

custis presented to andrew jackson then president a pocket telescope used by washington during the revolution general jackson received the relic in a manner peculiarly impressive which showed that however time hard service and infirmity may have impaired a frame no longer young the heart was still entire and alive to the heroic and generous feelings of the soldier the patriot and the friend—national intelligencer quoted in partons life of andrew jackson iii    the remarkable number of telescopes in washingtons possession or so described since his death led me to suspect that he had an opportunity of looting the stock of some instrument maker or had access to the laboratory of some institution of learning the latter was the case in the journals of the new york provincial congress under date   august      is the following entry a letter from john berrien and henry wilmot esqrs dated and received yesterday was read and filed they therein mention that they had by application to the reverend mr inglis obtained the telescope belonging to the college for the use of his excellency general george washington and delivered to his aiddecamp whom the general had sent to receive it that mr inglis readily consented to the delivery of it and the general had been anxious to obtain it   this account of the bible was an error on washingtons part thomas wilson bishop of sodor and man died   march      in      appeared the bible with notes by thomas wilson dd lord bishop of sodor and man and various renderings collected from other translations by the rev clement cruttwell the editor bath       to   vols this was the edition that the son also named thomas wilson presented to washington the presentation must have occurred immediately after the revolution for the son died at bath in april      he was chiefly notable by his extravagant appreciation of mrs macaulay whose statue in the costume of the goddess of liberty he erected in his own church it is very probable that the bible was sent over at the time that dr wilson sent to congress a number of copies of his fathers works which were distributed among the delegates journals of congress    march      these volumes passed by the will of bryan fairfax into the possession of john c herbert a grandson of fairfaxs sister sarah fairfax carlyle a son of john c herbert edward herbert becoming straitened

summers a member of congress that he had in his possession two of the swords the one devised to him by his father william augustine washington and the other by his uncle judge bushrod washington there were others in the possession of george lewis and george steptoe washington and the fifth was offered by samuel t washington a son of samuel to the government      my father continued george c washington was entitled to the first choice under the will but was prevented by indisposition from attending at mount vernon when the distribution took place and judge washington selected for him the most finished and costly sword with which associations were connected highly complimentary to general washington but i often heard my father say that he would have preferred the sword selected by colonel samuel washington from the fact that it was used by the general during the revolutionary war i have at different times heard similar statements as to this fact made by colonel samuel washington judge washington and major lawrence lewis and am not aware that it has been questioned by any member of the family the sword was represented to me as being a couteau with a plain green ivory handle this particular sword was said to have been worn by washington during the revolution and again      when he took command of the army against the whiskey insurrection this sword is now in the department of state washington the handle is of ivory colored a pale green and wound spirally at wide intervals with silver wire it was manufactured by j bailey fishkill dutchess county new york and has the makers name engraved upon the hilt—custis recollections   0 a second sword was at mount vernon in      and was described by lossing as the spanish dresssword worn by washington when he was president of the united states and which appears in stuarts full length portrait of him at that time it has a finely gilt hilt and black leather scabbard gilt mounted on one side of the blade are the words recti fac et ice—do what is right on the other neminem timeas—fear no man  this sword in a much injured condition was sold at auction in philadelphia    april      for   00 the catalogue states during the late civil war this sword with a lot of other valuables was hid in a pigeon house where it was so injured by rust that the scabbard was destroyed and the blade so rusted that it obliterated the inscription about five inches of the lower portion of the blade has been broken off but is joined to the other part of the blade by a gold band the goldplated top of the scabbard is missing the hilt of the sword and other trappings are gold plated this sword was the one selected by judge bushrod washington a third sword that selected by george steptoe washington is now in the possession of miss alice l riggs of washington d c see vol xiii     this sword also has suffered much owing to burial during the late war by the washingtons it was among the relics exhibited at new york in      a fourth sword that selected for william augustine washington passed into the possession of his son george corbin washington and from him to that of lewis william washington his wife ella bassett washington sold it with other relics to the state library of new york where it now is it is described in the report of the library for      as the dress sword of washington it is a straight pointed blade with hilt and chain of polished steel dotted with steel beads the present case of green turkey morocco is not the original that was of white shagreen or shark skin it was cleaned and covered in      in baltimore by s jackson cutler to the new york exhibition of      miss virginia t lewis of baltimore contributed a dress sword described as follows it has a handsome filigree handle and guard with swordknot to correspond the rapierblade sheathed in a sheepskin or white parchment scabbard which is silvermounted washington wore this sword when resigning his commission as commanderinchief of the army in annapolis december         and when inaugurated in new york april  0      and afterward on all state and dress occasions this is probably the sword received by george lewis though i am unable to identify it positively no reply being received to my inquiries a sword was exhibited in new york in      as one that had been presented to washington by majorgeneral william darke upon application to mr thornton a washington who exhibited the sword he very courteously gave me the following information the sword was not one of the five swords mentioned in george washingtons will it

william in the meantime sarah had lived upon the place married christopher conoway and after his death conveyed the land to augustine washington    june      by his will he left it to his son samuel

than sixty years after establishing the maryland works the company were negotiating the purchase of some of augustine washingtons land in virginia and in      a furnace at accokeek in king george county fourteen miles from fredericksburg was located augustines connection with the company probably dates from this purchase and he doubtless received a share in the undertaking a contract for raising the ore and carting it to the furnace and probably a bonus mentioned in the following letter as to ye deviding of ye shares of ye new founded works in virginia have advised with a counselor
