humanity the darling prize which must to ages consecrate their fame pathetic lettsom many a lisping babe shall bless the man who kindly gave it life who snatched its mother from a watery grave dr lettsom was one of the first promoters of that benevolent institution the humane society established in this kingdom by dr hawes  and to a husband gave a newborn wife if deeds like these may merit christian love record them angels in the realms above strand aug   pieces relative to the progress of the design of paying a public grateful tribute to the character of mr howard  taken from the gentlemans magazine for may may    mr urban true glory guides no echoing car  as is now exemplified in the noiseless tenor of the way long pursued in his going about doing good by the most truly glorious of mortal beings when i give him this title i flatter myself that but few of your readers will want to be informed that i mean the consummate philanthropist who who has so fully and feelingly demonstrated that indeed nothing human is alien from him by having given himself up to the softening the sorrows and sufferings of some of the most unworthy as well as of the most unfortunate of our race in that to the horrors of a prison where the iron so often enters into the soul horrors should not be added urged by strong benevolence of soul from his pleasant home and his more pleasant friends who i should suppose do honor him but just on this side idolatry he is now instead of rattling in a triumphal car gliding tranquilly on the sea apparently but an obscure passenger amidst all the wants of ease and accommodation at about  0 years of age in a common vessel to dare the vile contagion of the turks and if he cannot purge their air of pestilence to try at least to correct its virulence retard its progress and be blessed by thousands saved from untimely death in the only hour that i had ever the happiness and the honor of his conversation two months ago in italy i did all but worship him he was then at rome which for once saw but knew him not a true vicar of the god of mercy by whom the man that when his fellow creature was in prison came unto him and performed other acts of charity shall be placed on the right hand of his throne and was going to visit the lazarettos at naples and at malta and thence to constantinople he will be absent somewhat above a year he cherishes a hope that the means he has discovered to check the influence of the jail infection will be efficacious likewise against the plague and to make the trial abandons his comforts and risks his life glorious man godfulfil his hope and send him sase back to be still an ornament to human nature in general and in porticular to this glorious country which produced him and which an accomplished daughter of it has lately told us she has the daily delight to hear applanded in others as eminently just generous and humane i please myself with thinking what a host will join me in the wish but shall we be content with giving him but empty words and not avail ourselves of the only opportunity which in all probability we can ever have till he rest from his godlike labors of doing ourselves honor in doing to speak humanly a solid and a solemn one to him suppose mr urban you were to erect a statue to him entertaining as great an opinion of the glorious possibilities of the english character as lord chatham could do of those of the english constitution i persuade myself that you would be quickly furnished with the means in only calling by the publication of the hint in your next magazine but for a single guinea though the opulent need not be stinted upon those of the just generous and humane amongst us who can easily afford themselves the pleasure of giving a testimony to their exalted sense of what our nature owes to mr howard how truly has he ennobled the name before this glorious man arose what has been ever done for mankind by all the blood of all the howards ye little stars hide your diminished rays more i think will be furnished than is requisite to erect a statue the overplus will go almost selfdirected to the jails a bust or picture of him for a sculptor to work from can without doubt be supplied by some friend you and your corresondents will think of the proper spot in which the statue should be placed and of the inscription for it but no time is to be lost for if it be not executed before his return mr howards humble sense of his own inerits would most certainly prevent it alas alas mr urban what are posthumous honors no praesenti illi  insluenced only by our admiration and our love of such virtue as we must confess has never yet arisen but in mr howard let us render it mature honors whilst it is yet present with us in this world as the best foundation for not despairing that equal virtue may yet arise  anglus p s your wonder perhaps mr urban and i am sure your indignation will be excited when you are informed that in a country pretending modestly to be the most highly civilized and in this age when so much more light than heretofore and one would hope consequent goodness are diffused some of the ruling powers of that country could harbor the thought of seizing upon mr howard in his passage through it for having in the hope they might be reformed made abuses known in a book published in another country and another language that he was not seized is undoubtedly owing to the light which is diffused  when i asked mr howard with what antiseptic he arms himself when he ventures into those mansions of misery and infection which for the sake of his fellow creatures he has long frequented and is now again seeking in a distant land he told me that he trusts under god to extreme cleanliness alone of the property of which to resist or rather afford no hold to infection he entertains a great and from experience just idea an additional recommendation this to the decency and the comfort of that charming quality i had almost said virtue the concomitant of civilisation that the most uncivilised people are the most dirty will not i believe be controverted and if the converse of the proposition be equally true let it not be forgotten by the travelers in france  having the same opinion with our correspondent of this consummate philanthropist and of the glorious possibility of the english character our printer mr nichols in redlion passage flectstreet has undertaken to receive subscriptions for this purpose till the end of june before which period some respectable bankers will be requested to assist this laudable proposal edit    from the gentlemans magazine for june basinghallstreet june  0 to evince my approbation of erecting a monument to commemorate the godlike actions of the living howard i enclose a draught for ten guineas to be appropriated to that design  persnaded as i am that his character and writings will survive the most durable monument of friendship yet such an example of approbation appears to me calculated to promote many beneficial purposes though it cannot augment the zeal of this amiable man in the pursuit of lessening human misery public approbation of private and public virtues whilst it acknowledges a debt due to intrinsic merit reflects the highest honor on the community for to reward virtue is a pleasing proof of its prevalence and that it does prevail the monument of howard will testify  virtue whether shining in the public walks of life or emitting the soft rays of human benevolence in the dungeous of misery will ever obtain its own internal reward beyond all the powers of sculpture but to exhibit that evidence to the public to excite emulation in virtuous pursuits and to induce spectators to go and do so likewise nothing seems more conducive than a monument to howard  the present moment during his absence in turkey is the most proper to accomplish such a design with goodness of heart he unites exemplary humility and a perfection of mind rarely equalled is veiled by a modesty that shuns praise and adulation but the public applause which is due to great and virtuous actions cannot be ungratesul to the godlike breast of howard  suppose therefore the first five persons who subscribe ten guineas each or upwards be appointed a committee to carry such a design into execution which committee may be afterward augmented by selecting from the subseribers at large such persons whose taste and abilities may further assist in designing a monument to howard  john coakley lettsom p s if this paper be thought worthy of insertion in the gentlemans magazine i have no objection to its publication nor have i any to being appointed to receive subscriptions with any banker or bankers further to insure success  as there are many circumstances singular in the conduct of howard which tend to his security besides cleanliness i thought of adding some outlines of his history but fearful of diverting the public attention from the subject of a monument i have refrained from such addition though would it prove acceptable i could perhaps prepare a little essay for a subsequent magazine and am respectfully j c lettsom  we thankfully accept the offers of this truly benevolent correspondent and shall be obliged to him for his proposed communication subscriptions for the monument to howard will now be received by messrs r and f gosling bankers fleet street dr lettsom basinghallstreet and j nichols red lion passage fleet street till the last day of september by which time it is hoped a sufficient fund will be raised if our expectations are disappointed the subscriptions shall then be punctually returned edit    from the gentlemans magazine for july hermitage near bath july   mr urban though it has been my lot i will not say my happy lot to have lived with and conversed much among what are generally called the great men of this nation yet i consider the greatest honor i have received during a long and chequered life to be a visit made me on person by mr howard his unsolicited name as a subscriber to a poor persormance of mine and a present of his own immortal deeds deeds so fraught with benevolence and told with such modesty humility and philanthropy that he who can read them without feeling a reverential awe for the doer must be unworthy of the name of man i therefore send you a draft on messrs hoares for one guinea that i may contribute my mite toward the erection of a statue to immortalize the person of mr howard his virtues and his writings will immortalize his name i am sorry to say it is inconvenient for me to do more yet rather than the work should not be carried into immediate execution while the worthy and modest object of it is abroad you may call upon me for nine more for who would not put themselves to some inconvenience to render respect to the memory as dr lettsom justly styles him of the godlike howard one stately tree in my garden has long since borne his name on its rind and may the hand wither like its leaves in autumn who dares to erase it  yours etc polyxena  from the same june    mr urban of the proposal suggested by your ingenious and benevolent correspondent anglus to erect a statue in honor of mr howard i most cordially approve and where is to be found a man of sense and virtue that will not say the same statesmen are the corruption and heroes the destroyers of the human species but mr howard is in the noblest and most unequivocal sense of the word their preserver i can myself feel the importance of his services more than the generality of his readers as from motives not quite dissimilar from his own i have been long accustomed to visit prisons and perform now and then those offices of charity which are too much neglected even by wise and good men and which if i had not been writing on a subject endeared to me by long and solemn reflection i should not have presumed to mention concerning myself  anglus seems to call upon your readers in general not merely for approbation but assistance in what manner then does he mean me to assist for it is a righteous cause and my heart is with it on mr howard himself it were a panegyric to expatiate in that language which truth itself would warrant argument and persuasion are anticipated by the general and just celebrity he has attained and it seems to me that merely to propose the statue is sufficient to secure the concurrence of those who reverence the character of mr howard but as to the penurious and the unfeeling i must say with a little accommodation of sallust verba viris virtuem non addere in the present state of things i can only request to be put down as a subscriber and to be considered as a most sincere wellwisher  s p  from the same july    mr urban i very sincerely wish you success in your scheme of erecting a statue to mr howard toward which i have given you my mite with more pleasure than i ever gave any thing in my life as i never remember an occasion which so inspired me with a sensation of doing honor to myself and let the rochefoucault school chew it if they please we agree with them that every thing centers in self nor can it be otherwise but were there not goodness in mans nature how could he be capable of such gratifications as these even the sensation experienced by the insignificant individual who is scribbling to you is an irrefragable argument against their system and how much more strong and noble a one is supplied by the life and actions of mr howard the godlike man as he has been well styled and of whom we have so much reason to be proud what can be a more glorious part to act than that of the friend to nature and a second to god in the relief of his suffering creatures that is mr howards part and his place in the scale of beings a friend of mine amused himself some time ago in delineating that scale but though he employed much thought upon it he could not settle it quite to his satisfaction i send it you as a cud for your readers to chew if you think it worthy of them my friend i say could not settle it quite to his satisfaction as he doubted whether the second term in the descending series ought not to be put lower nay ought not to be the last but one  yours etc a subscriber scale of beingt or of meril god friend to nature tyrannicide man of honor honest man plain labourer knave secular saint statesman hero devil    from the same statfold july    mr urban within the last three hours i have received my gentlemans magazine for june and while warm from the impression of some articles which have caught my eye i sit down to show that sensible as i am with mr thickness see p     of the magazine that the good i do in the world is but inconsiderable i am at least a well wisher to goodness and forward to add my poor testimony of approbation to those who have arrived at an exalted degree of it in this view i commit to your care a draught for ten guineas as my contribution to the proposed monument for that man who as we are told was done by the founder of the religion of which it should seem mr howard is a catholic and largeminded member goes about doing good i hope and am persuaded there are far too many persons who would be in haste to stand forward on such an occasion and who get your miscellany the moment it comes out to leave a possibility of me at this distance being one of the first five proposed by dr lettsom for a committee to compose which it would seem none are proper persons but residents about the metropolis and who have a knowledge of the arts of design mr hickey mr sanders and mr flaxman artists have in a most liberal and disinterested manner testified a great desire of being favored with the instructions of any of the friends of mr howard intimately acquainted with his features in order to furnish the committee with a likeness of him edit  which i am not so happy as to be possessed of  yours etc s p w  from the same july   mr urban it affords me infinite pleasure that my valuable friend dr lettsom has seriously aided your godlike proposal of erecting a statue for mr howard as i am certain public and honorable distinctions to the superior excellent must be deeply impressed upon minds disposed to promote private and public good and that some such persons will become usefully active in society and though in a century there will hardly be a howard yet actions may be performed that may endear other characters to the community god grant that many such men may come forward and prove themselves valuable members of society  i have deposited my guinea with dr lettsom and recommend to your notice as a delightful specimen of howards exalted worth mr burkes speech at bristol guild see this in p    it is the most nervous that perhaps was ever penned i speak from my own feelings  yours etc w h from the same extract from mr burkes speech at the guildhall in bristol    0 i cannot name this gentleman mr howard without remarking that his labors and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind he has visited all europe but we now find that europe is not a field wide enough for the exertions of his exuberant philanthropy edit  not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces or the stateliness of temples not to make accurate measurements of the remains of ancient grandeur nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art not to collect medals or to collate manuscripts  but to dive into the depths of dungeons to plunge into the infection of hospitals to survey the mansions of sorrow and pain to take the gage and dimensions of misery depression and contempt to remember the forgotten to attend to the neglected to visit the forsaken and to compare and collate the distresses of all men in all countries his plan is original and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity it was a voyage of discovery a circumnavigation of charity already the benefit of his labor is felt more or less in every country i hope he will anticipate his final reward by seeing all its effects fully realized in his own he will receive not by retail but in gross the reward of those who visit the prisoner and he has so forestalled and monopolized this branch of charity that there will be i trust little room to merit by such acts of benevolence hereafter    from the gentlemans magazine for august aug    mr urban as i was charmed with the idea of erecting a statue to mr howard i beg your acceptance of my mite toward so good a work and this sentimental offering should have been larger were it not for the expense of some living statues which i am at this time raising to myself a plan so truly national meets my ideas in every point of view but its grand effect i hope and trust will be that by this pointed distinction a door may be opened for the revival of good sense and for the restoration of that honor to virtue which has so long been engrossed by every thing that is opposite to it  it is a melancholy truth mr urban that for these last twenty years the epithets of famous celebrated etc have scarcely ever been applied except to persons answering to some of the following descriptions viz first rebels secondly strumpets thirdly rogues highwaymen etc fourthly atheistical or deistical writers these i say have for some time been the ton but i flatter myself that the immortal honors intended to be conferred on our great philanthropist may be a means to prevent the vicious from assuming those titles which they and their dupes have been so lavishly bestowing on each other may we not i say indulge a pleasing expectation that this through gods good providence may become an epoch in the moral history of mankind and that under such auspices the public man may henceforth become what he always ought to have been  uni aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis  in consequence of which pious hope i rejoice and exult in the opportunity of contributing my humble sanction and support to the business you have in hand  besides this i think the british nation is very properly consulting its own honor by perpetuating that of mr howard this is now the third time that england has produced a worthy of such eminence as to be not only unrivaled but even i think we may add inimitable  it is easy to suppose i refer to the names of shakspeare newton and howard these are men whose expansion of soul and exaltation of genius in their several lines have set them clearly and  above the rest of their species of whatever age or nation  indeed i was tempted to have squared the circle by superadding the name of alfred if our ideas of him had been sufficiently precise and incontrovertible  i hope it will not be deemed too light and fanciful if i add that h which has been said to be no letter bids fair to become the most honorable letter in the alphabet since it has in the present age produced or rather introduced the names of a howard a hanway and a hetherington  yours etc b n t  from the same to the committee of the subscribers to the national design of erecting a statue to mr howard st georges fields aug    gentlemen i have it in contemplation to erect a considerable building in st georges fields in the form of a crescent after a plan drawn by mr george dance i should be well inclined it should receive the appellation of howards crescent or any other which you may think most conducible to perpetuate a name which does such infinite honor to our country and to human nature and to the bearer of which you are so very laudably engaged in endeavoring to raise a monument of public gratitude the center of this crescent will be in a line with the obelisk in st georges fields and that standing at the top of bridgestreet opposite to fleetmarket as you will see by the plan this plan of which an engraving shall be given in the next gentlemans magazine may be seen at messrs goslings in fleet street which i have sent for your inspection now gentlemen it is for you to consider whether the center of this crescent may not be a proper spot on which to erect this monument or if the spot of the obelisk should be preferred that erection might be moved to the center of the crescent and then howards column and howards crescent would be separated but by space enough to prevent the two objects from being confounded  i am etc james hedger  from the general evening post with a liberality inspired by the subject this and the following letter were copied into almost every newspaper printed in the metropolis and into many even of the provincial papers  to the committee of the subscribers to the national design of erecting a statue to mr howard gentlemen from the rapid progress of the subscription in which are already many names great in goodness learning elegance and sensibility as well as rank i cannot doubt but that you will soon see it filled in a manner becoming a design formed to enkindle all the sparks of nature in every lover of virtue and his species and becoming what i have the pleasure to believe i may truly call the most virtuous and in its individuals the most opulent nation under heaven but when you have the means how is this design to be completed and where is one of the first questions naturally asked is the statue to be placed you are pleased to invite the correspondence of any friend to the design i am a warm one to it and to express how warm a one i cannot do better than adopt the words of a great ornament of our country in his letter in the last gentlemans magazine see above p     and say with him i feel that it is a righteou cause and my heart is with it in consequence of your invitation therefore having contributed my mite of money i beg leave to contribute my mite of suggestion also in regard chiesly to a spot in which to place the statue with the most general approbation i say the most general approbation well knowing that if he shed not a miraculous influence on their minds michael the archangel could no more think of a spot to place it in than a michael angelo or even a phidias or praxiteles could sculpture it so as to please every critic and how is that most general approbation to be consulted and collected but by early throwing out ideas to the public in the hope to provoke good judgments to amend them or rather furnish more acceptable ideas in their stead  i will suppose then what at present there seems to be a happy prospect of that the general restimony from such a nation as this to the virtues of our unparalleled prodigy of a philanthropist will bring in so magnificent a subscription as to enable you to erect his statue on a column of the corinthian order fluted and of the dimensions at least of that beautiful one dug out of the ruins of the temple of peace on which pope borghese paul the fifth erected a statue which is now standing at rome in front of the church of st maria maggiore i will suppose further that there will be left an overplus not only competent to the excellent idea of one of the most respectable characters in the world a gentleman of suffolk of placing a bust of mr howard in prisons and houses of industry and correction but likewise to the establishment of a considerable fund to be called the howardian fund placed in the public stocks and there to accumulate i hope for a long while till mr howards death and then the interest of it to be applied by the howardian committee whoever they shall be and however supplied as the members of it drop off by acts of parliament either in aid of mr howards reform of prisons or in that of the benevolent institution for the discharge of prisoners confined for small debts this will be a collateral method of perpetuating his name as efficacious as the principal one as it must endure as long as the nation has either stocks or name but more of this hereafter i return to the placing of the statued column  now i take it for granted that the spot of all others that ought to be preferred would be that if it could be found which would naturally and necessarily induce the public to the daily constant common and perpetual mention of howards column and by such means indeed semper honos nomenque suum laudesque manebunt which is what you aim at as well in the mouths of the million where they otherwise would soon be lost as in philanthropic hearts where they will for ever live for this purpose gentlemen what think you of the spot where now stands the obelisk in st georges fields the obelisk is a name for ever necessarily in common use with all the world in a variety of phrases such as  you go by the obelisk  you turn to the right or left at the obelisk  it measures so many miles from the obelisk etc etc now if in the place of that obelisk which has not long existed neither were substituted howards column will not the name of it in all similar phrases be substituted too  you go by howards column etc etc to this helps might be given by roadacts etc that the obelisk would not be very readily given up it would be injurious to the liberal magistrates of surrey with submission to the writer of this letter we believe the obelisk to be the property of the corporation of london but from that opulent and benevolent body as well as from the magistrates of surrey every species of assistance may of course be expected to entertain a doubt as they would instantly see that the purposes for which it was erected for ornamenting and lighting the spot and as a term of measurement would be not only preserved but augmented and improved howards column such as i can conceive it and something like it i doubt not i shall have the happiness to see there or elsewhere would be much more highly ornamental than the obelisk eight square pillars dividing the iron rails into as many compartments might surround the column and have inscribed on their outer sides as many measurements as you will and from the tops of the pillars branch out an iron work supporting each two lamps and forming in all a ring or gloriole of sixteen lamps with which the shrine of that godlike man so much more deserving it than any saint i beg to be understood as meaning any modern saint would be nightly lighted in saecula seculorum amen  the trifling extraexpence of oil as well as the repairs of the column for ever to be defrayed out of the howardian fund this spot is what the french call an etcile when thus enriched what a brilliant star and who knows what glorious consequences to our country its animating influence may produce  every foreigner of distinction enters the town by westminster bridge the passage to which from the kentish road is now by the obelisk as having been found some yards nearer than the former way and it howards column should occupy the spot what foreigner could pass it by day or by night without acquainting himself with the meaning of it and consequently with the character of the man to whose honor it was erected his character indeed is well known and when i say that i say admired and i may add envied to us by all the present set of men in europe from the sovereigns down to their lowest fubjects who know any thing of the world  with whom by the way this nation will lose no credit by the magnificent exultation which it will express in this monument of gratitude for having had the honor to produce him  i shall be much surprised gentlemen if you should not receive before the end of september a subscription more than competent to all the purposes of honoring mr howard than have been here suggested if they should be approved which i am far from presuming to flatter myself they will as i expect to see much more judicious schemes proposed but so very material an article as that of the spot where the statue should be placed cannot too soon be discussed should you think it worthy you may publish my letter if you please as it may serve at least to sharpen better wits perhaps at my expense how much soever it may be itself  exors secandi  from the same to the editor there are i searce can think it but am told  yes sir there are they say some gentlemen who upon the subject of the excellent national design which is now on foot object to the propriety not of rendering a public honor to mr howard in his lifetime for to that i believe no mortal can object but to the propriety of rendering that public honor in a statue statues they say relating to the pomp of success in war and the havoc of mankind but i beg these gentlemens pardon statues have in all ages been erected likewise at the public expense to men eminent in the arts of peace as well as war for virtue learning and services performed augustus caused the statues of all those romans who had eminently distinguished themselves in the arts of either peace or war to be set up in the curia allotting to each profession its proper place thus tacitus tells us that the statue of hortensius was placed among the orators cato censor had a statue for being the most useful senator  the quality of senator is nothing to the purpose as a citizen may be as useful though he cannot be quite so mischievous out of the senate as in it  lucius minucius augurinus for having restored plenty to the city  and marius gratidianus for having only taught the marks by which adulterate coins was to be distinguished here then were statues erected to utility but not joined as in mr howards case with the most transcendent philanthropy for cato censor i think it was who with a heart harder than the nether millstone had the practice imitated i doubt not as he was famous for his wise economy by many of those barbarous butchers of mankind of sending his slaves useless through age to be starved to death upon a barren island how happier for them to have been mr howards horses mr howard allots to his horses grown old or infirm a rich pasture to range in for their lives  that this gentleman has been most useful were it not so generally known we might safely credit from a great master of eloquence and equally renowned for information mr burke see above p     who said six years ago that his labors and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind and that already the benesit of his labors was felt more or less in every country that a much greater number of statues have been erected to the corrupters and destroyers of the human species as statesmen and warriors are so well called by the most illustrious literary character now living in his letter recommending this design than to such men as mr howard if the world has ever looked upon his like who as he says has been in the noblest and most unequivocal sense of the word their preserver is most true and if any one will cast his eye upon the names which fluminis ritu feruntur in their respective channels on priestleys ingenious biographical chart which now hangs before me he will be convinced of the melancholy reason as he will there behold those corrupters and destroyers under the title of statesmen and warriors sailing as it were securely along the stream of time in every age in large thick close wellappointed squadrons whilst the preservers the friends and soothers of mankind qui vitam excolucre per arts quique sui memores alios fecere merendo appear but here and there one like the dispersed remnants of the pious trojans fleet thinly scattered and scarce emerging on the surface of the watery waste but thank heaven from the opening which the labors and writings of mr howard and the progress of philosophy together have given to the eyes and hearts of men there is great room to hope that the condition of the world is about to mend and that convinced as it must be that utility accompanied by virtue has the truest greatness we shall see it readier than it has been to render to virtuous utility its highest honors  of all descriptions of men it is our judges and magistrates who must be the most sensible of the utility which mr howard has been of to the world and i make no doubt sir but that we shall see the thing will be taken up by grand juries and other public bodies of men and that the example will run through the kingdom in such a manner as to make the statue become voted with classical propriety to this our most virtuous and useful citizen by his country in his provincial tribes  but the feeling heart will not want the influence of patriotic wisdom and example to direct it to its own gratification in delighting to honor delicately in his absence him by whom our nature is so highly honored and the precepts of the divine teacher who has left us an example that we should do as he did so well obeyed that after going about europe for thirty years he is now carried beyond the bounds of it in the most glorious of all crusades the sublime ardour of doing good  homo sum  extract from a letter to mr nichols  i am well pleased at the active part you have taken along with some worthy characters to subscribe and solicit subscriptions to erect a monument of mr howard a man who appears to possess such magnanimous humanity that it so debases me as that i appear contemptible to myself begging therefore i may be allowed to subscribe my mite i enclose a check on w fuller and son value five guineas and from the good opinion i have of the proper management you are welcome to call on me for the like sum provided the collection should sall short of expectation  from the gentlemans magazine for august to dr lettsom whitefordhouse callington august  0      sir the very laudable design which i observe by the gentlemans magazine has been set on foot greatly if not chiefly through you of handing down to posterity the unexampled philanthropy of mr howard meets my sincere approbation and as i long since admired his conduct when he was sheriff of bedfordshire i beg leave to express my attachment to his character by adding five guineas to the subscription for erecting a statue to his unremitted exertions for the relief of misery and distress  it was owing to his ideas and the intercourse i had with him when sheriff of cornwall in the year      that i conceived the design of constructing a gaol bridewell and debtorsward in this county  it has since been carried into execution and i flatter myself the criminals as well as the public are greatly indebted to him for the respective benefits resulting therefrom i am sir with great esteem for this opportunity of subscribing myself your very obedient humble servant  john call  from the same to the committee for erecting a statue to mr howard aug         gentlemen after contributing the trifle which accompanies this letter toward the grateful and generous plan of raising a memorial to my worthy relation for such i have the honor to style him mr howard i beg leave with great deference to the gentlemen who compose the committee to offer a thought or two on the subject of their proposal  mr howard appears to me from my own observation and from all i have heard of him to be modest and diffident to an extreme  vanity has no share in his composition  his good actions spring from native benevolence alone without a mixture of a wish for worldly applause  to such a man who shrinks from public approbation will not the showy tribute intended to his merits be exquisitely painful  statues are not very usually erected in these modern times to any persons crowned heads excepted during their lives more especially when the person so honored resides chiefly near the proposed situation of this elegant memorial  should this excellently wellintended monument give so much uneasiness to the person it commemorates as to make him avoid the metropolis which has hitherto been a conspicuous scene of his benevolence would it not then in vain be wished that the execution of the plan had been deferred until his ideas on the subject were at least guessed at  i will hazard one more question  supposing that the sums raised and to be raised for the statue were to be employed  in alleviating the distress of prisoners  in rewarding and encouraging proper attendants on their souls and bodies  in liberating those confined for small debts  in short in following up those plans for the welfare of the destitute part of mankind which mr howards life and actions have always meant to inculcate  can there be a doubt of the superior pleasure which that friend to mankind would feel when compared with his sensation when he finds on his return to britain an ostentatious token of gratitude which can neither extend his fame or aid the accomplishment of his designs  it will give me sincere concern should i find that my ideas on this subject should give offense to a set of gentlemen so wellintentioned so liberallyminded as the committee to whom i address myself  their candor will i hope excuse a variation from their opinions a variation in which i am by no means singular since the same idea has struck many who have perused the papers published on this affair and among these are some who seem to be well acquainted with the sentiments of my excellent relation i am gentlemen with true respect your devoted humble servant  j p andrews  london august         statue for mr howard and howardian fund for prisoncharities and reforms many sincere admirers of mr howard the friend to every clime a patriot of the world anxious that his transcendent philanthropy may not wait for the tardy and as it should seem almost unwilling gratitude of posthumous acknowledgement from the public entertain a hope from a hint thrown out in the gentlemans magazine for may and so nobly improved upon in that for june that though he seeks not his reward from men a statue as one of the highest earthly honors may be erected to him to perpetuate the memory of it before he goes to be rewarded with heavenly honors and during his absence upon a godlike errand which carries him to turkey to try to restrain the ravages of the plague and who knows not with how truly christian a spirit and undaunted courage he before went about doing good how gloriously he has devoted a great part of his life and property to repeated visits to most of those mansions of misery and infection the jails of europe and how many a weary prisoner whom he came unto has been bound to bless him for the removal of at least some horror for the alleviation of at least some anguish which with the iron entered into his soul when it was cast down and disquieted within him those persons therefore who feeling like men christians and britons the exalted merit which does so much honor to their nature their religion and their country wish to avail themselves that his delicacy may not be hurt of the humble possessors absence for the pleasure of expressing that feeling in the doing something toward crecting such a monument of public gratitude to him and of encouragement to virtue as heroic and sublime if it be possible in others at the same time forwarding his favorite charities and reforms are
