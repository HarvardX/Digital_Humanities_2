a remarkable case in surgery wherein an account is given of an uncommon fracture and depression of the skull in a child about six years old accompanied with a large abscess or aposteme upon the brain  with other practical observations and useful reflections thereupon  also an exact draught of the case annexed and for the entertainment of the senior but instruction of the junior practitioners communicated  by daniel tvrner  quamvis enim si mentem serio applicuerimus quid de facto agat natura and quibus in operatione sua utatur organis deprehendere valcamus modus tamen quo illa operatur

court of assistants such of them more especially who in that worshipful company profess the truly noble commendable and above all others most useful the art of surgery in the city of london gentlemen it is to you as proper arbiters of sound and artful practice that i address the following case you who at present are placed at the helm and whose peculiar provinc it is to inspect whether or no this renowned art be rightly steered by it several practitioners will quickly see as the following diary has been kept whether or no the practice therein observed be every way conformable t the rules of art  that it is truly stated i dare appeal to one of you mr warden herenden who was at several time pleased to be an eyewitness at the times of dressing  if it be objected that my patient at length dying i might have concealed the case as affording less matter of instruction to the young practitioner for whom principally it was intended i answer and that without vain boasting there is more of art required to protract life under the most imminent danger than there is to accomplish a cure where that danger is absent and farther whatever it may appear to others i dare say twill be no paradox to you should i affirm that the remarkable and succesful recoveries of some have been in great measure owing to the rational although succesless attempts upon others  the dissection that has been employed upon morbid bodies after death has enriched both physic and surgery with many useful improvements and he who thinks it not worth while to take notice of any other case than where a cure has been completed is least likely to be instrumental in the performance of any one that is extraordinary  i pretend to no new light in surgery nor shall i by any means recede from the old unless that enlightened gentleman dr c  can by autopsy convince me that any considerably contusd wound is to be cured by other first intention than that of digestion or engendring matter till this be done he is to excuse me if i think him more in the dark than those who never heard of his false meteor and quickly extinguished light  that wounds of the brain and other noble parts are inconditionately curable seems of a like stretch with the former yet want we not a late blazing star in comparison of the lesser light from the other side the water to portend they are so  but if these immortalisers of mankind could perform what they pretend to how comes it to pass that not one more surprising if well attested recovery has hen wrought by them than we are able to produce in the way of common practice performed by ingeniuos artists long before the world was fobbd by these arrogant pretenses  it is evident there never wanted some bold and confident pretender to work wonders in each art or science physic and philosophy as well as mathematics have had their heretics equally with divinity nor was there ever any thing how absurd so ever started by philosophers of differing sects but quickly gained its proselues amongst unthinking and unwary persons thus on the one hand no sonner does the knavish or at best deluded facio and his crew sound forth the trumpet but herds of fellow prophets take the alarm and men distinguished as well by sense as title and estate are drawn in amongst the beedless rabble  on the other no sooner does the bold and cosening quack confidently avouch that he can cure the most invetrate clap in two or three days and a pox of the superlative degree in as many weeks but shoals of fornicating sinners neglecting men of art and greater modesty run after him to court their ruin i need not tell you how many of this scandalous tribe our city affords who live great and appear splendid by the spoil of these most shamefully abused people  again no sooner does the sly insinuating v  the scandal of our reverend clergy publish to the world his cures of the kings evil where common ulcers and as common opthalmies make up the number and all miscariages are hushed up but strait the bubbled citizens caress the empty idol and fear not the abuse under a religious cassock  nostrums and specificks those subterfuges of ignorance and baits for nwary are every where to be met with but whilst their owners are so shy of being brought to the test of rational nquisition whilst they shelter themselves only under the umbrage of however honorable yet incompetent judges we may very well disregard them nor need we be at the pains of confuting them otherways than by what they only deserve our slight and contempt  if common fame or the lying tattle of the multitude is to be taken for authentic evidence i can produce a noonday sun which will obscure these lesser lights at once for if the dr finds his vouchers for his cure of wounds of the heart stomach liver guts and what not or the dutch nobleman who drives tenterhooks through mens heads healing them in a trice with his consolidator i will bring one to testify he heard a person swear that i had taken out some of a childs brains the same in the ensuing narative washed them in warm claret and put them in again after which in in a few minutes he was as merry as a cricket  but leaving these romantic boasters amongst knaves and fools the bare mentioning of whom i fear is a trespass upon your patience i hope it is no novel assertion if i do affirm that the wounded brain is conditionately curable had i not been able to produce authorities great variety of which the judicious mr young of plymouth has collected to my hand i can assert it upon my own knowledge in a little girl i was called to many years ago who by accident had an iron spike beat into her brain thoro the midst of the os frontis accompanied with a fracture in which upon removal of the scalp one part of the cranium as found shot under the other the wound had been treated by a barber as superficial taking off whose dressings i perceived some of the brain mixed with his balsam and passing in my probe observed there was an admittance farther than i cared to venture i dressed her up that night believing the case desperate next day i traced the fracture and making room for the trepan called in mr sergeant bernard perforating the first time whilst he was by the membrane appeared fair and clean but by this perforation we were not able to relieve that part of it which was oppressed by some angles of the fracturd bone on which account i made a second bore and sawed off the interstice which contained the doubled fragment of the offending cranium our membrane now lay bare a considerable compass yet notwithstanding incarnd as kindly as i could wish and gave no other trouble than that of keeping down the supercrescing flesh to lie even with the other parts of the skull  from the seeds in the forehead we had daily some portion of the brain discharged i believe in all a moderate spoonful which at length ceasing to work out instead thereof there ouzed forth a large quantity of an insipid water or clear lymph at least a pint in each twelve hours which continued till the edges of the seeds mouldred off about which time some grains of flesh began to arise from within soon after growing callous and bearing a firm cicatrix the patient is now grown a lusty young woman a wife and mother of children and from the minute she received her hurt through the long ourse of my attendance was not otherise affected than with the symptonatic fever and severe headache after this and diverse operations of the like nature though i cannot say all alike succesful i thought my self capable as well of discovering a fissufd or fracturd cranium as of releiving the distressed under those circumstances but yet i could not escape the censure of some gentlemen of the fraternity who admired i should overlook such a case  how justly this reflection was made i take this opportunity of informing you and delivering the business truly in as few words as i can shall leave you to determine  about two years and half since i was sent for to give my judgment upon a child who they told me had been bitten by a mastiff dog when i came to examine his head which was the part affected i found the scalp had been torn a considerabl way over one side the accident ha been received as i remember six o seven weeks before the lacerate part being laid down again was i some places agglutinated in others where there had been loss of substance incarnd and firmly cicatrised so that all i had to overlook was a large and no unseemly scarr under which there was nothing at that time to be apprehended not so much as a complaint upon the strictest impression the child upon the healing of the wound was seized with an hemiplegia the eye and lip distorted the arm in a manner useless and the leg drawing after him accompanied indeed with a partial loss of his understanding faltering in his peech and slavering like a changeng i asked the parents who had en their surgeon they told me one  their neighborhood being willing to have some talk with him they sent and the man readily came to e i inquired what he had observed at his first dressing upon the skull before he stitched the scalp to its disunited parts in his broken english being a frenchman he told me the skin meaning the pericrane was untouched unless in those places where the cur had set his teeth or paws that he had been careful in examining and found the skull to be no ways injured upon which having told the childs friends that taking this for a true report i could impute the symptoms to nothing more than a venomous taint impressed by the slaver of the dog upon the lips of the wound at this time got into the blood and so affecting the nerves themselves a case of the same nature i had observed and communicated to the royal society which the deceased dr tyson thought well worthy and had the same printed in the phylosophic transactions thus having told the mother that i should be clearly for opening both the scalp and skull which she i dare say will justify did i apprehend their surgeon might not not be depended on which put monsieur into a little passion and made him swear that the same was no more injured than the back of his hand i then prescribed some alexipharmic and antiepileptick medicines ordered a vesicatory for the neck and for farther relief of the brain directed the said person who om the first had been concerned to ply a caustic upon the top of the head at the meeting of the coronal ith the sagittal suture i also adised a nervous embrocation somehat like that in the following case or the spina dorsi after which i visited only five or six days till he eschar separated and the ulcer kept open as a fontanel with a pea not meeting then with the civility i expected nor the child much bettered by what i had directed i withdrew and they called in a physician of good note and repute meeting after with their apothecary i inquired about the child he told me the symptoms rather increased and he grew worse that the physician with inconsiderable variation had fallen upon the course i had before directed unless that in the room of the embrocation he had ordered a fomentation going some time after upon business by the door i had a messenger who followed me and entreated me to look in once more upon him whom i found a very pitiful object the mother told me she had carried him to some of our h  l surgeons and that one of them had proposed a couple of issues betwixt his shoulders i did then indeed recommend the cold immersion as believing if the skull was no way damnifyd the lost tone of the parts might thereby be restored and the spring of the nervous fibers much invigorated besides i knew our authors in case of the venomous bites of a dog recommend the salt water dipping above all other remidies however this experiment was luckily omitted and what ever after indicated the fracture and consequently the use of the trepan i am not certain supposing that matr might at length issue forth from e brain and raise some pappy tumor or the bone growing loose eing long steeped therein might proably give way and discover some inching of the child upon a hard mpression of the fingers be this is it will the next news i heard was that the head was opened by one of he surgeons who had before seen him n the company of a since deceased physician where a fissure or a fracture as discovered an absces underneath he membranes rotten as i was nformd and the child expired two r three days after the operation this gentlemen is the case truly tated for which i was censured by ne of my brothers who had but some weeks before discovered nothing himself or ordered any thing more than a couple of issues inter scapulas the sorrowful mother notwithstanding this reflection was so sensible of my care and that her frenchman only was blame worthy that sometime after i received her promised thanks for those few visits i had made her with this account of her childs death  i mention not this i will assure you gentlemen so much by way of recrimination as to give a hint how it behooves us at all times and in all places to be very tender of each others reputation i am much honored sirs withal due observance

at last died convuls t slater sculp   a remarkable case in surgery etc on the   th of february   0   i was called in much have to a child about the age of six years who was just then brought out of moorfields wounded by a catstick as he was sitting at some distance from a cock set to be thrown at where a young fellow missing his m unfortunately struck the child over the head and knocked him down he was taken up for dead and continued speechless for some ime  upon examining the head i perceived a small wound on the right side which had bled freely and laying my fingers hard upon the part under a sort of quagmire of grumous blood i found there must be a considerable depression of that part of the scull  whilst i was delivering my prognostic of the childs great danger and telling them of the necessity there was to make way to the fracture by removing some part of the scalp the boy began to cry and fell a vomiting having no assistant then by nor dressings suitable to the operation i contented my self for the present with the common restringents for staying the flux sending for a barber to shave that side of the head whilst i opened a vein in the arm and took about six ounces of blood then applying a defensative over that part of the head i rolled up the same intending to proceed farther if necessity so required the same evening at what time i found my little patient perfectly sensible but complaining of his headache still throwing up all he ook i ordered the following julep o be taken two or three spoonfuls betwixt whiles and left him for that night  aq ceras nigr iiij  cinam hordeat j  aq paeon c ss  sir caryoph vj  misce pro julapio  the next day i called in mr blundel and together visiting we found the child had been hot and restless all night his retching to vomit having left him when we had taken him out of bed and placed him in a good light i took off the bandage and dressings and passing a probe into the wound plainly felt the cranium for a great compass denudated of its covering  i began to draw a semicircular line on the outside of the depression as a direction for my knife and another perpendicular from the one point to the other that we might feel the extent of the fracture before we removed any more of the scalp the whilst mr b  kept the head steady i cut through my half circle to the cranium and found i was just beyond the edge of the fracturd bone but drawing my knife upon the straight line it slipped in a considerable distance from the superfice unawares which mr b  perceiving i withdrew the same to make way for his finger by which he discovered so great a vacuity that we concluded the bones were beat through both meninges into the substance of the brain  upon this he approved of my making another semicircle and taking off the scalp on the opposite side by which we might have the whole fracture in full view accordingly i dispatch the work and took from the scalp a circle in all as large or somewhat larger than a five shilling piece when immediately we discovered this vast fracture and depression exactly enough delineated in the following table of four angles sunk so low beneath the surface of the other part of the cranium as to make a cavity sufficient to contain near two ounces of liquor  the outward table was broke all round whilst the inward was only bowed upon which account there was no room for an elevator or indeed any other instrument by which we could hope to raise up the deprest bones without the help of the trepan the terebra was proposed but concluded insufficient as well as hazardous insufficient to lift up the bones unless we could go quite through and hazardous by going through of wounding the dura matter which if not lacerated by the prodigious stretch must needs bear tight against the infide of the fracturd bone the trepan in so young a child was thought likewise to have its danger the membrane in young children lying high and in a manner continuous to the inside of the scull  however here was no room for long delay the foresaid part subjacent being so wonderfully oppressed by the points of the bones through the clefts of which we might perceive a manifest oscillation yet for the present we could do nothing more being disturbed in our work by a flux of blood from an incised artery to the mouth of which i clapped a small button of lint dipped in equal parts of bole and vitriol filled up the cavity and edges with dry lint and a compress wrung out of oxycrate and albumen ovi strowd with farina tritici to be laid over all and rolled the head up again for this second dressing  i visited in the evening and found a quick pulse thirst and headache especially toward the forehead but no vomiting he was very sensible and indeed bore up beyond expectation yet in consideration to the disturbance we had given to the whole animal economy by that mornings work i prescribed for him as follows  aq ceras nigr j  paeon c ij  sir de meconio ss  misce and

i called upon my brother b  who was himself now laid up with the gout it was agreed for that day to defer taking off the dressings in consideration of the flux unless some more threatening symptom should appear to obviate which i directed thus  pull e chelis canc c  de gutteta aa gr x  misce sumat quamprimum repetatur mane and vesperi vel sepius pro re nata superbib cochl ij julapij sequentis

supported betwixt the hands of an attendant upon the nurses knee i began to malax the bandage and dressings very stiff by reason of the effused blood with a little ol rosarum and after some time cleared all away taking care to secure the application upon the wounded artery which from the first dressing bled no more  i now could plainly perceive the extent of the fracture which lay all in view and finding it would be fruitless to attempt the reduction of the deprest bones to their proper places which were so fast locked in by any other means resolved to make way for setting on the trepan  whilst i was making ready i ordered a stuph to be expressed out of the following decoction and applied over the wound  summit centauri  hypericon aa mj  flor chamomel mss  betonic  rorismar  lavendul aa p ij  bulliantur in a f ad consumptionem dimidij addendo sub finem vini alb lbss reservetur colatura per fotu  having applied two or three warm flannels and filled up the cavity with dry lint i concluded the best part for trepaning as likewise for the elevator would be above the fracture which being seated on the right bregma was bounded forwards by the coronal backwards by the lamdoide upwards by the sagittal and downwards by the squammous suture and indeed so near to this latter as may be seen in the figure hereto annexed that there was not room for the trepan below when i had therefore drawn a circle above within a quarter of an inch or less of the broken edge i took out a proportionate piece of the scalp almost the compass of a milled shilling which my patient never winchd at although he told his nurse the day before he thought at his first cutting we would not leave him till we had taken off all the flesh from that side of his head i had now no occasion for any restringent so that dressing up the bones all dry i applied a large pledgit of liniment upon soft tow over the lips and rolled up his head for that day  his drink which was indeed his whole diet was milk and water boiled together barleywater watergruel and betwixt whiles a small sack whey a clyster was repeated also at this time and his anodyne at night  this preparation being made for the work i went to mr warden herenden stated the case and appointed a consultation at three next day after dinner desiring he would not fail me that i might be justified in the operation accordingly on the   th being provided of a good instrument with a bore of the smallest sise and a suitable apparatus for the work at the hour appointed he called on me and tring my patients chamber when e found him on his feet walking about the room he seemed amasd s ready to surmize the case had een misstated and that probably we might spare the operation i was not in the least concerned hereat well knowing he would alter his sentiments upon a sight of the wound and taking off the dressings he seemed astonished that a child under such a violent pressure of that most noble part the source of all the other membranes if we may trust a late new system from the forcibly intruded bones should labor under no worse symptom than a headache and be in a condition to walk about the chamber  pleased with the childs courage he placed him against the nurses bosom and took upon himself to keep his head steady whilst i began to work with the trepan observing that admirable axiom festina lent i gently turned the instrument now and then taking it up to clean till i had got to the diploe when lifting it out again brushing off the sawdust and laying the pin aside i proceeded to work farther examining with my probe betwixt whiles where i was got through and bearing down upon those parts where i found i was not  in few minutes the work was dispatched and being willing to have it out as clear as i could without having occasion to shiver off any part that might remain undivided by the saw i thought to pass gently a turn more upon the adhering side and so remove my instrument when at first somewhat surpised we misd the perforated bone and were ready to surmise the membrane being somewhere lacerated underneath had let it in and returned by its own proper elasticity again to its convexity but looking into the instrument we found it in the bore i hint this as a memoir for the young artist for twas not truly my intention to have taken it so out nor did i suspect that one gentle turn would have cut asunder that part which just before d seem to stick to fast to hazard e breaking off  the warden was pleased however ith the operation the edges of the one were so exactly smooth and ven that we needed no lenticular to ome after for to polish the work the dura matter appeared fair though somewhat storid from its inflammation and now we immediately set about the lifting up the deprest bones in order to which passing carefully my elevator through the perforation and heedfully observing that the membrane might not slip between my instrument and the fracturd bone i was about to raise i began to lift having placed the end of the said instrument under the center of the largest and most likely of them when bearing up with considerable force i found it would not stir on which account i drew back my elevator and arming its shank with a soft rag placed also a linen bolster upon that part of the edge of the sound cranium which was to be its fulcrum  being thus provided i conveyed it in once more and with redoubled force perceived it began to give continuing the same force it immediately flew up and shivered off the inner table  this bone extracted our work was much facilitated nor had we farther occasion to pass our instrument through the bore for by shifting our fulcrum or resting upon another part we could command the other pieces at our pleasure  there had been a debate the day before betwixt mr b  and my self whether after extracting one or two of the bones we should not leave the remainder having raised them up to their places in expectation that they might agglutinate or unite by intervention of a callus by which the dura matter would be defended from lying bare so large a compass and our work shortened in respect to the cure if such a thing might be accomplished however finding them all break upon their elevation and fearing some loose angles might irritate e membrane creating to us more and greater disturbance it was now oncluded they should be all taken way and very happily they were so s appears by the sequel  having removed these four pieces of bones of the exact shape and dimension with those expressed in the annexed scheme the dura matter began to vibrate strongly and raised it self at the same instant to fill up the surprising chasm which wiping gently with a piece of a soft sponge wrung out of a little warm claret i presently covered that and the bored part with suitable syndons of white sarsnet dipped only in mel rosarum continuing my dry lint upon the lips and having laid the digestive over all i rolled up his head  after the work was over he was carried to bed being refreshed with two or three spoonfulls of his cephalic julep  from this day our work seemingly went on with a prosperous aspect the cephalalgye much abated the pulse grew calm and the child lively so continuing for four or five days the dura matter both in the place of the perforation as well as that where the bones had been extracted began to be besprinked with little grains of flesh only in the midst of this latter there appeared a kind of slough occasioned by the points of the deprest bones which by grating hard had rased the outward membrane to digest and hasten separation of which i dressed those parts with a little of the balsam terebinth added to the mel rosarum  no sooner was this part mundifyd and a sort of granulated flesh had clothed the bare membrane but our headache returned afresh with greater extremity than ever the symptomatic fever and restlesness also accompanied so that on the  th of march about five days after the operation upon taking off the bandage i perceived there had been a much greater discharge than could be reasonably expected from the outside wounds and removing the dressings to apply a stuph wrung out of the fomentation took notice of an offensive smell when looking carefully upon the membrane thoro a small papilla or grain of the new incarned flesh where the slough had thrown off there ouzed out a faetid matter from underneath  believing the case to be desperate i armed a small pledgit with linim arcaei dipping the same in the foresaid mixture of mel ros and bals tereb to apply on the part whence the matter issued forth the other parts of the membrane i covered with the syndons of sarsnet moistened only with the mel ros and clapping the edges of the silk under the shivered edge of the cranium that the subjacent noble part might not be offended thereby i dressed as before and rolled up the head  the next day intending to make apertion through the meninx and relieve the brain of the fluctuating matter i acquainted mr h  told him what i had discovered and the necessity of our farther proceeding  march   we met in consultation where we found the matter somewhat lessened in its discharge though still abundantly too much the lips which the day before were fallen looking white and flabby and the incarnd granules of flesh upon the membrane which were then sinking and of the same color had now as it were revived and put on a fresh complexion nor could we perceive the least drop of matter bursting through in any part of the membrane or any room for a probe where i had remarked it ouzing forth  upon these considerations though the symptoms still kept up without remission i mean the fever watching and headache yet mr h  surmising i might be mistaken in my yesterdays remark or hoping the matter lodging only betwixt the duplicature had made its exit persuaded me to dress up and endeavor to relieve the child some other way to which purpose upon further consultation it was agreed that i should presently open the jugular on the same side out of which running briskly and in a full stream we drew six ounces of blood a vesicatory was also applied to the neck and an emollient clyster thrown up in the evening the antiepileptic powders were repeated with the addition of two grains of sal vol c c to each paper the cephalic julep ut antea and if the headache did not remit by the next day leaches were concluded to be set behind the ears as also to each temple  the  th i called again and understood by the nurse the child had a bad night was then hot and restless and cried out of his head  this afternoon i took off the dressings perceived the bandage and compress were fouled with the matter likewise the pillow he had lain on which confirmed my belief that it was highly rational to make an apertion through the dura matter and that without so doing all other endeavors would prove useless  the dressings taken off i plainly observed from whence the matter had come forth but could not find a passage for my probe although there was a small drop of matter in the mouth of the papillary excrescens the supposed place of its vent there being no artist by to justify my proceeding i dressed up again as before the warden having promised to meet me on the  th during which interval so great a quantity of the purulent matter bad workt out as to afford some relief to the brain so that the symptoms grew milder he tried at this dressing with his probe but could find no entrance the wound looked fresh and the incarning ruddy though not much increased for   or   days past however much contrary to my own sentiments i was again prevailed upon to dress up continuing my wonted applications and to wait a little longer to see what farther time might produce unless fresh symptoms called for a penetration of which i was to give notice  thus we continued to the   th the pain twixt whiles remitting and returning a stinking gleet with much matter upon our dressings one day we seemed to get ground but the next lost it the lips again grew flaccid and the flesh upon the membrane loose and pallid so that resolving to wait no longer i went again to mr h  and told him i should lose my little patient if he would not comply with my dividing the membrane he readily offered me his assistance and came according to his appointment  when we came into the chamber the child was crying very dolefully of his head there was a faetid smell by the bedside from the putrid effluvia arising from the pent up matter and though we were sensible there was far too great a quantity to proceed from the wound yet could we not even at this dressing discover the orifice that had let it out the systole and diastole of the membrane likewise hindering us from apprehending any fluctuation under our fingers so that i cannot any ways blame nor would i reflect by any means upon that gentlemans judgment and great caution in this affair he having never seen the matter arising out of the incarned flesh as i had done and might think perhaps i was therein deceived  i was at this time extremely unwilling to dress again till i had given a freer vent and attempted the search once more with my probe yet still without success at last pressing hard down upon one side of the strongly resiliating dura matter a small drop of matter blubbered out of the aforesaid papilla which mr warden perceiving immediately took out a fine probe from his box and pressing gently down got in very readily giving way to make an apertion whilst his probe which he bore up underneath was to guide my lancet with which direction i passed the same in and made a wound about a quarter of an inch in length when examining more narrowly with the probe we found having not the discharge we expected that it was got betwixt the duplicature of the membrane so that without delay examining again he soon got under to the pia matter when raising up the part as before with his probe i cut close to the side thereof till i had made a wound of half an inch by which we discharged a vast quantity of stinking pus interspersed with two or three small globules of the cortex of the brain  by this last incision we were put to a dilemma a small capillary artery being divided in the inmost coat of this membrane here was no place for biting stiptics nor indeed for the common restringents some part of which with the utmost care must inevitably fall in upon the brain and there produce very bad effects if not the most direful symptoms nor was there by any resisting body underneath any hope that by compression we could stay the flux  the moment of its spurting up mr h  with an armed probe pressed close upon the mouth thereof which did me double service by restraining its bleeding and dilating the wound whilst i conveyed a dossil tied round with thread whose end hung out for the secure extraction dipped in the abovementioned mel rosarum into a small quantity of which for correcting the stench and putrefaction i had beforehand instilled a few drops of a tinct myrh drawn in whitewine clapping this down softly upon the tender meninx or rather upon the brain it self the pia matter being here eroded and having made up a second dossil somewhat tighter and fitted to the dimensions of the wound tied likewise with a thread as the other whilst he took away his armed probe i clapped it close upon the wounded vessel which being but capillary we were in hopes would be soon choked by this kind of compression  being dressed up he was carried to his bed mr h  acquainting the parents that his case was truly doubtful if not desperate absolutely and i my self indeed believing i should not often dress him after however considering with the great hippocrates that there is a  in morbis aliquibus and having found that there often occurs an aliquid miraculi in the wonderful escapes of these little innocents i resolved to leave nothing unattempted justifyable by art for this little champions recovery  having no more to do at present we took our leaves when i had first for his refreshment prescribed the following julep  aq ceras nigr v  paeon c  angelic c aa ss  sal vol oleos gut xxx  margarit p p ss  sacch albis q s  misce fiat julapium perlat cujus sumat coch ij in languoribus tempore usus agitetur phiala  the next day after opening the membrane the fever and headache did again remit our patient was manifestly relieved and what is a remarkable instance of the truth of that grand physical axiom natura est sui conservatrix we could perceive the dura matter plainly to do the office of a pump throwing off at every systole a large quantity of the offensive matter together with several considerable thrombi of the grumous blood which had been effusd from the bleeding artery and fallen inwardly upon the brain  at this dressing likewise i apprehended some small particles of the brain mixed with the matter and blood aforesaid  thus we continued on the mending hand so that in few days more our little patient began to call for his playfellows and walked sturdily about the chamber the matter daily lessened grew perfectly sweet and well concocted although still some quantity thereof upon removal of the dressings we could discern to be lifted out by the vibration of the membrane whose proper elater as i just now hinted well supplied the place of the antlia or sucker in the pump or syringe casting off the offending matter so far as lay within the spheer of its activity  the same applications were still continued leaving out the tinct myrh and putting in daily a soft dossil through the wound dipped only in the mel rosarum upon the pia matter the syndons being also moistened in the same which were laid upon the upper membrane till such time as it was firmly incarnd and the flesh even with the superfice of the cranium about which time i left off the the mel ros unless a small pledgit upon the wounded part of it using nothing but dry lint which however despicable is surely the best of dressings at these times by which and a slight touch of the vitriol stone i kept off the luxuriant flesh at sometimes troublesome when improperly treated and disposed the edges of the bones for desquamation which in seven weeks time was accomplished a small part only and that upon one side exfoliating visibly  by the  0th of may our incarned flesh grew callous the pulsation underneath but little perceptible and a sound cicatrix brought over to the very edge of the apertion which had been made upon the dura matter and through which we had still a discharge of laudable pus though inconsiderable to what it had been  we kept him all this while to his first allowance of water gruel panado barleygruel milk pottage his drink chiefly milk boiled with water but growing brisk and playing about as cheerfully as ever when he had been purged two or three times with manna he had the liberty of a more free and airy chamber and indeed trespassed so far as to get down stairs to eat though sparingly fresh meat every other day and could not be restrained from all his usual exercises and diversions  our business now was to contrive the keeping open the wound i had made in the dura matter which was ready to close upon us though of the utmost consequence to be kept therefrom whilst there was any matter to be dreined off  mr b  being got abroad was easily prevailed upon to give us a visit and having inspected the work passed in his probe down to the pia matter but finding no slanting sinus on y a direct one to the brain concluded there was no dilating for indeed where could we cut unless upon this lower meninx or into the brain it self our work was all in the dark nor could we know the source of the matter daily discharging in small quantity so that all we could do was to prevent the coalition of the wound hoping that in time the said matter might be cleansed off or insinuate it self up higher into the adventitious body that was there formed from the vessels and membranes circumjacent when we might with more safety enlarge and give a freer vent  for keeping the wound open which was the more difficult in consideration of the part i proposed a little cannula but he rather preferred a bit of sponge tent which he thought would not only lie much easier but imbibing the matter discharge it at the same time  with this i complied and put in a small piece fastened about with a string on the upper part  next day when i came to open the wound i found the matter as i feared was entirely pent in nor had one drop of it passed either by the sides or through the pores of the sponge but drawing the same forth by the thread a considerable quantity collected in the twenty four hours past gusht forth and continued to be thrown off by the systole of the dura matter till it had emptied the cavity of all it could lift up  the orifice being now enlarged by the tent i applied a small pledgit of liniment on the outside having beforehand dropped in with a feather a drop or two of mel ros and observed this way of dressing still breaking asunder the uniting fibers with my probe where they were ready to coalesce and dipping its end in oil besmeared the lips of the wound by which means the matter which became now again inconsiderable made its way without obstacle  and thus we continued to the middle of may our young gentleman growing fleshy and enjoying a better state of health than he had done some years before  about this time meeting my neighbor dr morton and my brother blundel in consultation at another place and passing by my patients house i invited them to walk in where they saw him dressed and took a view of the extracted bones mr b  had the curiosity again to examine the wound and having the probe straight down for about half an inch discovered a slanting sinus not before observed as very likely but lately made when drawing it forth to bend the end he passed the same in again and lifting up the extremity we could perceive it near an inch distant from the place it entered  having made this discovery i resolved if the discharge continued much longer or any symptom returned to cut into this cavity for i had taken notice that several of our late dressings had been disturbed from the childs scratching insomuch that although the same bandage was all along continued yet by the disturbance from breeding of lice from dandrif or humor under the cuticle some one or all these causes there grew so troublesome an irching that in the night he had got all off the wound was upon closing and a dry crusty scurf or caked matter had choked up the orifice  the same day the bystanders had observed a sort of rigor had seized him which went off in a moment whilst i was dressing him next day i perceived somewhat of that kind and asked him what he ailed he replied briskly enough he could not tell nor could he help it  the wound was again opened by the digestive i had applied the day before and the scabby crust cast off with a small quantity of matter as usual to prevent the like inconvenience of rubbing off his dressings i laid over my pledgit a more adhesive emplaster clipped the hair close and rolling up his head carefully cautioned him to keep his hands off  i was very much concerned at these rigours and fearful lest the matter should have got into the blood or tainted the nerves by insinuating it self through the cortical part of the brain but did not expect the surprise so sudden for early the next morning i was alarmed with the news that the child was seized with a violent convulsion i hastened and found him senseless very strongly twitcht on the contrary side the tendons of that arm and leg especially perpetually relaxing and again contracting upon which till they thought fit to send for a physician i prescribed thus to their apothecary  aq ceras nigr  rutae aa iij  paeon c j  tinct castor ss  sir paeon c j  misce and detur cochl ij quam

his relief whilst the medicines were preparing i had him taken out of bed and strongly supported upon the knees of an attendant i took off the dressings which were in a manner dry and passing a probe there being no room either for scissars or directour into the sinus discovered two days before and turning in the same i felt the end as formerly taking out my knife i carefully cut through upon my probe and let out the same in doing this we lost no blood nor can i say indeed any matter was let out so that filling up the wound i had now made with a dossil armed with liniment and moistened with the warm bals terebinth with a pledgit of the same over it and the usual plaster compress and bandage he was laid again in his bed where presently after i perceived the spasms grew milder  returning to him in the afternoon i heard they had held him in the manner i left him for near an hour that he had been seized with two or three fits since but from the first paroxysm they observed a palsy on the arm of the side affected which was thereby become incapable of motion for the relief of which i thus directed  ol lumbricorum j  spt lavend c  aq regin hungaric aa ss  ol succin  petrol aa ij  misce and inungatur spina dorsi tepide mane and vesperi a nucha ad coxygem usque  in the evening i returned again found the child sensible his fits had been off and on at two or three hours distance he then complained of being sick and retcht to vomit his headache also was very troublesome  may the   th which was the day after these convulsions i undrest his head and found all things had an ill aspect the wound was indigested the lips puffed up and risen to a considerable height above the rest of the parts discharging only a bloody serum  i fomented again as i had done through the whole course of my attendance ordering each time the fotus was taken from the fire two spoonfulls of the aq hungaric to be put therein applied several warm stuphs and with my digestive made up as before at this time i observed a lypothumia on which account i hastened them to lay him down in his bed administering some drops of the sp lavend in a little of the julep  he continued sensible all that day still crying out of his head but at night was delirous at some times  the next day i perceived the wound was crude still and no sign of matter the turgid lips turning livid and a very languid oscillation underneath the whole membrane so far as had been bare to the very edges of the fracturd cranium was stangely huft up or elevated  i passed my probe down cautiously upon the pia matter and could feel all round a pappy excrescens which had incarnd upon the lower membrane or was formed together with the upper and the adjacent vessels from whence arose upon drawing back my instrument a small quantity of matter  i now ventured to drop in a little of my bals terebinth to the bottom of the wound and as to the rest made up as the day before  may the  0th he grew comatose crying faintly now and then his head and dropped asleep that night his spasms returned with which the paralytic arm was chiefly and severely handled the wound tending to gangreen which i scarrifyd snipping off some part of the lips at the same time but had little or no blood following either my scissars or lancet  seeing now no advantage to be gained but only disturbance to the child i dressed him for that time with a somewhat warmer application on account of the gangreen concluding to give neither my self nor him any more trouble  that day and next the convulsions were seldom off and when they were he was perfectly stupid sometimes indeed he would attempt to speak but could not  however on the   d finding him still alive i thought it would be deemed an omission if i did not inspect his wound and as he lay along i took off the dressings found the lips flabby and subsiding so far from appearing to digest that every thing tended to a suddenly approaching death having covered up his head again i took my leave  the next day which was the   d of may i had notice given me he was dead  thus did this little hero of truly manly courage who had struggled under and got through so many difficulties and seemed now in vulgar estimation to have been well and out of danger for a long time past at last decease after fourscore and four days and indeed had there been nothing more than the fracture and depression how desperate soever they might seem yet his cure had been completed in a much shorter time but considering the large abscess upon the pia matter its rupture or erosion from whence there issued as mr h  can testify some of the outward substance of the brain twas little wonder nature should succumb and baffle art but very surprising that for three months time whilst matter lay upon this noble part neither palsy spasm sopor nor so much as a vertigo should invade but on the contrary that the child should eat drink and sleep as actively tumbling about with his companions and as ready if he had not been prevented to stand upon his head as any of em all  i am very confident i should not have magnified my own judgment had i succeeded in this cure which the gentleman aforesaid was pleased to allow would have been one of the greatest had been performed in england and if so i think i may say elsewhere as it was i thought there would intervene somewhat worthy of remark and accordingly as i generally do of rare cases i made this ephemeris which if it should not furnish matter of instruction as i hope it may to my younger brother yet will it let him see how near he may come to the accomplishment of his work and at last meet with disappointment  the day after his death i took with me a small capital saw and a dissecting knife and placing the head to my advantage i divided the scalp from the base of the occiput close by the sagittal suture to the top of the forehead then turning it down together with the temporal muscle which i raised at the same time over the ear of the wounded side of the head with the back of my knife i cleared off the pericranium and with my saw guided by a line of ink i had drawn beforehand on the top as well as on that side i got through the skull which being removed with the end of my spathula the right hemisphere of the brain i found would come into view by only clipping off the dura matter but before i began to meddle with this latter having raised up the side of the skull i took special notice of that part of the membrane which i had formerly divided or cut into and of the subjacent pia matter and cerebrum  i perceived there had been engendered a fibrous substance but whether springing from the tender meninx or complicated together of both membranes and vessels was not so easy to determine two or three days before it seemed to be an inch thick but after death growing flabby it parted upon the least touch and was fallen off from the upper membrane though here and there continuous with the under one  when i had removed this interposing body i expected to find some latent abscess upon the substance of the brain at least upon the pia matter where all that was conspicuous an indication there had been such were the larger ramifications of the sanguiferous vessels upon the surface of the membrane whose cavities instead of their naturally contained cruor were implete with a transparent pus more especially those upon the anterior lobe under the os frontis where the headache was at first as well as at the last continually pointed to  cutting into the cortical part of the brain i found all free and clear as in a sound state the ventricles likewise the oblong marrow also the cerebell were firm and to the eye untainted  being now minded to take a view of the other side i divided the falx and without sawing off that part of the cranium with my hand brought out the left hemispheer the vessels on whose surface in like manner with the right were conspicuously turgid with the same matter a little of which here and there was shed upon the cortex of the brain at the first sight i thought it might lie on the outside of the pia matter but going over gently with the back of my knife and wiping also with a soft sponge i found it not removed so that in several places opening the membrane with the point of my lancet i perceived it lay immediately upon the substance of the brain and issued out through each apertion  having thus far satisfied my own curiosity i placed the brain where i found it and fitting to the divided skull drew over the scalp which stitching up and with the point of my needle raisingthe short hair to cover the said stiches twas no easy matter for the nicest surveyor to perceive that the brain had been taken out and inspected or the cranium meddled with but this only by the bye  it may be now expected i should descend to the aetiologye and rationally solve or mechanically explain the foregoing phenomenon but as to this i think i may as well in general confess my ignorance as pretend to unfold that for another persons which i never could elucidate to my own satisfaction  till the business of sensation is better unravelled than hitherto it has been or i fear will be die disorders of the nervous system may be conjectured but not clearly demonstrated  whither there be any such bodies as the animal spirits is not yet universally agreed on that the source of these disorders lies somewhere in the  and that the nervous bodies thence arising are some how or other the causae sine qua of motion and perception seems incontestable thus far we may go and trace out many appearances thus also from the bare motion of the particles of matter as they happen to be this or that way modified may we by mechanic laws account for sundry observables in the animal structure but how mere matter which way soever figured can at first give guide and govern the impetus is unaccountable it is here that the poor twilight of humane understanding is truly nonplust and what we argue must be still a posteriori we may judge having aforehand discovered the effect produced that the like under similar circumstances will be brought forth again thus the quod sit is apparent but the quomodo out of sight  it is manifest the blow upon our little patients head was the remote cause of his death by occasioning a rupture of some of the vessels upon the brain which shedding forth their blood upon this noble part did there being not discharged produce an aposteme and when the purulent matter was afterward imbibed or absorbed by some of the said vessels it might in the way of circulation raise a febrile effervescence and it is very rational to believe that the same matter also did impress a taint upon the nerves exciting together an orgasmus to the subversion of the whole economy  but what these putrid bodies are which did the mischief or in what their essence does consist how or after what manner and why they came chiefly to affect the arm on the contrary side how after a few minutes they brought on a paralysis or how the nervous fibers with the tendons of the muscles in that arm and leg came so regularly and alternately to be haled by the direful spasms is what i know little or nothing of  it is true i might make some noise and talk of venomous exhalations or malign and poisonous miasmata which insinuating into the fibers like so many stimuli must needs twitch and convell those exquisitely sensible the nervous bodies with some i might denominate them acids with others atkelyes or with our curious mathematical gentlemen i might essay to investigate the configuration of their parts whether cubes cones prisms etc and so let you into the way of their operation upon the animal spirits or the nervous filaments and when i had gone thus far a judiciously learned man would see i had harrangud to very little purpose and that i might as well have owned it was some how or other the effect was brought about but which way i could not tell  let the adept in atheism here strut and pride himself in his recourse to a mundane soul or his omnipotent nature let him take up with those unintelligible terms of his archaeus or his plastic powers whilst i who never yet shook off the sacred ties of religion and am self conscious how great a debtor i am to his munificence look up to the prime architect the great  and cordially as well as orally acknowledge that it was he that made me and not i my self that man is fearfully and wonderfully formed being perfectly ignorant of the how and when he was so  in this confession i have the suffrage of the greatest men of the faculty such i mean as the renowned harvey and the famous lower the latter ingeniously acknowledging that it was the prerogative of god only who searches the secrets of the heart to know the reason of its motion also  to these i may well add that incomparable benefactor to medicine and therein to mankind the judicious sydenham who on this topic thus expresses himself

necessario fuerit exerenda epist ad gulielm cole  i hope this excursion will be deemed pardonable in which i was willing to take notice of the vain arrogance of such as fancy nothing to be insolvable by their supposedly unbounded comprehension  i must confess i would not willingly by any means discourage that most noble and useful study of the mathematics whose improvements are so advantageous so great and profitable to the public as well as satisfactory and pleasant to each proficient but yet i cannot see that medicine strictly speaking will be much advanced thereby nor how the fluids or humors of the body from a thousand imperceptible accidents diversifying their texture are at all compatible with the strict and plain rule of lines or figures  i am not unacquainted how many pretty hints are given how many probable truths unveiled for this and future ages to build some farther discoveries upon in that most excellent baglivian tract de motrice fibra yet surely those who have been entirely ignorant of baglivis system have done excellent service to their country in the faculty of physic and truly for my own part i never expect to find more real advantage accruing to mankind in general this way by the whole clan of phylosophic and mathematical physicians notwithstanding some modern flourishings than has already by that most diligently observing and heedfully reflecting the last of the forementiond authors whatever others may opine i neither know nor am solicitous being my self well satisfied that nothing short of omniscience will ever be able to bring medicine to bear strictly with mathematics  how improvable the humane intellect may be in its new clothing futurity must determine it is at present manifestly bounded and that in spite of all our proud pretenses to a narrow compass so that the most knowing amongst us knows truly only this that the all powerful and immense being who has geometrically fabricated these bodies of ours and observed a just number weight and measure in his works or in other words the supreme  who gave life to man the undoubted masterpiece of the sublunary creation fitted the great spring of motion and set all the lesser wheels a going in the most wonderful automaton that it is he i say and he alone who can and does foresee the result of all the several particles of matter traversing the machine under the variety of each or all their several combinations  some inferences by way of corollary from the preceding discourse   that wounds into the brain are not always mortal    that so far as the pia matter circumvolves or enters into the gyrations of the cortical part there is a medium of unition or a basis to incarn upon so that although this part of the brain be shed the sick or wounded may recover nay that although great portions of the same work out we must nor desperately forsake the patient since the shattered edges of this membrane may fortunately however unexpectedly concide and coalesce to prevent the farther eruption and afford the said medium to incarn upon this conceded it follows    that wounds upon the dura matter how dubious soever are by no means to be accounted desperate and that it is justifiable practice after the use of the trepan the dreadful symptoms not remitting and the membrane outwardly discovering no apparent cause to make apertion through for the timely discharge of the extravasate blood or matter underneath the want of this apertion having rendered these accidents too often fatal    that neither the fracture nor deprest skull how extraordinary soever they might appear were to be surmised as the proper causes of the childs death in the foregoing narrative much less the solution of continuity made by the lancet on the dura matter    that the shedding some portion of the brain as hinted by the first inference was none of the deadly causes but    that his death was owing to the effused blood from some vessel upon the pia matter which had been rupturd by the concussion or shock of the said vessel from the force of the blow which blood pent in for want of a discharge had formed an abscess thereby deluging the surface of the brain with matter and this though continually dreining of through the orifice in the upper membrane yet some part thereof lying beyond the elastic power of the said membrane to raise up and out of the reach of medicine to deterge and mundisie was at length imbibed by the vessels where missing the salutary crisis sometimes observed in the empieme and pluritic cases it was conveyed by the circulation to the heart and at length we are to suppose some how affected the nervous systeme bringing on the fatal spasm    that the brain justly supposed the fountain as well of motion as sensation is a body senseless that its parts are not homogeneous that its substance is not strictly glandulous nor properly medullary that we may call it substantia suiipsius vel proprii generis or speaking plain truth we may say it is something we know not what    that we are very little acquainted with the modus of sensation or muscular motion neither are we agreed whether there be an intromission to or an emission from the organ of the species to the object or vice versa we know as little how the same is conveyed to the common sensory or the idaea there formed by the soul nor is it uncontroverted whether sense in the common acceptance is not better accounted for by simple contact after the manner of a stroke upon a line extended which is no sooner given at the one end than felt at the other than by the medium of those subtle bodies we call animal spirits which how fine soever yet is so instantaneous a motion by them to communicate the apprehended object altogether unintelligible    that our knowledge of the causes and effects of some nervous distempers arrives but to a well grounded guess or rational conjecture and in likelihood will continue as inexplicable to the humane understanding under its present limited condition as is the essence of the soul it self on which account it is more becoming a modest man however learned to act the skeptic rather than the dogmatist with relation to these obscure and intricate phenomenon   0 and lastly that we must despair of bringing medicine under exact mathematic discipline till the primordia or till the intime nature of the corpuscles that make up the body are more clearly discovered to us and that we can foresee the several ways that matter may be impressed by a differing turn or a new modification which will scarce fall out till we our selves are got into a higher class of beings than that of too much selfconceited men in the mean while though we decry neither philosophy nor mathematics when employed upon their proper subjects without which we are sensible no improvement is to be made in the liberal or in mechanic arts yet can we not believe they will stand either physicians or surgeons in so much stead as some fine spoken gentlemen would

the skull which the surgeons call trepanning there is a silver or gold plate fixed into the hole out of which the bone was taken this is intended to satisfy if possible those over credulous people that the same is a notorious abuse on their belief and if such a thing was ever seen in the perforation it was after presently removed by the person concerned in the roguish fraud  it might seem amongst the more reasonable part of mankind there should be no need of such an information nor had i given my self a trouble of this nature for which i hazard being laughed at by every artist had i not frequently met as well with those of a discerning faculty enough in other matters who had swallowed this delusion as with the more easily deceived vulgar apprehensions  whilst i was treating my patient in the preceding narration a person of more figure indeed than capacity asserted to my face as the most assured truth that she had seen one of these plates in a skull just bored a second as cunning as the former strenuously avouched that her own husband upon an accident having undergone this operation had a plate she see put in and which many years after he carried with him to his grave  a bystander looking over others shoulders whilst i was laying a piece of white sarsnet into the hole made in the childs skull which we call a syndon and which i verily believe has often contributed to this vulgar error went away and reported he had seen the plate fixed in  now if they consider what disturbance they meet with if any extraneous body be thrust into the flesh which has no quiet till removed or till the place apostemates or festers and throws it out they would see the impossibility of this plates uniting with or growing to the bone where it cannot lie long without putrefying the flesh rotting the skull and dropping in upon the brain but if some practitioners have been so base as to contribute to this egregious imposition on mankind it is not strange that the people should spread the rumor and deceive one another  thus i was told by a surgeon used to the sea too many of whom are apt to take the travellers authority who openly acknowledged that under the necessity of a gold plate which he put in and after conveyed away to fill up the hole in his patients head he had got more from him than he could afterward for his cure  farther that wemay see the nature and prevalency of spreading error one of my own patients as i have been informed that she might appear the greater object of their wonder though she knew every time she told her story she was telling a lie of the first magnitude would often assert she carried one of these plates in her head neither wanted she for vouchers amongst such as fancied they could plainly feel it  to put a final stop therefore to this error so far at least as this publication reaches and farther to gratisie the inquisitive who may want to be informed how the hole is filled up they are to conceive that a new flesh is engendered after few days upon the skin that covers the brain and raises it self up even by the help of art to the outer edge of the skull where soon after it hardens into what the surgeons call a callus the said callus skinned over in some longer time becoming as hard as any other part of the skull it self for the truth of which let the still doubting apply themselves to their own surgeon
