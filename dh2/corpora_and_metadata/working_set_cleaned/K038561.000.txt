the law of lombardy a tragedy as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  written by robert jephson esquire author of braganza  london printed for t evans near yorkbuildings strand mdcclxxix price one shilling and sixpence  to the king sir your majestys having graciously permitted me to prefix your royal name to this tragedy has impressed me with so deep a sense of the honor that i despair of finding terms sufficient to express my acknowledgments  though the public which is seldom disposed to receive favorably performances destitute of merit has been pleased to give this a very indulgent reception i must still regret its imperfections when i consider that it may for a moment become the object of your majestys attention having omitted nothing in my power to render it not entirely unworthy of such an exalted patronage i cannot forbear to flatter myself that it may raise in the breast of your majesty those emotions which well imagined distress never fails to excite in the noblest natures but at the same time i more anxiously wish that no other uneasiness but from such fictitious sorrow may ever approach you and that the greatest and most amiable sovereign in europe may be also for ever distinguished as the most prosperous and happy  i am sir your majestys most dutiful subject and most obliged humble servant robert jephson  dramatis personae paladore mr smith king mr bensley rinaldo mr packer ascanio mr hurst lucio mr farren senator mr chambers shepherd mr wright foresters mr wrighten mr fawcet squire to paladore mr philemore and  bireno mr henderson princess miss young alinda mrs robinson the law of lombardy a tragedy act i scene i a chamber in the palace bireno alinda alinda i wonder not you should suspect me slow in this strange office had you but enjoined me shut out the sun ten times his annual rounds feed all my life on pulse or with coarse weeds obscure the little grace which natures hand has lent my outside then without a wherefore from the meek humbleness of love i bear you my obedience would have followed  bireno sweet impatience smooth that contracted brow   alinda but to commend to any other woman those fond vows i hoped to own unpartnerd is it less than to expect my tongue suborned should plead against the dearest interest of my life and make me earnest for my own undoing  bireno must i again call down the saints to witness that for convenience only not from love i seek to wed the princess my ambition aims at the crown her dower were that bright gem heird by a pigmy the mere mock of sight by idiot drawling and a shrews perverseness no less should i desire it if i prosper my heart as ever shall be thine and hers the dull legitimate languor of the husband  alinda but when to royal state sophia joins such rare endowments as make doubtful strife twixt natures gifts and fortunes can i hope more than some grateful note from memory how much alinda loved you  bireno trust me fair one beautys degrees are in the lovers fancy not in a scaled perfection varying nature has lineaments for every appetite not her arched brows nor stature junolike her crisped tresses spun from finest gold nor the intelligent luster of her eye to me have half such charms as thy soft mien the pure carnation of thy dimpling cheek and unassuming sweet simplicity  but have thou urged my suit  alinda spite of ourselves the tongue interprets from the abundant heart birenos image filling all my thoughts could i be silent on a theme so loved  bireno and how does she receive the gentle tale  alinda sometimes she chides and sometimes smiling tells me but that she knows me wise such lavish praise might hint a heart touched deeply and ill suits the sober preference of an humble maid who cannot hope to call you hers in honor then with discreetest lessons will she school me to guard my breast against love forgetting still how much she wants the counsel she bestows  bireno does she then love  alinda she never told me so but signs far more significant than speech reveal it hourly  bireno let me know my rival though my foreboding heart already whispers it must be paladore  alinda oh rightly guessed her love for him makes her unjust to you  bireno curses overtake him near his brighter fires my star shines dimly i was wondered at till this new meteor shot across mens eyes and drew all gaze to follow at our tournaments he foils me like a novice in grave council i prate unmarked while hoary heads bow down in reverence to his weighty utterance and thus the upstart heresy of opinion runs on this smooth impostor  by what signs take you this note of her affection toward him  alinda by such we women deem infallible if unexpectedly she hears him named sweet discomposure seizes all her frame suffasion softer than auroras blush spreads over her beauteous cheek if she expect his presence at the court studious to please beyond her wonted elegance of dress with nicer care she counsels at her glass to make the daintiest workmanship of nature by ornament more winning  bireno indications that speak and shrewdly yet their vanity to catch the flattery of the fool they scorn will bait such hooks as these have you no proof more unequivocal  alinda what would you more we reason from ourselves looking within we find in our own breasts the according springs of motions similar when first i loved so did i wish to please so doubt my power yet more than this her eye still follows him and when the unwelcome hour of parting comes the cheerful flame that lighted up her countenance expires sighs heave and a soft silent tear steals down her cheek  bireno enough i am satisfied she loves him and the frost of my reception conspires in proof now then my best alinda you must assist me on this single push hang all my fortunes  if my rival wed her farewell my hopes my country   alinda how your country a voluntary exile for the loss of one you swear you love not   bireno my possessions the means of pleasure to my thriftless youth moulder in confiscation thus my dukedom my royal ancestry and rank in the state so scantily supported will but mock me a marriage with the princess would heal all but if i fail i will not stay to see upstarts made rich by my inheritance nor the proud finger of the slave i scorn point at the princely beggar  alinda oh good heaven devise command  can my best industry prevent this ruin tell me but the means and bid me fly  bireno no more of jealousy but with appliance dextrous call her thoughts to me and my deservings speak with slight yet not as by suggestion of my rival i have known more way made in a womans grace by such confederate arts than could be won by a long siege of amorous enginry soft flatteries sighs protestings infinite and all the fervor of impatient love  alinda but should this fail  bireno i will spread a finer snare subtle as fabled vulcan forged in lemnos to enmesh them thy soft hand my dear alinda must help to hold the toils   alinda but see she comes the king too and her lover   bireno i will retire and seek thee presently rivet thine ear meantime to what they utter thy report shall somewhat shape my course highflighted fool check thy bold soaring else my hot revenge shall melt thy waxed plumes and hurl thee down to a devouring sea that roars beneath thee exit  alinda retires scene ii king princess paladore attendants king you shall no more sophia to the chase this mornings danger makes my blood run cold had not thy wellsped lance brave paladore pierced the huge boar that gored her foaming horse these eyes now raised in thanks to heaven and thee had wept her lifeless  paladore ever praised be fortune that placed me near her since a common feat that daily dies our weapons thus ennobled by blessed conjunct on with her precious safety i would not change for the best garland won by caesars conquering sword  princess we are not nice in dangers imminent to choose the means of our deliverance yet believe me sir more than for life preserved i thank the chance that made you my preserver the unwelcome hand rendering us service like sharp frost in sunshine chills the fresh blossom of our gratitude which else uncheckd would put forth all its sweetness  king i have much serious matter for your ear to paladore our helms must be laced close our swords new edged against fiercer foes than these rude foresters that make us sport with peril  paladore by my life my cruel heart beats high to give it welcome for virtues test is action  king thus my paper brief its contents but fearful burgundy stung by refusal of my daughters love stirs up commotion against our kingdoms peace and soon the golden grain of lombardy shall be trod down beneath the furious heel of peasants cased in iron  princess heaven avert it for sure twere better i had never been born than live the fatal cause why wars rude blast disturbed the quiet of my fathers age which soft repose should foster the grieved people will chide your gentleness that did not bend my heart to this obedience and your virtue seen through the unwelcome color of the event for reverence find upbraiding  king no sophia i would not violate the meanest right of my least subject for the fear or promise of any issue is my child my daughter sweet duteous amiable burn free and royal less charterd from oppression than a stranger a selfinvited wooer here he sojourned to thrive as your approving gave him license i fed him not with promise you with hope nor shall audacious menace ere extort what courtesy denied him  paladore to his teeth hurl your defiance king it is proud to threaten but baseness to be awed by it from my breast i would tear these hallowed symbols give this steel to be a babys plaything could my heart distrustful of the event forbode one fear to cast black presage on a cause so noble  king thou gem of britain dear in my esteem as were thou native here be pavias shield her pride her pillar yes our hardy files led on by thee shall drive the boaster back to mourn at home his baffled preparations  paladore oh would the fortune of this glorious strife hung on my arm alone  king our daughters hand is destined for a prince who draws his blood from the same source as mine our kingdoms heir did not this sweet prevention stand between to bless bireno with two matchless gifts her beauty and a royal diadem  princess bireno sir  king even he i know his worth  but is there poison in my kinsmans name it pales the healthful vermeil of your cheek dims your bright eye and viels your wonted smiles  princess alas i cannot speak   king why then hereafter will better suit this subject sir farewell we shall expect your aid to counsel with us what present mounds our wisdom best may raise against this loud torrent that at distance roars ere it rush down to spread its ruin round us exit  scene iii princess paladore princess oh stay and hear me now alas he is gone who smiles on me and kills me bids my heart be traitor to itself yet with soft words fetters my tongue which free would boldly answer such kindness but destroys me  paladore my souls idol i was indeed presumptuous to believe these humble arms were destined to enfold so vast a treasure yet aspiring love hopes things impossible  princess bireno he i would rather waste my life in singleness like the pale votarist pour faint orisons at the cold shrines of senseless marble saints and wear the eternal pavement with my knees than at the sacred altar load my soul with holy perjuries to love the man at whose approach my heart alarmed shrinks back while thought confirms instinctive natures hate  paladore see like a haughty conqueror he comes pleasure and pride on his exulting brow at distance speak his triumph  princess arm me disdain to meet the bold intruder  gentle paladore it is thus thy rival woos me courtships season is the short date of womans sovereignty for liberty we have but in exchange the little tribute of a lovers sighs his humble seeming and soft courtesy yet these he thinks too rich a sacrifice and owns no advocate but pride in love  scene iv to them bireno bireno confirmed fair princess by the kings command you see me here a joyful visitant it is not unknown why warlike burgundy spreading his hostile banners to the wind makes sword and fire his dreadful harbingers  princess the cause i have heard  but on  paladore aside down swelling heart  bireno your yet unplighted hand gives to this war its edge and color to remove that prize beyond the invaders reach my sovereigns wisdom deems the best means to blunt his hostile sword therefore on me he deigns   princess i understand but have no present ear for such a theme my fathers goodness left my choice unforced of one unwelcome suitor the same justice secures me from compulsion in a second  bireno and must i bear this answer to the king  princess myself will be my own interpreter and save your trouble once more sir i thank you  to paladore and exit scene v bireno paladore bireno well go thy ways womans epitome beauteous aenigma who would solve you rightly must thus interpret make your outward semblance an index pointing to its contrary when your smooth polished vizors beam in smiles displeasures at your hearts the moody brow tells inward sunshine tears are joy not sorrow you sooth where you approve not and look gall when sweet content honies your appetites  paladore these common railings against that gentle sex denote his humor more who utters them than their defect or any deep conception but you have chosen a season for hard thoughts rebukes your censure still the chambers air winnows her balmy breathing from our eyes scarce glides her beauteous form when your dark spleen as venomed things suck poison from sweet flowers finds matter for distempers nourishment and food for calumny in excellence  bireno her form indeed is fair  paladore ay and her mind if more can be more fair more amiable thy neverrenderd snowcold apenine is not so free from taint as from offense her spotless bosom yet has she a tear healing as balm for others frailties that makes remission heavenly sweet persuasion hangs on her words with power oracular to shame the cynics chiding  spirit of truth she is thy visible divinity and it is thy reverence to pay homage to her  bireno it is to my wish aside  i grant her well endowed and in fair seeming most preeminent but for these other virtues you have named they are of different climes and earlier ages our pavias ladies cast in earthly moulds they make the most of natures liberal gifts put pleasure out to usury and love as ease convenience or the moment sways them  paladore youre pleasant lord  bireno no soberly thy friend shall i be plain  paladore what call you your past measure was it a courtiers strain  bireno you love the princess  paladore and heaven may be beloved   bireno ay and hoped too for heaven has many mansions and receives too large for limitation all deservers but in a ladys heart there is but one place though many may contend for it therefore friend waste not your precious sighs which might enkindle bright sparks of equal love in some soft breast destined to mate your fondness in hopeless wooing search not the cause believe me on my truth it is past all reckoning hopeless  paladore nothings hopeless though deeds untried often seem impossible and craven sloth molting his sleekless plumes with drowsy wonder views the adventurous wing that soars the shining azure over his head what will not yield to daring victory sits on the helm whose crest is confidence and boldness wins success in loves soft strife as in the dangerous din of rattling war  bireno how could i make me sport were i light minded were i malignant mischief from this mood that runs so contrary to all sober sense  but here i rest in kindness  be advised push not a desperate purpose by my life the princess loves you not  paladore i will bear no more  matchless audacity let me take thee in from crown to toe walk round thee and survey thee like a prodigious thing for such thou should be to put my course of love in circumscription and school me like a boy with unsought precept  bireno lovers are sick with fevers of the brain diseased by airy hope high flighted fancy imaginations bred from selfconceit an arch deluder which presents the juno their frenzy grasps at with a zone unbound while like ixions mistress the coy queen slumbers on golden beds in high olympus  paladore hear me proud duke had i no other spur but thy forbidding were there no incitement from her transcendent beauty did no beam shoot from her eye to light eternal love at passions altar were she swart and froward oh blasphemy to think it in despite i would assume an unfelt ecstasy invoke her name till echo should grow faint with the perpetual burden and devise all means of contradiction to proclaim scorn of thy council and defiance to thee  bireno then hear to dash thy pride since thus you urge me my experience of her lightness well she knows would freeze me as her husband and her hand which but to save appearances i ask i would reject if offered so her craft sooths you with feigned endearments as a mistress i find her worth my holding but a wife fit for a prince must come with better gifts than amorous blood and beauty  nay but mark me  paladore trust not too far the reverence of this place  away  thou yet art safe  my sword once drawn   bireno am i so lost in your esteem you hold me your friend professed in malice capable or falsehood thus to wound you  paladore both by heaven  bireno and will maintain this thinking  palodore with my life   bireno it is a deep venture  mine upon my truth  when fullorbd phoebe wheel her fleecy car to silver yon blue concave midst the pines that wave their green tops over the battlement of her nightchamber in the garden meet me alone when we encounter in that place you there shall listen to conditions meet for both our honors so till then farewell  paladore alone i will meet thee be assured i will gird on thy keenest edge if thou have aught unsettled in this world dispatch it quickly we stand upon the utmost verge of fate and one or both of us must plunge for ever exit  scene vi bireno alone the wise should watch the event on fortunes wheel that for a moment circles at the top and seized not vanishes  i must about it my all is at stake  ye ministers of vengeance that hide your gory locks in misthung caves and roll your deadly eyeballs over the edge of your insatiate daggers shaking ever dews of oblivious sleep from your stung brows receive me of your band never to know peace till this keen writhing vulture quit my heart and with blunt beak and flagging wings outstretchd drowze over the mangled victims of my rage  end of the first act act ii scene i a chamber princess alone oh blessed most blessed are the insensible in the mild zone of calm indifference no hatred chills them and no passion burns to feed and sleep and do observance due to the stale ritual of quaint ceremony fills up the humble measure of their hope smooth and unruffled glides their temperate stream and one day rounds their whole lifes history oh had my heart been such but nature poised in distribution when she gives the touch alive to exstacy in like extreme subjects the sense to anguish the same soul that in the hope of wedding paladore enjoyed its sum of bliss with equal pain averts me from his rival thus entranced twixt love and fear i feel the pangs of both and the sharp conflict rends me ha my father now comes the trial  scene ii king princess king how in tears sophia come it is not well  i fear i guess the cause this morn i did but hint a purpose to you of import dear to your own happiness and your changed brow reproving my intent cut short my free discourse  princess oh good my lord i am not practiced to conceal my thoughts and least from you by casting over my looks the unaltered vizor of tranquillity when perturbation like a sleepless guest forbids my bosoms quiet  king i have loved thee with fondness so unbated that twere needless for confirmation to attest by words what all my thoughts my lifes whole carriage toward thee have set beyond the question  princess oh to me your love has been like those perpetual springs that ever flow and waste not my least wish scarce had its birth ere its accomplishment in your preventive kindness  king since it is so if chance the current of my present will to yours run contrary you must not deem that merely to enforce authority or wake controlement which might sleep to death in its difuse i now expect the course of your desires should lose themselves in mine or flow by my direction  princess as my father the giver of my life i reverence you next as your subject my obedience stands bound by the general tie but since your power has still been tempered so with lenity that even the strangers cause with patient hearing is weighed ere you determine i your daughter may hope at least an equal privilege with favor in my audience  king i were else unnatural withholding from my child what aliens claim by justice give me hearing  the duke bireno loves you has my promise that like a wellgracd advocate my tongue should win your gentle favor to his suit urging such commendations of his love as modesty though conscious of desert may wish you hear yet cannot speak itself  princess ah sir forbear he knows my heart already already has he heard from my own lips i cannot love him poorly he engages your honored combination in a league that whatsoever its issue must conspire to wound your daughters peace  king by heaven you wrong him to wound your peace he seeks your happiness and so am i his second  princess but these means are adverse to the end for if i wed him this is no raving of rash extacy on death that only can dissolve my chain will hang my future hope as eagerly as the poor weary seabeat mariner pants for the shore so shall my outstretchd arms embrace the welcome terror my refusal to you the gentlest kindest best of fathers must seem repugnance harsh and over my duty before untainted casts the sickly hue of pale suspicion thus begins his love fearful to me in each alternative  king why this is infant rhetric to protest the impulse of a strong antipathy which never causeless sways the human breast yet give no reason why  princess alas to feel it oermasters every reason need we search to ground aversion on weighed argument when instinct cuts the tedious process short and makes the heart our umpire  king hear me calmly  my days are almost numbered this white head bears not in vain its reverend monitors time puts a tongue in every hoary hair to warn the wise man of mortality when i am gone behold thy single state unhusbanded unfatherd stands exposed even as the tender solitary shrub on the bleak mountains summit  every blast may bend or break thy sweetness this strong fence this union would enroot its shelter round and like a forest shield thee  princess let me hope a stronger sense in a whole peoples love their grateful memory of my fathers virtue and loyalty hereditarly mine descending like the scepter to your issue  king think thou my aspiring kinsman whose ambition impatient waits till my declining beam give place to his meridian who already wins from my side a moiety of my court by his successions hope will tamely view that scepter wielded by a womans hand nor wrest it from thy grasp no my fair kingdom i see the meeting torrents of contention deluge thy peaceful vales while her weak sex unable to direct or stem the tide will be borne down and swept to ruin with it  princess these evils but in possibility may never come but oh it is certain sorrow to promise love obedience duty honor when the hearts record vouches against the tongue it changes orders course the holy tie of weilproportiond marriage still supposes these bonds have gone before nor is there power creative in the simple ceremony the seed unsown to give that harvest growth  king here break we off  to sue and sue in vain but ill becomes a father may my augury be more in fear than wisdom hold tomorrow the council meets to scan this threatened war the people call it thine then be thou present to thank and animate their zeal to serve us exit  scene iii princess alone i shall attend your order this cold parting speaks his displeasure and my heart accustomed to the kind sunshine of approving smiles droops at the chilling change ye gentle breasts strangers as yet to love be warned by me soft as the printless step of midnight sleep the subtle tyrant steals into the soul once seated there securely he controuls the idle strife of unimpassiond ties and laughs to scorn their sober impotence as feeble vassals list their arms in vain in the unequal conflict soon overthrown they prove their weakness and his power supreme exit  scene iv a garden rinaldo alone night he must pass this way through the postern gate that leads here only with distempered pace i saw him hasten since the evening banquet his wild demeanor  has put on more change than yonder fickle planet in her orb just now he seized his sword looked at and poised it then girt it round him while his bloodshot eye and heaving bosom spoke the big conception of some dire purpose there is mischief toward  i may perhaps prevent it  these tall shrubs will hide me from his view  soft soft it is he  rinaldo retires scene v paladore alone paladore why do i shake thus if indeed she is false i should rejoice to have the spell unbound that chains me to delusion he swears deeply but bad mens oaths are breath and their base lies with holiest adjurations stronger vouched than native truth which centered in itself rests in its simpleness then this bold carriage urging the proof by test infallible the witness of my sight why these combined spite of my steady seeming vipertoothd gnaw at my constancy and inward spread suggestions which unmasterd soon would change the ruddy heart to blackness but oh shame these doubts are slanders leigers  sweetest innocence that now perhaps lapt in elysian sleep see heaven in vision let not these base sounds creep on thy slumber lest they startle rest and change thy trance to horror  lo he comes yon light that glimmers twixt the quivering leaves like a small star directs his footsteps hither  scene vi to him bireno with a lanthorn bireno your pardon sir i fear i have made you wait  but here beneath the window of his mistress a lover favored and assured like you must have a thousand pleasant fantasies to entertain his musing  paladore sir my fancy has various meditations no one thought mixed with disloyalty of her whose honor your boldness would attaint  bireno then you hold firm i am a boaster  paladore it is my present creed  bireno twere kind perhaps to leave you in that error the wretch who dreams of bliss while his sleep lasts is happy as in waking certainty but if he is roused and roused to misery he sure must curse the hand that shook his curtain  paladore i have no time for maxims and your mirth is most unseasonable thus far to endure perhaps is too much tameness  to the purpose   bireno with all convenient speed youre not to learn we have a law peculiar to this realm that subjects to a mortal penalty all women nobly born be their estate single or husbanded who to the shame of chastity oerleap its thorny bounds to wanton in the flowery path of pleasure nor is the proper issue of the king by royalty exempted  paladore so i have heard but wherefore urge you this  bireno not without reason i draw my sword in peace now place your lips here on this sacred cross by this deep oath most binding to our order you must swear whatever you see or whatsoever your wrath from what you see that never shall your tongue reveal it to the danger of the princess  paladore a most superfluous bond  but on i swear  bireno hold yet a little now sir once again let this be touched  your enmity to me if by the process it should be provoked must in your breast be smothered not break out in tilting at my life nor your gage thrown for any after quarrel the cause weighed i might expect your love but it is the stuff and proper quality of hoodwinked rage to wrest offense from kindness  paladore should your proof keep pace with your assurance scorn not rage will here be paramount and my sword sleep from my indifference to a worthless toy valued but in my untried ignorance  bireno so you determine wisely i must bind you to one condition more if i make palpable her preference in my favor you must turn your back on lombardy and never more seek her encounter  paladore by a soldiers faith should it be so i would not breathe your air a moment longer for the sovreignty of all the soil washed by your wandering po  bireno summon your patience now for sure you will need it  paladore you have tried it to the last dally no more i shiver in expectance come your proofs  bireno well you will have them know you first this writing  gives a paper paladore it is the character of fair sophia  bireno i think so and as such received it from her conveyed with such sweet action to my hand as waked the nimble spirit of my blood whispering how kind were the contents within this light will aid the moon though now she shines in her full splendour at your leisure read it  paladore reading kind words indeed i fear i fear too common  bireno it works as i could wish how his cheek whitens his fiery eye darts through each tender word as it would burn the paper  paladore reading ever constant  let me look once again is my fight false oh would it were fain would i cast the blame to save her crime on my imperfect sense but did she give you this  bireno look to the address  paladore oh darkness on my eyes i have seen too much there is not a letter but like necromancy withers my corporal functions shame confound her  bireno as you before were tardy of belief you now are rash behold these little shadows these you have seen before producing two pictures  paladore what is this what is this my picture as i live i gave the false one and here is she promised me oh womans faith i was your champion once deceitful sex thought your fair minds  but hold i may be rash  this letter and these pictures might be yours by the kings power compelling her reluctant to write and send them therefore let me see all you have promised  you expect her summons at yon miranda   bireno yes the time draws near she ever is most punctual this small light our wonted signal stand without its ray for should she spy more than myself beneath fearing discovery she will retire again into her chamber  when her beauteous form breaks like the moon as fair though not so cold from yonder window  paladore ha by hell it opens   bireno stand you apart a moment while i climb yon orb now brazd to this accustomed scene will show you who invites me i will detain her to give you ample leisure for such note as counterfeits abide not bireno retires  scene vii paladore alone death it is she there is not a silken braid that binds her hair one little shred of all that known attire that wantons in the wind but to my heart has sent such sweet disturbance that it beat instinctive of her coming ere my sight enjoyed the beauteous wonder  soft what now see she lets down the cordage of her shame to hoist him to her arms i will look no more  distraction devil how she welcomes him that is well that is well  again grow to her lips  poison and aspics rot them now she woos him points to her chamber and invites him inward may adders hiss around their guilty couch and ghosts of injured lovers rise to scare them  ay get you gone  oh for a griffins wing to bear me through the casement deeds like this should startle every spirit of the grove and wake enchantment from her spellhung grot to shake the conscious roof about their heads and bare them to the scoff of modest eyes twined in the wanton fold oh wretch accursed see there the blasted promise of thy joys thy best hopes bankrupt  do i linger still here find a grave and let thy mangled corse when her lascivious eye peers over the lawn satiate the harlots gaze  going to fall on his sword rinaldo rushes out and prevents him rinaldo what frenzys this armed against your life in pity turn the point on your old faithful servant whose heart heaves almost to bursting to behold you thus  paladore have seen it then  rinaldo i have seen your wild despair and blessed be the kind monitor within that led me here to save you  paladore rather cursed be thy officious fondness since it dooms me to lingering misery give me back my sword  is it come to this oh i could tear my hair rip us this credulous breast blind dotard fool did wit or malice ere devise a legend to parellel this vile reality  rinaldo disgrace not the best gift of manly nature your reason in this wild extravagance  paladore and think thou i am mad without a cause i will tell thee  sdeath it choaks me  lead me hence  i will walk boldly on the billowy deep or blindfold tread the sharp and perilous ridge of icy caucasus nor fear my footing play with a fasting lions fangs unharmd and stroke his rage to tameness  but hereafter when men would try impossibilities let them seek faith in woman  furies seize them  exeunt end of the second act act iii

in the middle of the stage a scaffold guard and executioner at the bottom many spectators officers and senators preceding the princess supported by women bireno with ascanio who bears his shield and sword heralds with trumpets on the sides officer make room fall back let the procession pass  bireno it is known why i stand here yet once again and for the last time herald sound my challenge proceed none answer bireno s trumpet sounds  princess i would have it so you generous people who behold with horror these gloomy preparations do not deem me cold and unthankful for my offered safety though i preferred this dire alternative before the tongue of slander struck my fame the rude hand of affliction never touched me life had a thousand bonds to tie me to it young spirits royal birth fortune and greatness but honor was the prop round which like stalks tender and weak these accessaries twined when calumnys sharp edge cut down that trunk then these poor tendrils lost their hue and withered with that great ruin fell my happiness i now stand on eternitys dark verge nor dare i to the god and judge of truth bring lips with falsehood fullied of the offense cast on me by vile malice i am free even to abhorrence this to heaven is known my own heart and my accuser therefore boldly and for your sakes will i arraign the law which thus has passed upon me  first senator gracious lady if in this censure we too stand accused think we pronounced but did not make the law and let my bleeding heart bear witness for me i would lay down the dearest thing i own to save you from the forfeit  princess good my lord all forms of justice have been well observed my blame lights on the law not on your office which you with truth and mercy minister but let these mute spectators mark my counsel fall at the kings feet clasp the senates knees and pray them they wipe out clear from their rolls this more than cruel edict else be sure from every roof there hangs a dangerous sword hangs by a thread which each dark hand may drop to pierce and sever natures dearest ties she who profanes her honors sanctity upbraided by her heart by her own sex shunned or neglected nay held cheap and vile even to the loathing of the lovers sense who wrought her easy nature to transgress these are sharp penalties but added death turns the clear stream of justice into blood and makes such law more cursed than anarchy forget not my example let me perish but if you pluck your safety from my ruin i shall not die in vain farewell  lead on   princess goes toward the scaffold a trumpet sounds first senator hold on your lives  bireno what means that trumpets voice it sounds a shrill alarm  scene x to them a squire squire arrest your sentence i come in the name of one who hears with horror this barbarous process to proclaim the accuser of that most innocent and royal lady a slanderer and villain who accepts her just defense and by the law of arms throws down this gage and claims the combat for her  bireno take it ascanio bid your knight appear if such his order for to none beneath am i thus bound to answer speak his titles  squire he wills not i reveal him but suffice it he has a name in arms that will not shame the noble cause he fights for  bireno bid him enter my shield and sword say i am decked to meet him exit squire some rash adventurer prodigal of life bribed by her fathers gold to grace her fall and add an easy trophy to my banners  confusion paladore  scene xi to them paladore princess it is he it is he  then life thou art welcome   a loud murmur among the people bireno marshal do your office furies and hell  keep order in the lists  silence that uproar   paladore yes behold me villain i have thee in the toils thou can not escape me  but oh most wronged and heavenly excellence to the princess how shall i plead for pardon  can the abuse of his deep craft and devilish artifice fooling my natures plainness blanch my cheek from the deep shame that my too easy faith combined with hell against thee  princess rise my soldier though yet i know not by what subtle practice thy nobleness was wrought on nor the means that since revealed his fraud praise be to heaven thy presence plucks my honor from the grave thou livst thou know my truth thou will avenge me  paladore avenge thee  yes  did his right hand grasp thunder did yelling furies combat on his side pald in with circling fires i would assail him nor cast a look to fortune for the event  bireno presumptuous briton think not that bold mien a wantons favor or thy threats have power to shrink the finews of a soldiers arm  paladore a soldiers arm thou double murderer assassin in thy intention and in act but ere my falchion cleave thy treacherous breast i will divulge thee  bring that russian forth  one of alinda s murderers is brought out two hell hounds such as this he set upon me one fell beneath my sword that wretch i spared kneeling for mercy let your justice doom him look you amazed peruse that paper lords his compact for the blood of a fair minion he taught to sin and made her wages death  ha does it shake thee see alindas form thy panting image mangled in her side stalks from her sanguine bed and ghastly smiles to aid the prowess of this dauntless soldier  bireno aside destruction all is revealed   ascanio to bireno what turned to stone droop not for shame  be quick retort the charge  bireno all false as hell and thou  defend thyself nor blast me thus with thy detested presence  this to thy heart fight bireno falls  paladore oh impotence of guilt an infants lath had felled him villain die and know thy shame and the deep wound that wriths thee are but a feeble earnest of the pangs reserved beneath for giant crimes like thine  princess haste to the king proclaim this blessed event  bireno perfidious chance caught in my own device  accursed  ha they drag me tear me  oh  dies  princess i have a thousand things to ask to hear but oh the joy to see thee thus again to owe my life my honor to thy love  these tears these rapturous tears let them speak for me  paladore i could endure the malice of my fate but this full tide of such excessive bliss sure it is illusion all it quite transports me when i have borne thee from this scene of horror perhaps i may grow calm and talk with reason  scene xii and last to them king lucio etc king where is she let me strain her to my heart  they cannot part us now my joy my comfort  thou generous youth how can my overflowing soul find words to thank thee  words poor recompense here i invest thee with the forfeit lands the wealth and honors of that prostrate traitor this too is little  then receive her hand due to thy love thy courage and thy virtue and joys unutterable crown your union  end of the fifth act prologue to the law of lombardy written by the author spoken by mr farren hard is the task in modern days to choose congenial subjects for the tragic muse the historians page the fertile epic store were known and ransacked centuries before like luscious gardens unenclosd they lay to every sauntring bard an easy prey they entered and as taste impelled they fed on homer some and some on hollingshead from loftiest numbers or from humblest prose as each conspired the artless structures rose thus one great labor of their work was over they found a fable and they fought no more careless were they of action place or time whose only toil was dialogue and rhyme rules which the rigid stagyrite devised our fathers knew not or if known despised whilst side by side were mingled in the scene a laughing rustic and a weeping queen space was obedient to the boundless piece that opened in mexico and closed in greece then thick with plots the crowded tale was sown till the divided bosom felt for none they feared no censures of a frowning pit that judged as loosely as the authors writ but we who posted in times tardy rear before a learned tribunal now appear with anxious art a fable must design where probability and interest join where time and place and action all agree to violate no sacred unity and thus each candid critic must confess the labor greater and indulgence less when such the task the wonder is to meet not many pieces bad but one complete nor let presumptious poets fondly claim from rules exemption by great shakespeares name though comets move with wild excentric force yet humbler planets keep their stated course but now a bard who touched your hearts before again salutes you from a neighboring shore fired by the applause you gave his early lays he stands again a candidate for praise nor from your former favor dares foresee to worthless strains a partial destiny but if his virgin palm was fairly won and this next course with equal vigours run now join to bind his fresher laurels on he fears no jaundicd rivals envious reath the hands which twined shall still preserve the wreath  epilogue to the law of lombardy written by the author spoken by miss young of all the gothic laws i ever heard this lombard law was sure the most absurd what could the monsters mean to make us die but for a little harmless gallantry were such a barbarous custom now in fashion good lord it would unpeople half the nation scaffolds on scaffolds now the streets would fill as signposts did before the pavingbill were british lawmakers such rigorous churls they would hardly leave a head to wear false curls besides what champion now would risque his life to gain what most men shudder at  a wife instead of armed knights at trumpets summons commend me to our proctors and the commons there though we lose our husbands and our fame we get our portion and a maiden name and if her fortune and her charms remain then miss may wed  and be divorced again yet though these frolics have of late been common lay not the blame entirely on weak woman the careless mate his rival recommends we find him midst his own obliging friends some swain who swears he lives but in our eyes and plies us with such cunning flatteries that spouse neglecting us and lover wooing one strives and the other leads us to our ruin so if weak ladies chance to go astray their lords methinks are more in fault than they the goal of marriage reached the men lie down like weary racers when the prize is won mere catching us alone their care engages the nets they spread but never mind the cages the married gamester more delight can find in sevens the main than all dear womankind acteon wedded to our voice prefers the sweeter music of his yelping ours while the dull sot who his six bottles boasts thinks women good for nothing  but for toasts thus slighted for the glass the hound the die our pride steps in and to revenge we fly one obvious method only can preserve us strive by your own attentions to deserve us and now as formerly be sure you will prove contempt will meet contempt as love meets love  books printed for t evans in the strand   braganza a tragedy by robert jephson
