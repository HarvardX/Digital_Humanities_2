quanto lacqua comporta un picciol legno e cio ch io penso colla fantasia di piacere ad ognuno e il mio disegno ben so che spesso come gia morgante lasciato ho forse troppo andar la mazza ma dove sia poi judice bastante materia c e da camera e da piazza pulci london printed for j bell no     oxfordstreet mdccxcviii  prologue spoken by mr wroughton far from the haunts of men of vice the foe the moonstruck child of genius and of woe versed in each magic spell and dear to fame a fair enchantress dwells romance her name she loathes the sun or blazing tapers light the moonbeamd landscape and tempestuous night alone she loves and often with glimmering lamp near graves newopend or midst dungeons damp drear forests ruined aisles and haunted towers forlorn she roves and raves away the hours anon when storms howl loud and lash the deep desperate she climbs the searocks beetling steep there wildly strikes her harps fantastic strings tells to the moon how grief her bosom wrings and while her strange song chaunts fictitious ills in wounded hearts oblivions balm distills a youth who yet has lived enough to know that life has thorns and taste the cup of woe as late near conways timebowed towers he strayed invoked this bright enthusiasts magic aid his prayer was heard with arms and bosom bare eyes flashing fire loose robes and streaming hair her heart all anguish and her soul all flame swift as her thoughts the lovely maniac came high heaved her breasts which struggling passions rent as pressed to give some fearfraught mystery vent and often with anxious glance and altered face trembling with terror she relaxed her pace and stopped and listened  then with hurried tread onwards again she rushed yet backwards bent her head as if from murderous swords or following fiends she fled soon as near conways walls her footsteps drew she bade the youth their ancient state renew eager he sped the fallen towers to rear twas done and fancy bore the fabric here next choosing from great shakspeares comic school the gossip crone gross friar and gibing fool  these with a virgin fair and lover brave to our young authors care the enchantress gave but charged him ere he blessed the brave and fair to lay the exulting villains bosom bare and by the torments of his conscience show that prosperous vice is but triumphant woe the pleasing task congenial to his soul often from his own sad thoughts our author stole blessed be his labors if with like success they soothe their sorrows whom i now address beneath this dome should some afflicted breast mourn slighted talents or desert oppressed false friendship hopeless love or faith betrayed our author will esteem each toil oerpaid if while his muse exerts her livelier vein or tells imagined woes in plaintive strain her flights and fancies make one smile appear on the pale cheek where trickled late a tear or if her fabled sorrows steal one groan which else her hearers would have given their own  epilogue spoken by mrs jordan osmond by this arrived at charons ferry my honor saved and dad alive and merry hither i come the public doom to know but come not uncompelld  the mores my woe even now oh pity friends my hard mishap my shoulder felt a bowstreet runners tap who while i shook with fear in every limb thus spoke with accent stern and visage grim  mistress quoth he to me it given in trust is to bring you straight before our larned justice for know it is said tonight the whole town over you have killed one osmond alias barrymore the fellows mad twas thus amazed i spoke lord sir i murdered osmond for a joke this dagger free from blood will make it certain he died but till the prompter dropped the curtain and now well pleased to quit this scene of riot the mans gone home to sup in peace and quiet finding that all i said was said in vain and townshend still his first design maintain i thought twere best to fly for shelter here and beg my generous friends to interfere but though the awkward nature of my case may spread some slight confusion over my face no terrors awe my bosom i will assure ye just is my cause and english is my jury besides it must appear on explanation how very ticklish was my situation and all perforce his crimes when i relate must own that osmond well deserved his fate he heeded not papas pathetic pleading he stabbed mama  which was extreme illbreeding and at his feet for mercy when i sued the odious wretch i vow was downright rude twice his bold hands my person dared to touch twice in one day  twas really once too much and therefore justly filled with virtuous ire to save my honor and protect my fire i drew my knife and in his bosom stuck it he fell you clapped  and then he kicked the bucket so perish still the wretch whose soul can know selfish delight while causing others woe who blasts that joy the sweetest god has given and makes an hell where love would make an heaven forbear thou lawless libertine nor seek forced favors on that pale averted cheek if thy warm kisses cost bright eyes one tear kisses from loveliest lips are bought too dear  unless those lips with thine keep playful measure and that sweet tear should be a tear of pleasure now as for osmond  at that villains name i feel reviving wrath my soul inflame and shall one short and sudden pang suffice to clear so base a fault so gross a vice no to your bar dear friends for aid i fly bid osmond live again again to die nightly with plaudits loud his breath recall nightly beneath my dagger see him fall give him a thousand lives  and let me take them all  dramatis personae osmond mr barrymore reginald mr wroughton percy mr kemble father philip mr palmer motley mr bannister jun kenric mr aickin saib mr truman hassan mr dowton muley mr davis alaric mr wentworth allan mr packer edric mr wathen harold mr gibbon angela mrs jordan alice mrs walcot evelina mrs powell the music composed by mr kelly  the castle spectre act i scene i  a grove enter father philip and motley father philip never tell me  i repeat it you are a fellow of a very scandalous course of life   motl and i repeat it i am a perfect image of the purest virtue compared to whom for sobriety and continence cato was a drunkard and lucretia little better than she should be   f phil oh hardened in impudence  can you deny being a pilferer a liar a glutton    motl can i  heaven be thanked i have courage enough to deny any thing   f phil does not all the world cry out upon you   motl certainly my transcendant merit has procured me some enemies and in common with many other great men my virtue at present labors under something of a cloud but understand me right father though i dont assent to the sumtotal of your accusations possibly i may acknowledge some of the items the best actions frequently appear culpable merely because their motives are unexplained therefore produce your charges let me justify my conduct and i doubt not i shall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure as a new sheet of foolscap   f phil to begin then with your pilfering  did you or did you not break open the pantrydoor and steal out the great goosepye   motl begging your pardon father that was no fault of mine   f phil whose then   motl the cooks undoubtedly for if he had not locked the pantrydoor it is an hundred to one i shouldnt have taken the trouble to break it open   f phil nonsense nonsense  i tell you you have been guilty of stealing which is a monstrous crime and what did you steal had you taken any thing else i might have forgiven you but to lay irreverent hands upon the goosepye  as i am a christian the identical goosepye which i intended for my own supper  but this is not my only objection to your conduct   motl no   f phil what principally offends me is that you pervert the minds of the maids and keep kissing and smuggling all the pretty girls you meet oh fie fie   motl i kiss and smuggle them st francis forbid lord love you father it is they who kiss and smuggle me i protest i do what i can to preserve my modesty and i wish that archbishop dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which i read last night to the dairymaid in the dark he would have been quite edified but yet what does talking signify the eloquence of my lips is counteracted by the luster of my eyes and really the little devils are so tender and so troublesome that i am half angry with nature for having made me so very bewitching   f phil nonsense nonsense   motl why it was but yesterday that cicely and luce went to fiftycuffs quarrelling which looked neatest  my red leg or my yellow one then they are so fond and so coaxing they hang about one so lovingly and one says kind mr motley and to other sweet mr motley  ah father philip father philip how is a poor little bit of flesh and blood like me to resist such temptation  put yourself in my place suppose that a sweet smiling rogue just sixteen with rosy cheeks sparkling eyes pouting lips etc   f phil oh fie fie fie  to hear such licentious discourse brings the tears into my eyes   motl i believe you father for i see the water is running over at your mouth however this shows you    f phil it shows me that you are a reprobate and that my advice is thrown away upon you in future i shall keep those counsels to myself which i offered you from motives of pure christian charity   motl charity my good father should always begin at home now instead of giving yourself so much trouble to mend me what if you thought a little of correcting yourself   f phil i  i have nothing to correct   motl no to be sure   f phil the odor of my sanctity perfumes the whole kingdom   motl it has a powerful smell about it i own not unlike carrion you may wind it a mile off   f phil all malice   motl not exactly i could mention some little points which might be altered in you still better than in myself such as intemperance gluttony    f phil gluttony  oh abominable falsehood   motl plain matter of fact  why will any man pretend to say that you came honestly by that enormous belly that tremendous tomb of fish flesh and fowl i protest i am grateful to heaven that among the unclean beasts who accompanied noah there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks they must infallibly have created a famine and then the world would never have been repeopled  next for incontinence you must allow yourself that you are unequalled   f phil i i   motl you you  may i ask what was your business in the beechgrove the other evening when i caught you with buxom margery the millers pretty wife was it quite necessary to lay your heads together so close   f phil perfectly necessary i was whispering in her ear wholesome advice   motl indeed faith then she took your advice as kindly as it was given and exactly in the same way too you gave it with your lips and she took it with hers  well done father philip   f phil son son you give your tongue too great a license   motl nay father be not angry fools you know are privileged persons   f phil i know they are very useless ones and in short master motley to be plain with you of all fools i think you the worst and for fools of all kinds i have an insuperable aversion   motl really then you have one good quality at least and i cannot but admire such a total want of selflove an horn sounds but hark it is the dinnerhorn away to table father  depend upon it the servants will rather eat part of their dinner unblessed than stay till your stomach comes like jonass whale and swallows up the whole   f phil well well fool i am going but first let me explain to you that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite no son no little sustenance do i take but st cuthberts blessing is upon me and that little prospers with me most marvellously verily the saint has given me rather too plentiful an increase and my legs are scarce able to support the weight of his bounties exit   motl alone he looks like an over grown turtle waddling upon its hind fins  yet at bottom it is a good fellow enough warmhearted benevolent friendly and sincere but no more intended by nature to be a monk than i to be a maid of honor to the queen of sheba going   enter percy percy i cannot be mistaken in spite of his dress his features are too well known to me hist gilbert gilbert   motl gilbert oh lord that is i  who calls   percy have you forgotten me   motl truly sir that would be no easy matter i never forgot in my life what i never knew   percy have ten years altered me so much that you cannot    motl hey  can it be  pardon my dear master pardon  in truth you may well forgive my having forgotten your name for at first i didnt very well remember my own however to prevent further mistakes i must inform you that he who in your fathers service was gilbert the knave is motley the fool in the service of earl osmond   percy of earl osmond this is fortunate gilbert you may be of use to me and if the attachment which as a boy you professed for me still exists    motl it does with ardour unabated for i am not so unjust as to attribute to you my expulsion from alnwic castle in fact i deserved it for i cannot deny but that at twenty i was as goodfornothing a knave as ever existed consequently old earl percy dismissed me from his service but i know that it was sorely against your inclination you were then scarce fourteen and i had been your companion and playfellow from your childhood i remember well your grief at parting with me and that you slipped into my hand the purse which contained the whole of your little treasure that act of kindness struck to my heart i swore at the moment to love you through life and it ever i forget my oath damn me   percy my honest gilbert  and what made you assume this habit   motl ah my lord what could i do  in spite of my knavery and tricks i was constantly upon the point of starving and having once contracted an idle habit of eating i never could bring myself to leave it off after living five years by my wits want drove me almost out of them i knew not what course to take when i heard that earl osmonds jester had fled the country i exerted my knavery for the last time in stealing the fugitives cast coat was accepted in his place by the earl and now gain an honest livelihood by persuading my neighbors that i am a greater fool than themselves   percy and your change is for the better   motl infinitely indeed your fool is universally preferred to your knave  and for this reason your fool is cheated your knave cheats now everybody had rather cheat than be cheated   percy some truth in that   motl and now sir may i ask what brings you to wales   percy a woman whom i adore   motl yes i guessed that the business was about a petticoat and this woman is    percy the orphan ward of a villager without friends without family without fortune   motl great points in her favor i must confess and which of these excellent qualities won your heart   percy i hope i had better reasons for bestowing it on her no gilbert i loved her for a person beautiful without art and graceful without affectation  for an heart tender without weakness and noble without pride i saw her at once beloved and reverenced by her village companions they looked on her as a being of a superior order and i felt that she who gave such dignity to the cottagemaid must needs add new luster to the coronet of the percies   motl from which i am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic   percy could i mean otherwise i should blush for myself   motl yet surely the baseness of her origin    percy can to me be no objection in giving her my hand i raise her to my station not debase myself to hers nor ever while gazing on the beauty of a rose did i think it less fair because planted by a peasant   motl bravo  and what says your good grumbling father to this   percy alas he has long slept in the grave   motl then he is quiet at last well god grant him that peace in heaven which he suffered nobody to enjoy on earth  but his death having left you master of your actions what obstacle now prevents your marriage   percy you shall hear  fearful lest my rank should influence this lovely girls affections and induce her to bestow her hand on the noble while she refused her heart to the man i assumed a peasants habit and presented myself as edwy the lowborn and the poor in this character i gained her heart and resolved to hail as countess of northumberland the betrothed of edwy the lowborn and the poor   motl i warrant the pretty soul was not displeased with the discovery   percy that discovery is still unmade judge how great must have been my disappointment when on entering her guardians cottage with this design he informed me that the unknown who sixteen years before had confided her to his care had reclaimed her on that very morning and conveyed her no one knew whither   motl that was unlucky   percy was it not  ah had i declared myself one day sooner ere this she would have been my wife   motl true and being your wife if a stranger then had conveyed her no one knew whither you might have thought yourself mightily obliged to him   percy however in spite of his precautions i have traced the strangers course and find him to be kenric a dependent upon earl osmond   motl surely it is not lady angela who    percy the very same speak my good fellow do you know her   motl not by your description for here she is understood to be the daughter of sir malcolm mowbray my masters deceased friend and what is your present intention   percy to demand her of the earl in marriage   motl oh  that will never do  for in the first place you will not be able to get a sight of him i have now lived with him five long years and till angelas arrival never witnessed a guest in the castle  oh it is the most melancholy mansion and as to its master he is the very antidote to mirth he always walks with his arms folded his brows bent his eyes louring on you with a gloomy scowl he never smiles and to laugh in his presence would be high treason he looks at no one  speaks to no one none dare approach him except kenric and his four blacks  all others are ordered to avoid him and whenever he quits his room ding dong goes a great bell and away run the servants like so many scared rabbits   percy strange  and what reasons can be have for    motl oh reasons in plenty you must know there is an ugly story respecting the last owners of this castle  osmonds brother his wife and infant child were murdered by banditti as it was said unluckily the only servant who escaped the slaughter deposed that he recognized among the assassins a black still in the service of earl osmond the truth of this assertion was never known for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning   percy good heavens   motl since that time no sound of joy has been heard in conway castle osmond instantly became gloomy and ferocious he now never utters a sound except a sigh has broken every tie of society and keeps his gates barred unceasingly against the stranger   percy yet angela is admitted  but no doubt affection for her father    motl why no i rather think that affection for her fathers child    percy how   motl if i have any knowledge in love the earl feels it for his fair ward but the lady will tell you more of this if i can procure for you an interview   percy the very request which    motl it is no easy matter i promise you but i will do my best in the meanwhile wait for me in yonder fishing hut  its owners name is edric  tell him that i sent you and he will give you a retreat   percy farewell then and remember that whatever reward    motl dear master to mention a reward insults me you have already shown me kindness and when it is in my power to be of use to you to need the inducement of a second favor would prove me a scoundrel undeserving of the first exit   percy how warm is this good fellows attachment yet our barons complain that the great can have no friends if they have none let their own pride bear the blame instead of looking with scorn on those whom a smile would attract and a favor bind for ever how many firm friends might our nobles gain if they would but reflect that their vassals are men as they are and have hearts whose feelings can be grateful as their own exit   scene ii the castlehall saib and hassan meeting saib now hassan what success   hass my search has been fruitless in vain have i paced the rivers banks and pierced the groves deepest recesses nor glen nor thicket have i passed unexplored yet found no stranger to whom kenrics description could apply   saib saw you no one   hass a troop of horsemen passed me as i left the wood   saib horsemen say you  then kenric may be right earl percy has discovered angelas abode and lurks near the castle in hopes of carrying her off   hass his hopes then will be vain osmonds vigilance will not easily be eluded  sharpened by those powerful motives love and fear   saib his love i know but should he lose angela what has he to fear   hass if percy gains her every thing supported by such wealth and power dangerous would be her claim to these domains should her birth be discovered of this our lord is aware nor did he sooner hear that northumberland loved her than he hastened to remove her from allans care at first i doubt his purpose was a foul one her resemblance to her mother induced him to change it he now is resolved to make her his bride and restore to her those rights of which himself deprived her   saib think you the lady perceives that our master loves her   hass i know she does not absorbed in her own passion for percy on osmonds she bestows no thought and while roving through these pompous halls and chambers sighs for the cheviot hills and allans humble cottage   saib but as she still believes percy to be a lowborn swain when osmond lays his coronet at her feet will she reject his rank and splendor   hass if she loves well she will saib i too have loved i have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung how incapable was all else to supply her loss i have exchanged want for plenty fatigue for rest a wretched hut for a splendid palace but am i happier oh no still do i regret my native land and the partners of my poverty then toil was sweet to me for i labored for samba then repose ever blessed my bed of leaves for there by my side lay samba sleeping   saib this from you hassan  did love ever find a place in your flinty bosom   hass did it oh saib my heart once was gentle once was good but sorrows have broken it insults have made it hard i have been dragged from my native land from a wife who was every thing to me to whom i was every thing twenty years have elapsed since these christians tore me away they trampled upon my heart mocked my despair and when in frantic terms i raved of samba laughed and wondered how a negros soul could feel in that moment when the last point of africa faded from my view when as i stood on the vessels deck i felt that all i loved was to me lost for ever in that bitter moment did i banish humanity from my breast i tore from my arm the bracelet of sambas hair i gave to the sea the precious token and while the high waves swift bore it from me vowed aloud endless hatred to mankind i have kept my oath i will keep it   saib illstarred hassan your wrongs have indeed been great   hass to remember them unmans me  farewell i must to kenric hold  look where he comes from osmonds chamber   saib and seemingly in wrath   hass his conferences with the earl of late have had no other end the period of his favor is arrived   saib not of his favor merely hassan   hass how mean you that   saib his anxiety for independence his wish to withdraw himself from wales  yet more certain mysterious words and threats for some time past have made our lord uneasy by him was i this morning commissioned silence he is here you shall know more anon   enter kenric kenr his promise ever evaded my request still heard with impatience and treated with neglect  osmond i will bear your ingratitude no longer  now hassan found you the man described   hass nor any that resembled him   kenr yet that i saw percy i am convinced as i crossed him in the wood his eye met mine he started as had he seen a basilisk and fled with rapidity be on your guard my friends doubtless he will attempt to gain admission to the castle   hass can we be otherwise than watchful when we see how well the earl rewards his followers   saib of that kenric you are an example have you obtained that recompense so long promised do you enjoy that independence which   kenr saib the earls ingratitude cuts me to the heart attached to him from his infancy i have long been his friend long fancied him mine the illusion is now over he sees that i can serve him no further  knows that i can harm him much therefore he fears and fearing hates me but i will submit no longer to this painful dependence tomorrow for the last time will i summon him to perform his promise if he refuses i will bid him farewell for ever and by my absence free him from a restraint equally irksome to myself and him   saib will you so kenric  be speedy then or you will be too late   kenr too late and wherefore   saib you will soon receive the reward of your services   kenr ha know you what that reward will be   saib i guess but may not tell   kenr is it a secret   saib can you keep one   kenr faithfully   saib as faithfully can i come hassan   exeunt kenr alone what meant the slave those doubtful expressions ha should the earl intend me false kenric kenric how is thy nature changed there was a time when fear was a stranger to my bosom  when guiltless myself i dreaded not art in others now wherever i turn me danger appears to lurk and i suspect treachery in every breast because my own heart hides it exit   enter father philip followed by alice f phil nonsense  you silly woman what you say is not possible   alice i never said it was possible i only said it was true and that if ever i heard music i heard it last night   f phil perhaps the fool was singing to the servants   alice the fool indeed oh fie fie how dare you call my ladys ghost a fool   f phil your ladys ghost  you silly old woman   alice yes father yes i repeat it i heard the guitar lying upon the oratory table play the very air which the lady evelina used to sing while rocking her little daughters cradle she warbled it so sweetly and ever at the close it went singing lullaby lullaby hush thee my dear thy father is coming and soon will be here    f phil nonsense nonsense  why prythee alice do you think that your ladys ghost would get up at night only to sing lullaby for your amusement  besides how should a spirit which is nothing but air play upon an instrument of material wood and catgut   alice how can i tell  why i know very well that men are made but if you desired me to make a man i vow and protest i shouldnt know how to set about it i can only say that last night i heard the ghost of my murdered lady   f phil  playing upon the spirit of a cracked guitar  alice alice these fears are ridiculous the idea of ghosts is a vulgar prejudice and they who are timid and absurd enough to encourage it prove themselves the most contemptible    alice screaming oh lord bless us   f phil what  hey  oh dear   alice look look  a figure in white  it comes from the haunted room   f phil dropping on his knees blessed st patrick  who has got my beads where is my prayer book   alice it comes  it comes  now now  lackaday it is only lady angela   f phil rising lackaday i am glad of it with all my heart   alice truly so am i  but what say you now father to the fear of specter   f phil in good faith alice that my theory was better than my practice however the next time that you are afraid of a ghost remember and make use of the receipt which i shall now give you and instead of calling for a priest to lay the spirits of other people in the red sea call for a bottle of red wine to raise your own probatum est   exit alice alone wine indeed  i believe he thinks i like drinking as well as himself no no let the old toping friar take his bottle of wine i shall confine myself to plain cherrybrandy   enter angela ang i am weary of wandering from room to room in vain do i change the scene discontent is every where there was a time when music could delight my ear and nature could charm my eye  when as the dawn unveiled the landscape each object it disclosed to me looked pleasant and fair and while the last sunbeams yet lingered on the western sky i could pour forth a prayer of gratitude and thank my good angels for a day unclouded by sorrow  now all is gone all lost all faded   alice lady   ang perhaps at this moment he thinks upon me perhaps he wanders on those mountains where we so often have strayed reclines on that bank where we so often have sat or listens sadly to the starling which he taught to repeat my name perhaps then he sighs and murmurs to himself the flowers the rivulets the birds every object reminds me of my wellbeloved but what shall remind her of edwy  oh that will my heart edwy i need no other remembrancer   alice lady lady angela  she minds me no more than a post   ang oh are you there good alice what would you with me   alice only ask how your ladyship rested   ang ill very ill   alice lackaday and yet you sleep in the best bed   ang true good alice but my hearts anguish strewed thorns upon my couch of down   alice marry i am not surprised that you rested ill in the cedarroom those noises so near you    ang what noises i heard none   alice how  when the clock struck one heard you no music   ang music  none   alice and never have heard any while in the cedarroom   ang not that i  stay now i remember that while i sat alone in my chamber this morning    alice well lady well   ang methought i heard some one singing it seemed as if the words ran thus  singing  lullaby lullaby hush thee my dear   alice screaming the very words  it was the ghost lady it was the ghost   ang the ghost alice  i protest i thought it had been you   alice me lady  lord when did you hear this singing   ang not five minutes ago while you were talking with father philip   alice the lord be thanked  then it was not the ghost it was i lady it was i  and have you heard no other singing since you came to the castle   ang none but why that question   alice because lady  but perhaps you may be frightened   ang no no  proceed i entreat you   alice why then they to say that the chamber in which you sleep is haunted you may have observed two foldingdoors which are ever kept locked they lead to the oratory in which the lady evelina passed most of her time while my lord was engaged in the scottish wars she would fit there good soul hour after hour playing on the lute and singing airs so sweet so sad that many a time and often have i wept to hear her ah when i kissed her hand at the castlegate little did i suspect that her fate would have been so wretched   ang and what was her fate   alice a sad one lady impatient to embrace her lord after a years absence the countess set out to meet him on his return from scotland accompanied by a few domestics and her infantdaughter then scarce a twelvemonth old but as she returned with her husband robbers surprised the party scarce a mile from the castle and since that time no news has been received of the earl of the countess the servants or the child   ang dreadful were not their corses found   alice never the only domestic who escaped pointed out the scene of action and as it proved to be on the rivers banks doubtless the assassins plunged the bodies into the stream   ang strange and did earl osmond then become owner of this castle  alice was he ever suspected of    alice speak lower lady it was said so i own but for my own part i never believed it to my certain knowledge osmond loved the lady evelina too well to hurt her and when he heard of her death he wept and sobbed as if his heart were breaking nay it is certain that he proposed to her before marriage and would have made her his wife only that she liked his brother better well she might indeed for earl reginald was a sweeter gentleman by half   ang and in that oratory you say  good alice you have the key of it let me see that oratory tonight   alice tonight lady heaven preserve me i wouldnt enter it after dark for the world   ang but before dark alice   alice before dark why that indeed  well well well see lady but i hope youre not alarmed by what i mentioned of the cedarroom   ang no truly alice from good spirits i have nothing to fear and heaven and my innocence will protect me against bad   alice my very sentiments i protest but heaven forgive me while i stand gossiping here i warrant all goes wrong in the kitchen your pardon lady i must away i must away exit   ang musing osmond was his brothers heir his strange demeanor  yes in that gloomy brow is written a volume of villainy  heavenly powers an assassin then is matter of my fate  an assassin too who  i dare not bend my thoughts that way  oh would i had never entered these castlewalls  had never exchanged for fearful pomp the security of my pleasures  the tranquillity of my soul return return sweet peace and over my breast spread thy bright wings distill thy balmy rest and teach my steps thy realms among to rove wealth and the world resigned naught mine but love ah cease thy suit fond girl thy prayer is vain for thus did love his tyrant law ordain  peace still must fly that heart where i still reign    exit end of the first act act ii scene i  the armoury  suits of armor are arranged on both sides upon pedestals with the names of their possessors written under each enter motley peeping in the coast is clear  hist hist  you may enter  enter percy percy loiter not here  quick my good fellow  conduct me to angela   motl softly softly a little caution is needful and i promise you just now i am not upon roses  you remember the servant who hinted that earl osmond had an hand in his brothers murder  should i be suspected of admitting you to the castle his fate might be mine and whatever you may think of it my lord i shouldnt be at all pleased at waking tomorrow morning to find myself dead in my bed   percy if such are your fears why not lead me at once to angela are we not more exposed in this open hall   motl be contented and leave all to me i will contrive matters so that osmond shall have you before his eyes and be no jot the wiser  here  taking down a suit of armor  put on this coat of mail you must make up your mind to play a statue for an hour or two   percy how   motl nay it is absolutely necessary  quick quick ere the servants quit the hall where they are now at dinner  here is the helmet  the gauntlet  the shield  so now take this truncheon in your hand and there we have you armed capapee   percy and now be good enough to explain what purpose this masquerade is to answer   motl willingly you are to know that since the late earls death the castle is thought to be haunted the servants are fully persuaded that his ghost wanders every night through the long galleries and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy mansion he is supposed to be dressed in complete armor and that which you wear at present was formerly his now hear my plan the earl prepares to hold a conference with lady angela even now i heard her summoned to attend him in the armoury placed upon this pedestal you may listen to their discourse

word of it had i minded all the strange things related of this castle i should have died of fright in the first halfhour why they say that earl hubert rides every night round the castle on a white horse that the ghost of lady bertha haunts the west pinnacle of the chapeltower and that lord hildebrand who was condemned for treason some sixty years ago may be seen in the great hall regularly at midnight playing at football with his own head above all they say that the spirit of the late countess sits nightly in her oratory and sings her baby to sleep however if it be so  a bell sounds thrice

really believed the invention to be entirely my own but the situations of angela osmond and percy so closely resemble those of isabella manfred and the animated portrait in the castle of otranto that

angela flying away as if for dear life  so i dropped her a curtsey  but might as well have spared my pains without minding me any more than if i had been a dog or a cat  she pushed me on one side and before i could recover my balance somebody else who came bouncing by me gave me the other thump  and there i lay sprawling upon the floor however i tumbled with all possible decency and took great

looked like i cannot say  but i am sure he didnt feel like one however you have not heard the worst while i was sprawling upon the ground my lord comes tearing along the passage  the first thing he did was to stumble against me  away went his heels  over he came  and in the twinkling of an eye there lay his lordship as soon as he got up again  mercy how he stormed  he snatched me up  called me an ugly old witch  shook the breath out of my body  then clapped me on the ground again and bounced away after the other two   motl my mind misgives me  but what can this mean alice   alice the meaning i neither know or care about  but this i know  i will stay no longer in an house where i am treated so disrespectfully my lady  says i  out of my way  says she and pushes me on one side my

wretch having had good opportunities of knowing how wonderful are the talents for misinterpretation possessed by certain persons i think it necessary to observe to my readers that the foregoing speech is not meant to contain a moral sentiment but to display the false reasoning of a guilty conscience  if i were not to make this explanation i should expect to see it asserted that the whole play was

with alice in the first act  i never said it was possible i only say it is true  this incident was furnished me by the german history in which it appears that a certain landgrave of thuringia being condemned to death made his escape by taking so desperate a leap from the window of his prison that he was afterward known throughout germany by the name of ludwig the springer  there is a german play on this subject whence i borrowed the idea of making the gaolers play at dice and motleys song bears some resemblance to an incident in richard coeurdelion     muley and saib  starting at the noise

percy listen  i have recognized you in spite of your disguise and seize the opportunity to advise your exerting yourself solely to obtain earl percys liberty heed not angela i have sure and easy means

there is no profession more universal than yours we all spread our nets to catch something or other  and alas when obtained it seldom proves worth the trouble of taking the coquette fishes for hearts which are worthless the courtier for titles which are absurd on the strength of this single sentence it was boldly asserted on the morning after the first performance that the whole play was written to support the cause of equality and that i said in it all distinctions of rank ought to be abolished and thought it extremely wrong for any persons to accept titles to make the thing complete the assertors should have added that i thought it extremely wrong for any persons to pay compliments or possess hearts  and the poet for compliments which are empty  oh happy are they in this world of

my strange narration  i was brought up with osmond  was the partner of his pleasures  the confident of his cares the latter sprang solely from his elder brother whose birthright he coveted whose superiority he envied yet his aversion burst not forth till evelina neville rejecting his hand bestowed hers with her heart on reginald  then did osmonds passion overleap all bounds he resolved to assassinate his brother when returning from the scottish wars carry off the lady and make himself master of her person by force  this scheme he imparted to me he flattered threatened promised and i yielded to his seduction   ang wretched man   kenr condemn me not unheard it is true that i followed osmond to the scene of slaughter but no blood that day imbrued my hand it was the earl whose sword struck reginald to the ground it was the earl whose dagger was raised to complete his crime when evelina threw herself upon her husbands body and received the weapon in her own   ang dreadful dreadful   kenr his hopes disappointed by this accident osmonds wrath became madness he gave the word for slaughter and reginalds few attendants were butchered on the spot scarce could my prayers and arguments save from his wrath his infant niece whose throat was already gored by his poniard angela yours still wears that mark   ang mine  almighty powers   ken lady it is true i concealed in allans cottage the heiress of conway there were you doomed to languish in obscurity till alarmed by the report of his spies that percy loved you and dreading your meeting with so powerful a supporter osmond decreed your death a second time with this intention he sought your retreat but when in you he beheld evelinas living image he changed his bloody purpose he caused me to reclaim you from allan and resolved by making you his wife to give himself a lawful claim to these possessions   ang the monster now then i know when he pressed my hand why still my blood ran cold twas nature that revolted at the fratricides touch twas my mothers spirit that whispered love not my murderer oh good good kenric and you knelt to me for pardon you to whom i owe my life you to whom    ken hold oh hold  lady how little do i deserve your thanks  oh listen listen  i was the last to quit the bloody spot sadly was i retiring when a faint groan struck my ear i sprang from my horse i placed my hand on reginalds heart it beat beneath the pressure   here osmond appears at the door motions to saib etc to retire and advances himself unobserved ang it beat it beat cruel and your dagger    ken oh that would have been mercy no lady i preserved his life to rob him of liberty it struck me how strong would be my hold over osmond while his brother was in my power and this reflection determined me to preserve him having plunged the other bodies in the conways stood i placed the bleeding earls on my horse before me and conveyed him still insensible to a retreat to all except myself a secret there i tended his wounds carefully and succeeded in preserving his life  lady reginald still exists    here osmond with a furious look draws his dagger and motions to stab kenric a moments reflection makes him stay his hand and he returns the weapon into the sheath ang still exists say you my father still exists   ken he does if a life so wretched can be termed existence while his swoon lasted i chained him to his dungeon wall and no sooner were his wounds healed than i entered his prison no more through a wicket in his dungeondoor i supplied him with food and when in plaintive terms he sued to me for mercy hasty i fled nor gave an answer lady near sixteen years have passed since an human voice struck the ear of reginald   ang alas alas   ken but the hour of his release draws near i discovered this night

alice  the door too  it moves it opens  guard me good angels   the foldingdoors unclose and the oratory is seen illuminated in its center stands a tall female figure her white and flowing garments spotted with blood her veil is thrown back and discovers a pale and melancholy countenance her eyes are lifted upwards her arms extended toward heaven and a large wound appears upon her bosom angela sinks upon her knees with her eyes riveted upon the figure which for some moments remains motionless at length the spectre advances slowly to a soft and plaintive strain she stops opposite to reginald

look and follows the vision extending her arms toward it ang stay lovely spirit  oh stay yet one moment   the spectre waves her hand as bidding her farewell instantly the organs swell is heard a full chorus of female voices chaunt jubilate a blaze of light flashes through the oratory and the folding doors close with a loud noise ang oh heaven protect me  she falls motionless on the floor   end of

to fear for myself we are now within bowshot of the castle the archers may think proper to amuse us with a proof of their skill and were i to feel an arrow quivering in my gizzard probably i should be much more surprised than pleased good my lord let us back to the fishermans hut   percy your advice may be wise gilbert but i cannot follow it angelas escape may be discovered  she may be pursued and in need of my assistance then counsel not my retiring my fears of losing angela are too strong the flame which burns in my bosom too ardent   motl i am sure no flame burning in your bosom can give you so much pain as an arrow would give me sticking in mine and as to your fears of losing the lady i would bet mine of losing my life against any fears in christendom   percy how gilbert have you not promised to stand by me to the last did you not say you could die in my service with pleasure   motl very true  but lord if a man was always taken at his word the world would soon be turned upside down when a polite gentleman begs you to consider his house as your own and assures you that all he has is at your disposal he would be in a terrible scrape if you began knocking down his walls or requested the loan of his wife or daughters  no no sir  when i said that i should die in your service with pleasure i intended to live in it many long years since to tell you the truth from a child i had always a particular dislike to dying and i think that with every hour the prejudice grows stronger  good my lord let us be gone ere long i doubt not    percy hark did i not hear  no she comes not

love wraps one up better than a blanket sancho makes nearly the same observation upon sleep  but that not being my situation the present object of my desires is a blazing woodfire and venus would look to me less lovely than a smoking sackposset  oh when i was in love i managed matters much better i always paid my addresses by the fireside and contrived to urge my soft suit just at dinnertime then how i filled my fairones ears with fine speeches while she filled my trencher with roastbeef  then what figures and tropes came out of my mouth and what dainties and tidbits went in  twould have done your heart good to hear me talk and see me eat  and you would have found it no easy matter to decide whether i had most wit or appetite   percy and who was the object of this voracious passion   motl a person well calculated to charm both my heart and my stomach it was a lady of great merit who did your father the honor to superintend his culinary concerns i was scarce fifteen when she kindled a flame in my heart while lighting the kitchen fire and from that moment i thought on nothing but her my mornings were passed in composing poems on her beauty my evenings in reciting them in her ear for nature had equally denied the fair creature and myself the faculty of reading and writing   percy you were successful i hope   motl why at length my lord a pindaric ode upon her grace in frying pancakes melted her heart she consented to be mine  when oh cruel fortune taking one night a drop too much  poor dear creature she never got the better of it  i wept her loss and composed an elegy upon it which has been thought by many persons of great judgment not totally destitute of taste and sublimity it began thus    baked be the pies to coals  burn roastmeat burn boil over ye pots  ye spits forget to turn cindrelias death  percy peace peace  see you nothing near yonder tower   motl yes certainly  two persons advance toward us  yet they cannot be our friends for i see neither the

despair alarms thy phrensied eye screams in thine ear and bids thee heaven deny court thou religion strive thy faith to save bend thy fixed glance on bliss beyond the grave hush guilty murmurs banish dark mistrust think there is a power above nor doubt that power is just finis to the reader many erroneous assertions have been made respecting this drama some that the language was originally extremely licentious others that the sentiments were violently democratic and others again that if mr sheridan had not advised me to content myself with a single spectre i meant to have exhibited a whole regiment of ghosts to disprove these reports i have deviated from the usual mode of publishing plays as performed and have printed mine almost verbatim as originally written whether it merited the above accusations the reader has now had an opportunity of judging for himself i must just mention that the last line of the piece is altered and that in the second scene of the fifth act the friar was made to stick in the doorway whereas he now makes his exit without difficulty  other charges however have been brought against me on better grounds and i must request the readers patience while i say a few words respecting them to originality of character i make no pretense persecuted heroines and consciencestung villains certainly have made their courtesies and bows to a british audience long before the appearance of the castle spectre the friar and alice are copies but very faint ones from juliets nurse and sheridans father paul and percy is a mighty prettybehaved young gentleman with nearly no character at all i shall not so readily give up my claim to novelty when i mention my misanthropic negro he has been compared to zanga but youngs hero differs widely from what i meant in hassan zangas hatred is confined to one object to destroy the happiness of that object is his sole aim and his vengeance is no sooner accomplished than he repents its gratification hassan is a man of violent passions and warm feelings whose bosom is filled with the milk of human kindness but that milk is soured by despair whose nature was susceptible of the tenderest affections but who feels that all the chains of his affections are broken for ever he has lost every thing even hope he has no single object against which he can direct his vengeance and he directs it at large against mankind he hates all the world hates even himself for he feels that in that world there is no one that loves him  lorsque lon peut souffrir sure que ses douleurs daucun mortel ne font jamais color les pleurs on se desinteresse a la fin de soimeme on cesse de saimer si quelquun ne nous aim but though hassans heart is changed by disappointment and misfortune that heart once was feeling and kind nor could he hate with such inveteracy if he had not loved with extreme affection in my opinion this character is not zangas but this i must leave to the public decision i may however boldly and without vanity assert that motley is quite new to the stage in other plays the fool has always been a sharp knave quick in repartee and full of whim fancy and entertainment whereas my fool but i own i did not mean to make him so is a dull flat good sort of plain matter of fact fellow as in the course of the performance mr bannister discovered to his great sorrow  that osmond is attended by negroes is an anachronism i allow but from the great applause which mr dowton constantly received in hassan a character which he played extremely well i am inclined to think that the audience was not greatly offended at the impropriety for my own part i by no means repent the introduction of my africans i thought it would give a pleasing variety to the characters and dresses if i made my servants black and could i have produced the same effect by making my heroine blue blue i should have made her  in the friars defense when he most ungallantly leaves angela in the cavern to shift for herself i can only plead the necessity of the case stay where he was he could not go he must at any rate i trundled him off in the best way that i could and for the sake of the public i heartily wish that way had been better with regard to his not meeting osmond in his flight a little imagination will soon conquer that difficulty it may be supposed that as he lost his way in coming he lost it again in going or that he concealed himself till the earl had passed him or that he tumbled down and broke his neck or that hedid any thing else you like better i leave this matter entirely to the readers fancy  against my spectre many objections have been urged one of them i think rather curious she ought not to appear because the belief in ghosts no longer exists in my opinion this is the very reason why she may be produced without danger for there is now no fear of increasing the influence of superstition or strengthening the prejudices of the weakminded i confess i cannot see any reason why apparitions may not be as well permitted to stalk in a tragedy as fairies be suffered to fly in a pantomime or heathen gods and goddesses to cut capers in a grand ballet and i should rather imagine that oberon and bacchus now find as little credit to the full as the cocklane ghost or the spectre of mrs veal  never was any poor soul so illused as evelinas previous to her presenting herself before the audience the friends to whom i read my drama the managers to whom i presented it the actors who were to perform in it  all combined to persecute my spectre and requested me to confine my ghost to the greenroom aware that without her my catastrophe would closely resemble that of the grecian daughter i persisted in retaining her the event justified my obstinacy the spectre was as well treated before the curtain as she had been illused behind it and as she continues to make her appearance nightly with increased applause i think myself under great obligations both to her and her representative  but though i am conscious that it is very imperfect i shall not so far offend my own feelings or insult the judgment of the public which has given it a very favorable reception as to say that i think my play very bad had such been my opinion instead of producing it on the stage or committing it to the press i should have put it behind the fire or throwing it into the thames made a present of it to the british scombri still its success on the stage great enough to content even an author does not prevent my being very doubtful as to its reception in the closet when divested of its beautiful music splendid scenery and above all of the acting excellent throughout without detracting from the merits of the other performers to all of whom i think myself much indebted for their respective exertions i must here be permitted to return particular thanks to mrs jordan whose manner of sustaining her character exceeded my most sanguine hopes and in whose hands my heroine acquired
