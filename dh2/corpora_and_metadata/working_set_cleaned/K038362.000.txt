an inquiry into the original production of insects in human bodies especially of the seminal animalcula  and whether these pass the testicular strainers and are reposited in the seminal bladders in infants or not till near puberty  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane       price   d  an inquiry into the original production of insects in human bodies not only have the manner of secretion and use of the genital liquor been the occasion of disputation but also its matter and composition have been the subject of much inquiry and the methods they have used for satisfaction were  st hypothetic arguments  ly experimental examination of the first sort viz inquirers or rather guessers are   such as derive the sperm from the brain only   from brain heart and liver   from an uncertain juice conveyed from the brain along the spinal marrow to the spermaticks   such as ascribe a spermatick force to the kidneys   such as will have it to be a mixture and temperature taken from all the facultys of the soul   such as plead that it falls from the parts of the body into the lesser veins and out of them ascends into the greater and swims like a cloud upon the humors and is at last attracted by the force of the testicles   some derive it from all the parts of the body others from the mass of blood only   some wholly reject the last and fetch it from a sweeter juice or some milky chylous matter   others say it is the excrement or residuum of the most elaborated and finely digested juices falling like a dew from all the parts of the body and meeting at the spermaticks  0 some will have it to be only a simple uncompounded nervous juice destitute of all other mixtures  these were the chief opinions of the hypothetical gentlemen and each of them had their patrons and strenuous defenders who racked their wits to invent arguments to maintain their darling notion and many of their arguments are fitter to move laughter or raise the choler of the sober than to satisfy his curiosity or inform his judgment wherefore some who were dissatisfied with this supposititious or guessive way of arguing i go with them next to experimental examination the first whereof has caused the animal seed to undergo the fiery trial of the chemists furnace to make it discover its principles but found it consist only of the same with all the parts of animal bodies viz an insipid water a fetid oil some volatile salt a residuum of much light earth in the retort but in rectification it afforded no spirit see act erudit lips supplem tom   sect  0 p     and borellus obs med phys

pervenerunt nonnulli chymistae ut pro conficiendo suo lapide philosophico materiam in spermate humano quaerunt but still some mens curiosity not being satisfied with all these guesses and experiments they next try what they can discover in it by ocular examination and demonstration whereby they are convinced that the sperm is only a crowd of animalcula or small worms with long tails like tadpoles swimming in a viscid serum and they are so found of this notable discovery that leewenhoeck and hartsecker are like to go by the ears about it each challenging this for his own observation and invention but let them differ as they please we know it belongs to neither of them for d ham first of all observed these animalcula in the semen of a cock and long before any of them ludovicus bonaciolus advises us when we are solicitous to know whether a woman be conceived with child to take her urine and put it into a glass vessel shut it up and set it three days in the shade then filter it through a linen cloth and if you find therein little worms like lice then he says she is certainly conceived now one would think that these were leewenhoecks animalcula or little perfect men come down from the vterus to keep centry in the neck of the bladder till they be washed off by the urine and changed into small lice a strange metamorphosis indeed men become lice but to ascend higher plutarch in his symposiacon lib   quest   discovered and described a spermatick worm saying hospitem nostrum novimus athenis ephebum cum multo semine ejecisse bestiolam asperam multis pedibus celeriter ambulantem but neither is this doctrine of seminal animalcula without its opponents for iddo wolfius philip verheyen christianus vater johannes langius andreas ottomar gaelickius and several others flatly deny the existence of any such infects in the genital liquor and say that what is supposed to be these animalcula is only flatuss of air intermixed with the sperm which seeking to unbend themselves or make their escape cause that motion in the seed  at nostrum non est tantas componere lites but we shall allow the masculine semen like most other fluids to abound with these little infects and shall attempt to give a rational account how they come into it and are bred in it and why they are more conspicuous here than in most other fluids of the body  it is the opinion of some that whilst we are young and our stomachs weak the ova of insects taken in with our food and air may escape the attenuation digestion communication and attrition of the stomach and intestines and lie there and generate worms which may again deposite their ova in the guts some whereof may be so small as to enter the lacteal vessels together with the chyle and mix and circulate with the blood and be strained off by the spermatick vessels sooner than any other substance because of their smoothness and politeness and if they be so small as to enter the small pipes they may be readily conveyed along all the gyres turnings and windings of the testes and epididymides till they arrive at the different vessels and thence get into the several bladders whither there are daily arriving other new ones till the age of puberty or time of seminal discharge and that thus the seminal bladders from a supposed continual addition of new ova may be stretched forth and extended just as the intestines of the foetus are full of meconium before the birth and the bladder full of urine now when these ova are got into the vesiculae seminales where they are at rest and lie till the boy is of age and there generate and become little insects and so cover the surface of the seedbladders they shall never be free of that spawn till we are capable of generation but when we are grown to strength our stomachs and intestines are so strong that they attenuate digest and grind down not only the insects which we swallow but the ova also  to all which may be answered that it is improbable and impossible that these impregnated ova should lie in the seminal bladders from infancy to puberty without coming to life and if they should become live infects and breed without any evacuation of them for so many years what irreparable mischief must they first make upon their containing seminal bladders and then upon the circumjacent parts intestines bladders peritoneum etc and none can deny this who have read sennertus schenckius spigelius and others who have seen and written on the tragedys acted by worms how they have corroded the stomachs and intestines of children and even eaten their way through the belly and navel yea that they consumed all that fleshy part on the groins and came to the surface of the body now if vermin make such dispatch in a short time upon thick and strong intestines and muscles i do not see how the delicate seminal bladders can for    or    years imprison such innumerable numbers of animalcula generated and bred from such a heap of ova as from infancy to puberty are daily added to them from the testes and different vessels besides the prodigious myriads which are still generated from the diurnal generation of the formerly reposited ova and insects for what may be done by a few worms or maggots in a short time may certainly be expected from a vast congeries of little animals in so many years especially seeing there is both a daily generation there and a continual new addition from the testes how quickly is cheese consumed by mites leaves of trees by imperceptible insects hair of animals by the tinea or small mite and solid wood it self into dust by minute insects  but suppose it should be answered that the ova arriving at the seminal bladders are so very small and the number so inconsiderable that we need be under no apprehension of danger from them yet this affords no satisfaction when we consider  first that from infancy there is supposed to be a continual addition of new ova stretching forth and extending the cavitys of the seminal bladders till the boy be of age  secondly when we reflect on the sudden generation of insects every where for a chrysalis in which a worm had been wrapped up will be full to day and to morrow quite empty and the butterfly got out of it flying abroad in its full stature and magnitude since this generation is so sudden and their spawn so numerous this destroys their argument who say that these ova may be laid up in the different vessels and seminal bladders till the boy comes to the age of puberty the difficultys such gentlemen leave us in the dark about are as great as any they can remove for  first let us suppose that these ova may lie in a quies in the seminal bladders till the age of puberty then what prevents the generation of these reposited ova and impregnation of the animalcula in the vesiculae seminales until the boy be puber or what is there to impregnate and render them fruitless after that time which there was not before what hinders the corruption and putrefaction of these small ova lying so many years in a warm moist place which is fit either for generation or corruption but  secondly if they did generate as it is most probable they would if they were there how could these strait bladders be capable to contain such a vast crowd as a diurnal generation in that place and a daily new supply from the testicles must amount to it is surprising that any should pretend that these ova should be strained off only by the ductus spermatici when we are assured from experience that they are strained off and generated in all parts of the body both internally and externally and according to these gentlemens hypothesis when the ova are got into the seedbladders seeing they are for several years shut up in these cells we might expect them to produce maggots were they capable of such growth and bulk and as a consequence of this the first ejected semen would be chiefly a heap of worms or insects instead of small and imperceptible by the naked eye animalcula and according to this opinion more sperm should be ejected the first year after puberty than in several years after and that sperm should be better elaborated and fuller of animalcula and supposing these animalcula so many embrios of human foetuss should be more productive of strong healthy and lively children all which is contradicted by daily experience  lastly seeing these infects are so short lived then if they generated in the vesiculae seminales so many years the greatest number must be dead putrified and rotten in that time and one would think it very improbable for the rest to live in such a kennel of filthiness especially to feed upon the putrified carrion of their own species which certainly must make up a considerable part of their repast  secondly i shall give the reasons which seem to me more probable why children have not animalcula reposited from ova in their seminal bladders supposing these ova to come from without and swallowed down together with our air and food although we had an opportunity to examine with a microscope that thin useless insipid mucilage contained in the testicles epididymides different vessels and seminal bladders because  first during infancy the straining vessels or glands of the testicles are too narrow and small for the ova to pass which is further proved from such observations as show that the ova being mixed with the blood when that comes to pass the capillary vessels the diameter of the egg being larger than the cavity of the vessel it must stop there and be wedged in by the force of the fluids behind is hatched by the bodys heat and produces a worm or worms if other ova arrive at it and stop also and this case we know has often happened in most parts of the body thus worms have been bred and found in the liver kidneys bladder blood vessels brain eyes teeth ears nostrils feet navel heart lungs spleen etc sometimes where ulcers or abcesses have seated themselves in any external parts of the body there have been found worms in them of these herod sylla and aleman were eaten up and are called by coelius aurelianus pediculi ferales i shall not here treat of the sundry kinds of infects found in the intestines andre and le clerc have written well on this subject but especially the learned valisnerius who has carefully dissected several of them and has obliged the world with a curious anatomy of them and tho worms have bred in most other parts of the body yet we have scarce any instances where they have been observed to generate in or be discharged from the substance of childrens testes wherefore i am ready to think that these secretory ducts which strain off the semen from the blood are very narrow and therefore the eggs cannot enter nor pass them but are together with the blood returned back to the spermatick veins this opinion appears more satisfactory because the sperm seems to consist of more elaborated particles than the matter of other evacuations for its more ponderous subsidy in water is of a thicker consistence and condenses still more in spirit of wine but if it be laid on a dry place exposed to the air it presently becomes fluid transparent and loses its viscidity the production of worms in the miliary glands on the surface of the body is no good argument against this for  first when the ova get out of their road into the labyrinths of the miliary glands they cause an obstruction and tumor they breed there break the small vessels and get through the skin  secondly worms are sometimes produced on the surface of the body where the skin is excoriated from the ova floating in the air falling upon the grieved place and taking up their abode there and generating others  thirdly it is not improbable that the ova of these animalcula of the masculine semen are greater than the ova of some larger insects and then it is no wonder that they neither pass the miliary glands nor the spermatick labyrinths of children  that some particular glands have such narrow secretory ducts as will not allow the ova to pass readily is manifest  first from the ropy matter discharged from the penis upon intense amorous thoughts or lascivious conversation which tho more tenacious then the semen and strained off by the glands of the vrethra yet we do not hear of any animalcula taken notice of in it  secondly leewenhoeck owns that mens semen has no animalcula and this he assigns for a reason of sterility but hereof he gives us but one instance and for any thing we know the fault even of this might be from some indisposition in the ova foeminaea tubae fallopianae vterus or some of the circumjacent parts or the male sperm might want that vivacity subtility or forcible projection but however these were yet we may safely impute his want of animalcula to the narrowness of the meanders of the testes  thirdly the flaccidity and emptiness of the different vessels and seminal bladders before puberty and the minute portion of semen discharged by boys for some months after the first seminal evacuations yea such is the penury of it that we have historys of some wicked boys who desiring to anticipate nature and gratify their too early libidinous desires have ejected blood instead of sperm  fourthly not only the small quantity but the tenuity and aqueousness of their genital liquor shows the narrowness of their spermatick strainers  fifthly in old age when the tubes contract the canals are straightened and few or no ova pass there is but little semen separated from the blood and what is strained off is mostly useless either for generation or stimulation to venery  lastly the spittle has likewise passed the microscopial examination but leewenhoeck could observe no animalcula in it and we are sure that that secretion has a much shorter way to pass after its separation from the blood till it come into the mouth so that if the narrowness of the glands hindered not the passage of the ova from the blood we should rather expect them here than in the semen  hitherto i have spoken of the visibility of the animalcula in all male semen but now let us try how we can account for such vast multitudes of insects in this liquor  the first reason then why i suppose we meet with greater numbers in this liquor than in several other secretions of the body is the slow circulation of the blood in the spermatick vessels whereby the seminal particles have time to approach and attract one another for the course of the blood in the spermatick arterys betwixt the great artery and the testes dr keil has demonstrated to be   0 times slower than the motion of the same blood would be in the great artery or even in the iliacks and if its motion decrease so quickly in the first division from the aorta how much more languid then must its motion be in the many divisions subdivisions turnings and circumvolutions of the testicular glands no inward secretion or circulation is so slow in the whole body it being little more than what seems necessary to prevent the bloods stagnation  secondly the long retention of the semen in the different vessels and seminal bladders which is more obstinate than any one or all of the abdominal secretions to this i add  thirdly the speedy and surprising generation of insects the breeding quick growth numerous progeny and short life of the butterfly and silkworm fleshfly and flymaggots may be seen at large in leewenhoecks observations now if these are bred and come to maturity in so very few hours how much sooner the ova of the animalcula which are much less and may therefore be supposed of much shorter continuance i might also instance in the surprising speedy and prodigious progeny of the small worms called astarides great numbers whereof i have known bred afresh every night and evacuated next morning at stool let us then suppose the generation of the seminal animalcula to be as speedy if the ova should pass the glands and get into the seminal bladders during childhood what vesiculae seminales would be capable to contain the great fry of small worms bred in the space of    or    years  fourthly the sperm is seemingly the most homogene secretion of the whole body and the most agreeable for the generation of these animalcula being it self not only a prolifick but a smooth balsamic fluid seemingly endud with all propertys which can conduce to render a liquor either fertile or nutritious if we consider these things we shall see reason to be of that ingenious gentlemans opinion mentioned by dr blair who thinks that these animalcula are the same with those we see in water but under different shapes  but let us next enquire for the causes why these small insects are either not so numerous or perceptible in the blood bile urine or pancreatick juice and  first none of these seem of so agreeable a nature have neither so much rest nor afford so proper nutrition  secondly because as dr blair says the blood being a compositum of all the various particles of the whole fluids in the body it appears under a more solid form in globules where the several particles are compactly and firmly united so that the ova or animalcula are not so perceptible unless the particles were separated into their different parts and even this heterogene mixture called blood has sometimes had worms in it  thirdly these animalcula seem to meet with the cruellest treatment in the bile for although several physicians and naturalists have observed abundance of live worms in the liver yet rarely have they been found alive in the bile or gallbladder for this is the most purgent sharp and bitter of all the secretions and is chiefly made up of very sharp particles like small wedges whereby when by the peristaltick motion of the guts it is mixed with the food and fluids it breaks their acrid saline particles as well as divides the coagulated or mixes the watery and oily the pungent bilious particles are darted into either the bodies or ova of insects that are larger than the bilious particles in the intestines and kills them if alive or prevents their generation if they be only in ova but the ova or animalcula swallowed with our meat or drink being both so numerous and small get out of the duodenum unhurt but if the bile be pure and unmixed very few species of insects can live in it  another reason why many ova and insects may get out of the intestines untouched by the bile is either its scarcity in the body from the secretory ducts of the liver being stuffed with a gritty matter causing a jaundice or its meeting with obtundent and tenacious meat drink or medicine often poured down into the stomach and lastly the animalcula are not so conspicuous in the bile because it is of a darker body than the semen  fourthly the pancreatick juice is constantly flowing into the duodenum as it is separated from the blood and so the ova have but a short residence there to generate insects and suppose they were in it its immediate mixture with the bile would render it very disagreeable to live insects this mixture of the two juices prevents our discovery of animalcula or perhaps the texture of the procreatick glands may not be so convenient for their conveyance  fifthly the urine being often full of pungent salts they would be darted into the delicate bodies of these little creatures therefore are we not to expect them so frequently and plentifully in that liquor it not being of so amicable a nature for such guests and also several times have there been worms voided with the urine yet do i not find that either leewenhoeck or his votarys have met with what they call seminal animalcula in it for which reason it would appear that the urine is no beloved habitation of theirs  sixthly the serum of the blood is not altogether so fit a vehicle for they having some small solidity must be deposited in the sediment together with the blood globules and so become invisible  seventhly neither could leewenhoeck find them in the saliva for the glands which strain it off from the blood seem to have too narrow ducts to suffer the passage of either infects or their eggs the disagreeableness of both bile and urine to these little animals is further evident from this that although the strainers of both liver and kidneys seem larger and laxer than the testicular strainers and might therefore be supposed to admit of these insects yet are they rarely perceived alive in these liquors  i shall now try to account for be several ways how these insects are generated in the semen and come to be reposited in the vesiculae seminales when boys come to puberty and this will serve to illustrate not only the generation of these but of all other insects which are to be met with in human bodies these ways i suppose to be chiefly three viz  st from our creation  ly from our propagation  ly from our sustentation  it is from the first two of these that we can account for worms in the bodies of embrios foetuss and abortives but the generation of insects from our creation i presume to be this that although god at mans first creation did not directly and purposely sow the seeds of such an ineradicable vermin in human bodies yet mans body being made of earth whether clay dust or ashes it is not material to our design toward the evening of the sixth day when he had ended all his other works the earth not only then abounded with insects and ova but having been at first created and furnished with the seeds of all these there must fall some of the minuter of them to the share of that part of matter which went to the compositum of the human machine and these might not only be a seed for the generation and propagation of these insects in the first mans body but serve for the seeds of a lasting progeny in all his posterity who shall descend from him it is surprising to see how little trouble the ancients gave themselves in inquiring into the cause of vermin in animal bodies they were satisfied that they had solved the doubt at once by saying that insects were formed from themselves out of a certain putrid matter by heat and motion but they never regarded the destruction of their hypothesis when they might observe that the generation of insects and all other creatures was always alike the same for if slimy and putrid matter could give form and life to any creature it were ridiculous to expect that the species should still be of the sort and always keep one form and shape according to their notion where there is plenty of slime and an agreeable warmth men might with horror and danger look on and see strange and prodigious monsters daily arise out of this heap of putrefaction ready to devour the beholders and the food designed for their provision mercurialis either persuaded of the folly of this supposition or affecting to be singular fled to occult qualities and celestial powers which by the mediation of proximate causes formed animals but he could not dispute whether this was the facultas fortuita galeni or the powerful factor calcodea avicennae or platos anima mundi in the last age the indefatigable redi has demonstrated that the generation of animals and insects is still alike and then all philosophers with unanimous consent banished the notion of equivocal generation and assigned insects the same parents viz ova of late appeared the learned valisnerius who strenuously contends that worms in the human body are coeval with adam and says that the eggs of all insects that generate in men were purposely created by god in the body of the first man even when created in a state of purity and innocence one great difficulty which put him on coining this new scheme was to account from whence these eggs came and how they can be detained in human bodies for he thinks it equally dangerous to true philosophy whether we believe that animals are bred out of corruption or suppose a certain kind of animals produced from the eggs of others of a different kind and so confound their species thus says he we give to some insects feigned fathers and to others bastard children what he chiefly builds his argument upon is that we can find no species of insects without us to which we may fitly compare these insects bred within us and then to establish his opinion beyond all controversy he says that the insects without us as they are of different kinds so they have their sundry habitations such as live in one kind of earth will die in another and on shrubs and trees these who live on its roots would pine on its leaves and those who feed well on the bark would starve on the wood fruit leaves etc tho it be not my design to examine all this learned mans arguments yet give me leave briefly to observe en passant that as we meet with variety of infects without us so are there different kinds of worms within us  secondly we know that either vegetables or animals removed from their natural soil to a very different climate and nourishment will in a few of their generations be so much changed from their natural appearances that they will hardly be taken for the same this is so commonly allowed that it needs no proof  thirdly the many historys and observations of the spawn of frogs beetles and other insects having been unwarily swallowed down with meat or drink and generated in the body leaves no room to doubt but that the ova of insects swallowed down will breed in us and produce a vermin which will live in us tho deprived of the open air and the common food of its species such as that we meet with in the philosophical transactions of a mans girl at sheffield aged only three months who after swallowing greedily a pint of wormwood ale she vomited up three hexapodes all very active and nimble these dr lister says would have changed to beetles and also the mans son who after a long and grievous pain of the stomach vomited up several strange worms in the ninth year of his age these worms says dr lister were caterpillars with    legs for he had many times seen of the same kind on plants and no doubt says he these would in due time if the place had not hindered have shrunk into chrysaliss and changed into moths  fourthly there may be some unheeded circumstances in the generation and production of several insects that will not only come up to but exceed the dissimilitude of these insects bred in in our bodies to these of the same kind without us i shall instance in some that we know e gr who would believe that that fine flying insect the lybella should be generated like a tadpole under water wrapped up in a membrane till she be near ready to leave that element and appear in a more glorious dress in the open air who would expect that great caterpillars should sometimes produce two or three or a whole swarm of ichneumones an insect with four wings antennae like a be etc dr lister apr        diffected some black beetles which were cast up in his garden and found live hair worms in their bellys which crept out and crawled when the beetles belly was cut up they were some inches long and about the thickness of a hogs bristle these are what have been taken by the vulgar for horsehairs turning into eels or animated bodies in water strange it is also that the wild bees which breed in old willows if these bees maggots or nymphae happen to miscarry they breed  st little hexapodes which produce beetles  ly maggots which produce flys  ly mites etc and what more wonderful metamorphosis can we imagine than that of a caterpillar into a butterfly and of a butterfly into a caterpillar again we have also sufficient experience that several insects live casually and promiscuously on herbs leaves flowers and fruits  fifthly insects from ova taken into our bodies may generate and live there having during their generation been nourished with the juices of our bodies and afterward fed with the same and indeed it is more reasonable to think that the insects of our bodies are bred from ova than from vermin swallowed down alive for i have known some consumptive persons swallow many small frogs alive without any generation thereof or inconvenience therefrom but a young fellow in the neighborhood where i lived had not so good fate for he in the latter end of february carelessly drank some water wherein was frogspawn and had therefrom generated in his body a fine fry of young frogs whereby he was emaciated and reduced to a living ghost and when neither the greatest bitters nor strong purges could be of any service to him there were given him strong vomits of white hellebore which raised such violent spasms and convulsions in the muscular fibers of his stomach and intestines that the nauseous destructive vermin were forced to quit their hold and be thrown up so there is no doubt but several insects which are swallowed alive by us will live and breed and for this reason it is that wise nature has taught herons and some other fowls which live much on worms and insects to draw them often through their bills and pinch them till they are dead before they swallow them another great difficulty with valisnerius is that there have been many kinds of insects found in human bodies none of whose species were ever seen abroad in the world but to this may be replied   that the different soil may very much alter the creature from those of the same kind without us   some creatures have very different appearances according to the sundry stages of their growth thus bees are first white maggots then bees frogs are first tadpoles and swim like small fish in the water ichneumones are first a kind of tadpole then a glorious flying insect etc i confess that sometimes such observers may be willing to flatter themselves and think they have seen monsters and so impose upon our faith when perhaps their great wonder may be only a little coagulated blood unnatural excresence or polypus appearing or cunningly represented by the dextrous operator in such a shape for there is no such thing as a new creation of animals or insects of such an unknown species such things are proper only to amuse idiots halfwits and children who can be prevailed upon to believe a spontaneous generation in opposition to god reason and observation these are the chief of valisneriuss difficultys which drive him back to mans first creation for the origni of insects in human bodies but we see there is no such difficulty in them as to challenge our compliance with him  secondly another way how insects are generated in human bodies is from the seed it self for consider we that the semen whereby man is propagated is said to abound with live insects and can we imagine that creatures of such vigorous agile and minute bodies cannot penetrate and make their way through the interstices of the dilated membranes of the ovum foeminaeum get into the rudiments of the embrio be shut up in its vessels and be mixed with its fluids circulate with the blood and juices live lay their eggs and breed in the body of the foetus the animalcula make up the subtilest part of the masculine semen and it would be ridiculous to assert that the sluggish viscid part made its way into the ovum but the more subtle and active part did not therefore the repletion of the seed with these is sufficient foundation for future generation and a lasting progeny of the kind in every man and woman during life now to assert the destruction of them in the womb were absurd seeing the embrio is nourished with the finest juices of the mothers body which must make as agreeable a repast for them as they can meet with afterward in the bodies of adults  thirdly the last way how i suppose the insects in animal bodies do come is from our sustentation or food and this i divide again into three viz that wherewith we are nourished in the womb   that wherewith we are fed in our infancy to wit the mothers milk and   that which preserves human life ever after  as to the first of these let us remember that the embrio in the vterus is not only surrounded with but fed by the mothers juices especially those in the amnios in which are discovered multitudes of animalcula of several sorts and these together with the fluid wherein they live and sport getting into the body and vessels of the foetus will leave the seeds of a vermin which shall never be extirpated and from this may insects of sundry kinds be found in the bodies of abortives now that the child receives some of its nourishment from the liquor contained in the amnios the learned and curious heister professor of anatomy at altorf has fully proved but suppose the child had no part of its nourishment from these juices yet is there not a constant circulation of fluids from mother to child and back from the child to the mother again and are there not multitudes of insects and ova in the human blood tho its globular parts render them invisible to us but  secondly suppose the child should come into the world free from all manner of insects or ova which yet is neither probable nor possible after its birth is not much of its food milk and are we not satisfied that the mothers milk abounds with animalcula and is not here sufficient cause for the generation of all these myriads in the human body whilst as yet an infant how are we to expect that the infants body should be capable to destroy all that vermin since they escaped the strong attrition of the mothers stomach lungs and muscles all which are stronger in the mother than it is reasonable to expect in the infant  the last cause i assigned for the ingestion and generation of insects and ova into our bodies was by those means which are the preservation and support of human life during the remaining course of our time and these are our meat drink and air i say from the mixture of the ova of insects with these for although it be supposed that when we are adult our stomachs are able to attenuate and digest not only the ingested aliments but also many of these ova which must undergo the common fate of attrition and comminution of their particles but in youth especially in childhood the stomach is weak and the ova escape and generate insects in our bodies to this cause may be added childrens irregular way of eating often cramming down new food before the former was fully digested and got out of the stomach whereby their chyle must be coarse and unprepared a viscidity will subside and line the inside of the guts and become a fit nest for the ova to take up their residence in and become a filter to the chyle whereby the ova of larger insects are detained hatched come to life generate and become the parents of an innumerable progeny childrens incapacity for exercise contributes its share to this for their solids are weak and lax and then their food is not only such as abounds with ova but as the parents of these ova have found it a proper receptacle for them so their offspring must find it exceedingly agreeable viz milk and the farinaceous foods i could assign other causes but these are sufficient however i deny that when we are adult our stomachs are so very capable of attenuating breaking and digesting the particles of the ova for that is more properly the use of the lungs and the effect of muscular motion to divide and grind down such moleculae or small bodies but when all these have exerted their utmost force still great numbers of both ova and animalcula escape all their shocks as is evident  st from the generation of worms and insects in all parts of adult bodies  ly the production of such myriads of insects in dead bodies in few days as quickly eat it up especially if the season be very warm now that all these are ova swimming in the air and falling upon and breeding in dead carcases i deny for although these insects may seize upon it externally yet far greater numbers are produced from ova and insects within the carrion it self this i am satisfied of from these observations  st i have found incredible numbers of these little animals generated and living in the fleshy parts of dead bodies where both skin and scarf skin have been sound and entire this i have seen especially in dead fish upon the shore in summertime  ly take a dead body in a hot summer season and cover it up from the air and you shall find that this will not wholly prevent the growth of insects only it will be longer before they breed and arrive at their perfection and no doubt fewer in number from the deprivation of adventitious ova and animalcula from the air  ly the consumption of human bodies in the grave is a plain proof of this for let the coffin be contrived never so close or the grave deep yet great numbers of vermin generate in the body here the deep interment prevents the accession or addition of ova from the air and the closeness of the coffin hinders their getting in from the earth for i found in a skull newly dug up out of a deep grave which had not been many years shut up a great multitude of small worms of different kinds tho the coffin was close and sound till broken by the sexton i had lately under my care a woman who voided every day by stool a multitude of ascarides she was then past  0 years of age and had been accustomed to this evacuation every morning for several years past i was acquainted with a gentleman who discharged every morning at stool many large knots of them clean before the excrements and yet both enjoyed a good state of health had a good appetite and digestion the first i recovered by prescribing a tedious course of bitters with daily exercise and the last by the chalybeat waters i hope it cannot be denied that dogs have as strong a digestion as most animals and yet they are never free from these insects this i think is sufficient to invalidate the strength of their arguments who affirm that the force of adult stomachs hinders the generation of worms by breaking and grinding down their eggs  but now it remains in the last place that i show how i suppose these animalcula to come at the seminal bladders of youth when come to puberty and that is supposing them to come from without the number of vessels in infants or embrios is much greater than in adults as children advance in years tho the greater vessels lengthen out and grow yet the least become more compact their diameters shorten the quantity of fluids admitted is still less till at last they refuse all access to the fluids then close up grow together and are changed into minute fibers which requiring less space give more liberty to the larger vessels to expand themselves their compression being lessened their canals are enlarged they allow more and larger particles of fluids to enter their orifices and move along their tubes the membranes of the vessels being yet dilatable and the contained liquor pressing vndiquaque the diameters of the vessels are lengthened and their orifices and cavitys are proportionably widened and are capable to admit particles of larger diameters than they could formerly receive amongst which not only ova but minute insects get along and this appears to be truly the case of the testicular strainers for during infancy the natural narrowness of these pipes and that increased by innumerable small open vessels which afterward vanish into solid fibers render the tubes so exceedingly small that only so much insipid humor and nourishment is suffered to enter as suffices to keep open their cavity and nourish their parts but when both their cavity naturally increased and the small vessels which wedge them in on every side have lost their cavity then not only a greater quantity of liquor will pass them but fluids consisting of larger particles and ova together with them  ly we shall add hereto the different sorts of animalcula found in water dr hook says that from his microscopial observations eight millions two hundred and eighty thousand of living creatures may be seen in one drop of water and as these had been too few when he had procured finer glasses they not only magnified these he had formerly discovered to a very great magnitude but observed others much less than what he had formerly seen and some of them so minute that millions of millions of them might be contained in one drop of water now if we consider the state of the testicles of youth arrived at puberty i see no difficulty why we may not allow the ova of these little animals to pass and even the generated animalcula themselves may make way and be driven through all the turnings and windings of the testicles till they come at the deferent vessels and seminal bladders how improbable is it to expect that the stomach should exert any considerable force upon the ova of such insects  ly another presumption that the cavity of the testicular glands is the occasion of the admission of these guests is because the mammillary glands of the breasts which separate the milk from the blood give ready passage to prodigious numbers of these insects or their ova which may readily be discovered by the help but of ordinary glasses thus i have explained the manner of the generation of insects in human bodies it now remains that i should treat of the use of these seminal worms and enquire whether they are reasonably to be reputed the rudiments of a human foetus or whether each of them be an entire and perfect man as leewenhoeck and his followers teach and believe but this would protract the present discourse far beyond its designed bounds wherefore i shall defer this inquiry to another opportunity  errata page   l     r
